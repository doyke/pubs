SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Provides guidance for updating supplements when the AFI is changed or revised (paragraph 1),
clarifies waiver authority (paragraph 1.2), updates responsibilities (paragraph 1.3) and revises
office symbols and terminology as necessary, revises requalification training guidance
(paragraph 2.2), updates conversion and difference training guidance (paragraphs 2.3 and 2.4)
and adds transition training guidance (paragraph 2.5), establishes documentation procedures for
individuals who fail to meet continuation training requirements (paragraph 3.6.1), adds
requirements for X-prefix fliers (paragraph 3.12), revises ancillary training guidance (paragraph
6), prescribes AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training (paragraph 9.1), and
updates HCM/SCM Report guidance (Attachment 3).

(AFSOC) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
revision consolidated guidance on responsibilities (1.3.) and aircrew training records (Chapter
10), included in most AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1s, into a single location to standardize training across
AFSOC. It provides guidance for logging flying events accomplished during qualification
training on the qualification flight examination (2.1.5.). Additionally, this revision includes
guidance for secondary method training (2.9.), initial cadre (2.10.), universal qualifications
(2.11.), and upgrade nominations (4.1.). It expands AFI 11202, Vol 1, guidance on proration of
training (3.5.), flight surgeon requirements (3.11.), and X-prefixed flyers (Table 2).

(AFSOC) This interim change revises AFI 11-202V1_AFSOCSUP by (1) correcting format
issues with regulation references, (2) updates the instruction on how to notify AFSOC/A3T when
secondary method training is completed. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material..

2. Qualification Training. This section specifies minimum training requirements for initial
qualification training, requalification, conversion/difference qualification, multiple qualification,
senior officer qualification, and mission qualification training.
   2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Training needed to qualify for basic aircrew
   duties in an assigned crew position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit’s
   operational mission.
       2.1.1. General Requirements. All personnel maintaining flying status will meet the
       requirements listed in the sub-paragraphs below. Unless specified in applicable AFI 11-2
       MDS Vol 1, the primary method of IQT is to attend and complete the appropriate formal
       training course listed in the ETCA. Completing the appropriate formal course satisfies all
       IQT requirements. When attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units will
       request waivers as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, to conduct in-unit
       IQT, using formal school courseware (see also paragraph 2.1.4). Note: Before performing
       flying duties in USAF fixed-wing aircraft, helicopter-only qualified pilots must meet the
       eligibility criteria for and complete USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) or Fixed-
       Wing Qualification (FWQ) training. Waiver authority is HQ AETC/A3. See also AFI
       11-402.
           2.1.1.1. Aircrew members entered into in-unit IQT leading to qualification or
           requalification will be dedicated to that program; i.e., give training requirements
           priority over non-training related duties. EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may
           continue their normal duties as time permits.
           2.1.1.2. Training time limitations for IQT completion are contained in applicable AFI
           11-2MDS Vol 1. In-unit IQT will begin no later than 45 days (90 days for the Air
           Reserve Components [ARC]) after reporting to a new duty station or unit, unless
           waived by the MAJCOM aircrew training function.
           2.1.1.3. Physical Examinations. Complete flight physical examinations IAW AFI
           48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, and AFI 44-170, Preventive Health
           Assessment. Aircrew members who fail to successfully complete a flight physical
           may not perform inflight duties until they successfully complete the examination. For
           further action to be taken on personnel who fail to complete a required flight physical
           examination when due, see AFI 11-402.
           2.1.1.4. Physiological Training. Complete physiological training IAW AFI 11-403,

               status codes (FSC) J, K and L (except individuals selected for indoctrination
               flying, FSC T), and for personnel performing remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)
               ground control station aircrew duties (FSC V and Z). Requalification is completed
               IAW AFI 11-403.
               2.1.1.4.2. Personnel who perform flying duty in other than their rated specialty
               (for example, airborne command post duty) must maintain currency in
18                                         AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013


            physiological training.
            2.1.1.4.3. Personnel who are delinquent in physiological training will not be
            scheduled for flight duty.
        2.1.1.5. Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Training. Complete
        training IAW AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE)
        Program. For action to be taken on personnel who fail to meet training standards
        while enrolled in a USAF survival school, see AFI 11-402. Note: SERE training is
        not required for cadet aircrew.
     2.1.2. IQT Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member
     must comply with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites prescribed in the
     applicable syllabus. Due to quota allocations, scheduling limitations and fiscal
     constraints, SERE training (Ex. S-V-80/90) for ANG students is desired but not required
     for entry into IQT. Water survival training requirement is prescribed in the MDS-specific
     formal course syllabus. All ANG members will comply with training requirements in
     AFI 16-1301 and receive training prior to their first operational assignment.
     2.1.3. Ground Training Requirements. (For in-unit IQT, commanders will obtain and
     use the current formal school courseware, if available.)
        2.1.3.1. Accomplish academic training requirements as directed in the applicable
        syllabus.
        2.1.3.2. For written examinations, comply with AFI 11-202 Vol 2, Aircrew
        Standardization/Evaluation Program, and the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.

        (N/A for RPA aircrew.)
        2.1.3.4. Aircrew chemical defense ensemble (ACDE) training (to include ACDE
        egress training and emergency parachute training with ACDE) must be completed
        prior to the first ACDE flight.
        2.1.3.5. Accomplish combat survival training (CST), conduct after capture training,
        and water survival training IAW AFI 16-1301. See also AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, AFI
        11-2MDS Vol 1 Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking memorandum, and/or
        MAJCOM Supplements, as applicable.
        2.1.3.6. Applicable ground training (i.e., simulators, aircraft systems, etc.)
        accomplished at the formal school establishes due dates for subsequent continuation
        training. If completion dates are unknown, use the evaluation completion date on the
        formal school generated AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form
        8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
        2.1.3.7. (Added-AFSOC) After completion of formal training, ensure all ground
        training requirements listed in AFI 11-202, Vol 1, paragraphs 2.1.3.3 – 2.1.3.5 are
        entered and tracked in ARMS using the date the member accomplished the training.
        If the training date is unknown, use the evaluation completion date.
AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013                                                            19


     2.1.4. In-Unit IQT Requirements. Approved in-unit training must be accomplished
     IAW applicable formal school courseware and the following guidance:
         2.1.4.1. Flying training lessons should be completed in order; however, if mission
         scheduling or student progress dictates otherwise, the unit commander or designated
         training supervisor may change the order.
         2.1.4.2. Training syllabi will establish a maximum time lapse between training
         missions. Failure to accomplish training as scheduled will require documentation and
         corrective action.
         2.1.4.3. With operations group commander (OG/CC) (or equivalent) approval, IQT
         requirements may be completed during operational missions under the supervision of
         an instructor of like specialty. Comply with restrictions in appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS
         Vol 1, MAJCOM directives, and applicable operation order (OPORD).
     2.1.5. (Added-AFSOC) Flying Training Requirements. After completion of formal
     training, ensure all flight training is entered and tracked in ARMS.
         2.1.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) The Formal Training Unit (FTU) SARM office will
         update training events accomplished on an evaluation or an instructor certification
         flight toward the individual’s continuation training (CT) volume and currency
         requirements in ARMS.
         2.1.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) Flying training events accomplished during formal
         training, but not on the evaluation flight, will use the date of the successful evaluation
         to establish accomplishment dates. The SARM office will ensure “0” is marked on
         the Mission Accomplishment Report (MAR) or Training Accomplishment Report
         (TAR) for any events completed during the course, but not completed the day of the
         evaluation to update ARMS.
  2.2. Requalification Training. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of his or
  her qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items
  specified in applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, IAW paragraph 3.4.3.2), or completion of a
  qualification evaluation in a different MDS (unless multiple qualification has been approved
  prior to the evaluation), whichever occurs first. The duration of unqualified time is from the
  date the aircrew member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For
  aircrew members who are not authorized multiple qualification and who complete a
  qualification evaluation in a different MDS, members must complete requalification training
  as specified below to regain qualification in the original MDS. For all aircrew members
  except flight surgeons, requalification requirements are as follows: (MAJCOMS may provide
  more restrictive guidance and may adjust requirements as necessary to allow for aircrew
  member experience level and similarity of aircraft types. Provide specific guidance in
  command supplements or AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1.) (Terms TX-1, TX-2 and TX-3 identify
  formal courses required, from longest to shortest course.) (As noted below, completing the
  ETCA formal school flying training course is the desired standard. When attendance is not
  practical or quotas are not available, units will request waivers as specified in the applicable
  AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, to conduct in-unit IQT, using formal school courseware.)
     2.2.1. Unqualified up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or up to
     51 months at the end of any active flying assignment. Complete training in all
20                                           AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013


     delinquent items (as applicable), additional training as directed by the squadron
     commander, and a requalification evaluation IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFI 11-2MDS
     Vol 2. An ETCA formal school flying training course (TX-3) satisfies this requalification
     requirement, if specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
     2.2.1. (AFSOC) TX-3 requalification course are not available, therefore, unit
     commanders are authorized to direct in-unit requalification training. See paragraph
     2.9.3.1. for guidance on obtaining courseware the formal school, to complete applicable
     training.
     2.2.2. Unqualified 39 or more months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or 51
     or more months at the end of any active flying assignment, up to 8 Years. Complete
     the appropriate ETCA formal school flying training course (TX-2) and a flight evaluation
     IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     2.2.3. Unqualified in MDS Over 8 Years. Complete the appropriate ETCA formal
     school flying training (TX-1) and a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFI 11-
     2MDS Vol 2.
     2.2.4. Instructor Requalification. IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS Vols 1
     and 2.
  2.3. Conversion Qualification Training.
     2.3.1. Conversion training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
     Conversion training requires completion of a formal school qualification course. For unit
     conversions, when formal school courses are not available, MAJCOMs will develop and
     coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly
     experienced personnel as the initial cadre. See also AFI 11-202 Vol 2 for instructor
     qualification and flight examiner certification guidance.
     2.3.2. Submit requests for conversion qualification training IAW the applicable AFI 11-
     2MDS Vol 1.
  2.4. Difference Training.
     2.4.1. Difference training is required for qualification in a different series aircraft in the
     same MDS. When MAJCOMs determine the differences between series are great enough,
     the training required is a formal TX course.
     2.4.2. Difference qualification training requirements will be established in AFI 11-2
     MDS Vol 1.
     2.4.3. (AFSOC) AFSOC-approved differences training may be conducted in unit
     without a waiver (see AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1).
  2.5. Transition Training. MAJCOMs may prescribe shortened versions of qualification
  training for aircrew members cross-flowing from another military aircraft to allow credit for
  acquired aviation proficiency. Requirements will be established in AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1.
  2.6. Multiple Qualification. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one
  MDS aircraft for crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission
  requirements and is economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below the
AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013                                                           21


  MAJCOM level, except HQ AFMC, which may further delegate, but not lower than wing
  commander.
     2.6.1. Unless required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not permit
     aircrew members qualified in primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in
     support aircraft.
     2.6.2. General officers will only maintain qualification in a single MDS. Difference
     qualification in variants of the same MDS is authorized, but is not permitted when
     qualification involves formal conversion training, IAW AFI MDS Vol 2.
         2.6.2.1. Approval authority for general officer multiple qualification is AF/CC.
     2.6.3. Multiple qualification does not apply to aircrew members selected for
     reassignment to another MDS who attend training prior to PCS. Flying squadron
     commanders will review reassignment training and validate requirement for additional
     qualification prior to aircrew member flights in original aircraft. Additional qualification
     authorization under this exception terminates when the aircrew member signs out from
     the losing organization.
     2.6.4. (Added-AFSOC) Aircrew members in formal training to obtain qualification in a
     second aircraft are not required to be current and qualified, in their primary aircraft, to
     perform training flights, up to and including the qualification check, in their secondary
     aircraft.
     2.6.5. (AFSOC) For Combat Aviation Advisor aircrew, refer to AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 1,
     Additional Aircraft Training, regarding training and qualification on multiple aircraft.
  2.7. Senior Officer Qualification and Performance Requirements. Senior officers
  (colonel selects and above) whose position requires operational flying will complete the
  appropriate formal training course unless already qualified. Aircraft qualification will include
  instrument qualification and an AF Form 8/8a flight evaluation. A senior officer course that
  does not result in an AF Form 8/8a flight evaluation will not permit unsupervised flying. In
  addition, senior officers will comply with paragraph 3.1.4 of this instruction. Note: All senior
  officers must complete a formal training course qualification program that results in an AF
  Form 8/8a flight evaluation prior to flying an aircraft with passengers on board. Exceptions
  to this policy must be approved by HQ USAF/A3/5 (colonels and colonel selects); exceptions
  for general officers must be approved by AF/CC.
     2.7.1. General officers in commander billets approved for operational flying may fly
     without an instructor in their primary assigned aircraft if they are current and qualified
     and maintain Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR), or Basic Mission
     Capable (BMC) status IAW the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
     2.7.2. All other general officers and general officer commanders maintaining Basic
     Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status or less, must fly with an instructor.
     2.7.3. When approved for operational flying, general officers authorized to fly single-
     place aircraft are limited to HQ USAF/CC, commanders, and MAJCOM/A3s. See AFI
     11-401, Aviation Management, for specific general officer flying authorizations. If
     approved by AF/CC for operational flying, numbered Air Force general officer vice
22                                           AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013


     commanders may also fly single-place aircraft. General officers maintaining BAQ in
     single-place aircraft require an instructor pilot in the flight.
     2.7.4. Except for HQ USAF/CC, HQ USAF/CV, MAJCOM commanders (or
     equivalents), and Combatant Command commanders (when filled by a USAF general
     officer), and when those officers are in operational flying status, general officers who are
     in operational flying status and who do not directly oversee Operational Support Airlift
     (OSA) aircraft and/or Very Important Person/Special Airlift Mission (VIP/SAM)
     operations should not fly OSA/VIP/SAM aircraft. MAJCOM commanders may develop
     further OSA/VIP/SAM guidelines as necessary.
     2.7.5. As a minimum, HQ USAF/CC and HQ USAF/CV will maintain BAQ in their
     assigned aircraft when they maintain operational flying status. Minimum and maximum
     sortie rates do not apply.
     2.7.6. Unless further restricted by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, colonels and colonel selects who
     comply with paragraph 2.7 may fly without an instructor in their primary assigned
     aircraft.
     2.7.7. MAJCOMs may establish additional guidelines and flight requirements as
     necessary.
     2.7.8. Test pilots of any rank assigned to AFMC, AFMC civilian employees who have
     previously graduated from a military test pilot school (or equivalent), contract personnel

     Thunderbird selectees (with MAJCOM concurrence), may attend senior officer
     qualification training courses.
     2.7.9. (Added-AFSOC) Senior officers (colonel-selects and above) will successfully
     complete periodic qualification written examinations and flight evaluations in each MDS
     aircraft in which mission qualification is maintained. If maintaining only basic
     qualification in similar aircraft, complete written examinations in each MDS, but only
     one flight evaluation is required. The results of written examinations, ground
     requirements, and flight evaluations will be documented on an AF Form 8, Certificate of
     Aircrew Qualification or AF Form 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple
     Aircraft), and maintained in a flight evaluation folder.
  2.8. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). The purpose of MQT is to qualify aircrew
  members in assigned aircrew positions to perform the command or unit mission. AFI 11-2
  MDS Vol 1 prescribes minimum training requirements to qualify individuals in unit
  missions. All crew members will complete MQT before entering special mission (e.g.,
  Special Operations Low Level (SOLL) II, etc.) certification/qualification, unless the special
  mission training is specifically directed as pre-MQT in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, e.g., LANTIRN
  training.

     continue training; however, their units will notify AFSOC/A3T with a description of the
     difficulty and expected completion date (not to exceed an additional 120 calendar days).
     If SMT is not completed by this date, any further extension requires AFSOC/A3
     approval. Commanders will ensure aircrew personnel engaged in qualification or
     requalification training complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.
     Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should be
     minimized.
     2.9.3. (Added-AFSOC) Formal School courseware requests. For SMT, the waiver
     authority (per AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1) will include the appropriate formal school as an
     addressee on all correspondence and will request that the formal school forward
     applicable courseware to the aircrew member’s unit of assignment. Courseware includes
     but is not limited to; the course syllabus, briefings, Computer Based Training (CBT)
     modules, student and instructor guides, and training guides and grade sheets for the
     student’s training folder. The unit training office will verify the current version is used.

     The squadron commander will also determine the training level (MR/CMR, BMC, BAQ)
     of each assigned crew member, when not prescribed by MAJCOM.
     3.2.2. (AFSOC) Additionally, commanders will determine aircrew qualification
     according to the associated programming plan (P-PLAN) for unit transfers. For
     individual transfers, commanders will accept previous qualifications and currency in the
     same MDS aircraft. If this results in exceeding authorized unit ratios for instructors and
     flight examiners, use normal attrition to achieve authorized ratios (not applicable to
     ANG).
     3.2.3. Aircrew Members. Each aircrew member is responsible for monitoring and
     completing all training requirements.
  3.3. Training Events/Profiles. Aircrew members’ CT and additional (ground) training
  events/profiles are maintained in ARMS. Commanders have the option of monitoring AF-
  wide awareness training (e.g. Resource Protection) for aircrew members in ARMS.

  active flying API, a non-rated aircrew position or a FAC 6/E temporary status will be
  assigned appropriate training profiles for their aircrew status. Training profiles will be
  managed by their unit of attachment SARM office. Fully qualified individuals will be
  assigned training profiles effective the date arrived station. Individuals in qualification
  training will be assigned profiles effective the completion date on the AF Form 8/8a.
     3.3.1. Use the following forms when documenting aircrew training in ARMS (If
     additional forms are needed, see AFI 33-360 for guidance): Note: Reports and updates
     to ARMS generated from AF-approved automated systems (e.g. ARMS, PEX, TIMS)
     may be used as source documentation for CT provided these reports contain the
     minimum required elements. Updates generated from an automated system must be
     validated by a mission review process.
         3.3.1.1. Additional Training. Use AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training
         Accomplishment Report, to document aircrew ground training for processing into
         ARMS. Training events required to be taught by a certified instructor (e.g. CBRNE,
         small arms), as well as grounding events (e.g. ground egress training), must be
         documented on the AF Form 1522 and signed by an instructor.
28                                      AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013


        3.3.1.1.1. AF Form 1522 may also be used to document training accomplished by
        a single individual when no instructor is involved (e.g. computer based training).
        In this case, the form may be emailed directly from the individual's official e-mail
        account to a unit aviation resource manager’s official e-mail account.
        3.3.1.1.2. Training and other non-grounding events accomplished by other
        agencies (e.g. fire extinguisher training) but without documentation must be
        documented on the AF Form 1522.
        3.3.1.1.3. Events that do not require a formal course of instruction (e.g. SOF
        duties) may be documented on a locally developed form for processing into
        ARMS. Locally developed forms must contain the minimum elements found on
        the AF Form 1522, with the exception of instructor certification. Refer to AFI 33-
        360 for additional guidance.
        3.3.1.1.4. Training events accomplished by other agencies and documented on
        another form and/or certificate may be photocopied and annotated in the lower
        right corner with the ARMS training event ID, date of input, signature of
        instructor conducting the training (for instructor led events – i.e. CATMS, aircrew
        flight equipment training, etc.), initials of the individual processing the ARMS
        transaction, date of audit, and the initials of the individual who audited the ARMS
        transaction.
        3.3.1.1.4. (AFSOC) This guidance also applies to training accomplished via
        ADLS.
        3.3.1.1.5. For training events maintained in ARMS that are accomplished by a
        single individual when no instructor is involved (e.g. computer based training),
        provide a copy of the certificate to the unit SARM office. The SARM office will
        maintain a copy of the certificate as a source document.
        3.3.1.1.6. Reports and updates to ARMS generated from AF-approved automated
        systems may be used as source documentation for continuation training provided
        these reports contain the minimum required elements listed in paragraph 3.3.1.1.4
        Updates generated from an automated system must be validated by a review
        process.
     3.3.1.2. Continuation Training. CT events will be logged in Zulu date to match the
     AFTO Forms 781 and the Flight Authorizations. MAJCOMs will establish specific
     criteria and forms for documenting CT. With MAJCOM approval, units may develop
     local mission accomplishment reports and/or training accomplishment reports to
     document CT for processing into ARMS. MAJCOMs will establish minimum
     elements required for locally developed forms.
     3.3.1.2. (AFSOC) Unit developed MARs and TARs will include an aircraft
     commander signature block. SARM office personnel will ensure completed
     documents are certified by the aircraft commander before processing into ARMS.
        3.3.1.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Units must submit MARs and TARs to
        AFSOC/A3TR for approval through the designated wing/group training
        representative. Submit documents to: AFSOC.A3TR.ARMS@hurlburt.af.mil.

         3.3.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Unit training and standardization/evaluation offices will
         submit changes to the SARM office for update and proper coding of their individual
         aircraft certification code status changes.            Use AF Form 4324, Aircraft
         Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet, to document status changes to Basic
         Qualification, Mission Capable, Mission Ready, upgrade, training levels, and formal
         training course completion. The AFSOC Form 40, Mission Summary Report (or PEX
         equivalent), and End of Half Flying Training Level (FTL) upgrade letters may be
         used to update ARMS until the SARM office receives the completed AF Form 4324.
         EXCEPTION: AFSOC Form 40 and End of Half FTL cannot be used to update
         individual aircraft certification code status in which a certification board is required
         (e.g., Instructor Navigator). After the SARM office receives the AF Form 4324, it
         must validate the form against the information previously entered in ARMS.
  3.4. Currency. Currency requirements for aircrew members will be listed in AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 1.
  3.4. (AFSOC) Currency. Currency requirements for AFSOC aircrew members may be
  listed in an RTM posted on the AFSOC/A3T SharePoint.
     3.4.1. MAJCOMs determine similar equipment or systems for aircrew members who fly
     more than one mission or design aircraft.
     3.4.2. MAJCOM/A3s may waive currency requirements for aircraft that are unique to an
     organization when accomplishment is not practical. In such cases, commanders will
     ensure that aircrew members are current and certified/qualified in all normal and
     emergency procedures before unsupervised flight.
     3.4.3. Recurrency Training.
         3.4.3.1. Loss of Currency up to 6 Months. An aircrew member must demonstrate
         proficiency with an instructor (or designated supervisor, when specified in the
         applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1) in all delinquent items.
         3.4.3.2. Loss of Currency Exceeding 6 Months. AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1 will
         establish which currency items result in unqualified status requiring requalification
         according to paragraph 2.2, and which currency items do not result in unqualified
         status allowing recurrency to be regained according to paragraph 3.4.3.1.
  3.5. Proration of Training. When determining training requirements, prorate an aircrew
  member not available for flying duties (for example, PCS, nonflying TDY, duty not
  including flying [DNIF] status, or emergency leave).
  3.5. (AFSOC) Proration of Training. The unit training officer will notify the SARM
  office, in writing, when an assigned or attached aircrew member's continuation training must
  be prorated because the individual was not available (e.g., PCS, non-flying TDY, DNIF,
  emergency leave). Some flying TDYs may be prorated; refer to AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, for
  guidance (if applicable). The only type of leave authorized for proration is emergency leave.
  Proration training will be given in accordance with the schedule listed below.
     3.5.1. Proration does not apply to individuals who are available for 15 days or less, who
     will not incur training requirements.

     3.5.1. (AFSOC) For the purposes of proration, when an aircrew member is declared
     mission ready (MR) during the last 15 calendar days of the training half, assign MR
     training profiles effective the first day of the following training half. Example: Capt
     Smith completes Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and is declared MR on 20 March
     2012; assign MR training profiles, in ARMS, effective 1 April 2012.
     3.5.2. For individuals available for flying duties for 16 days or more, requirements
     prorated are in direct proportion to the number of days of nonavailability. Do not prorate
     for nonavailability of 15 days or less.
     3.5.3. For every 30 days of nonavailability beyond 15 days, prorate training requirements
     one month, but not to less than one event. Additional proration guidance may be
     established in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  3.6. Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements.
     3.6.1. Declare individuals in Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) non-
     mission ready (N-MR), non-combat mission ready (N-CMR), non-basic mission capable
     (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) if they fail to complete periodic
     ground or flying continuation training requirements defined in paragraph 3.1.5 and in AFI
     11-2MDS Vol 1.
     3.6.2. Individuals who fail to accomplish minimum CT requirements and subsequently
     lose currency must fly in supervised status when currency in the item is required for the
     particular flight (unless otherwise directed in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1). If
     failure to accomplish the minimum requirement results in grounding, individuals will not
     fly as aircrew members and will not perform aircrew duties until the requirement is
     accomplished.
     3.6.3. Suspend aircrew members assigned to active flying positions who fail to attain and
     maintain aircrew qualification, when such action is within the member’s control, IAW
     AFI 11-402.
     3.6.4. Document decisions to suspend, retain or regress aircrew member status following
     failure of the individual to meet required standards IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and/or AFI
     11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2.
     3.6.5. (Added-AFSOC) Documentation. SARM office will establish procedures to
     monitor non-current individuals (Go/No-Go requirement). Training offices will ensure
     the SARM office has a list of non-current personnel at the end of each quarter (if
     applicable), semi-annual, and annual periods. As a minimum, the log will include grade,
     name, crew position, and non-current event(s). SARM offices will track non-current
     event(s) completion by including the date of completion and instructor on the log; then
     file the completed log with the end of cycle documents.
  3.7. Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Members on Active Flying Status. The
  following paragraphs apply to flying personnel departing PCS from their old station or
  departing for a non-flying TDY from their permanent station.
     3.7.1. Aircrew members should complete a proportionate share of flying requirements by
     the end of the month preceding the date of departure.
AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013                                                        31


     3.7.2. Complete flight physical and physiological training requirements before departing,
     if the due date occurs within three months after departure date (CONUS assignments), or
     if the due date occurs prior to DEROS (overseas assignments). Air University graduating
     students may delay physiological refresher training until they arrive at their new duty
     location or formal flying training base, if the assigned base is a location with a
     physiological training facility.
  3.8. Requirements Before Removal from Active Flying. The following paragraphs apply
  to flying personnel being retired, separated, placed in inactive status, or reassigned to
  nonflying positions. Paragraph 3.1.5 applies.
     3.8.1. Training requirements apply until the last day of the fourth month prior to an
     individual’s removal from active flying. For example, a person who retires or starts
     terminal leave on 1 July must complete requirements through 31 March; or, if a person is
     reassigned to a nonflying position on 15 November, he must complete requirements
     through 31 July. MAJCOMs may extend specific training requirement applicability,
     based on unit mission requirements, on a case-by-case basis.
     3.8.2. Refresher physiological training and academic refresher courses are not required if
     individuals on active flying status are current, and if removal from active flying status
     occurs during the 4-month period after the due date.
  3.9. Requirements While in Inactive Flying Status.
     3.9.1. Personnel placed in inactive status will not complete flying and ground training
     requirements of this instruction and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.

     170, except for flying personnel in aviation service codes (ASCs) 6J, 7J, 8J, and 9J, GJ
     and HJ. When inactive members in the preceding ASCs have been selected and
     confirmed for assignment to aircrew duties, these individuals must be in compliance with
     paragraph 3.1.5 before performing inflight duties. Individuals will regain their physical
     qualification prior to PCS/PCA to an active flying assignment.
  3.10. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
  Units. Air Force aircrews performing appropriate duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
  AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, are only
  required to maintain a current flight physical and review their flight records IAW AFI 11-
  401. Aircrew members affected by this paragraph are not required to maintain currency in
  USAF physiological training, but must regain physiological qualification (when required)
  prior to performing aircrew duty in USAF aircraft. See also AFI 11-202 Vol 2.
  3.11. Flight Surgeon Requirements. Flight surgeon flying requirements are according to
  the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1, but in no case are they less than those in Table 1.

   3.11. (AFSOC) Flight Surgeon Requirements. AFSOC policy is for flight surgeons to get
   flight time on the full variety of AFSOC aircraft available to them in order to understand the
   physical and physiological challenges facing AFSOC aircrew. AFSOC flight surgeons
   assigned to API-5 positions will be attached to an AFSOC flying unit. If TDY and unable to
   fly on their primary aircraft, prorate primary training requirements according to AFI 11-202,
   Vol 1, AFSOC Supplement, AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, or RTM as appropriate.
         3.11.1. (AFSOC) Any AFSOC flight surgeon may be designated on the flight
         authorization if they have current aeronautical orders and complete the requirements of
         AFI 11-202, Vol 1, paragraph 3.1.5.
         3.11.2. (Added-AFSOC) Flight Surgeon ground training requirements will be
         established via RTM and posted on the AFSOC/A3T SharePoint site.

   SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, AF Form 4110, Comments-SOF/CSAR Training
   Record,.and AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training. AFSOC approved substitutes may be
   utilized in lieu of these forms.
   10.2. (Added) (AFSOC) Career Training Folder (CTF). Units will maintain a career
   training folder for all assigned or attached crewmembers. All completed training records will
   be included in a single binder of appropriate size or saved electronically to provide an
   accurate representation of an individual’s long term progression and any positive or negative
   trends related to their training. From the release date of this supplement unit training offices
   will keep training folders completed by the aircrew member (i.e. training folders from
   previously qualified MDSs).
       10.2.1. (AFSOC) For hard copy CTFs, the name of the crewmember will be clearly
       posted on both the binder spine and front cover. The front cover must also prominently
       display the following statement: “PRIVACY ACT INFORMATION – The information
       accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY and must be protected in
       accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program.”
36                                          AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013


     Each training record within the binder will be tabbed separately to differentiate between
     programs. The binder will be divided into sections as follows:
        10.2.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Section 1 – Table of Contents. This should clearly list
        each item contained within the binder and the tab where it is located. It should be
        kept as current and accurate as possible and clearly display the date of the last update.
        10.2.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Section 2 – Record of Review. The training section
        will review the career training folder for accuracy and completeness annually. The
        review will include, but not limited to, a thorough scrub of all training folders (TF)
        added in Section 3 since the last annual review; ensuring TFs were opened, closed,
        and filled out correctly. Annotate the date of review as well as the name and office
        symbol of the reviewing official. Include any comments or discrepancies noted. If an
        expanded explanation is necessary, use a Memorandum for Record (MFR) signed by
        the unit training officer. File these documents behind the record of annual review in
        chronological order with the most recent on the bottom. No annual review is required
        for crewmembers in inactive/non-flying positions. Annotate the timeframe during
        which the individual was in non-flying status in appropriate chronological space in
        the record of annual review (i.e., May 2002-Jun 2005 Inactive/AFSOC Staff).
        10.2.1.3. (Added-AFSOC) Section 3 – Completed Training Records. This
        section will ideally contain all flight training records (qualifications, certifications,
        specialized mission training, etc.), whether they are completed in-unit or at the FTU.
        The records will be in chronological order starting with initial qualification and
        ending with the most recently completed training on the bottom. Each training record
        within the folder will be tabbed separately to differentiate between programs. The
        tabs will be numbered in order with the member’s initial qualification (whether
        completed at the FTU or in-unit) labeled Tab #1.
     10.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Electronic CTF will follow the guidance in paragraph 10.2.1.
     For electronic maintained CTFs, the name of the crewmember will be used as the name
     of the folder with FOUO (i.e. Capt John Smith’s folder will be named ‘Smith John –
     FOUO’). An example of the electronic CTF will be located on the AFSOC/A3T
     SharePoint. Inside the main folder, there will be two sub folders as follows:
        10.2.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Record of Review. Inside the folder will be a document
        or a collection of documents showing the completion of the annual reviews and any
        discrepancies noted. The document may be a living word, excel, etc file or scanned
        copies of the completed reviews.
        10.2.2.2. (Added-AFSOC) Completed Training Records. This folder will contain
        scanned copies of all completed training folders (41XX series or AETC equivalent)
        and any applicable Graduate Training Integration Management System (GTIMS)
        products. Include a file documenting all courses contained within this folder; Table
        of Contents.
     10.2.3. (Added-AFSOC) Career training folders are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974
     and shall be used for official business only. Maintain folders in a secure area within the
     unit’s training section or electronically. Only instructors and supervisors should have
     regular access to these records. Individuals may sign out their own records.
AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013                                                           37


     10.2.4. (Added-AFSOC) When a crewmember makes a PCS move, the squadron
     training section will copy the table of contents and record of annual review as a
     minimum. The unit shall seal the career training folder, or computer disc with the files,
     in an envelope along with the individual’s FEF and AF Forms 4324 then give it to the
     member for delivery to the next duty station. If the squadron is storing the career training
     folders electronically, they will save a copy of the entire folder.
         10.2.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) When a crewmember PCSs to an active flying
         assignment. The losing squadron will maintain the table of contents and record of
         annual review until positive confirmation the gaining squadron receives the
         crewmembers CTF.
         10.2.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) Crewmembers PCS to an inactive flying assignment,
         separating, or retiring. The losing unit squadron training section shall keep these
         copies until the member arrives at his next flying assignment or 5 years (whichever is
         less).
  10.3. (Added) (AFSOC) Entry into Upgrade. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4109)
  for ETCA formal training courses (formal school or SMT), mission certification, special
  qualification, certification training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew
  qualification, requalification training (formal school, SMT, or IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
  paragraph 2.2.1.), difference training, and corrective action or additional training as directed
  by the squadron commander. Each training folder must include documentation of entry into
  the training program by the unit leadership. This will normally consist of an entry on the first
  AF Form 4110 in the trainee’s record. Units may also substitute a copy of the minutes from
  an upgrade board, MFR, or other locally produced form in place of the AF Form 4110 entry.
  This document must be signed by the unit operations officer or commander.
  10.4. (Added) (AFSOC) AF Form 4109. These forms are the cardstock folder used to
  hold all required training documents. They are available from the pubs distribution office or
  by establishing an account on the AF e-publishing homepage. It is mandatory for all
  basic/mission qualification training and any special mission qualification training (leading to
  either a special mission evaluation or instructor certification). Open AF Form 4109 records

         10.4.6.4. (Added-AFSOC) Remarks. This section may be used for additional
         information at unit discretion. Otherwise, it should be left blank.
  10.5. (Added-AFSOC) AF Form 4110. These forms are used to record a narrative of
  student performance during all flying and ground training sessions and administrative
  comments related to student training. They are available on the AF e-publishing homepage.
  This form is required for all training completed at the FTU or in-unit IAW AFI 11-202, Vol
  1, paragraph 2.1.4. (including SMT IAW paragraph 2.9.). This form shall be maintained on
  the left side of the AF Form 4109. Comply with the following instructions when completing
  the AF Form 4110.
     10.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) The first AF Form 4110 entry will be the “entry into training”
     write-up unless substituted with a locally produced form or TRB minutes.
     10.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) Name or Trainee Name. Self-explanatory.
     10.5.3. (Added-AFSOC) Date. Self-explanatory.
     10.5.4. (Added-AFSOC) Training Period or Sortie ID. Enter the appropriate training
     period designator, numbered sequentially.
     10.5.5. (Added-AFSOC) Mission/Profile/Comments/Recommendations. This section
     shall include a write-up for each training event (ground, simulator, or aircraft) the student
     participates in. It will also contain any additional information pertinent to the
     individual’s training (i.e. recommendations for proficiency advance, monthly/quarterly
     reviews, etc). Write-ups for student ground, simulator, and aircraft training events will
     comply with the following format:
         10.5.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Profile. This section should start by listing the sortie or
         event completed and the grade earned; or indicate why the sortie was incomplete, if it
         was not finished for any reason, and what items yet remain to complete it. A brief
         description of weather and other related factors (i.e., EMI levels for an NVG sortie or
         sea state for a water ops sortie) should be the next item. The rest of the section
         should be a brief summary of training completed, to include specific events and
         number of iterations where relevant. It should be written so that the next instructor
         has no doubts where to pick up the training. Detailed comments will be entered
         whenever the performance level attained is below the printed RPL.
         10.5.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) Strengths. This section should be a brief summary of
         the student’s strengths. Make every effort to identify useable, relevant strengths to
         further build a picture of student progression for the next instructor. There should
         always be some strength or strengths to emphasize but if the sortie does not lend itself
         to identifying any or none are noted, state “none noted.” If no strengths are noted,
         strong consideration should be given to awarding the student an “unsatisfactory” for
         the training period.
         10.5.5.3. (Added-AFSOC) Weaknesses. This section should be a brief summary of
         the student’s weaknesses. It should, again, contribute to the next instructor’s ability
         to understand the proficiency level the student has attained. It should also give the
         student areas in which to strive for improvement. An honest assessment is critical but
         avoid being overly harsh or judgmental. There should always be some weakness or
42                                          AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013


        weaknesses to emphasize but if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or
        none are noted, state “none noted.” If no weaknesses are noted, strong consideration
        should be given to awarding the student an “excellent” for the training period.
        10.5.5.4. (Added-AFSOC) Recommendations. This section is written primarily for
        the next instructor but should also include recommendations for the student where
        applicable. List items the next trainer should emphasize or other suggestions to
        maximize the student’s next training event. Enter the next recommended step for the
        student (i.e., continue with training, proceed to evaluation, proficiency advance, etc).
        10.5.5.5. (Added-AFSOC) The individual making the entry will sign after each
        write-up, and print his/her name and crew/supervisory position. The student will
        initial next to the trainer’s signature. This only indicates that he/she has read and
        understands the entry. It does not necessarily indicate agreement/concurrence.
  10.6. (Added-AFSOC) AF Form 4111. This form is used to document required maneuver
  information file (MIF) items and RPL. Typically this will be a pre-printed form. Comply
  with the following instructions when completing the AF Form 4111.
     10.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) Name. Self explanatory.
     10.6.2. (Added-AFSOC) Crew Position. For aircrew members in a program designed
     to advance them to a higher crew position, enter the qualification to which they are
     upgrading. For all other training, enter the crew position currently held.
     10.6.3. (Added-AFSOC) Course/Phase. Enter formal course title if one exists or enter
     a descriptive identifier for other types of training (e.g., C-145A MP IQ, CV-22 Fast Rope
     Certification, AC-130U LM Instructor Upgrade).
     10.6.4. (Added-AFSOC) Programmed Training Profile. This line should contain the
     sortie identifiers for each training event and the syllabus-directed training time.
     10.6.5. (Added-AFSOC) Actual Training Profile.         The instructor should fill in the
     actual training time the student received.
     10.6.6. (Added-AFSOC) ID. List applicable task number for the corresponding task
     from the MDS Master Training Task List (MTTL).
     10.6.7. (Added-AFSOC) Task/Topic Listing.          List applicable task from the MDS
     MTTL.
     10.6.8. (Added-AFSOC) Min Event. List the minimum number of events to be
     completed (if applicable) before training can be considered complete. If a task has an
     associated required proficiency level then the minimum events required is one unless
     otherwise noted in this block. Fill out this block for any task which requires two or more
     events to complete training.
     10.6.9. (Added-AFSOC) GR (grade)/PK (performance knowledge). List the grade or
     RPL to be attained on that sortie. On a preprinted form, the instructor should slash
     through the item if the RPL is met. If the RPL is not met or is exceeded, the actual RPL
     attained should be written over the preprinted number/letter. Standards for awarding
     grades should be IAW procedures listed on the back cover of the AF Form 4109.
AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013                                                          43


     10.6.10. (Added-AFSOC) Req Prof Level. This is the final RPL the student must attain
     prior to being recommended for evaluation. One RPL should be listed for each training
     task.
  10.7. (Added-AFSOC) Periodic Reviews. All open training records shall be reviewed
  monthly by the unit training section and quarterly by the operations officer. This review
  shall be documented in the AF Form 4110 and signed by the unit training representative or
  the operations officer, respectively. In those months where a quarterly review is completed,
  the monthly review is not required.
     10.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) The monthly review should ensure all training is correctly
     documented and instructor write-ups adequately document student performance. If errors
     are discovered, take immediate action to correct them or document reasons the errors
     could not be corrected (e.g., instructor not available for signature). It should also ensure
     the trainee is progressing in a satisfactory manner, identify any significant problems
     encountered, and recommend any adjustments to training.
         10.7.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Review the time elapsed between training flights. If an
         excessive amount of time has elapsed between training rides, an extra training sortie
         (X-ride) should either be awarded and flown or the training section should document
         the reasons this additional training is not required at this time (N/A ANG/AFRC).
     10.7.2. (Added-AFSOC) The quarterly review should consist of a cursory look at a
     sampling of training documentation and other administrative items. The focus of this
     review should be primarily on trainee progression. The operations officer should take
     this time to ensure students are performing up to standards and the training program is
     meeting his goals or vision for the unit. Any relevant findings or recommendations
     should be documented at this time.
  10.8. (Added-AFSOC) Instructions for Closing Out Training Records. Whether a
  training program is successfully completed or terminated for other reasons (failure to
  progress, extended DNIF, etc); the training record must be closed out. This is accomplished
  by a final entry in the trainee’s last AF Form 4110. Units may substitute an MFR, or locally
  produced form, in place of the AF Form 4110. The form used must be reviewed and signed
  by the unit ops officer.
     10.8.1. (Added-AFSOC) For successful completion of training, the entry should
     indicate that all training has been satisfactorily completed, the new qualification or
     certification is awarded, and all records have been updated (to include the AF Form 4348,
     letter of Xs, FEF, and ARMS database as required). It should also include any
     restrictions (if applicable).
     10.8.2. (Added-AFSOC) For termination of training (for cause or unrelated factors), the
     entry should indicate the reasons for termination of the upgrade and plans to re-enter the
     trainee into the program again at a later date (if any).
  10.9. (Added-AFSOC) Instructions               for          Documenting          Aircrew
  Qualifications/Certifications.    Units must accurately track all qualifications and
  certifications for each crewmember. This is best accomplished through a combination of the
  AF Form 4348 and a locally generated letter of Xs (or equivalent).

     10.9.1. (AFSOC) The AF From 4348 shall be maintained in the member’s flight
     evaluation folder IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2. Events requiring
     documentation on the AF Form 4348 will be listed in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, applicable
     supplement, or AFSOC guidance.
     10.9.2. (Added-AFSOC) Letter of Xs. A letter of Xs (or equivalent document) shall be
     maintained by each unit. This document is the commander’s tool to track specialized
     training (e.g., locally required certifications for new equipment or procedures). Specific
     procedures and format will be determined locally, but it must contain the following
     minimum information:          crewmember name, certifications obtained, and highest
     qualification currently held. Other information may be included at the discretion of the
     unit commander. The letter of Xs is not a source document for certifications and
     qualifications; it is a display of information found in the source documents. Units will
     forward a current copy of the letter of Xs to their SARM office and AFSOC/A3TR
     monthly.
     10.9.3. (Added-AFSOC) AF Form 4324. This form is the source document used to
     update aircrew certification, assign training profiles, and formal flying training dates in
     ARMS. The squadron Stan/Eval or training office will complete this form and submit to
     SARM office to assign training profiles when a new crewmember inprocesses to the unit.
     Complete a new form when training profiles are added, aircrew certification codes
     change, and when formal school courses are completed. SARM offices will maintain a
     copy of aircrew members’ AF Forms 4324 on file for the duration of their assignment.
     Upon members’ PCS/PCA, include copies in the members’ training folder for delivery to
     the next duty station/unit (see paragraph 10.2.4.).

Terms
Aircrew—The total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, combat systems officers, air battle
managers, and flight surgeons), career enlisted aviators (1AXXX and 1UXXX Air Force
Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed Air Force Specialty Code)
personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft and onboard
systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission. Includes
members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying
position. Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position
according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an
aircraft’s basic crew complement, but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their
principal duties inflight and their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary
tasked mission. Duties must be essential to operating the aircraft or mission systems and
equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties essential to the aircraft’s mission.
NOTES:—1. US Air Force Academy (USAFA)/Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps
(AFROTC) cadets enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status
while actively participating in such programs. Cadets will be placed on aeronautical orders
authorizing flying status while participating in approved USAFA flying programs and will not be
added in the operational ARMS database. HARM office personnel will not assign an Aviation
AFI11-202V1_AFSOCSUP_I 11 MARCH 2013                                                                51


Service Code (ASC) and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established. Neither flying
incentive pay nor flying duty credit are authorized.
IAW AFI 11—401, cadets who fly as part of their scheduled OPS AF training are authorized to
participate in flying duties as observers, in a special training status. These training sorties are not
orientation sorties, which are authorized for USAFA and AFROTC cadets not on aeronautical
orders. Observer sorties may be conducted IAW all regularly-scheduled sorties and are not
restricted to the local flying area. They may be flown in conjunction with student training and IP
continuation training sorties, as well as IAW direct support flights, but may not be flown on
functional check flight (FCF) or operational check flight (OCF) sorties.
The purpose of cadet training sorties is to introduce cadets to USAF flying operations and
motivate cadets to consider a career as a rated aircrew member. As such, all normally—
permitted training events, to include touch and go landings, aerobatics, air combat maneuvering,
air refueling, and low level training, are authorized. An IP must be at the controls during all
critical phases of flight on cadet training sorties.
2. The term “navigator” includes all navigator specialties and is synonymous with the
designation Combat Systems Officer (CSO). New UFT graduates are designated CSOs, but
previously qualified individuals will continue to be identified as navigators.
Basic Aircraft Qualification—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed training
prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
Basic Mission Capable—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission
qualification training, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not maintain
MR/CMR status.
Combat Mission Ready—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission
qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the command or unit combat
mission.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned
qualification level.
Conversion Training—Training conducted in association with a unit converting to a different
MDS.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure the average aircrew member maintains a minimum level of
proficiency in a given event.
Difference Training—Training provided to qualify members in a different series aircraft in the
same MDS.
Flying Training CONOPS—The process that ties validated training requirements to the Air
Force Programming, Planning, and Budgeting System.
Formal Course—A course of instruction listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcement (ETCA).

Initial Qualification Training—Training needed to qualify aircrew for basic aircrew duties in
an assigned crew position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit’s operational
mission.
Mission Ready—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification
training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission.
Mission Qualification Training—Training needed to qualify aircrew in an assigned crew
position for a specific aircraft to perform the command or unit mission.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—Any headquarters, agency, or activity having the
primary functional interest in, and responsibility for, a specific action, project, plan, program, or
problem.
Proficiency—A measure of how well a task is completed. An aircrew member is considered
proficient when they can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and
safety.
Special Mission Training—Training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s
assigned missions that are not required by every crew member. Specialized training is normally
accomplished after the crew member is assigned MR/CMR or BMC status, and is normally in
addition to MR/CMR or BMC requirements. May be an additional certification or qualification
event as determined by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1 or 2.
Training Command—The MAJCOM assigned responsibility for formal school training in each
MDS.
Transition Course—A formal course that qualifies an aircrew member in a similar type aircraft.

A3.1. Units and/or MAJCOMs will capture HCM and SCM data on aircrew assigned to API-1,
API-2, API-6, API-8, and API-9 positions. MAJCOMs will consolidate unit-level HCM and
SCM data by weapon system and API category. All reports will be defined by Fiscal
Year/Quarter and will be submitted in the following format (pilot example provided; use same
columns for API-2 and API-9 positions):

   A3.1.1. Aircrew Reporting:
       A3.1.1.1. Pilots: Average number of N-coded pilots assigned to the designated API
       during the quarter, broken out by Experienced and Inexperienced levels, IAW AFI 11-
       2MDS Vol 1. Do not include other coded pilots, such as retired, separated, PCS, TDY,
       inbound and new record. Only include pilots assigned and N-coded during the entire
       quarter. Report API-1 pilots only to HQ USAF/A3O-AT; retain data on other API pilot
       positions at MAJCOM, to be reported as requested by HQ USAF/A3O-AT.
       A3.1.1.2. CSO/Navigator: Average number of N-coded CSOs/Navigators and related
       specialties (EWO/WSO) assigned to the designated API during the quarter. Report API-
       2 data.
       A3.1.1.3. Air Battle Managers. Average number of ABMs assigned to the designated
       API during the quarter. Report API-9 data.
   A3.1.2. Hours per Quarter: Total number of hours flown (to include Primary, Secondary,
   Instructor, Evaluator, and Other time) during the quarter for the designated API (N-coded
   only).
   A3.1.3. HCM: Average numbers of hours flown per position per month. For the F-15C
   example above, 3000 hours flown divided by 50 pilots divided by the 3 months in the quarter
   equals 20 hours per crewmember per month.
   A3.1.4. Sorties per Quarter: Total number of sorties flown during the quarter for the
   designated API (N-coded only).

  A3.1.5. SCM: Average number of sorties flown per position per month. For the KC-135
  example above, 850 sorties flown divided by 50 pilots divided by the three months in the
  quarter equals 5.7 sorties per crewmember per month.
  A3.1.6. Reports will include explanatory remarks when actual HCM differs from
  programmed HCM (by MDS and API) by 10 percent or more.
  A3.1.7. Reports are required from the following commands: ACC, AFGSC, AFRC, AFSOC,
  AMC, NGB, PACAF, USAFE. Reporting requirements may be revised as directed by HQ
  USAF.
