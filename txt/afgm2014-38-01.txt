Airmen Powered by Innovation Program

This guidance memorandum provides interim guidance for the Airmen Powered by Innovation
(API) Program, and more specifically, procedures for submitting, evaluating, implementing, and
confirming the results of ideas submitted using the API Idea Process.

1. Background. In February 2013, the AF/CV tasked SAF/US(M) and AF/A1 to “streamline
and consolidate” four Air Force-wide “good idea” generating programs (Innovative
Development Through Employee Awareness (IDEA), Best Practices (BP), Productivity
Enhancing Capital Investment (PECI), and Air Force Smart Operations for the Twenty-first
Century (AFSO21)) into an Airmen Powered by Innovation Program. All four programs had
become stale over time and ineffective at “culling-out, implementing, and cross-feeding good
ideas.” The urgency to become better at implementing good ideas was further motivated by an
extremely stringent fiscal environment, the likes of which had not been seen since World War II,
and budget pressures brought about by sequestration. The challenging fiscal environment drove
a need to look internally to find underutilized resources. Leadership initiated the “streamlining
and consolidation” effort based on a logical cause and effect assumption that an increase in the
implementation of “good ideas” would result in resource savings and/or improved mission
performance. These savings could then be reallocated as deemed appropriate to maintain or
increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Air Force while simultaneously meeting the
budgetary reduction demands of sequestration.

2. Applicability and Scope. This guidance and these procedures apply to ideas submitted as of
1 June 2013. With the exception detailed in paragraph 5, it applies to individuals, units, and
organizations at all levels of the United States Air Force (Air Force), including Active Duty
personnel, civilian employees, contractors, and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) members
in Title 10 status (collectively Air Force personnel.)

3. Authorities, Roles, and Responsibilities.

3.1. All Airmen should:

3.1.1. Elevate ideas that affect cost savings, quality, productivity, cycle time, process
improvement, and morale.

3.1.2. Provide evaluation-ready ideas with sufficient detail describing the current method,
proposed method, expected benefits, and cost of implementation to support the idea.

3.1.3. Seek assistance, as needed, from local talent to build idea proposal (AFSO21 expert,
financial management analysts, etc.).

3.1.4. Search the “idea pool” for similar ideas previously processed to prevent unnecessary
processing of an idea.

3.1.5. Use mutually exclusive, established improvements processes for Tech Order changes,
Zero Overpricing proposals, and Patents/Inventions.

 4. Airmen Powered by Innovation Idea Process. As depicted in figure 4.1, the API Idea
Process is comprised of four phases: Ideation/Submission Phase, Evaluation Phase,
Implementation Phase, and Hold-the-Gains Phase. The process is triggered by the submission of
an idea from an Airman.

4.1. Ideation Phase. During the ideation phase, ideas are generated, screened, and improved to
ensure fact rich ideas are forwarded for evaluation.

4.1.1. Activity.

4.1.1.1. Generating Ideas. Ideas can be submitted at any time by any Airman at the following
website: https://ipds.afpc.randolph.af.mil. Additionally, ideas may be generated through a
focused effort, normally lasting no more than 72 hours. These efforts focus on a very specific
problem or seed of an idea. This method is referred to as crowdsourcing, an information
gathering method that leverages the creativity and experience of a large number of Airmen.

4.1.1.2. Quick Look. The idea cell will read and review each idea submission to categorize
them in order to select an appropriate response to the submitter.

                                           Attachment

4.1.1.2.1. Specific idea. The idea is valuable, practical, usable, clearly articulated, and ready to
be evaluated with no additional work necessary. The idea is ready to enter the evaluation phase.

4.1.1.2.2. Seed idea. The idea is an interesting starter idea but not yet actionable/“evaluate-
able.” The idea will enter the quality assist activity.

4.1.1.2.3. Problem without a proposed solution - submitter advised to resubmit with a proposed
solution and to consider seeking out local AFSO expert for assistance, as needed.

4.1.1.2.4. Non-actionable (personal complaint, personal attack, venting, etc.) - submitter advised
this process is not designed to respond to the nature of the submission.

4.1.1.2.5. Uniform Change Request (UCR) - idea database will hold UCRs in a repository
awaiting the next Uniform Board.

4.1.1.2.6. Patents/Inventions - submitter advised that patents/inventions are no longer accepted
in the API Idea Process and redirects them to AFI 51-303.

4.1.1.2.7. AFTO22 - submitter advised that approved AFTO 22s, in and of themselves, are no
longer accepted in the API Idea Process and redirected to Air Force Technical Order Guidance
00-5-1. However, if the approved “improvement-type” AFTO22 is adopted and implemented via
a TO change, an award may be made under paragraph 5. The approved “improvement-type”
AFTO22 and TO change must be included in the submission.

4.1.1.2.8. Zero Overpricing (ZOP) - submitter advised that approved ZOPs, in and of
themselves, are no longer accepted in the API Idea Process and redirected to AFM 23-110.
However, if the approved and implemented ZOP is based on the criteria in para 3.1.1.1, an award
may be made under paragraph 5. The approved ZOP and documentation of formal
implementation must be included in the submission.

4.1.2. Harvesting and Quality Assist. As part of the Ideation phase, an idea is reviewed and the
submitter is afforded a quality assist by the API Idea Cell. The objective is to take a “seed” of an
idea and transform it into a specific idea that has sufficient fact-based information to move to the
evaluation phase.
4.1.3. Outcome. The outcome of the Ideation Phase is an “evaluate-able” idea that increases the
effectiveness and/or efficiency of the Air Force. In other words, the present method, proposed
method, expected benefits, and cost to implement are addressed in the idea.

4.2. Evaluation Phase.

4.2.1. Activity. During the evaluation phase, the OLDM evaluates the idea through validation of
the current method, proposed method, expected benefits, and cost of implementation.
                                          AFGM38-01
                                          Attachment
4.2.2. Outcome. There are three potential outcomes of the evaluation phase: 1) approved or
approved in part with intent to implement, 2) approved or approved in part without intent to
implement, or 3) disapproved.

4.2.2.1. If an idea is approved with intent to implement, it will move to the implementation
phase.

4.2.2.2. If an idea is approved without intent to implement, the OLDM must provide rationale
and identify constraints to implementation. Approved ideas without intent to implement will be
reviewed and briefed during the quarterly performance review.

4.2.2.3. If an idea is disapproved, the OLDM must provide rationale or justification for the
decision. Disapproved ideas will be reviewed and briefed during the quarterly performance
review.

4.3. Implementation Phase.

4.3.1. Activity. During the implementation phase, implementation plans are developed and
executed.

4.3.2. Outcome. There are two potential outcomes of the implementation phase: 1) the idea is
fully implemented and results can be confirmed, or 2) a deliberate decision is made by the
OLDM to suspend/cancel implementation.

4.3.2.1. If an idea is fully implemented, it moves to the hold-the-gains phase.

4.3.2.2. If an idea is suspended/cancelled, the OLDM must provide supporting rationale for the
action.

4.4. Hold-the-Gains Phase.

4.4.1. Activity. During the hold the gains phase, the OLDM confirms results and 1) makes
resource savings (manpower and/or hard savings) available for harvesting through corporate
planning, programming, budgeting and execution processes, the year following confirmation of
results, or 2) recommends a new standard of performance and measurement.

4.4.2. Outcome. A more effective and efficient Air Force.

5. Awards. The Air Force relies on the professionalism of our Airmen who live by our core
value, excellence in all we do. Per Air Force Instruction 1-1, Air Force Standards, “Excellence in
All We Do directs us (all Airmen) to develop a sustained passion for the continuous improvement
and innovation that will propel the Air Force into a long-term, upward spiral of accomplishment
and performance.” Nevertheless, the Air Force will use non-monetary and monetary awards to
recognize Airmen for their ideas. Only active duty Air Force military members and civilian
employees, paid from Air Force appropriated funds, will be eligible for monetary awards

     5.1. Ideas approved for implementation.

     5.1.1. Local implementation - personal letter from OLDM

     5.1.2. MAJCOM-wide implementation - personal letter from MAJCOM 2-Ltr

     5.1.3. Air Force-wide implementation - personal letter from HAF 2-Ltr

     5.2. Ideas that delivered confirmed results in effectiveness and/or efficiency when
     implemented:

     5.2.1. Tangible Results. Whenever possible, awards will be based on tangible benefits (Table
     5.1). Only if it is extraordinarily difficult to measure benefits in dollar terms will intangible-
     benefit calculations be used.

     5.2.2. Intangible Results. Intangible benefits will, out of necessity, be estimated on the basis of
     judgment rather than precise facts or calculations.

     5.2.2.1. If benefits are intangible, the evaluator must clearly indicate the value and extent of
     application and recommend a precise award amount (Table 5.2). Suggestions with intangible
     benefits of limited value should be recognized.

     5.2.2.2. An idea may have tangible or intangible benefits only or a combination of both tangible
     and intangible benefits. The submitter will be paid an award commensurate with both tangible
     and intangible benefits realized.

     5.3. Processing awards. Monetary awards will be centrally funded at the HAF and managed by
     SAF/US(M).
