Supersedes AFI63-701, 24 June 1994                                                                            Pages: 40

This instruction implements AFPD 63-6, Industrial Resources, and establishes procedures for acquiring,
managing, and disposing of Air Force-owned industrial facilities defense contractors use to support Gov-
ernment contracts. For this instruction, industrial facilities are all property (other than material, special
tooling, military property, and special test equipment) needed for production, maintenance, research,
development, or test, including real property, buildings, structures, improvements, and plant equipment.
This instruction applies to Air Force activities that provide or authorize the use of Air Force-owned indus-
trial facilities, excluding Air Force Reserve and National Guard activities. It does not include the Air
National Guard. Attachment 1 lists the Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force directives, policy
documents, and instructions required to comply with this instruction. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil/.
This is the first publication of AFI 63-609. It rescinds and replaces AFI 63-701. It reflects changes in
organizations and responsibilities, eliminates the detailed Ownership Assessment decision tree (formerly
Fig. 2.1), and the Facilities Management and Divestiture Plan Requirements (formerly Atch 2) now that
most of the divestiture planning has progressed to the execution stages.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The interim change reflects organizational and administrative changes and identifies why the Air Force
uses procurement or RDT&E funds when GOCO facilities are acquired or constructed on government real
property, other than a military installation under the provisions of DODD 4275.5. A bar ( | ) indicates a
revision from the previous edition.

                            FACILITIES MANAGEMENT PLANNING

2.1. Facilities Planning Requirement. ASC/ENV performs periodic analysis to validate the need for
existing facilities and project future ability to make and support weapon systems and develops strategies
to dispose of industrial facilities.

2.2. Divestiture and Management Actions. ASC/ENV assesses whether the Air Force needs to own
facilities and identifies opportunities for divestiture.
    2.2.1. Declaration of Excess. If another DoD agency needs the industrial facility, the Air Force
    transfers it to the agency or reports it to the General Services Administration (GSA) through the US
    Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) as excess to requirements with no restrictions. Either action
    removes the property from the Air Force Industrial Property Account.
    2.2.2. Transfer to Air Force Military Property Account. If organic Air Force programs need the
    facility, the Air Force transfers it to the military property account.
    2.2.3. Negotiated Sale to Operating Contractor. If the Air Force needs the facility but does not
    need to own it and the incumbent contractor offers to buy it, the activity reports this to the GSA
    (through the USACE) with a recommendation to negotiate a sale.

                                                Chapter 3

                                   ACQUISITION OF FACILITIES

3.1. Real Property. SAF/AQR's oversight minimizes government construction of nonseverable facilities
on privately owned land and of facilities that only add to or support privately owned facilities on govern-
ment owned land. However, when the Air Force needs facilities, SAF/AQRE follows the statutes for real
property acquisition (summarized in DoD Directive 4165.6, Real Property Acquisition, Management and
Disposal, September 1, 1987) and secures any needed congressional approvals.
   3.1.1. ASC/ENV prepares supporting documentation for SAF/AQRE, as shown in Attachment 2.
   3.1.2. When acquiring real property, ASC/ENV does an environmental baseline survey per AFI
   32-7066, Environmental Baseline Survey in Real Estate Transactions to assess the property's environ-
   mental condition, address potential liabilities, and estimate remedial costs.

3.2. Personal Property. Air Force activities may only acquire industrial facilities to meet critical needs.
   3.2.1. ASC/ENV approves personal property acquisitions accountable under facilities contracts.
   3.2.2. The laboratory commander or the PEO responsible for the RDT&E funds approves personal
   property acquisition with RDT&E funds.
   3.2.3. The responsible procurement contracting officer (PCO) approves personal property acquisi-
   tions for all other contracts.

3.3. Vehicles. ASC/ENV provides military-unique motor vehicles to contractors for DoD contracts per
FAR 45.304 and AFPD 24-3, Operation, Maintenance, and Use of Transportation Vehicles and Equip-
ment and the attendant AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.

3.4. Expansion:
   3.4.1. If expanding Air Force industrial facilities becomes necessary, ASC/ENV gets SAF/AQRE
   approval.
   3.4.2. Programs fund their own expansion requirements.
   3.4.3. For expansion projects involving construction, ASC/ENV prepares DD Form 1391, Military
   Construction Project Data, modified to read "Facility Project Data," supporting documentation, and
   an Environmental Impact Analysis per AFI 32-7061, Environmental Impact Analysis Process.
   3.4.4. ASC/ENV requests SAF/AQRE approval for contractor financed construction projects or for
   installing permanent equipment on government property.

3.5. Modernization. ASC/ENV modernizes facilities if more efficient and cost-effective facilities result.

                                    BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

4.1. Facilities Contracts. For GOCOs, the Air Force uses a consolidated facilities contract if a lease is
not viable.
    4.1.1. ASC/ENV authorizes the use of facilities contracts. ASC/ENV uses a facilities contract when
    the contractor uses government-owned personal property at a contractor-owned, contractor-operated
    (COCO) facility.
    4.1.2. The facilities procurement contracting officer (FPCO) negotiates facilities contracts per FAR
    45.302-2.

4.2. Leases. The leasing statute, Title 10, United States Code, Section 2667, lets the Secretary of the Air
Force lease needed real or personal property under the control of the Air Force. The statute and the Secre-
tarial Determination and Finding (D&F) may add restrictions and mandatory lease provisions.
    4.2.1. Request for Lease. In the request for lease, ASC/ENV includes the information Attachment 5
    shows. The request includes supporting documentation, comments by the contract administration
    office (CAO), and a proposed draft D&F.
       4.2.1.1. The requester sends the needed documentation directly to SAF/AQRE and sends HQ
       AFMC/A7C a copy.
       4.2.1.2. The resulting official Secretarial D&F authorizes a lease, specifies final review and
       approval authority, and includes additional guidance about the lease terms.
       4.2.1.3. ASC/ENV sends SAF/AQRE a copy of the drafted lease for Secretarial review and gives
       the CAO copies for review and comment. The Air Force does not give a contractor any lease infor-
       mation before Secretarial review and comment.

4.3. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Contracts. When ASC/ENV does not use US Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE) services, a base civil engineering function, or the Air Force Center for Environ-
mental Excellence (AFCEE), ASC/ENV negotiates O&M contracts to obtain services, including care-
taker services for unneeded industrial plants and environmental cleanup.
    4.3.1. ASC/ENV prepares a purchase request (PR) package that includes project approval, funding
    source, and a statement of objectives (SOO) for use in issuing O&M contracts.

4.4. Acquisition Planning. Program offices include requirements for all industrial facilities in the initial
program documentation (pre-request for proposal) of all RDT&E and production contracts (e.g., acquisi-
tion plans, acquisition strategy panels, and so on).
    4.4.1. RFPs require a detailed government-furnished facilities plan to include facilities moderniza-
    tion.
    4.4.2. The contractor must identify potential problems during production, surge and mobilization.

4.5. Contract and Lease Administration:
    4.5.1. Facility contract administration follows the FAR.
AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005                                                                             9


  4.5.2. Facility lease administration follows the FAR as incorporated into the lease or as stated in an
  MOA.
  4.5.3. The facilities procurement contracting officer (FPCO) negotiates the MOA with each responsi-
  ble CAO; or HQ AFMC/PK and HQ DCMA negotiate a single MOA for all CAOs.
10                                                                         AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005


                                                  Chapter 5

                                      FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

5.1. Contractual Instruments. The Air Force uses facilities contracts or leases to account for and man-
age government-owned industrial facilities it provides to defense contractors.
     5.1.1. Leases. Normally, the government restricts the contractor from using leased property in a way
     that interferes with DoD contracts or subcontracts.
     5.1.2. Facilities Contracts. After ASC/ENV approves a facilities contract, the FPCO authorizes a
     contractor to use government-owned industrial facilities according to FAR 45.4 and this instruction.
     5.1.3. Contracts with Foreign Governments or International Organizations. A S C / E N V
     approves industrial facilities' use for foreign government work per AFI 63-107, Integrated Planning
     and Assessment Product Support, and FAR 45.405. ASC/ENV considers the impact on the facilities
     disposal effort.
        5.1.3.1. ASC/ENV may grant a contractor blanket facility use approval for a given country not to
        exceed 1 year. If a country orders something from the contractor in the approved period, the
        approval continues until the contractor fills the order.
        5.1.3.2. DFARS 245.405 explains the process of approving a request to waive or reduce charges
        for using government production and research property.
     5.1.4. Commercial. FAR 45.407 limits commercial work done in facilities under a facilities contract
     to 25 percent of the facilities' total use. Commercial work under a facilities lease is unlimited provided
     it does not interfere with government work. Commercial work includes items produced to sell directly
     to foreign governments.
        5.1.4.1. A contractor who wants to extend the limit under a facilities contract must send requests
        in sufficient time to reach SAF/AQRE at least 3 weeks before using the facility.
        5.1.4.2. ASC/ENV reviews requests and sends them through HQ AFMC/A7C to SAF/AQRE for
        approval.

5.2. Accountability. A contractor using a GOCO facility to produce goods for DoD has only one lease or
facilities contract with the government (FAR 45.302-2(b)). ASC/ENV may simultaneously use a facilities
lease and a facilities contract at any contractor location, provided that one accounts for the facilities and
the other fulfills a different need.
     5.2.1. ASC/ENV manages all government-owned industrial plant equipment (IPE), other plant equip-
     ment (OPE), and vehicles provided to contractors at GOCO industrial plants. Facilities contracts and
     leases govern personal property use outside GOCO facilities.

5.3. Resource Protection. Physical security for GOCO industrial facilities and their products will be
IAW AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program; AFI 10-245, The Air Force Antiterrorism/
Force Protection (AT/FP) Program Standards, and DoD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Con-
ventional Arms, Ammunitions, and Explosives.
     5.3.1. Program offices provide physical security standards through the production contracts.
AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005                                                                             11


       5.3.1.1. The program offices monitor physical security for their production contracts at GOCOs
       and conducts physical security surveys IAW AFI 31-101 for their production contracts.
   5.3.2. ASC/ENV is responsible for oversight of physical protection of real property at GOCO facili-
   ties IAW AFI 31-101 and AFI 10-45. They will ensure physical security surveys are conducted IAW
   AFI 31-101 for their contract/lease agreements.
   5.3.3. Facilities planning, programming, and budgeting must identify what is needed to protect gov-
   ernment-owned real property, personal property, arms, ammunition, and explosives.
   5.3.4. If a program office has a specific need driven by a weapon system, such as installing a new
   ammunition storage bunker due to unique needs or falling short of capacity, ASC/ENV requests funds
   from the office managing the program.
       5.3.4.1. These projects normally qualify as expansions.
       5.3.4.2. The program office funds any security requirements unique to their program.

5.4. Facility Maintenance. Contractors use industrial standards to maintain facilities the Air Force
owns. The work needed to maintain industrial facilities consists of normal maintenance, capital work, and
packing, crating, and handling (PC&H). Capital work includes projects qualifying as expansion, capital
type rehabilitation (CTR), modernization, environmental compliance, and energy conservation.
   5.4.1. For facilities contracts, ASC/ENV programs Capital Type Rehabilitation (CTR) projects and
   PC&H needs annually per Air Force budgeting guidance.
       5.4.1.1. For leases, ASC/ENV programs projects annually against projected lease revenues.
       5.4.1.2. ASC/ENV systematically tracks the backlog of unfunded facilities projects under both
       facilities contracts and leases.
       5.4.1.3. When CTR project needs exceed lease revenues, ASC/ENV sets up a method for priori-
       tizing projects.
   5.4.2. Requirement Analysis. The contractor identifies the maintenance needs for GOCO industrial
   facilities. ASC/ENV assesses each GOCO at least annually to:
       5.4.2.1. Make sure each contractor complies with the approved Normal Maintenance Plan.
       5.4.2.2. Identify, validate, and prioritize capital needs.
   5.4.3. ASC/ENV prioritizes project funding with appropriated funds, proceeds from facilities sales, or
   lease revenues according to the following class or category priorities:
   5.4.4. The Air Force makes a definitive distinction between its recurring and nonrecurring environ-
   mental compliance requirements.
       5.4.4.1. Recurring environmental compliance requirements, also known as environmental opera-
       tions and services (O&S), involving “must do” requirements associated with keeping the facilities
       open. These are known as Level 0 environmental compliance requirements. AFI 30-7001, Envi-
       ronmental Budgeting, explains environmental policy and how to comply with it.
       5.4.4.2. Nonrecurring environmental compliance requirements will fall into three levels.
12                                                                       AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005


            5.4.4.2.1. Level 1 requirements correct conditions not in compliance with federal, state, inter-
            state, and local environmental laws. Ignoring these laws may lead to permit revocation, injunc-
            tion through regulatory enforcement, fines, or citizen suit.
            5.4.4.2.2. Level 2 requirements correct conditions that will result in future non-compliance.
            5.4.4.2.3. Compliance Through Pollution Prevention. These projects involve a pollution pre-
            vention fix for a compliance requirement.
            5.4.4.2.4. Level 3 requirements enhance environmental quality and prevent future environ-
            mental degradation.
     5.4.5. There are four categories of capital work that are not environmental:
        5.4.5.1. Category 1 projects protect life, health, or safety(risk assessment codes [RAC] 1, 2, or 3
        or fire safety deficiency codes [FSDC] 1 or 2).
        5.4.5.2. Category 2 projects impact production and/or are safety related projects (RAC 4 or
        greater, or FSDC 3 or greater).
        5.4.5.3. Category 3 projects prevent further property deterioration.
        5.4.5.4. Category 4 projects enhance productivity.
     5.4.6. Normal Maintenance. The facilities contract or lease requires the contractor to perform the
     normal maintenance Attachment 1 defines.
        5.4.6.1. In the Normal Maintenance Plan contractors describe the program they must set up and
        administer per FAR 45.509-1. The contractor reports maintenance needs not covered in the Nor-
        mal Maintenance Plan to ASC/ENV for appropriate action.
        5.4.6.2. ASC/ENV reviews the contractor's written Normal Maintenance Plan, FPCO validates it,
        and the CAO approves it.
        5.4.6.3. ASC/ENV considers whether the contractor should reduce normal maintenance for facil-
        ities to be disposed of soon.
     5.4.7. Capital Work. The Air Force normally funds needs beyond the contractor's normal mainte-
     nance plan. However, contractor financing may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
     5.4.8. Real Property. GOCO industrial facilities may require work more than normal maintenance to
     sustain their production capability to meet current and future DoD needs.
        5.4.8.1. For capital projects, ASC/ENV uses integrated engineering practices to comply with fire
        and safety codes, security, energy conservation, and pollution prevention requirements. ASC/ENV
        does not accomplish projects solely to meet code revisions unless failing to do so results in not
        complying with a law or an emergency situation.
        5.4.8.2. In plants identified for disposal, ASC/ENV corrects only life, health, safety, and environ-
        mental problems. In addition, ASC/ENV uses discretion when accomplishing projects which are
        essential to current production, eliminate a serious security risk, or needed to facilitate the sale.
     5.4.9. Notification to the Congress. For construction projects that expand plant capability or capac-
     ity, the contractor sends DD Form 1391 changed to read "Facility Project Data" and AF Form 813,
     Request for Environmental Impact Analysis. On these forms, contractors assess their projects' environ-
     mental impact.
AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005                                                                                13


       5.4.9.1. ASC/ENV reviews the forms and forwards them through HQ AFMC/A7C to SAF/
       AQRE.
       5.4.9.2. If SAF/AQRE concurs with the project, they notify the Congress prior to approval.
   5.4.10. Emergency Capital Type Rehabilitation (ECTR):
       5.4.10.1. The contractor acts first to stop an emergency and minimize facility damage. Then the
       contractor tells ASC/ENV about the emergency and the action taken and recommends a solution.
       5.4.10.2. When ASC/ENV secures funding and obtains project approval, they instruct the FPCO
       to direct the contractor to take appropriate action.
   5.4.11. Rearrangement:
       5.4.11.1. ASC/ENV approves the classification and technical scope of proposed rearrangement
       projects. ASC/ENV may delegate their authority to the responsible CAO.
       5.4.11.2. The CAO or DCAA determines and allocates the projects' costs.

5.5. Personal Property. Air Force activities phase out personal property defense contractors use.
   5.5.1. For personal property under a facilities contract or lease, the contractor has a maintenance pro-
   gram per FAR 45.509-1.
   5.5.2. Although ASC/ENV may authorize using lease revenues to repair personal property account-
   able under a lease, they should not normally approve the use of direct Air Force funds for capital
   repair of personal property under a facilities contract.

5.6. Environmental Management. ASC/ENV executes the Environmental Management Program that
implements the requirements of Air Force directives and instructions on environmental planning and
management, specifically AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, and implementing Air Force Instructions.
   5.6.1. ASC/ENV makes sure that all leases and facility contracts require defense contractors to oper-
   ate and maintain Air Force property in conformance with current federal, state, interstate, and local
   environmental laws and regulations.
   5.6.2. ASC/ENV establishes contract terms that address contractor responsibilities for environmental
   restoration, compliance, pollution prevention, and response actions.
   5.6.3. The Air Force does not assume responsibility for environmental restoration or compliance it
   assigned to a contractor under a lease or facilities contract.
   5.6.4. ASC/ENV seeks legal review of all actions that may result in liability for, or litigation against,
   the Air Force. If higher headquarters directs, or counsel advises, legal review is mandatory.
   5.6.5. Compliance. The contractor is responsible for operating and keeping the facilities in compli-
   ance with all environmental laws and regulations.
       5.6.5.1. ASC/ENV develops and uses an environmental compliance assessment and management
       program for industrial facilities. The program fulfills Air Force directives and instructions, and
       environmental laws and regulations.
       5.6.5.2. ASC/ENV performs all necessary actions required by Air Force environmental directives
       and instructions for GOCO facilities.
14                                                                        AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005


        5.6.5.3. ASC/ENV represents the Air Force in fulfilling "owner" obligations under federal, state,
        interstate, and local laws and regulations.
        5.6.5.4. ASC/ENV represents the Air Force in federal facility compliance program activities.
        5.6.5.5. ASC/ENV oversees GOCO plant operator responses to uncontrolled releases of hazard-
        ous substances. The contractor's response to this situation is governed by the facilities contract,
        leases, and the contractors' pollution incident plan. The plant operator then cooperates with envi-
        ronmental authorities and acts under National Contingency Plan guidelines and the Air Force
        instructions it contains.
        5.6.5.6. ASC/ENV uses the compliance program to reduce Air Force legal liability, financial loss,
        and environmental damage resulting from GOCO plant operator compliance problems.
        5.6.5.7. ASC/ENV negotiates the facilities contract or lease and programs resources necessary to
        execute the approved compliance program.
     5.6.6. Pollution Prevention. ASC/ENV writes and oversees the use of a Pollution Prevention Man-
     agement Plan. The plan identifies the pollution prevention opportunities that each active GOCO
     industrial facility then takes. The plan must address the requirements of the Pollution Prevention Act
     of 1990, Executive Order 13148, and AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program.
        5.6.6.1. ASC/ENV negotiates the facilities contract or lease and programs resources necessary to
        execute the approved pollution prevention program.
        5.6.6.2. ASC/ENV continually assesses opportunities to eliminate use or creation of toxic materi-
        als and ozone-depleting chemicals in GOCO plants.
        5.6.6.3. ASC/ENV seeks strategic alliances with the Air Force laboratories, United States Envi-
        ronmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Research and Development, and other research
        organizations to effectively use GOCO industrial facilities for technology demonstration pro-
        grams for pollution prevention.
     5.6.7. Restoration. ASC/ENV develops and executes an Environmental Restoration Program to
     solve problems caused by past releases of hazardous substances at Air Force GOCO plants.
        5.6.7.1. The program must comply with federal and state laws, AFPD 32-70, Environmental
        Quality; AFI 32-7020, The Environmental Restoration Program; AFPD 35-1, Public Affairs Man-
        agement; and Air Force instructions for implementing them.
     5.6.8. Cultural and Natural Resources Management. ASC/ENV assesses GOCO industrial facili-
     ties to identify cultural, historical, archaeological, and natural resources protected and managed under
     AFI 32-7065, Cultural Resources Management, and AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources
     Management.
     5.6.9. Environmental Surveys, Assessments, and Reports. ASC/ENV manages a continuing, inte-
     grated, interdisciplinary program to produce surveys, assessments, and reports required by federal,
     state, and local environmental laws and regulations and by DoD and Air Force directives and instruc-
     tions.
     5.6.10. Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). The proponent is responsible for the
     complying with EIAP and shall ensure integration of the EIAP during the initial planning stages of
AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005                                                                                15


   proposed actions so planning and decisions reflect environmental values, delays are avoided later in
   the process, and potential conflicts are precluded.
       5.6.10.1. ASC/ENV is the initial review and approval authority for the EIAP at ASC.
       5.6.10.2. ASC/ENV assesses the environmental impact of all major GOCO facilities actions
       under guidelines in AFI 32-7061.
       5.6.10.3. ASC/ENV supports the environmental impact assessment and mitigation activities of
       acquisition using GOCO facilities.
       5.6.10.4. ASC/ENV will assure a government person is completing the governmental function.
       Whether a function being considered for performance by contract is an inherently governmental
       function is an issue to be addressed prior to issuance of the solicitation. An inherently governmen-
       tal function is a function that is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate perfor-
       mance by Air Force personnel only. Inherently governmental functions do not necessarily include
       gathering information for or providing advice, opinions, recommendations, or ideas to Air Force
       personnel.
   5.6.11. Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP). A F I
   32-7045 is going to be obsolete by FY06, as a new ESOHCAMP AFI is being developed to supercede
   the existing one.
   5.6.12. Environmental Baseline and Closeout Surveys. ASC/ENV surveys and assessments define
   baseline environmental conditions at Air Force GOCO facilities before acquiring the real property or
   as soon as practicable afterward. The surveys support acquiring, transferring, leasing, selling, and dis-
   posing of real property following procedures and guidelines in AFI 32-7066, Environmental Baseline
   Surveys in Real Estate Transactions.
       5.6.12.1. ASC/ENV identifies and assesses all contaminated, potentially contaminated, and safe
       property.
       5.6.12.2. Federal or state regulatory agencies must agree that the property is safe.

5.7. Safety. ASC/ENV periodically reviews the operating contractor’s safety assurance program for Air
Force industrial facilities. The program covers occupational safety and health, grounds, explosives, flight,
space, systems safety, and fire protection. The operating contractor has legal and contractual responsibil-
ity for the safety assurance program as an employer and facility operator.
   5.7.1. Program Requirements. This program follows guidelines in DoD Instruction 4145.26, DoD
   Contractor's Safety Requirements for Ammunitions and Explosives, April 4, 1996 and identifies sys-
   tem safety requirements. The program meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1960, DoD Instruction
   6055.1, DoD Occupational Safety and Health Program, August 19, 1998, DoDI 6055.6, DoD Fire
   and Emergency Services Program, and the 91-series policy directives and Air Force instructions.
   5.7.2. Contracting Requirements. ASC/ENV includes safety requirements in facilities contracts
   and leases to establish contractor responsibilities for complying with appropriate safety standards and
   the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA).
   5.7.3. Occupational Safety and Health Requirements. All capital projects must meet OSHA stan-
   dards.
16                                                                       AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005


        5.7.3.1. The burden of complying with OSHA is the contractor's. The government does not mod-
        ify government-furnished personal property to meet OSHA standards.
        5.7.3.2. ASC/ENV, through the FPCO, may negotiate with the contractor to replace the govern-
        ment property with contractor property or authorize modification of the government property at
        the contractor's expense. ASC/ENV may only authorize such modifications for properties that
        support major programs.
        5.7.3.3. If OSHA compliance requires modification of government-owned real property, ASC/
        ENV determines whether it's essential to continue to use the property. If so, either the government
        or the contractor corrects the deficiency, following the approval procedures in this instruction.
     5.7.4. Fire Protection:
        5.7.4.1. ASC/ENV sets the requirement for a fire protection program following the National Fire
        Protection Association Standards and AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Pro-
        tection Program.
        5.7.4.2. ASC/ENV oversees and approves the contractor-designed program.
        5.7.4.3. The contractor designs the program to protect the facilities, personnel, and contents from
        fire and related hazards.
        5.7.4.4. Under the terms of the contract or lease, the contractor sets up an in-house fire department
        for a GOCO not protected by a full-time fire department or having a fire department with more
        than 4.5 minutes response time. (Under some contracts, contractors must set up in-house fire
        departments regardless of their distance from the nearest fire department.)

                                  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

6.1. Funding Sources:
   6.1.1. ASC/ENV primarily uses:
      6.1.1.1. PE 78011F (Industrial Preparedness).
      6.1.1.2. PE 78054F (Pollution Prevention).
      6.1.1.3. PE 78008F (Environmental Restoration Account [ERA]).
      6.1.1.4. System Program Offices (SPO) budget and fund weapon system-specific requirements
      with both production and RDT&E funds.
   6.1.2. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) provides funds as needed.
   6.1.3. ASC/ENV coordinates with SPOs to fund facilities' needs that impact production.
   6.1.4. ASC/ENV may use lease revenues to fund projects.
   6.1.5. Projects funded with proceeds from the sale of other GOCO plants must be approved by SAF/
   AQRE regardless of cost.

                                               Chapter 7

                                            DISPOSITION

7.1. General:
   7.1.1. ASC/ENV:
       7.1.1.1. ASC/ENV disposes of real property using AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property as a
       guide. The divestiture process encompasses intragovernmental transfers, leasing arrangements, or
       property declared unneeded.
       7.1.1.2. ASC/ENV must not let a contractor use facilities identified for disposal for new contracts.
   7.1.2. The Contractor:
       7.1.2.1. The contractor must continue normal maintenance and may conduct rearrangements.
       7.1.2.2. The contractor may install removable equipment that the contractor owns.
   7.1.3. HQ AFMC/A7C. After disposing of real property, HQ AFMC/A7C prepares special orders
   using Section 2 through 6 of AFI 32-9005 as a guide to record actual disposal and adjust the industrial
   real property record.

7.2. Public Sale. To dispose of Air Force-owned property through public sale, ASC/ENV declares that
the Air Force does not need the property and screens the property by determining any requirements within
the DoD before reporting it to the GSA for disposition.
   7.2.1. Real Property.
   7.2.2. ASC/ENV:
       7.2.2.1. ASC/ENV declares that real property is unneeded, using AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real
       Property as a guide, the Format for Declaring Property Excess to Ownership or Need (Require-
       ments)(Attachment 3), and AF Form 813 which addresses environmental considerations affect-
       ing divestiture.
       7.2.2.2. ASC/ENV sends two copies of each to SAF/AQRE.
   7.2.3. SAF/AQRE:
       7.2.3.1. After receiving the declaration, SAF/AQRE continues the disposal action using AFI
       32-9004 as a guide.
       7.2.3.2. SAF/AQRE works with other military departments, with each defense agency, and the US
       Coast Guard to see if they can use the property.
       7.2.3.3. If no one needs the facility, SAF/AQRE writes a disposal report and notifies the House
       and Senate Armed Services Committees.
       7.2.3.4. The GSA, through the Corps of Engineers, is the Air Force's disposal agent. If the Con-
       gress does not object, SAF/AQRE asks the ASC/EN to report the property to the GSA for screen-
       ing and disposition.
       7.2.3.5. SAF/AQRE has final approval authority for all projects funded using the proceeds from
       the sale of any Air Force-owned, industrial facility.
22                                                                       AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005


     7.2.4. Personal Property. After ASC/ENV determines that personal property is unneeded, they
     begin plant clearance procedures following FAR 45 and DFARS 245 disposal procedures.

7.3. Negotiated Sale. ASC/ENV tries to sell facilities that the Air Force needs to use but does not need to
own.
     7.3.1. Real Property:
        7.3.1.1. The incumbent contractor must first offer in writing to buy the property.
        7.3.1.2. After ASC/ENV receives the offer, they declare the property excess following Attach-
        ment 3, and send two copies through HQ AFMC/A7C to SAF/AQRE.
        7.3.1.3. Screening a negotiated sale is unnecessary.
        7.3.1.4. The procedure for reporting property to the GSA is the same as for public sale.
     7.3.2. Personal Property:
        7.3.2.1. The incumbent contractor must first offer in writing to buy the property.
        7.3.2.2. After ASC/ENV receives this offer, they write a letter (Attachment 6) to the regional
        GSA Administrator, asking GSA to negotiate with the contractor.
        7.3.2.3. ASC/ENV sends two copies of the package through HQ AFMC/A7C to SAF/AQRE.
        7.3.2.4. If any of the personal property becomes unneeded during negotiations, ASC/ENV
        removes it from the sales package and begins plant clearance according to FAR 45 and DFARS
        245.
     7.3.3. Real and Personal Property. ASC/ENV may authorize negotiated sales mixing real and per-
     sonal property. However, if personal property becomes unneeded during negotiations, they remove the
     property from the sales package and begin plant clearance according to FAR 45 and DFARS 245.

7.4. Transfer of Real Property. The Air Force transfers real property three ways: within the Air Force
(intra-Air Force), within DoD (interdepartmental), or to other government agencies.
     7.4.1. Intra-Air Force. To transfer real property from the industrial property account to the military
     property account, ASC/ENV sends a declaration of excess to industrial need and a DD Form 1354,
     Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property, to HQ AFMC/A7C for approval.
     7.4.2. Interdepartmental. To transfer property from the Air Force to other DoD segments, ASC/
     ENV prepares and sends a declaration of excess to SAF/AQRE.
        7.4.2.1. If the real property value is over the amount identified in 10 U.S.C. 2662 (a), the acquir-
        ing service must notify Congress and wait the number of days specified in 10 U.S.C. 2662 (a)(3)
        before proceeding.
        7.4.2.2. Following procedures outlined in the United Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-900-02 dated 1
        Sept 2003, Criteria for Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property.
     7.4.3. Other Government Agencies. To transfer excess real property to a government agency out-
     side the DoD, ASC/ENV reports the unneeded property using Attachment 3. Paragraph 7.2.
     describes the procedures.
AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005                                                                                  23


7.5. Deteriorated Real Property. The CAO uses AF Form 139, Industrial Facility Disposal (Attach-
ment 4) to document demolition of deteriorated government-owned real property. The CAO begins by
sending five copies of AF Form 139 through ASC/ENV and HQ AFMC/A7C to SAF/AQRE for approval.
Upon completion of disposal, the property administrator completes block 10 of AF Form 139 and returns
two copies through channels to HQ AFMC/A7C for final distribution.(RCS: SAF-MII[A]7115 applies.)

7.6. Transfer of Equipment to Nonprofit Educational or Research Institutes. Air Force activities
may transfer title to equipment it provided to nonprofit educational or research institutes under a facilities
contract.
   7.6.1. Air Force activities may transfer title to equipment directly to the contractor if the facilities
   contract includes enabling provisions such as FAR clauses 45.302-7, 52.245-12, or 52.245-15 and if
   research funds initially bought the equipment.
   7.6.2. If the facilities contract contains no enabling provisions, FAR 45.302-3 lets Air Force activities
   still transfer title to equipment to a nonprofit educational research institute.
   7.6.3. Air Force activities must not transfer equipment to nonprofit educational or research institutes
   unless research funds paid for the equipment. The equipment must remain accountable under a facili-
   ties contract or lease. The Air Force declares the equipment excess and disposes of it according to
   FAR 45 and DFARS 245.
24                                                                   AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005

all pertinent terms. Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated
Terms, May 1, 1988, and AFM 11-1, Air Force Glossary of Standardized Terms, contain standard terms
and definitions for Department of Defense and Air Force use.
Capability—The ability to carry out a specified course of action.
Capacity—The quantity of "output" which a specified facility can produce in a specified period of time.
NOTE: Usually a facility's output is based on two 8-hour shifts 5 days per week.
Capitalize—To charge an expense to a capital or fixed asset account to amortize cost. This is the opposite
of expensing an item.

Capital-Type Rehabilitation (CTR)—Major repair or replacement of government-owned property that
exceeds normal maintenance needs.
Construction—Erecting, installing, assembling buildings or structures; adding, expanding, extending,
altering, converting, or replacing existing buildings or structures. Construction includes equipment and
utilities installed and made part of real property and related site preparation, excavation, and other land
improvements. Excludes installation and relocation of moveable property and minor modifications made
while installing or relocating removable property).
Emergency Capital-Type Rehabilitation (ECTR)—Urgently required repair of government-owned
real or personal property damaged by unexpectedly by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane,
lightning, flood, equipment breakdown, or malfunction and other perils. It also refers to repairing real
property when verified life, health, environmental or safety threats exist and to cases which adversely
impact scheduled system production lead-time.
Expansion—Adding personal or real property that creates a new industrial plant or augments the
capability or capacity of an existing one.
Facilities Base—Industrial facilities that support approved acquisition programs including privately and
government owned facilities for tests, production, and maintenance. Excluded are personal property and
variable resources like material and labor.
Facilities Contract—A facilities contract provides a contractor or subcontractor government facilities to
use while fulfilling contracts for supplies or services (FAR 45.301). There are three types of facilities
contracts: acquisition, use, and consolidated (a combination of the two).

Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended, authorizes.
These acts differ from the Military Assistance Program and the International Military Education and
Training Program because the recipient pays for weapons and services. FMS are only those sales to a
foreign government that the US State Department sponsors. However, defense contractors' direct sales to
foreign governments are not FMS but rather commercial sales.
Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) Facility—An industrial facility the government
owns but a defense contractor operates. See definition for industrial facilities.

Subject: Negotiated Sale of Government-Owned Facilities, XXX Corporation, Facilities Contract
       #FXXXXX-XX-XXXX
   1. The Air Force received an offer from XXX Corporation, P.O. Box 123, Arkansas KS, 67000 to
      purchase by negotiation government-owned facilities that the contractor uses. The offer is for two
      pieces of Industrial Plant Equipment (IPE) with an acquisition value of $XXX,XXX. These two
      pieces of equipment are the only government-owned property at this plant.
   2. We reviewed the proposal and believe that negotiating a sale to the contractor would be in the
      government's best interests. Here are our comments on the proposed sale:
       a. This equipment is mixed with equipment XXX Corporation owns and removing either of
          these large pieces of equipment would disrupt the contractor facility severely.
       b. Removing the equipment would cause production delays and increase Air Force costs.
          Because of the lead-time for buying such equipment, costs will increase while the contractor
          takes time to replace these items.
       c. The government gains nothing by retaining ownership.
       d. The equipment is over 25 years old. Its tooling is obsolete. The cost of any major rehabilita-
          tion would be prohibitive because parts are not available and would have to be manufactured.
   3. Therefore, we recommend that GSA proceed with the proposed sale. Please incorporate the fol-
      lowing restrictions into the Bill of Sale:
       a. The contractor will preserve the existing capability for producing weapons for the government
          for 5 years after conveying title to the contractor.
       b. The contractor will preserve the facilities' capability to meet defense production requirements
          during that period.
   4. Please find out if the sale can be accomplished with the imposed restrictions and provide a copy
      of the Bill of Sale after the sale consummated.

                            CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PROCEDURES
NOTE: ASC/ENV follows these procedures to ensure consistent and timely execution of government
funded projects. The procedures apply to all projects funded by appropriations or qualifying as offsets
against lease revenues. These projects require engineering evaluation and approval and have a project
number.

A7.1. Project Classification. During the annual Fin Plan review, the ASC/ENV supervising engineer
reviews individual projects' scope and assigns project numbers. All projects, including environmental
compliance projects, fall into three categories: major, minor, or other. A project's category depends on the
complexity of its design work effort.
     A7.1.1. Major Project. Major projects are complex and are accomplished in four phases as
     described in A7.2. -A7.5.
     A7.1.2. Minor Projects. Minor projects are usually completed in three phases but sometimes in two,
     skipping the second phase.
     A7.1.3. Other Projects. These technically simple projects need minimal oversight. Contractors sub-
     mit only a Statement of Work (SOW) and a completed DD Form 1354.
     A7.1.4. Environmental Compliance (MPC 7000) Projects. The environmental compliance engi-
     neer assigns a 10 digit number for A106 reporting. The annual budget call letter gives contractors
     detailed instructions.

A7.2. First Phase--Statement of Work:
     A7.2.1. Contractors prepare and send SOWs to ASC/ENV for approval.
     A7.2.2. After approval the contractor selects an independent A&E firm to prepare design documents
     and supervise construction. Contractors select A&E firms for their professional merit.
     A7.2.3. ASC/ENV may waive the requirement to select an independent A&E firm and authorize
     in-house project design.
     A7.2.4. Contractors must send requests for waivers and justification with the SOW to ASC/ENV.
     A7.2.5. Contractors negotiate a reasonable fee within statutory limits:
        A7.2.5.1. A&E Fees. By statute, these must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated project cost,
        excluding A&E fees, for producing and delivering designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.
        A&E Services refers to this statutory limit as A&E Services Title 1B.
        A7.2.5.2. Other Fees. The statutory limit does not apply to the cost of technical field investiga-
        tions and surveys, essential subsurface exploration, and similar fact-finding surveys and investiga-
        tions essential to proper design. A&E Services refers to these fees as Title 1A.
        A7.2.5.3. Construction Management Fees. The statutory limit does not apply to A&E supervi-
        sion and inspection services or other A&E services during construction. A&E Services refers to
        these fees as Title 2.

A7.3. Second Phase--Preliminary Design Documents. Documents consist of design analysis, cost esti-
mates, drawings, and outline specifications. Prepare preliminary drawings on 28- by 40-inch sheets out-
lining specifications, cost estimates, and design analysis of project work. Preparing the drawings and
specifications eliminates as much as possible, requirement to use specific manufacturers' furnishings and
products. Preliminary drawings and outline specifications cover these construction features:
   A7.3.1. Plot plan and orientation of construction site.
   A7.3.2. General building configuration and dimensions (plans and elevations).
   A7.3.3. Soil conditions and bearing values.
   A7.3.4. Foundations (isolated, spread, combined, continuous, mat or raft, pile, other).
   A7.3.5. Superstructure type (wood, steel, prefab, or specified others), floor, roof and decking type.
   A7.3.6. Type and extent of electrical installations (primary supply and secondary distribution) and
   other utilities and services.
   A7.3.7. Construction schedule and estimated construction cost with detailed line-item breakdown for
   land, property, improvements, structures, mechanical and electrical building installations, and others.
   A7.3.8. Type and extent of site preparation, and mechanical and non-mechanical building installa-
   tions.
   A7.3.9. Design analysis describing the facility, design assumptions, design factors used, life cycle
   cost analysis when applicable, types and characteristics of materials, and any contractor's options. The
   contractor sends the analysis with the project identification and number to ASC/ENV for technical
   review and approval.

A7.4. Third Phase--Final Design Documents. Final design documents are like approved preliminary
design documents but give greater detail.
   A7.4.1. For environmental projects, the contractor includes documentation that shows project coordi-
   nation with the appropriate Environmental Protection Agency as AFPD 32-70 requires.
   A7.4.2. The contractor sends two copies of the detailed final design document to ASC/ENV for
   review and approval. Leave enough space on each reproducible drawing and the cover sheet for these
   following signature blocks:
   PREPARED BY: (Representative for firm doing A&E work)
   RECOMMENDED BY: (Representative for contractor operating Air Force plant)
   APPROVED BY: (Air Force supervising engineer)
   A7.4.3. ASC/ENV keeps one signed copy and returns the other to the contractor through established
   channels.
   A7.4.4. After approval, the contractor may award a contract and begin construction. A bid tabulation
   must accompany all early construction progress reports.

A7.5. Fourth Phase--Construction. Follow these procedures in the construction phase:
   A7.5.1. The operating contractor manages approved construction projects.
40                                                                        AFI63-609 18 JANUARY 2005


     A7.5.2. The CAO monitors the contractor's work, performing periodic technical inspections to pro-
     tect the government's interest. If needed, the CAO asks the supervising engineer for technical assis-
     tance.
     A7.5.3. ASC/ENVP approves construction changes that materially affect previously approved con-
     struction documents. Otherwise, the CAO may approve construction changes. ASC/ENVP reviews
     and approves change orders.
        A7.5.3.1. ASC/ENVK issues a modification to the facilities contract or lease.
     A7.5.4. The GOCO operator must submit construction progress reports and a final acceptance report:
        A7.5.4.1. Initial Report. Includes a bidders list, their bid prices, bid start date, bid opening date,
        contract award date, award amount, and scheduled completion date. If the low bidder did not
        receive the contract, explain why.
        A7.5.4.2. Periodic Progress Reports. Include a time line showing scheduled versus actual per-
        cent completed. List all construction changes and for approved change orders describe the
        changes, their cost, the reason for the changes, and any slip in schedule the change caused. Include
        the status of funds for the project, funds committed to subcontractors, reserves needed to complete
        the project, and all GOCO operator costs to date.
        A7.5.4.3. Final Acceptance Report. The GOCO operator sends a final acceptance report for
        projects using DD Form 1354. The GOCO plant operator must sign the DD Form 1354 prior to
        submitting to ASC/ENV. The supervising engineer approves and accepts the project for the Air
        Force.
