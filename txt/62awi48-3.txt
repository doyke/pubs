    mitted through EMIS. All requests will be accompanied by Technical Orders and other documentation
    to justify a purchase. If applicable, manufacturer/product specific MSDSs will also be provided.
62AWI48-3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                                   3


   These documents will be scanned into electronic format for review by the Hazardous Materials Man-
   agement Process Team (HMMPT). If requesters do not have access to a scanner, the documents can be
   scanned at 62 CES/CEV, Environmental Management Flight, Bldg 174, x2-3913.
   4.3. EMIS will route electronic authorization requests to each agency in the HMMPT. Requests are
   certified by the supervisor, 62 CES/CEV, 62 MDOS/SGOAB, and 62 AW/SEG, Ground Safety, for
   review and approval.
   4.4. The HAZMART is not authorized to purchase or distribute a product until the request has been
   approved by each agency.
   4.5. Local purchases of hazardous materials are prohibited without prior authorization. Requesters
   will submit a local purchase request form to the HAZMART. The HAZMART will assign an authori-
   zation # to the purchase request. After these steps are completed, the procedures stated in paragraphs
   1.4.2 and 4.3. will be followed.
   4.6. Supervisors will maintain AF Forms 3952 for all approved hazardous materials, in Tab J of the
   HAZCOM Program binder. Electionic copies are acceptable. If a 3952 has not been reviewed by the
   appropriate agencies, it is not an authorized product even if it is listed on the Authorized User Listing
   (AUL).
   4.7. The requirements in this section do not apply to “consumer products” as long as they are used in
   accordance with AFI 90-821, Paragraph 2.2.9. These products can be ordered without requesting a
   chemical authorization. A list of exempt products can be found on L:/Hazmat Management/Blan-
   ket-Exempt Lists.

5. Container Labeling Requirements and Procedures.
   5.1. McChord AFB will follow all labeling procedures and guidance provided in AFI 90-821, Section
   2.6.
   5.2. DD Form 2521, Hazardous Chemical Warning Label (8-1/2” X 11”), or DD Form 2252, Hazard-
   ous Chemical Warning Label (4” X 6”) will be used to label the following: (1) Existing Stocks of unla-
   beled materials, (2) Hazardous materials manufactured within the Air Force, (3) Bulk materials
   transferred into other containers, (4) Hazardous material containers with defaced or lost labels.
   5.3. Consult BE if a 4” X 6” is too large for the container or if DD Form 2521, or DD Form 2252 are
   unavailable.

6. Training Requirements and Procedures.
   6.1. Supervisor HAZCOM Training. Work Area/Shop Supervisors and their designated HAZCOM
   program designees/trainers must receive Supervisor HAZCOM training before training other person-
   nel. Training is conducted online at www.free-training.com and must be documented on AF Form 55
   or CAMS. Contact 62 MDOS/SGOAM, Public Health (PH) at 2-3717 for questions concerning
   HAZCOM training.
   6.2. Initial HAZCOM Training. Initial HAZCOM training will be conducted according to AFI
   90-821, Section 2.7. Supervisors are required to complete and use the Workplace Written HAZCOM
   Plan template (Attachment 1) to train their personnel. This template is available as a Word document
   on Sharepoint (62 AW/62 MDG/62 MDOS/Bio Environment/Documents/HAZCOM trng). Supervi-
   sors are encouraged to supplement this template with additional health or safety information they feel

    would be beneficial for their personnel. Training will be documented on the AF Form 55, Employee
    Safety and Health Record or CAMS as “Initial HAZCOM”
    6.3. Supplemental HAZCOM Training. Supervisors will conduct supplemental HAZCOM training
    according to AFI 90-821, Para 2.7.2.2. However, at a minimum, supervisors will brief personnel on
    the HAZCOM program annually, and document it as “Supplemental HAZCOM”.

7. Chemical Inventory Requirements.
    7.1. Each work center will maintain two modified versions of the AF-EMIS report, Chemical Autho-
    rization With Cage Data (CACD) for its hazardous material inventory. The first CACD report is for
    items “approved”, and the second is for items “approved w/ conditions”. See Attachment 3 for
    instructions on how to generate the two versions of this report from EMIS.
    7.2. The CACD reports must be kept current with the physical chemical inventory on hand, and will
    be maintained in Tab J of the MSDS binder.

8. Non-Routine Tasks. The work area supervisor will list non-routine tasks performed in the work area
that involve hazardous materials. Personnel will be informed about hazards of non-routine tasks accord-
ing to AFI 90-821, Section 2.9. Also refer to Para 1.2.5. of this instruction.

             WORKPLACE WRITTEN HAZCOM PLAN AND TRAINING PLAN X
Organization _________________________ Bldg #______ Date________________

A2.1. Purpose. This shop specific HAZCOM written plan is a tool for supervisory personnel. Upon
completion of this training, personnel must have either AF Form 55 or CAMS updated.

A2.2. HAZCOM Program Binder. The HAZCOM program binder contains all the regulations and doc-
uments pertaining to HAZCOM. This is what it looks like. It is kept _____________________(Loca-
tion)________________________________________________. Make sure the binder is arranged
according to Paragraph 1.2. of this instruction. Ensure personnel know what the HAZCOM program
binder is, and where they can find it. Review the items kept in each tab, and explain their purpose.

A2.3. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
    A2.3.1. Review AFI 90-821, Section 2.5.
    A2.3.2. MSDSs for ________(Shop Name) ____ are located in Tab J of the MSDS binder,
    located____________________(State the location)________________________.
    A2.3.3. An MSDS contains nine major sections. The sections are divided as follows: Material Identi-
    fication, Ingredients and Hazards, Physical Data, Fire and Explosion Data, Reactivity Data, Health
    Hazard Data, Spill and Disposal Methods, Special Protection Information and Comments Section. All
    companies follow this standard format. Review an example MSDS as you go over sections 4.3.1
    through 4.3.9.
       A2.3.3.1. Section I contains the material identification and general information like company
       name, address, material name with synonyms and an emergency phone number.
       A2.3.3.2. Section II lists all hazardous ingredients in the chemical mixture. Many chemical mate-
       rials are mixtures. Not only does this section list the ingredients, but also states the percentages of
       each ingredient found in the total mixture. For example, acetic acid may contain two ingredients,
       water and acetic acid, where water makes up 72% of the mixture and 28% is acetic acid. This
       accounts for 100% of the mixture (72 + 28). Knowing percentages is helpful when an air sample
       is accomplished to determine the airborne concentration of the hazard.
       A2.3.3.3. Section III contains physical data. Physical data is characterized by appearance, odor, a
       boiling point, freezing point, vapor pressure, solubility and specific gravity. The important data in
       this section are vapor pressure and boiling point. For instance, methylene chloride has a boiling
       point of 39C (102F) and has a high vapor pressure. Because of these physical properties, an
       employee should be aware that this material must be stored in a cool, vented and flame free envi-
       ronment.
       A2.3.3.4. Section IV provides data on fire and explosion information such as what type of fire
       extinguishing media to use and whether or not any toxic vapors are released during a fire. If so, it
       states the personal protective measures fire fighters should use. It is important that this section be
       reviewed prior to using the chemical.
62AWI48-3 15 MARCH 2007                                                                                   7


      A2.3.3.5. Section V provides reactivity data. This section simply describes “what can be stored
      with what”. An example is storing acids with bases. You would not want to store sodium hydrox-
      ide (lye) in the same cabinet with sulfuric acid (battery acid), if one of those containers broke, it
      would react vigorously, neutralize your chemicals and produce hydrogen gas. It could produce a
      dangerous situation.
      A2.3.3.6. Section VI contains health hazard information, emergency and first aid procedures. The
      data found in this section describe the route of entry (e.g. skin, eyes, respiratory) and the target
      organs or systems (e.g. liver, lungs, and central nervous system) and first aid procedures.
      A2.3.3.7. Section VII provides information on the proper disposal of the material. This section
      tells you how to neutralize a chemical spill, how to dispose of the material and who to contact if a
      spill occurs.
      A2.3.3.8. Section VIII provides important information on specific personal protective equipment
      such as respiratory protection, rubber boots, or eye goggles. It also provides information on the
      necessity for engineering controls such as a ventilation system.
      A2.3.3.9. Section IX is used for any additional comments the manufacturer deems necessary for
      the user. The key is educating the user on the product to prevent injury or illness.

A2.5. Hazardous Material Inventory. A current copy of the shop hazardous material inventory is main-
tained in Tab J of the MSDS binder. Our hazardous materials are stored in
 ____________________________(Storage location)_____________________________________. All
hazardous materials located in our storage area must be accounted for on the hazardous material inven-
tory. If an item is not accounted for, we are out of compliance. Unauthorized items are not to be used or
stored in this area. If you encounter any problems, please report it to your supervisor so it can be fixed.
Review AFI 90-821, Para 2.8. Review the Hazardous Material Inventory (CACD reports), and show how
to read it.

A2.6. Labeling Requirements.
     A2.6.1. Review AFI 90-821, Paragraph 2.6.
     A2.6.2. The warning label is often your first source of information about chemical hazards. The name
     and identity on the label can be used to find the right MSDS, where you will find additional informa-
     tion.
     A2.6.3. We are out of compliance if we have any unlabeled hazardous materials in our storage area.
     Please report any discrepancies to supervision so a DD Form 2521 or 2522, Hazardous Chemical
     Warning Label, can be properly filled out and placed on the container.

A2.7. Hazard Determination.
     A2.7.1. Our MSDSs provide information on physical hazards and health risks associated with the
     products we use and signs/symptoms of overexposure. In addition, Bioenvironmental Engineering’s
     (BE) occupational health reports break down chemical exposure hazards associated with specific
     tasks and operations we perform. These reports will be reviewed during the hazard reduction portion
     of this training.
     A2.7.2. We are required to brief you on the methods we use to detect the presence or release of a haz-
     ardous material in the work area. Choose one of the paragraphs below (whichever applies):
        A2.7.2.1. In our section, we do not have or need equipment to monitor a chemical release. We fol-
        low BE’s recommendations to prevent overexposures. If someone uses one of our chemicals and
        begins to behave strangely, they will be removed to a fresh air environment. BE will be contacted.
        They will determine if monitoring is necessary, and act accordingly. In the event of a major
        release, the area will be evacuated; BE and the Fire Department will be contacted for assistance.
        A2.7.2.2. In our section, we have the following equipment available to monitor the release of the
        following hazardous materials. Either state or create a chart listing the types of equipment you
        have and the chemicals each piece of equipment is used to monitor. We follow applicable Techni-
        cal Orders and BE recommendations to prevent overexposures. If someone using one of our chem-

      icals begins to behave strangely, they will be removed to a fresh air environment, and BE will be
      contacted to perform an evaluation. They will determine if specialized monitoring is necessary,
      and act accordingly. In the event of a major release, the area will be evacuated and BE and the Fire
      Department will be contacted for assistance.

A2.8. Overview of Hazard Control Measures.
   A2.8.1. Work area personnel will reduce or prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals by using appro-
   priate personal protective equipment (PPE) and being familiar with the signs and symptoms of expo-
   sure to the materials they are working with. Three basic methods for controlling chemical hazards are
   engineering controls, personal protective equipment and administrative controls.
   A2.8.2. The following are source prevention and Engineering controls which can be used to reduce
   potential exposures.
      A2.8.2.1. Substitution – Subsituting a chemical, process, or piece of equipment with one that is
      less hazardous. For example, you could replace a paint containing a cancer causing agent with one
      that doesn’t have it. Also, maybe a process using a hazardous material can be eliminated or modi-
      fied to better suit the mission.
      A2.8.2.2. Isolation – Use an enclosure, barrier, or safe distance to separate workers from the expo-
      sure hazard. Common examples of this are machine enclosures, enclosed control rooms, and
      splash-guards.
      A2.8.2.3. General Ventilation – A ventilation system which mixes fresh air with airborne chemi-
      cal vapors to reduce exposure levels. This type system should only be used when hazards have low
      toxicity and mix readily with air. Some examples of general ventilation are fans and vents.
      A2.8.2.4. Local exhaust ventilation – A ventilation system which captures airborne chemical
      vapors, particulates, and dusts at the source, and transports them out of the work area and breath-
      ing zone of the employee.
   A2.8.3. Personal protective equipment (PPE) - is the least desirable method for preventing chemical
   exposures, but is also the most common method used. Some examples of PPE include gloves, aprons,
   eye and face protection and respirators. To protect you, the PPE must be matched to the specific haz-
   ard. For example, there are hundreds of different kinds of gloves available to prevent hand contact
   with chemicals. These gloves are made of different kinds of natural & synthetic rubbers, each with its
   own protective properties and weaknesses. For instance, nitrile rubber gloves may provide 100% pro-
   tection against a particular chemical, but butyl rubber gloves may only 20% effective against the same
   material. Make sure you follow recommendations provided by BE. They follow specific procedures to
   determine what PPE is adequate. Finally, PPE is useless unless you wear it and perform routine checks
   of its structural integrity.
   A2.8.4. Administrative controls include documentation, information and training in safe work prac-
   tices, and good housekeeping. This applies to personnel and equipment. The HAZCOM Program is an
   effective administrative control to ensure workers are informed on the work area hazards.

A2.9. Chemical Exposure Reduction.
   A2.9.1. BE performs routine occupational health assessments of our work area. During these assess-
   ments, they determine chemical exposure hazards associated with the specific tasks and operations we
12                                                                           62AWI48-3 15 MARCH 2007


     perform, and address engineering, PPE, and administrative controls to reduce the risk of exposure to
     personnel. BE reports are filed in Tab F of the HAZCOM Program binder located
     _______________State the Location ______________________.
     A2.9.2. This shop will follow all of BE’s recommendations in order to reduce or prevent chemical
     exposures to the maximum extent possible. Review the Certified Occupational Health Personal Pro-
     tective Equipment Listings from BE’s previous three Occupational Health Assessments, and provide
     copies to personnel.

A2.10. Spill Procedures.
     A2.10.1. In our work area, we use Do / Do Not (circle appropriate word) use large quantities of haz-
     ardous materials. Spills are cleaned up on the spot by following the hazardous material spill cleanup
     procedures which are reviewed prior to working with any chemical. Review spill procedures and iden-
     tify location of spill kits.
     A2.10.2. An emergency eyewash is available in __________State the location(s)__________ for
     accidental eye contact. A shower is available in ____________State the location___________
     ____________________. Immediately after flushing the exposed area for 15 minutes, involved per-
     sonnel will be taken to the MAMC Emergency Room for further evaluation.
     A2.10.3. Additionally, work area personnel receive in-service training on hazardous material spill
     response. If, at any time, there is a spill beyond our capabilities, work area personnel will evacuate the
     building and call the Fire Department for assistance.
