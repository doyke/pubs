                                            Chapter 1

                                  MISSION PREPARATION

1.1. Overview. The objectives of every sortie in undergraduate flying training (UFT) are to
achieve proficiency in flying maneuvers, maximize situational awareness, increase decision
making skills, and successfully apply task management skills. Preparation for any training
mission should be based on these objectives. The overall mission objective should give the “big
picture” of what needs to happen to accomplish a successful sortie. More specific objectives
should be used to determine success in relation to the syllabus, course training standards,
continuation training requirements, etc. A valid objective is realistic, achievable, and measurable.
1.2. Mission Briefing and Debriefing
   1.2.1. General Rules of Engagement (ROE). During briefings and debriefings, the briefer is
   in charge and should be the only one speaking until he or she asks for inputs. Any questions
   or comments should be saved until requested by the briefer. Generally, no food or drink is
   allowed during briefings without the approval of the briefer.
   1.2.2. Briefing. The aircraft commander (AC) or flight lead must ensure the mission is
   thoroughly briefed. As a minimum, use the briefing guides in appropriate AFI 11-series
   publications, and include discussions on formal special interest items (SIIs). Other
   members of the flight or formation should be prepared for the brief and assist the AC or
   flight lead as directed. The brief should focus on successfully accomplishing all the
   objectives.
       1.2.2.1. Standard Mission Elements. Mission elements may be briefed as “standard”
       provided they are published, and the proficiency level of all flight members would allow
       them to be briefed as such.
       1.2.2.2. Expectations. On student training sorties, the student is expected to obtain
       relevant notices to airmen (NOTAMs), weather, airfield status, threat of the day,
       emergency procedure of the day, etc., and have a lineup card prepared. On nonstudent
       training sorties, the briefer will assign these responsibilities. Before the brief, all
       crewmembers should ensure all go/no-go items are accomplished and life support
       equipment is available and inspected for flight.
   1.2.3. Debriefing. The main goal of the debrief is to determine if mission objectives were
   achieved and to what level. Before the debrief, the student (or designated crew member)
   should post the objectives and cue the tape to the G-exercise (or as directed by the debriefer).
   If T-38 Mission Debrief System is used, it should be loaded and prepared as directed by the
   debriefer.
       1.2.3.1. The debriefer should curtail time spent on administrative items based on the
       experience or proficiency level of the flight members, and avoid an item-by-item
       description of every event that occurred. Instead, the debriefer should cover what went
       right and what went wrong, with emphasis on the root cause of relevant errors and how to
       improve on subsequent missions. The debriefer should relate everything back to the
       mission objectives.

     1.2.3.2. For student sorties, the instructor pilot (IP) will identify areas of emphasis for the
     next sortie, and provide focused instruction on them in this sortie’s debrief. The IP should
     summarize at the end with emphasis on the major learning points and considerations for
     future missions.
  1.2.4. Formation Debrief. The flight lead should focus on formation-specific items, leaving
  single-ship execution for individual aircraft debriefs. The amount of debrief allotted to the
  entire flight is also affected by the skill level of the flight members, the presence of solos in
  the flight, and the potential benefit to the entire flight of the items being discussed.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      15


                                            Chapter 2

                                   GROUND OPERATIONS

2.1. Objectives. The objectives of ground operations are to safely and correctly prepare the
aircraft for flight and return the aircraft to parking after flight.
2.2. Checklist Discipline. Ensure completion of all items in accordance with (IAW) the
applicable flight crew checklist. However, aircrew need not reference the checklist to complete
each individual item. You may accomplish a few items and then refer to the checklist to ensure
completion of all items. The pilot at the controls should initiate all checks and ensure the
asterisked items are accomplished. Challenge and response will be used to accomplish
asterisked items during student training.
2.3. AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, Review and Walk
Around. Ensure the AFTO IMTs 781 are complete, correct, and the aircraft is airworthy.
Perform a walk around IAW the flight crew checklist. If any doubt exists as to the condition,
setting, or operation of any system, consult a qualified maintenance representative.
2.4. Ground Visual Signals. Keep hands clear any time someone is under the aircraft. The
crew chief is your safety observer. Monitor the crew chief’s signals closely for safety actions. All
visual signals will be IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground.
2.5. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. To reduce the risk of FOD during ground
operations, do not place objects on the cockpit glareshields during engine start or while the
engines are running unless the canopies are down and locked. In addition, do not allow
personnel to climb on the aircraft with either engine operating, and do not hand objects over the
cockpit side unless the engine on that side is shut down and has stopped rotating. Loose items in
the cockpit also pose a hazard to the multi- function display (MFD), up front control panel
(UFCP), and electronic engine display (EED) glass. Crews must exercise caution to ensure items,
especially the helmet and oxygen hose, do not strike these components.
2.6. Taxi Operations.
   2.6.1. Clear in all directions before advancing the throttles. Keep the use of power to a
   minimum. Normally, a power setting less than 80 percent revolutions per minute (rpm)
   should be enough to taxi. Check the nosewheel steering and brakes as you taxi out of the
   parking spot.
   2.6.2. In congested areas, reduce throttles to idle while turning to avoid jet blast damage to
   ground equipment, aircraft, and personnel. Check the flight instruments in the turn onto the
   taxiway or ramp, not the marshaling turn out of the chocks. Aircrews should taxi at a
   moderate speed, normally not greater than 25 knots groundspeed (GS) (available on the MFD
   while taxiing). As a technique, taxi no faster than the reported runway condition reading
   (RCR). Stagger only in authorized areas. Slow down and taxi on the centerline in congested
   areas.
   2.6.3. Use the brakes sparingly to prevent wear and overheating. When using the brakes,
   ensure the throttles are in idle. Adjust taxi speeds during high or gusty wind conditions to
   prevent exceeding the 50-knot canopy limit. When opening the canopy in high or gusty
   winds, hold the canopy frame to prevent rapid fly-up.
 16                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   2.6.4. When taxiing closely behind aircraft with engines running, lower the canopies to
   prevent exhaust windblast effects. Do not taxi within 10 feet of any obstacle. Do not taxi
   within 25 feet of an obstacle without a wing walker. For additional procedural guidance,
   refer to AFI 11-218, AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3, and the flight manual.
2.7. Instrument Cockpit Checks. Before flight, accomplish a thorough instrument cockpit
check according to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures. Checking the
following items will satisfy all requirements:
   2.7.1. Navigation Publications. Ensure all publications required for your departure, en
   route, destination and alternate are current.
   2.7.2. Pitot Heat. Check for proper operation, including the heating of the total air
   temperature probe and angle of attack (AOA) transducer vane.
   2.7.3. Clock. Check for correct time of day.
   2.7.4. Vertical Velocity. All should indicate zero.
   2.7.5. Attitude System. Set the standby attitude indicator at 3 degrees nose-low. The EADI
   should indicate 3 degrees nose low if the aircraft is on level ground. If the climb/dive marker
   (CDM) is selected, the horizon line is displayed in the center of the EADI coincident with the
   waterline symbol when the aircraft is on level ground.
   2.7.6. Heading System. Ensure the electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI) is
   within 8 degrees of the magnetic compass and within 5 degrees of a known heading.
   Check for correct indicator movement in turns.
   2.7.7. Airspeed Indicators. Check for proper indications on the HUD, MFD, and standby
   indicators.
   2.7.8. Altimeters. The maximum error of each altimeter at a known elevation point is 75
   feet.
   2.7.9. Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) (EGI) Area Navigation (RNAV)
   Check. Prior to conducting RNAV operations, verify the currency of the International
   Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) database, the aircraft’s present position (PP)
   during alignment, the GPS is providing civil (C) code data; blended “EGI” solution, and
   verify the EGI accuracy.
      2.7.9.1. EGI Accuracy. RNAV enroute navigation operations may be conducted
      with the EGI operating in the INS only solution provided a full gyrocompass
      alignment has been completed IAW T.O. 1T-38C-1, and the predicted accuracy of the
      INS is 7 (greater than 500 up to 1,000 meters) or less.
   2.7.10. Flight Director System and Instrument Landing System (ILS) Check:
      2.7.10.1. Tune and identify an appropriate ILS frequency, set the final approach
      course, select ILS as PNS. Absence of a CDI, a vertical deviation indicator, or pitch and
      bank steering indicates either a lack of data or a system failure. Glideslope raw data and
      pitch steering may not be present until proximity to the glideslope transmitter is resolved.
   2.7.11. TACAN/VOR/DME Checks: (Note: CDI displays will be checked with either
   TACAN or VOR as the PNS.)
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     17


      2.7.11.1. TACAN, VOR, and DME Channels. Tune and identify appropriate TACAN,
      VOR, and DME channels. Verify the MFD NAV data block displays the correct
      channels. The NAV data block will indicate the TACAN station identifier, if available.
      With valid signals, check that the range data block contains valid data and the primary
      flight reference provides a CDI for both TACAN and VOR as the PNS.
      2.7.11.2. Bearing Pointers. Ensure the bearing pointers point toward the stations.
      2.7.11.3. CDI Requirements. Center the CDI and check for proper CDI displacement.
      One technique is to change the course by 5 degrees and verify the CDI deflects one dot.
      2.7.11.4. TO-FROM Indicator. Check the TO-FROM indicator. Change the selected
      course past 90 degrees from the centered CDI course and check that the TO-FROM
      indicator switches sides.
      2.7.11.5. NAVAID Ground Checkpoint Checks. At designated ground check points, the
      allowable bearing pointer and CDI error is ± 4 degrees from the depicted course to the
      station. The allowable DME error is ½ nautical miles (nm) or 3 percent of the distance to
      the facility, whichever is greater. (Note: When a designated ground checkpoint is not
      available, the VOR and TACAN are both considered reliable for instrument flight if the
      systems check within ± 4 degrees of each other against collocated VOR and TACAN
      stations.)
   2.7.12. Side Slip Symbol. Check to ensure that the side slip symbol (trapezoid shape
   located below the bank arrow on the HUD and the MFD EADI) indicates properly in
   turns.
2.8. End of Runway (EOR):
   2.8.1. Check the FCP speed brake switch to ensure it is centered and up.
   2.8.2. Review takeoff procedures as well as how you might handle serious emergency
   procedures during and immediately after takeoff. Review your go/no-go criteria. A common
   technique is to set the go/no- go speed as the green speed and single-engine takeoff speed
   (SETOS) as the yellow speed. Another common technique is to set Guard (243.00) in the
   backup ultra high frequency (UHF) radio as the UHF backup frequency in case of MDP
   failure during a time critical emergency.
   2.8.3. When inspecting the flight control surfaces during the before-takeoff checks, there are
   two separate tasks. The first task is to visually confirm free and proper movement of the
   flight control surfaces. Apply smooth and controlled stick movements while confirming the
   direction and deflection of each flight control surface. Failure to be smooth and controlled
   could place undue strain on the aileron control mechanisms. The second task is to check for
   rudder and aileron neutrality. With the stick and rudder pedals in the neutral position,
   check that all surfaces are approximately flush with the surface of the wing and the
   vertical stabilizer. It is crucial that this final surfaces check occurs as close as possible to
   takeoff. The final check of aileron and rudder neutrality should occur no earlier than
   arriving at the EOR/hold short area and no later than taking the active runway. Check
   other aircraft for leaks, loose panels, proper configuration, streamers, FOD, etc. If able,
   make sure their stabilator is properly trimmed for takeoff by inspecting the alignment
   marks. Alert the aircrew if anything looks abnormal.
 18                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   2.8.4. Ensure the videotape recorder (VTR) tape or VDTS card has been titled, as required,
   and that the appropriate display is being recorded via the VTR key display IAW mission
   requirements. Title the VTR/VDTS to include callsign, tail number, name(s), date, and
   mission.
2.9. Taking the Active Runway.
   2.9.1. Once cleared for takeoff, confirm the approach and departure ends of the runway are
   clear of aircraft.
   2.9.2. Ensure the canopy is down and locked prior to engine run-up.
   2.9.3. Note your takeoff time and taxi into a takeoff position that allows maximum use of the
   runway. Release the nosewheel steering button during the last few degrees of turn onto the
   runway and ensure the nosewheel is centered by allowing the aircraft to roll forward once
   it is aligned with the runway. Momentarily displace the rudder pedals to ensure the
   nosewheel is disengaged.
   2.9.4. Confirm your heading system is within tolerances.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     19


                                           Chapter 3

                          TAKEOFF, CLIMB, AND LEVEL-OFF

3.1. Introduction. This phase of flight is very dynamic and can be as complicated as any other
part of the mission. Complex departure procedures may be required immediately after takeoff in
the low altitude environment, and communications can be very busy leaving the terminal area.
Emergency situations, when they occur in this phase of flight, require forethought, and quick
correct action. Solid preparation is essential to success.
3.2. Takeoff:
   3.2.1. Description. Two takeoff options exist: static and rolling. The static takeoff is used
   early in training because it provides more time to accomplish required checks and
   verify proper engine operation. A static takeoff is also required at night and for solo
   students. A rolling takeoff aids traffic flow in a busy pattern and is a smooth transition from
   taxi to takeoff roll. Rolling takeoffs may increase takeoff distance 150 to 300 feet.
   3.2.2. Static Takeoff. Disengage the nosewheel steering. Remind the other crew member
   to guard the brakes. (When guarding the brakes, do not exert pedal pressure but be in a
   position to immediately assume control.) Exert as much pedal pressure as necessary to
   prevent creeping during the engine run-up. Look outside the aircraft and advance the engines
   to military (MIL) power. Your primary concern is to ensure the aircraft is not creeping
   forward or pulling to one side. If the brakes fail to hold at MIL power, reduce power and
   attempt to build sufficient hydraulic pressure by pumping the brakes. If the second attempt to
   keep the aircraft from rolling fails, consider aborting the aircraft. Once the lineup checks are
   complete, release the brakes, select maximum power (MAX), confirm afterburner operation,
   and confirm exhaust gas temperature (EGT) readings stabilize within limits.
   3.2.3. Rolling Takeoff. Ensure all lineup checks prior to engine run-up are complete, and
   taxi onto the runway in a normal manner. After attaining proper runway alignment, check the
   heading system, disengage the nosewheel steering, and advance the throttles to MAX.
   Confirm proper engine operation during the takeoff roll.
   3.2.4. Takeoff Roll:
       3.2.4.1. Maintain directional control by tapping the brakes until the rudder becomes
       effective. Once the rudder is effective, drop your heels to the floor. This will ensure you
       do not inadvertently apply the brakes while using the rudder. Check the minimum
       acceleration check speed (MACS) and remain aware of go/no-go speeds.
       3.2.4.2. Depending on aircraft gross weight, pilots should normally initiate backstick
       pressure at approximately 145 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS), and set the bore sight
       cross (F-16 HUD) or waterline (MIL-STD HUD) at 7 degrees nose-high on the pitch
       ladder (Figure 3.1). Nosewheel liftoff should occur at approximately 155 KCAS, and the
       aircraft should fly off the runway at approximately 165 KCAS depending on aircraft
       gross weight. When safely airborne with a positive climb, retract the gear.
 20                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


Figure 3.1. Takeoff Attitude (Front Cockpit).




      3.2.4.3. Following gear retraction, ensure sufficient airspeed exists before retracting
      flaps, then check gear and flap indications to verify they are up.
      3.2.4.4. Whenever significant crosswinds are a factor, use aileron into the wind
      throughout the takeoff roll to prevent an early liftoff of the upwind wing, and use rudder
      to maintain runway alignment. As airspeed increases, crosswind control inputs should
      decrease.
3.3. Climb. Climb IAW local procedures. If practical, use the restricted MIL power climb
schedule to maximize fuel economy.
   3.3.1. Restricted MIL Power Climb:
      3.3.1.1. Begin a smooth power reduction out of MAX power between 220 and 280
      KCAS, and terminate afterburner by 300 KCAS. Accelerate to, and hold, 300 KCAS
      (approximately 12 to 15 degrees nose- high) until passing 10,000 feet mean sea level
      (MSL).
      3.3.1.2. After passing 10,000 feet MSL, accelerate in a shallow climb (approximately
      1,000 to 2,000 feet per minute [fpm]) until reaching cruise indicated mach number (IMN)
      for the altitude assigned (.52 mach + altitude [in thousands]/100). If you reach 400 KCAS
      before the desired cruise IMN, climb at 400 KCAS until reaching cruise IMN. If assigned
      an intermediate level-off, maintain the cruise IMN for the altitude assigned until assigned
      a higher altitude. At that time, accelerate to the higher cruise IMN. Another technique is
      to fly the directed caret airspeed in the Divert Mode function. To use this function select
      Divert Mode under the DST key on the UFCP, select UL-1 (DS), select UL-4 (DVT), and
      then select UL-7 on the MPCD to RNG, this will bring up the caret on the airspeed
      indicator. While in range mode, the airspeed caret uses the military restricted climb
      numbers directly from the T-38C -1 -1 and provides optimum climb airspeeds.
      Example: Climbing to 20,000 ft MSL (.52 Mach + 20) = .72 M Cruise IMN
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                       21


   3.3.2. MAX Power Climb. In full afterburner, an attitude of approximately 20 to 25 degrees
   nose-high will hold 300 KCAS. Passing 10,000 feet MSL, lower the nose and accelerate to
   and maintain .9 IMN.
   3.3.3. Climb Check. You may combine the climb check with the level-off check when cruise
   altitude is at or below flight level (FL) 180. Applicable steps of the climb check can be
   completed prior to 10,000 feet MSL; however, the cabin altitude scheduling should be
   reconfirmed above 10,000 feet MSL.
3.4. Level-Off. The level-off should be a smooth, continuous pitch change to level flight. Avoid
abrupt pitch changes and stair stepping to the desired altitude. Normally, a smooth level-off is
accomplished as follows: when IVV is less than 6,000 fpm, begin the level-off at 10 percent of
the vertical velocity; when IVV is greater than 6,000 fpm, reduce power, lower the nose to cut
the picture in half about 1,000 feet prior in MIL power (or 2,000 feet prior in MAX power), and
then use 10 percent of the vertical velocity.
3.5. Cruise. Attain cruise airspeed, set power, and trim the aircraft for level flight. A technique
for attaining cruise speed at medium/low altitude (<10K MSL) is to set a fuel flow of approx-
imately 1,200 pounds per hour (pph) per engine to maintain 300 KCAS. Another technique is to
use the range (RNG) profile in the emergency divert mode, and fly the commanded calibrated
airspeed (CAS) or IMN. When using this technique, pilots must be aware that the aircraft’s range
mode may command a max range speed which places the aircraft close to the edge of the engine
operating envelope. This is more likely to occur at higher altitudes. Above FL280, a Min Mach
caret (MM) will appear on the airspeed indicator in the MFD. In all cases when flying above
35,000 MSL, pilots should fly a minimum speed of 0.9 mach or higher, as indicated by the
technical order. Outside air temperature can be determined by referencing the data page on the
MFD (select MB1-MB1-ML2 on the MFD). You can also set the flight manual recommended
fuel flows for other altitude and airspeed combinations.
3.6. Abnormal Procedures:
   3.6.1. Overview. It is not the intent of this paragraph to cover every situation a pilot may
   encounter, to replace or supersede procedures in the flight manual, or to replace the use of
   sound judgment. Unusual or complex circumstances will require pilot judgment and systems
   knowledge to alleviate the situation. In an emergency, the supervisor of flying (SOF), tower
   personnel, runway supervisory unit (RSU) personnel, and other controlling agencies can
   assist the pilot. However, if anyone requests information at an inconvenient time, do not
   allow radio communications or other tasks to distract you from the primary responsibility of
   flying the aircraft. Take charge of the situation, and don’t hesitate to direct controllers to
   stand by until you are able to safely provide the requested information. When making radio
   transmissions, be clear, concise, and emphasize exactly what assistance you need. Your
   priorities are to: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate.
   3.6.2. Takeoff Aborts. If there is reason to abort the takeoff, do not hesitate to do so. If the
   pilot not flying sees something hazardous, he or she will inform the pilot that is flying. If the
   AC is not flying during a time-critical situation that requires immediate action, and there is
   no time to relay this to the pilot flying the aircraft, the AC should take control of the aircraft
   and accomplish the appropriate procedures. The priorities for maintaining directional control
   are: rudder, differential braking, and nose wheel steering only as a last resort.

  3.6.3. Wake Turbulence. Anticipate wake turbulence when taking off behind other aircraft
  on the same or parallel runways, especially if the wind is calm or straight down the runway.
  Wake turbulence is formed when an aircraft is creating lift, therefore plan to take off at a
  point prior to the preceding aircraft’s takeoff point or after their point of touchdown.
  3.6.4. Barrier Operations. Procedures for barrier engagement are specified in the flight
  manual. The MA-1, MA-1A, and BAK-15 (61QSII) are the only suitable barriers. If aborting
  on a runway where the BAK-15 barrier is raised only on request, transmit “BARRIER,
  BARRIER, BARRIER” on the appropriate frequency.
  3.6.5. Ejection. If abandoning the aircraft becomes necessary, the AC will use the
  command “BAILOUT, BAILOUT, BAILOUT” as the final directive. If time and conditions
  permit, discuss and accomplish ejection procedures with the other crewmember, using the
  term “ejection” rather than “bailout”. In critical situations, do not delay an ejection waiting
  for the “BAILOUT” command, and do not delay an ejection once the command is given.
  3.6.6. Single Engine Taxi. Do not taxi the T-38 single engine. You may, however, clear an
  active runway if you have downside hydraulics or the landing gear is pinned.
  3.6.7. Transfer of Aircraft Control without Intercom. In all cases, transfer of aircraft
  control should follow procedures found in AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3. Transfer of aircraft
  control can result in disastrous crew confusion if not done in a positive, previously briefed
  manner. When the AC assumes control, the other crewmember will immediately relinquish
  all controls and momentarily show both hands to the AC (use the mirrors as necessary).
  Normally, the AC will maintain control for the remainder of the flight; however, some
  circumstances may necessitate a subsequent transfer of control. In these situations, the AC
  will yaw the aircraft to signal the transfer of aircraft control back to the other crewmember.
  The other crewmember will acknowledge by shaking the stick and looking for the AC to
  show hands clear.
  3.6.8. Transfer of Aircraft Control during Critical Phases of Flight. During critical phases of
  flight, maintaining aircraft control often requires rapid intervention by the AC. The
  possibility exists for both pilots to simultaneously be on the controls until the transfer of
  aircraft control is complete. Pilots assuming aircraft control must be aware there are other
  control inputs that can affect the aircraft’s performance but are not readily apparent. For
  example, a pilot assuming aircraft control to abort a takeoff may not be aware that the other
  pilot has mistakenly depressed the nosewheel steering button. If there is an overlap in aircraft
  control while the nosewheel steering button is depressed and the throttles are then retarded
  out of afterburner, the aircraft could enter an unrecoverable skid.

                           TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND LANDINGS

4.1. Introduction. High volume traffic patterns require diligent visual lookout and a
complete knowledge of traffic pattern procedures. For all patterns, the runway is the primary
reference. The flight manual describes the basic procedures for flying the T-38 in the traffic
pattern and landing environment. From the flight manual procedures, a variety of techniques can
be used to safely and effectively land the aircraft. The remainder of this section outlines the
techniques most commonly used and taught in the UFT and pilot instructor training (PIT)
environment.
4.2. Judgment in the Traffic Pattern. Your judgment in determining whether an approach is
safe must take into account airspeed; aircraft buffet; AOA indications; aural, HUD, and MFD
stall warnings; and sink rate. When used together, these indicators can warn you of an
approaching stall. Heavy buffet or a high AOA indication in the traffic pattern may indicate one
or more of the following conditions: an incorrect configuration, a miscalculated or poorly flown
airspeed, too much backstick pressure, or an AOA or airspeed system malfunction. Low airspeed
or high AOA may require a go-around. Also, erratic pitch changes can cause momentary flashing
of the indexer lights.
Note: More T-38 fatalities have occurred because of improperly flown final turns than for
any other reason. If stall indications or an excessive sink rate occur in the traffic pattern,
immediately execute a stall recovery. Do not attempt to maintain the traffic pattern ground
track because the altitude needed for recovery may significantly increase.
4.3. Wind Analysis. Adjust all traffic patterns to compensate for known wind conditions. Use
all available wind information to attain adequate downwind displacement during and after the
break or pulling closed. Accurate pattern winds can be obtained on the MFD, and surface winds
can be obtained from the controlling agency. Compensate for winds on inside downwind by
crabbing into the wind to maintain the desired ground track to the perch. As a technique,
reference the ground track (GT) indexer to establish the correct crab. With a strong headwind on
initial, you should delay the break and begin the final turn earlier than for no-wind conditions.
The opposite is true for significant tailwinds on initial. Move your perch point into the wind.
4.4. Normal Straight-In. Normally, slow to approximately 240 knots or less on base or
approximately 10 to 15 miles from touchdown on an extended straight-in. Local procedures or
traffic deconfliction may require adjustments. Avoid slowing to less than final turn airspeed for
the current flap setting until established on final. Prior to intercepting the glidepath, establish the
landing configuration and trim while allowing the airspeed to gradually decrease to the
computed final approach airspeed (approximately .6 AOA). Strive to be configured at
final approach speed upon intercepting the glidepath. From this point, follow procedures
outlined in “Normal Final Approach/Landing” this section.
4.5. Normal Overhead:
   4.5.1. Normal Break. The end result of the break should be a properly spaced downwind
   with an established drift correction while maintaining traffic pattern altitude. Unless the
   controller directs otherwise, initiate the break between the approach end and 3,000 feet
   down the runway. Do not go into the break until 45 degrees off from another aircraft to
24                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


  ensure 3,000-foot spacing, and abeam another aircraft to ensure 6,000-foot spacing. Ideally,
  adjust the breakpoint for winds, and vary the bank angle or back pressure during the break to
  rollout on the desired ground track. Maintain level flight during the break. As a guide, the
  pitot boom and flightpath marker will be on the horizon during the break turn. A MIL power
  break turn with AOA and G to reduce airspeed will result in tighter displacement than a
  reduced power break turn. One technique is to leave the throttles where they are on initial
  and use AOA and G to reduce airspeed (no wind). Slow to below 240 KCAS, but no less
  than final turn airspeed by rollout.
  4.5.2. Normal Closed Pattern. With clearance for the closed pattern, begin the pull-up
  with a minimum of 240 KCAS. Normally, power will be in MIL, although a closed pull-up
  from a go-around may require less power. Execute a climbing 180-degree turn, maintaining
  a minimum of 200 KCAS until wings-level on downwind. Consider winds (overshooting or
  undershooting), and establish the proper crab on rollout. Visually clear for traffic in the break
  and for other aircraft on downwind.
  4.5.3. Normal Inside Downwind. Getting from the break or closed downwind to the perch
  incorporates pitch, trim, and configuration changes. Check runway displacement when
  rolling out on inside downwind using the runway as a primary reference and adjust spacing if
  needed. The normal no-wind spacing is approximately 1 to 1.3 miles for a 1,500 feet AGL
  traffic pattern (Figure 4.1). As a guide, crab into the wind with twice as much crab as you
  used on initial. One technique is to have the runway heading set in the CDI course to provide
  quick heading reference since the canopy rail slopes and can present an illusion. Another
  technique is referencing the GT caret to maintain the appropriate crab. If the EOR can be
  selected as the steerpoint, EGI can be used to check runway displacement when abeam the
  EOR. Compute and verify final turn and final approach airspeeds, and strive to configure no
  later than abeam the touchdown point. Monitor airspeed during flap extension to prevent
  flap overspeed when lowering full flaps. Prior to beginning the final turn, ensure the
  landing gear is down and locked and the flaps have traveled a sufficient amount to ensure
  no asymmetry exists (approximately 60 percent). Maintain a minimum of final turn
  airspeed.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    25


Figure 4.1. No-Wind Runway Displacement (1,500 feet AGL traffic pattern).




   4.5.4. Final Turn. The goal of a final turn is to arrive over the desired rollout point, on the
   extended runway centerline, with appropriate heading, altitude, and airspeed. Normally, the
   rollout point is 300 to 375 feet AGL at 1 to 1.3 nm from the threshold. Begin the final turn
   when abeam the no-wind rollout point, adjusted for winds. To adjust for winds, move the
   perch point into the wind. Other reference techniques include: when aligned with the overrun
   chevron closest to the runway or when reaching approximately a 45-degree angle from the
   threshold (no wind, assuming1NM downwind spacing). A preceding T-38 should be two-
   thirds of the way around the final turn to ensure 3,000-foot landing spacing or abeam for
   6,000-foot landing spacing.
      4.5.4.1. Flying the final turn.
          4.5.4.1.1. Confirm configuration and enter approximately a 45-degree banked turn
          with a shallow rate of descent and blend in back pressure to establish an on-speed
          AOA. Adjust power, bank, back pressure, and trim to hold final turn airspeed and fly
          over your rollout point, on altitude, and crabbed into the wind, if necessary.
          Maintain approximately .6 AOA throughout the final turn and on final, and do not
          allow the airspeed to decrease below final turn airspeed until initiating the rollout
          onto final.
          4.5.4.1.2. A visual reference for pitch in the final turn is two-thirds ground and one-
          third sky in the front windscreen with the angled portion of the glareshield roughly
          parallel to the horizon. Also, the top corner of the HUD should be approximately on
          the horizon (Figure 4.2). For a 1500ft pattern, the flightpath marker (FPM) will be
          approximately 6 to 7 degrees nose-low in the HUD/EADI. Whether using the HUD
          or visual references, the runway remains the primary reference and must be cross-
          checked in the attempt to intercept a 3-degree glidepath.
          4.5.4.1.3. During the early part of the final turn, make a gear-down call. The vertical
          velocity will eventually indicate approximately 2,000 fpm rate of descent for a
 26                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


           1,500ft AGL traffic pattern. Halfway around the final turn, check altitude; you should
           lose about half the altitude between traffic pattern altitude and rollout altitude with
           approximately half of your lateral downwind displacement remaining. As a technique,
           consider the final turn made when <30deg of stabilized bank is required, < 0.6 AOA
           required, and within 30deg of alignment to the landing runway, power may be
           reduced to begin slowing to final approach speed corresponding to the amount of
           bank needed to complete the turn.

Figure 4.2. Normal Final Turn.




       4.5.4.2. Rolling Out on Final. Rolling out on final, crab into the wind as necessary, and
       raise the nose of the aircraft to capture the glidepath based on your desired aimpoint as
       you slow down. Once established on final and on airspeed, the vertical velocity should be
       approximately 700 to 900 fpm.
4.6. Normal Final Approach and Landing. On final approach, the goal is to maintain the
desired glidepath, aimpoint, and final approach speed until transitioning to a flare and landing.
   4.6.1. Glidepath. Use the runway and surrounding environment as the primary
   reference for establishing a 2.5 to 3-degree glidepath. Once the proper aimpoint is set, the
   HUD pitch scale should indicate 2.5 to 3 degrees nose-low with the FPM on the aimpoint.
   Trim off stick pressures to aid in glidepath control. Corrections to glidepath are made by
   increasing or decreasing the current pitch until the desired glidepath is regained. If you need
   to correct for a steep glidepath, aim slightly shorter until re-intercepting a 2.5 to 3-degree
   glidepath. If you need to correct for a shallow glidepath (being “drug- in”), aim slightly
   longer until re-intercepting a 2.5 to 3-degree glidepath. In either case, do not allow an
   excessive descent or sink rate to develop.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      27


   4.6.2. HUD OFF Aimpoint (Full Flap). For a normal final approach, the aimpoint will be
   approximately in the top of the HUD combining glass (the lower piece of glass in the HUD).
   One technique is to note the FPM position in the HUD; when the HUD is off, use this point.
   This will not be a fixed point in the HUD, rather an approximation which varies based on
   winds, glidepath corrections, etc. The point in the windscreen that appears stationary (it just
   grows bigger as you approach it) is your true aimpoint. This aimpoint needs to be
   maintained (assuming on glidepath) until reaching the transition point. When using the
   HUD, the FPM will help you visualize the aimpoint (Figure 4.3).

Figure 4.3. Landing Picture (HUD ON and HUD OFF 3 Degree Glidepath).




   4.6.3. Airspeed. Ideally, the aircraft should be flown at the computed final approach speed
   and .6 AOA. With gusty winds, increase the final approach and landing speed by one-half
   the gust factor IAW the flight manual. Approximately 90 percent rpm will maintain on-
   speed indications on a normal glidepath with gear and full flaps. When making adjustments
   to glidepath, a power adjustment may also be required. If there appears to be a calibration
   discrepancy between the airspeed and AOA indications, take all factors (such as aircraft feel)
   into account to determine the appropriate speed to fly. Flying a higher speed than required is
   far safer than attempting to fly on speed with suspect indicators.
4.7. General Approach and Landing Information. The basics for landing the T-38 involve
flying down the glidepath at final approach speed to a desired aimpoint. As the aircraft
approaches the aimpoint, the pilot reduces power and transitions the aircraft to level flight, where
the aircraft is flared down to touchdown airspeed in ground effect (Figure 4.4).
 28                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


Figure 4.4. Final Approach.




   4.7.1. Glidepath.
      4.7.1.1. The desired glidepath is 2.5 to 3 degrees with an aimpoint at the threshold. A 3-
      degree glidepath positions the aircraft 300 feet AGL at 1 nautical mile (nm) from the
      threshold.
      4.7.1.2. The desired touchdown point may be altered in cases where prudence would
      dictate a slightly longer aimpoint, such as in runways where there are hazards in the
      overrun environment, no overrun, or raised lights at the threshold. Generally, an aimpoint
      100 to 200 feet past the threshold (around the top of the numbers on an instrument
      runway) is sufficient to provide a margin of safety and still ensure adequate runway
      remaining for landing rollout.
   4.7.2. Transition. The transition phase is where the pilot transitions from maintaining
   glidepath, aimpoint, and airspeed to level flight in preparation for the flare. The transition
   involves both a power reduction and a pitch change. Gross weight, airspeed, winds, height
   above the runway, descent rate, and AOA affect the timing of the power reduction and the
   rate of pitch change. As the aircraft completes the transition, it must be positioned at the
   correct altitude, pitch, and airspeed to flare. A properly trimmed aircraft will require less
   backstick forces on final, which will make the transition much easier.
      4.7.2.1. One transition technique is to maintain final approach airspeed until
      approximately half way through the overrun. At this point, the power should be reduced
      one-half throttle knob width and the aimpoint initially shifted to 100 to 200 feet beyond
      the threshold. Power should be reduced to idle before crossing the threshold.
      4.7.2.2. Another technique is to begin a smooth, gradual power reduction by “latching
      the throttles” to the threshold so that power is pulled at the same rate the threshold is
      approaching. Using this technique, the aimpoint is initially shifted the same as above.
      4.7.2.3. For a landing 150 to 1,000 feet down the runway, the aircraft should cross the
      runway threshold approximately 5 to 10 feet off the ground and 5 to 10 knots below final
      approach speed. As the aircraft approaches the desired height above the runway, raise
      your eyes to the other end of the runway and increase backstick pressure to smoothly
      arrest the descent. The aimpoint will continue to shift down the runway. Shifting your
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      29


     eyes helps pick up peripheral cues to judge and cancel out descent at the right height. It
     will also help you maintain directional control, especially during crosswinds.
     4.7.2.4. If the glidepath is steeper than normal, a greater pitch change will be required to
     arrest the descent. With a larger pitch change, the pilot must delay the power reduction
     until a normal transition line is established.
     4.7.2.5. If you are coming in from below a normal glidepath, power should be held until
     a normal transition line is established (at which point the rules of thumb listed above
     apply). If buffet is felt during the transition, delay the power reduction or consider adding
     power as required to avoid stall indications.
     4.7.2.6. Premature touchdowns can result from insufficient backstick pressure in the
     transition, early or rapid power reduction causing a sink rate, or an incorrect perception of
     aircraft height and descent rate. If an excessive sink develops, execute a stall recovery.
     With a strong headwind or gusty crosswinds, use caution when reducing power to idle.
     4.7.2.7. Long, fast touchdowns can result from a delayed or slow power reduction.
     4.7.2.8. Sinking flares, firm touchdowns, or hard landings can result from excessive
     height at the end of the transition. Excess height results when the transition is started too
     high (shifting the aimpoint early); back pressure is applied too rapidly (shifting the
     aimpoint too fast); airspeed is carried too long; or height is not judged correctly.
  4.7.3. Flare and Landing. The flare is where the aircraft remains in level flight and dissipates
  kinetic energy to slow to touchdown speed. Since power is reduced to idle during the
  transition, remaining in level flight involves a pitch change as the airspeed decreases. Ideally,
  the aircraft reaches touchdown speed in the landing attitude as the main gear smoothly
  touches the runway (fully flared) approximately 150 to 1,000 feet down the runway. Landing
  deviations can result from conditions established in the transition or from flare execution.
     4.7.3.1. A low height at the end of the transition or insufficient back pressure to maintain
     level flight during the flare causes premature (early or short) touchdowns.
     4.7.3.2. Excessive back pressure during the flare, with sufficient airspeed, causes the
     aircraft to balloon. If this happens, consider if a go-around is required. Otherwise,
     momentarily relax back pressure, reestablish the correct height, and continue the flare to
     landing.
  4.7.4. Heavy Weight Landing. Although the speed reduction from final approach speed to
  landing speed is the same for the lightweight and heavyweight landing (approximately
  25 knots), the heavyweight aircraft will tend to bleed off airspeed faster when the pilot
  reduces power. Therefore, the power reduction will need to be slower (or later) to prevent
  slow airspeed, a sink rate from developing, or landing short. If the pilot is not certain that the
  sink rate has been adequately reduced, the power reduction will have to be delayed, and a
  longer and (or) faster touchdown will result. This may indicate that a go-around for stopping
  distance is required.
  4.7.5. Landing on Alternate Sides of the Runway. When traffic permits, land in the center of
  the runway. However, during a busy traffic pattern or when using reduced runway
  separation, plan the final approach and landing using alternate sides of the runway, keeping
  the aircraft toward the center. When landing on alternate sides of the runway, position the
 30                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   runway centerline between the main landing gear and wingtip opposite the side of the runway
   you are landing on. For example, on the right side of the runway land with the centerline
   between left main landing gear and left wingtip. Don’t allow the aircraft to drift across the
   runway centerline. We refer to the two sides of the runway as hot side (the side of the
   runway opposite the turnoff taxiways) and the cold side (the side of the runway adjacent to
   turnoff taxiways).
   4.7.6. Approach Lighting Systems. Approach lighting systems, including visual approach
   slope indicator (VASI) and precision approach path indicator (PAPI) systems, can help
   establish a safe glidepath. For normal contact approaches where the aimpoint is the runway
   threshold, these systems are good for reference 3 to 4 miles out, but will show below
   glidepath indications inside approximately 1 mile.
      4.7.6.1. Standard VASI and PAPI. The standard VASI and PAPI have a 2½- to 3-degree
      glideslope and a glidepath intercept point (aimpoint) approximately 750 feet beyond the
      runway threshold. The glidepath is normally coincidental with the ILS or precision
      approach radar (PAR) glideslope. When flying the standard VASI or PAPI glidepath
      down to the flare, expect to land up to 2,000 feet down the runway. This is normally not
      desired during a normal contact approach where you want to land 150 to1,000 feet down
      the runway.
      4.7.6.2. Other Approach Lighting Systems. Some Air Force bases use the Pulsating
      Visual Approach Slope Indicator (PVASI) and most naval air stations use the Fresnel
      Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS). Refer to Flight Information Publications (FLIP)
      for complete guidance on these systems.
4.8. Full Stop Landing and Aerobrake
   4.8.1. Ensure the throttles are in idle. On a full-stop landing after touchdown, smoothly
   increase back pressure to attain approximately a 10 to 12-degree pitch attitude for an
   aerobrake. A technique is to place the bore sight cross slightly above the 10-degree nose-high
   reference line. Just prior to the loss of stabilator authority, lower the nosewheel to the
   runway. Aerobrake as appropriate for gross weight (e.g., with 1,000 pounds of fuel
   remaining, the maximum attitude of 12 degrees can be achieved at about 130 KCAS). Do not
   aerobrake abruptly—a lightweight T-38 can leap dangerously into the air.
   4.8.2. Smoothly fly the nose to the runway approaching 100 KCAS. Heavyweight aircraft
   stopping characteristics are different than lightweight characteristics. The aerobrake can
   begin at a faster calibrated airspeed, and the nose will settle to the runway sooner following
   the aerobrake. Because the touchdown airspeed is higher, the stopping distance is longer and
   the wheel brakes will initially feel less effective. After lowering the nosewheel to the runway,
   keep the stick full aft to increase weight on the main gear and use cautious wheel braking to
   prevent possible skidding.
   4.8.3. Calculated normal landing distance is computed by adding 2,500 plus the fuel from
   the touchdown point. For example with 1,200 lbs (2,500 + 1,200) + 500 ft touchdown point =
   4,200 ft runway required.
4.9. Rollout and Wheel Braking.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     31


   4.9.1. During a landing roll, apply aileron into the wind, and maintain directional control
   with the rudder. After lowering the nosewheel, check for brake system pressure by gently
   pressing the brake pedals. To prevent possible directional control problems, make sure both
   pedals are applied with equal pressure in one smooth brake application. Do not pump the
   brakes unless a single application provides insufficient pressure.
   4.9.2. Use steady braking to reduce to taxi speed. Keep the stick full aft throughout the
   landing roll to maximize aerodynamic deceleration. Maintain directional control with the
   rudder and differential braking until you reach taxi speed, then use nosewheel steering. When
   routinely operating from very long runways, practice the braking technique required to stop
   on shorter runways.
   4.9.3. When landing in the center of the runway or on the hot side, plan to cross to the cold
   side with speed under control and sufficient distance down the runway to prevent a conflict
   with other traffic. If turning off the runway prior to the end, clear for aircraft behind you on
   the runway before crossing to the cold side. Comply with local procedures.
4.10. Touch and Go Landing.
   4.10.1. At touchdown, advance power to MIL (or MAX, if required) and smoothly lower the
   nose slightly below takeoff attitude to just prior to the nosewheel touching the runway. Do
   not release backstick pressure abruptly. Check the engine instruments, and accelerate to
   takeoff airspeed.
   4.10.2. When reaching takeoff speed (approximately final approach speed), establish the
   takeoff attitude, and allow the aircraft to fly off the runway. Then follow initial takeoff
   procedures. High gross weights, high temperatures, high-pressure altitudes, full flaps, etc.,
   may adversely affect acceleration. Consider selecting afterburner under these conditions.
   Another technique is to retract the flaps to 60 percent until reaching 200 KCAS to avoid
   losing altitude as the flaps are retracted beyond 60 percent.
4.11. Crosswind Landing:
   4.11.1. Final Approach. Counteract the drift by crabbing into the wind. Maintain the crab
   until touchdown. The aircraft will reduce the crab angle when both main tires are on the
   ground. When the crosswind component exceeds 15 knots, plan to touch down on the
   upwind side of the runway.
   4.11.2. Full-Stop Landing:
      4.11.2.1. When the crosswind component exceeds 15 knots, maintain the landing
      attitude and do not aerobrake. Maintaining the landing attitude requires additional
      backstick pressure as airspeed decreases. Increasing backstick pressure too rapidly may
      result in the aircraft becoming airborne or drifting across the runway.
      4.11.2.2. Tire damage is highly probable if you allow the aircraft to drift across the
      runway by not applying aileron into the wind. Maintain directional control with the
      rudder. Applying aileron into the wind will aid in directional control, help prevent
      compression of the downwind strut, and prevent the upwind wing from becoming
      airborne.
      4.11.2.3. Just prior to the loss of stabilator authority, lower the nosewheel to the runway
      and apply aileron into the wind. Do not lower the nose prematurely with a crosswind.
 32                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


      Insufficient crosswind controls may result in compression of the downwind strut and poor
      directional control and, when combined with weathervaning, can result in damage to the
      downwind tire.
      4.11.2.4. Applying these techniques during crosswind landings may increase the landing
      distance by approximately 50 percent. Expect to be farther down the runway when you
      lower the nose, with less runway remaining to stop the aircraft.
4.12. No-Flap Patterns and Landings:
   4.12.1. No-Flap Straight-In. Practice a no-flap straight-in to prepare for an actual emergency
   that requires a no-flap landing. The basic procedures for flying the approach are the same as
   the normal straight-in.
   4.12.2. No-Flap Overhead. The reason we do no-flap overhead patterns is to maximize no-
   flap landing training. For an actual emergency requiring a no-flap landing, a straight-in
   approach should be flown. Due to the increased final turn airspeed and resulting increased
   turn radius, the no-flap pattern requires a wider downwind displacement. The no-flap no-
   wind spacing is approximately 1.5 miles for a 1,500 feet AGL traffic pattern (Figure 4.5).

Figure 4.5. No-Flap Runway Displacement (1,500 feet AGL traffic pattern).




      4.12.2.1. Flying the No-Flap Final Turn. The desired rollout point for a no-flap final turn
      is the same as for a normal overhead. Realize you’re wider on a no-flap; therefore, if you
      use the same visual reference (in relation to the runway) to begin the turn as on a normal
      pattern, you will be too long at the perch. Confirm configuration and enter
      approximately a 45-degree banked turn. Let the nose of the aircraft fall very slightly, and
      smoothly add back pressure to establish an on-speed AOA. The visual reference for a no-
      flap final turn is approximately half ground and half sky with the angled portion of the
      glareshield roughly parallel to the horizon (Figure 4.6). The horizon should
      approximately touch the top corner of the combining glass. In a 1500ft pattern, the FPM
      will be approximately 4 to 6 degrees nose-low in the HUD; however, the aircraft pitch
      attitude will be higher than what you see during the normal final turn. Trim to reduce
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     33


      stick pressure as pitch and airspeed are changed. Maintain approximately .6 AOA
      throughout the final turn and on final, and do not allow the airspeed to decrease below
      final turn airspeed until initiating the rollout onto final.

Figure 4.6. No-Flap Final Turn.




      4.12.2.2. Rolling Out on a No-Flap Final Approach. As you rollout on final, reduce
      power to attain final approach airspeed as soon as practical. Because of the reduced drag
      with flaps up, you will need a larger power reduction to slow at the same rate as an
      aircraft configured with full flaps. Without the flap/slab interconnect, more stick travel in
      pitch is required to arrest the sink rate as the glidepath is captured.
   4.12.3. No-Flap Final Approach and Landing:
      4.12.3.1. For a no-wind, no-flap final, place the desired aimpoint about one-third of the
      way up from the bottom of the front windscreen, or approximately the same height as the
      top of the AOA indexer (Figure 4.7). Trim off backstick pressure, and monitor aimpoint,
      airspeed, and glidepath. The transition and landing phases are the same as a normal
      landing with the exception of pulling the power to idle. Because of the reduced drag
      without flaps, power reduction normally needs to begin 300 to 500 feet sooner than on an
      approach with full flaps. Exercise diligence when reducing power and transitioning to the
      flare to avoid a sink. Without the flap/slab interconnect, more aft stick travel is required
      to achieve the desired pitch change, arrest the sink, and flare.
      4.12.3.2. Due to higher landing speed and less effective aerobraking on a no-flap
      approach and landing, expect landing distances to be approximately twice the landing
      distance of a normal landing at similar fuel weights. Reference the no-flap landing
      checklist in an actual emergency.
      4.12.3.3. Calculated no-flap landing distance is computed by adding 2,500 plus the fuel
      from the touchdown point and multiplying it by two. For example with 1,200 lbs 2 x
      (2,500 + 1,200) + 500 ft touchdown point = 7,900 feet runway required.
      4.12.3.4. When the crosswind component exceeds 15 knots, apply the crosswind landing
      procedures shown in paragraph 4.11. The no-flap crosswind landing distance will be
      longer than most runways.
 34                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013

4.13. Single-Engine Patterns and Landings:
   4.13.1. Single-Engine Pattern. Fly single-engine patterns from a straight-in approach. Set
   the simulated failed engine not less than 60 percent rpm during a simulated single-engine
   approach. Power on the good engine will be approximately 98 percent on glidepath. Use the
   rudder to counteract the yaw induced by asymmetrical thrust (“step on the good engine”).
   Yaw will be greater during low- airspeed, maximum-thrust situations such as a single-engine
   go-around.
   4.13.2. Single-Engine Landing. The single-engine landing is similar to the normal landing
   with the following exceptions: With 60 percent flaps selected, drag is not as great as with full
   flaps, and power must be reduced slightly sooner than a full flap landing under the same
   conditions to touch down in the same location. However, use caution to prevent landing short
   of your desired touchdown point. Ensure both throttles are checked in idle for touchdown.
   When performing an actual or simulated single-engine full-stop landing with 60 percent
   flaps, the landing roll will be approximately 500 feet longer. If heavy weight or if landing
   distance is critical, consider using full flaps when landing is assured according to the flight
   manual.
   4.13.3. Touch-and-Go from a Single-Engine Landing. Use both engines for the takeoff
   following a simulated single-engine touch-and-go landing.
   4.13.4. Go-Around from a Single-Engine Approach. If a go-around is required for any
   reason other than a planned single-engine go-around practice, use both engines. Refer to
   paragraph 4.14 for single-engine go-around practice procedures.
   4.13.5. Single-Engine Safety Considerations. Heavy fuel loads, high outside air
   temperatures, high pressure altitudes, or a combination of these conditions makes single-
   engine approaches more difficult. These conditions may also result in MIL power being
   insufficient to maintain level flight while configured. If these conditions exist, consider
   configuring the aircraft just prior to intercepting the glideslope. Use afterburner if needed to
   maintain final approach speed on final.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                       35


4.14. Practice Single-Engine Go-Around:
   4.14.1. The setup and planned execution should be prebriefed, and may be accomplished
   from either a straight-in or overhead pattern. The aircraft should be stabilized on final at final
   approach airspeed with the simulated inoperative engine set no less than 60 percent rpm.
   4.14.2. If the single-engine go-around is practiced from an overhead pattern, fly the final
   turn portion of the pattern with 60 percent flaps or full flaps, using both engines until rolling
   out on final. Once on final, simulate the engine failure, and then apply the boldface to
   initiate the go-around. Use coordinated rudder to offset the adverse yaw produced by one
   engine in afterburner. Once the simulated single-engine go-around exercise is complete,
   advance the simulated inoperative engine to MIL prior to coming out of afterburner on the
   other engine. If an unsafe situation is developing, do not hesitate to abandon a simulated
   single-engine go exercise and recover the aircraft using both engines.
4.15. Low-Closed Traffic Pattern. Use a low-closed traffic pattern to practice circling
approach procedures. The procedures for a low-closed pull-up are the same as for the normal
closed pull-up except you must adjust the pull-up to attain the published low-closed altitude and
a wider downwind displacement. Be aware of the reduced power and pitch requirements since
the downwind altitude is lower. From the downwind position, fly the practice circling approach
as described in Chapter 7.
4.16. Traffic Pattern Irregularities.
   4.16.1. Excessive Sink Rates:
       4.16.1.1. Excessive sink rates are insidious and potentially deadly in the traffic pattern. If
       allowed to continue, recovery may not be possible due to engine response time, lack of
       excess thrust, and (or) insufficient altitude.
       4.16.1.2. Excessive sink rates are generally not accompanied by approach to stall
       indications. Vertical velocity is the primary indication of excessive sink rate.
       4.16.1.3. In the final turn from a standard 1,500-foot overhead pattern, a vertical velocity
       in excess of twice the pattern altitude is normally an indication of an excessive sink rate
       condition. On short final approach, vertical velocity of approximately 700-900 fpm is
       normal. Anything greater is an indication of excessive sink rate. In most mishaps the sink
       rates developed first, and were followed by a stall during the recovery. Note: Any time
       you encounter an excessive sink rate in the traffic pattern, immediately execute a stall
       recovery. Proper stall/sink rate recovery procedures take priority over maintaining the
       published ground track.
   4.16.2. Stall Indications in the Traffic Pattern:
       4.16.2.1. An actual stalled condition is immediately preceded by heavy, low-frequency
       buffet, and in most cases, moderate wing rock. The actual stall is indicated by a
       combination of a very high sink rate, heavy buffet, and high AOA (above 1.0). Training
       and recovery techniques must concentrate on approach-to-stall characteristics to prevent
       an actual stall.
       4.16.2.2. Individual aircraft performance may differ. The sequence of flight
       characteristics up to and beyond the approach-to-stall indication include:
36                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


         4.16.2.2.1. Light Buffet. The light buffet is defined as the buffet at 0.6 AOA (green
         donut). This is the optimum final turn AOA.
         4.16.2.2.2. Moderate Buffet. Moderate buffet is the buffet from approximately 0.7
         AOA to the definite increase in buffet intensity. (Red chevron above green donut).
         4.16.2.2.3. Definite Increase in Buffet Intensity (DIBI). The definite increase in
         buffet intensity is the point where the buffet increases in amplitude, but the frequency
         becomes slower and irregular. Wing rock may occur. This typically occurs in excess
         of 0.8 AOA.
         4.16.2.2.4. Heavy Buffet. Heavy buffet is the buffet from AOA higher than the
         definite increase in buffet intensity to the point where the stick is at the aft stop.
         4.16.2.2.5. The aural, HUD, and MFD stall warnings (a boxed, blinking, STALL
         warning displayed on the HUD and MFD, and a stall warning tone, when the landing
         gear is extended and the AOA is at or above 0.80).
         4.16.2.2.6. Low-frequency, high-intensity airframe buffet.
         4.16.2.2.7. Glareshield shaking, erratic buffet (no set frequency).
         4.16.2.2.8. Wingtips stall first and may cause a wing to drop.
         4.16.2.2.9. Light wing rock due to alternately stalling wingtips.
  4.16.3. Recovery Procedures for Stall, Approach-to-Stall, or Excessive Sink Rate:
     4.16.3.1. In the traffic pattern, execute the stall/sink recovery any time you encounter
     a definite increase in buffet intensity, aural, HUD, and MFD stall warnings, or
     excessive sink rate. Simultaneously advance both throttles to MAX, relax backstick
     pressure, and roll the wings level. Rudder can be an effective way to initiate the roll to
     wings level; however, use caution to avoid over-controlling. After the wings are level,
     maintain an AOA just below the definite increase in buffet intensity and achieve a
     positive nose track until establishing a climb. Note: Maintaining an AOA just below the
     definite increase in buffet intensity may activate the aural, HUD, and MFD stall
     warnings.
     4.16.3.2. Once a safe climb has been established and obstacle clearance is assured, relax
     backstick pressure to allow the aircraft to accelerate. Avoid heavy buffet or secondary
     stall during the recovery. Since decreasing bank significantly reduces the stall speed, do
     not delay raising the nose after the wings are level. Airspeed can also be used as an
     indication of maximizing performance. In general, excess thrust during recovery should
     be used for establishing a climb versus increasing airspeed. Therefore, airspeed should
     not increase during the recovery, but should remain constant (not decrease).
  4.16.4. Avoiding Stall/Sink Rate Situations. Avoiding situations that can lead to a stall/sink
  rate is the best way to prevent one. Four pilot-controlled variables determine controlled
  patterns—attitude, airspeed, configuration, and power. When one or more of these variables
  is flown incorrectly, pilots tend to allow a sink rate to develop in order to hold the other
  variables in the optimum range. For example, a pattern can appear normal in every respect as
  long as the pilot allows a sink rate to compensate for an improperly set bug speed. Any
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      37


   combination of situations can rapidly deteriorate into a stalled or sink- rate condition without
   exaggerating any single condition. Some of these situations include the following:
      4.16.4.1. Beginning the final turn with an improper configuration.
      4.16.4.2. Beginning the final turn with less than the computed final turn airspeed.
      4.16.4.3. Beginning the final turn with inadequate downwind displacement.
      4.16.4.4. Beginning the final turn with an excessively nose-low attitude.
      4.16.4.5. Flying a stabilized final turn with more than 0.6 AOA or 45 degrees of bank.
      4.16.4.6. Using low power settings.
      4.16.4.7. Making abrupt control movements.
      4.16.4.8. Overbanking to correct an overshooting final turn.
   4.16.5. Rudder Overcontrol. When configured, the T-38's 30 degrees of available rudder is
   highly effective in rolling the aircraft. Although the rudder is not needed to coordinate flight,
   it may be useful during high AOA or asymmetric thrust situations. To prevent over-control,
   use only small rudder inputs as required in the traffic pattern. In no case should you wait
   until you see aircraft response before removing rudder input when the landing gear are
   extended.
   4.16.6. Balloons, Bounces, and High Flares:
      4.16.6.1. Balloons, bounces, and high flares are the result of abrupt control inputs in the
      transition and flare or a misjudgment of the height above runway. They can all result in
      the same dangerous situation—an aircraft above the runway with insufficient airspeed for
      a controlled descent.
      4.16.6.2. In mild cases, they may only result in a firm landing. In extreme cases, they can
      result in a wing rock, wingtip contact with the runway, or departure from the prepared
      surface.
      4.16.6.3. For minor deviations, reestablish the landing attitude and continue with a flare
      and touchdown. You may need to fly the aircraft back to the runway or accept a hard
      landing and (or) bounce while waiting for acceleration. In all cases, use extreme caution
      to avoid approach-to-stall indications or wing rock. Recovery should appear much like a
      landing attitude stall recovery with most of your concentration focused on keeping the
      wings level and flightpath down the runway. For larger or more pronounced
      deviations, immediately perform a go-around. Simultaneously select MIL or MAX
      power and establish a safe pitch attitude.
   4.16.7. Overrotation. An abrupt or excessive application of backstick pressure during a
   takeoff usually causes overrotation. However, during a touch-and-go landing, maintaining
   the landing attitude while increasing the power may also cause overrotation. Overrotation can
   lead to a premature liftoff at a potentially dangerous airspeed. To correct this situation,
   establish the normal takeoff attitude, select MAX if necessary, and allow the aircraft to
   accelerate. It may be necessary to allow the aircraft to settle back to the runway to accelerate
   in a three-point attitude to attain safe flying airspeed and avoid approach to stall indications.
4.17. Go-Around:
 38                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   4.17.1. Go-Around from the Final or Landing Phase. Advance power to MIL (MAX, if
   required), accelerate to a minimum of final approach airspeed, and retract the landing gear
   only after ensuring touchdown will not occur. Ensure sufficient airspeed exists before
   retracting the flaps. Climb, following local procedures for ground track and altitudes. Use
   caution not to overspeed the gear, gear doors, or flaps. If the runway is clear, you do not have
   to offset to the side of the runway.
   4.17.2. Go-Around from the Final Turn:
       4.17.2.1. On a go-around from the final turn, the potential for gear or flap overspeed is
       high. Therefore, cross-check your flight parameters during the go-around. MIL is not
       always required in these situations. To execute a go-around from the final turn, maintain
       a minimum of final turn airspeed, climb or descend as required, and retract the gear and
       flaps only after attaining a safe flying airspeed. If the runway is clear, you do not have to
       offset to the side of the runway. Maintain 240 to 300 KCAS on the go-around.
       4.17.2.2. With the aircraft under control and if time permits, notify the RSU or tower
       when initiating a go-around. Never break out from the final turn; execute a go-around
       instead. Consider lowering flaps to 60 percent when going around from an overshooting,
       no-flap final turn. If a dangerous situation develops, do not attempt to conform to the
       prescribed traffic pattern ground track. Your first priority is to maintain aircraft control.
   4.17.3. Touching Down During a Go-Around. If an airborne go-around is impossible,
   continue to fly the aircraft to touchdown. Do not attempt to hold the aircraft off the runway in
   a nose-high attitude. Instead, maintain the landing attitude and accept a touchdown. Then
   perform a takeoff in the same manner as the takeoff phase of a touch-and-go landing, using
   MAX power if necessary.
4.18. Alternate Gear Extension. Allow extra time for the gear extension when using the
alternate system. After practicing an alternate gear extension, ensure the alternate release
handle is fully stowed. Then reset the landing gear system. Accomplish this by moving the
landing gear handle down, then up, and then back to the down position. When accomplishing
an alternate extension, lower the flaps, as required, before lowering the gear IAW the flight
manual.
4.19. Abnormal Procedures:
   4.19.1. Alternate Gear Extension. Under conditions requiring alternate gear extension, the
   front cockpit pilot must be prepared to lower the landing gear with the alternate gear release
   handle. Without intercom, the rear seat occupant may signal the need to use the alternate gear
   release system by lowering the landing gear handle.
   4.19.2. Airspeed Indicator Malfunction. With a known or suspected airspeed indicator
   malfunction, ensure the pitot heat is on, and establish a known power setting or fuel flow for
   the desired cruise airspeed, and refer to your checklist. If possible, use a chase aircraft for
   recovery. If one is not available, use known power settings and (or) fuel flows in
   combination with the AOA system to approximate desired airspeeds. (A 0.3 AOA equals 230
   + gas; a 0.5 AOA usually indicates a safe gear-lowering speed.) You can use the AOA
   system to safely recover the aircraft because it is independent of the pitot static system.
   Ground speed should still be displayed on the MFD and can be used to approximate airspeed.

  4.19.3. Bird Strike. A bird strike poses a hazard to low-altitude operations, particularly in the
  traffic pattern and on low-level navigation routes. The two most serious forms of damage
  from bird strikes are engine failure and cockpit penetration. In the traffic pattern,
  consideration must be given not to make an aggressive bird avoidance maneuver that may
  lead to a more severe stall or ground impact situation. Due to the critical nature of cockpit
  penetration, thoroughly brief procedures for transfer of aircraft control and reestablishment of
  intercockpit communications.
  4.19.4. Go/No-Go Decisions from a Touch-and-Go Landing. Although TOLD for touch-
  and-go landings is impractical, the following rules of thumb are useful:
     4.19.4.1. Normally, at or near the point of touchdown, both an abort and a takeoff are
     safe options, even with a single-engine failure. The abort is possible because the aircraft
     is lighter than on initial takeoff. Barring a catastrophic, compound problem, the takeoff is
     equally safe. At touchdown, the aircraft is no more than 25 knots below final approach
     speed with most of the runway remaining. In most cases, either option will work,
     provided you stick to your original decision and correctly apply the procedures.
     4.19.4.2. For a no-flap touch-and-go, an abort requires further consideration. By
     regulation, the landing fuel weight will be below 2,500 pounds. According to the flight
     manual, the stopping distance for a no- flap landing is approximately 2 x (2,500 + fuel
     weight). For fuel weights closer to 2,500 pounds, the stopping distance from the actual
     touchdown point could exceed actual runway available. A takeoff decision in this
     scenario should be the safer option.
     4.19.4.3. The go/no-go decision is largely a matter of pilot preference, but the most
     common technique is to consider the throttle position. That is, if the throttles are in idle
     when the problem occurs, leave them there because you are psychologically prepared to
     land. However, if you have advanced the throttles or they have stabilized in MIL power,
     consider continuing the takeoff. In either case, apply the appropriate boldface for the
     selected decision.
     4.19.4.4. As with other emergency situations, you should weigh all factors, including the
     runway remaining, runway condition, configuration, aircraft weight, weather, barrier
     type, and obstacles on departure. In any case, two fundamental questions will serve you
     well: (1) is a safe abort possible? And (2) is a safe takeoff possible? Take the time to
     answer these questions on the ground—before you fly. This discussion highlights why we
     emphasize landing on speed in the desired landing zone—to provide maximum runway
     remaining to stop (or go) during an emergency.
  4.19.5. After-Landing Procedures with an Emergency. If you need assistance from fire
  department or maintenance personnel following an emergency landing, hold the brakes and
  raise both hands. This signals to the ground crew that they are clear to inspect the aircraft.
  Do not actuate switches without visual coordination with the ground crew.

                                            CONTACT

Section 5A—General Methods and Procedures

5.1. Introduction. Contact flying in the T-38 incorporates areas of training in which pilots
learn and practice the basics, including takeoffs, landings, and a wide variety of area work.
Contact training is flown single ship, with an emphasis on using primarily outside, visual
references—the horizon, ground, runway, etc. The basic objective of contact flying in the T-38 is
to build a solid feel for the aircraft’s performance capabilities through a large portion of its flight
envelope, including stalls, aerobatics, advanced handling characteristics, and normal and
emergency traffic patterns.
5.2. Area Orientation. Maintain area orientation using all available means (ground references,
NAVAIDs, or horizontal situation display [HSD]). Ground references should be the primary
reference, when available. There are three methods of using the aircraft instruments—HSD,
center radial, and pie- in-the-sky as follows:
   5.2.1. HSD/SIT Method. The HSD/SIT can depict flying zones based on the data transfer
   system (DTS) load. With the correct area boundaries depicted on the HSD/SIT, turn as
   required to maintain the aircraft symbol within the confines of the depicted flying training
   zone boundaries. Select an HSD/SIT range which allows sufficient detail to determine
   proximity to borders and turn direction. Normally, 15 or 30 nm ranges will be sufficient.
   Momentarily increasing the display scale can prevent confusion when trying to discern
   between training zone boundaries.
   5.2.2. Center Radial. The center radial technique is best used in narrow areas (20 radials
   wide or less). With the center radial dialed in, the center of the area is always towards the
   CDI.
   5.2.3. Pie-in-the-Sky. The pie-in-the-sky technique is best used in wide areas (20 radials
   wide or more). Dial in one course boundary bearing (not radial), and mark the other course
   boundary bearing with the heading marker. Keep the head of the bearing pointer—which
   always falls—between the head of the course arrow and the heading marker.
5.3. Energy Management:
   5.3.1. General. Energy management requires maintaining effective combinations of
   altitude, airspeed, power settings, and AOA or G loading. Airspeed provides the kinetic
   energy required to maneuver the aircraft. Altitude provides potential energy that may be
   exchanged for airspeed. Power settings, AOA and G loading control can be used to gain or
   lose energy.
   5.3.2. Exchanging Altitude and Airspeed. Altitude and airspeed can be traded at a given rate.
   The most common rule of thumb is 1,000 feet of altitude is worth about 50 knots of airspeed.
   You can exchange altitude and airspeed in these proportions by using MIL power with the
   canopy bow on the horizon or 80 to 85 percent rpm at 20 degrees nose-high.
   5.3.3. Optimum Energy Level. To do aerobatic maneuvering in a standard UFT or PIT
   military operations area (MOA), the optimum energy level allowing you to do nearly all
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    41


  maneuvers is 300 KCAS at an altitude midway between the top and the bottom of the MOA.
  Minimum and equivalent energy levels (the altitude-airspeed relationship) may be calculated
  using the 50 knots at 1,000 feet exchange rate rule shown earlier in paragraph 5.3.2. For
  example, 16,000 feet MSL at 300 KCAS is approximately the same energy level as 14,000
  feet MSL at 400 KCAS.
  5.3.4. Losing Energy. Losing energy is easy through the use of low power settings, increased
  drag due to configuration or speed brakes, and (or) increased AOA/G loading. A simple way
  to lose energy is to perform a constant speed descent until the desired energy level is reached.
  Applying increasing back stick pressure until achieving moderate buffet (see paragraph
  5.7.3) will also help lose energy. Use caution to avoid causing an over-g when airspeed is
  greater than corner velocity (reference figure 5.1).
  5.3.5. Gaining Energy. The best way to gain a large amount of energy is a wings-level climb
  at or near the tech order climb schedule. Gaining energy is enhanced with light AOA or G
  loading and maximization of excess thrust with the aircraft lift vector pointed vertically up.
  MAX power could be used (within engine envelope restrictions) but is rarely the most fuel-
  efficient way to gain energy. Many pilots will use MIL power for most energy-gaining
  maneuvers. Do not hesitate to use MAX power for small, quick changes in airspeed or when
  the aircraft is already at a high CAS.
  5.3.6. Maneuverability Diagrams:
     5.3.6.1. An energy maneuverability diagram (Figure 5.1) plots airspeed or Mach against
     turn rate with lines of constant G-load, turn radius, and specific excess power (PS or “P-
     sub-S”) contours represent the performance capabilities of an aircraft for a given set of
     flight conditions, including altitude, configuration, weight, and power setting.
     5.3.6.2. The lines on the diagram represent the aircraft's ability to change altitude,
     airspeed, and direction of flight by considering lift, aerodynamic drag, structural limits,
     thrust, weight, and velocity.

5.4. Flight Control Characteristics:
   5.4.1. Rudder. Effective use of the rudder is important throughout the T-38 flight regime and
   should not be ignored. Generally, the rudder is more effective at high AOA and less effective
   at low AOA.
   5.4.2. Ailerons. Ailerons are most effective at low AOA and become less effective as AOA
   increases. Be cautious of aileron sensitivity and rapid aircraft roll rates, especially at low
   AOA. At high speeds and low AOA, large stick deflections may exceed aircraft limits.
   5.4.3. Speed Brake. The speed brake has minimal effect below 250 KCAS. Little or no pitch
   change occurs when activating the speed brake below 250 KCAS. At airspeeds above 250
   KCAS, speed brake extension causes a slight pitch up, and retraction causes a slight pitch
   down. The pitch changes are not abrupt; you can easily overcome them with smooth control
   inputs.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      43


   5.4.4. Trim Techniques. Proper trim technique is essential for smooth and precise aircraft
   control during all phases of flight. The basic rule for proper trim is simple: Establish and hold
   a desired attitude by applying control stick pressure, then trim to relieve the pressure.
   Normally, large trim changes are not necessary. Use “clicks” of trim when trimming the
   aircraft.
5.5. Pilot-Induced Oscillation (PIO). Over-controlling pitch corrections can result in a PIO,
especially at high airspeeds. During a PIO, your control inputs lag behind the aerodynamic forces
acting on the aircraft, and flight deviations will actually increase as you try to correct them. To
avoid this potentially dangerous situation, make smooth control inputs and, if encountered,
freeze the stick slightly aft of neutral until oscillations stop.
5.6. G-Awareness Exercise:
   5.6.1. Perform the G-awareness exercise to warm up or assess your personal G-tolerance,
   and practice the timing and execution of your anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM). Also
   check your anti-G suit and the aircraft’s system for proper operation. Use MIL power and
   420±20 KCAS to provide adequate airspeed to sustain the appropriate Gs without losing
   excessive altitude. Set the FPM approximately 8 to 10 degrees nose-low to maintain 4-4.5 Gs
   and approximately 18-20 degrees nose-low to maintain 5-5.5 Gs.
   5.6.2. When executing high-G maneuvers while looking over your shoulder, you will find
   the AGSM more difficult to do properly and more tiring. Increased emphasis on the AGSM
   is necessary during high-G maneuvers.

Section 5B—Aircraft Handling

5.7. Airframe Buffet Levels. As a baseline for common reference, this manual will use the
following terms for airframe buffet levels, described in order of increasing AOA:
   5.7.1. Light Tickle. Light tickle is the first consistent appearance of high frequency, low
   amplitude vibration on the airframe due to AOA. The lower the airspeed the higher the
   AOA at which this occurs - Typically at about 0.55 AOA during clean, 1G flight at speeds
   below 300 KCAS, to about 0.4 AOA at 400 knots
   5.7.2. Light Buffet. Light buffet is a consistent, light airframe vibration that normally occurs
   at 0.6 AOA (green donut).
   5.7.3. Moderate Buffet. Moderate buffet is a consistent, moderate airframe vibration that
   normally occurs from approximately 0.7 AOA to the definite increase in buffet intensity, just
   short of wing rock.
   5.7.4. Definite Increase in Buffet Intensity (DIBI). The definite increase in buffet intensity is
   the point where the frequency of airframe vibrations becomes inconsistent, irregular and
   slower with the amplitude often increasing beyond the moderate buffet level. This typically
   occurs above 0.8 AOA—usually closer to 0.8 AOA with the flaps up, and potentially above
   0.9 AOA with the flaps at 60 or 100 percent. In some aircraft, the definite increase in buffet
   intensity may not be noticeable prior to entering wing rock.
   5.7.5. Heavy Buffet. Heavy buffet is the buffet from AOA higher than the definite increase
   in buffet intensity to the point where the stick is at the aft stop.
 44                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   5.7.6. Wing Rock. Wing rock normally occurs just prior to a fully developed stall and
   includes exaggerated, alternating drops of each wing.
5.8. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC). The following exercises display the handling
characteristics and qualities of high-performance, swept-wing aircraft. They are exercises, not
precise maneuvers. Developing a feel for handling characteristics is more important than
achieving specific parameters. When observing or flying these exercises, note when the flight
control surfaces are most effective and how airspeed and AOA changes affect the aircraft
handling characteristics.
5.9. Full Aft-Stick Stall:
   5.9.1. This stall demonstrates aircraft characteristics throughout the stall regime and shows
   the importance and effectiveness of relaxing backstick pressure during a stall recovery. In
   this stall, the stall progresses far beyond the situation encountered in normal flight or
   approach-to-stall training.
   5.9.2. This exercise demonstrates the aircraft’s stability in a stall, the ability to recover from
   any stall simply by relaxing backstick pressure, and the excessive altitude lost when
   recovering from a stall without using increased power. Always consider increasing power to
   minimize altitude loss in an inadvertent stall recovery.
   5.9.3. Begin in level flight below FL 200 with power set at 80 percent rpm minimum.
   5.9.4. As airspeed decreases, hold the pitch constant by smoothly and steadily pulling the
   stick straight back to the stop with no aileron inputs. Mild wing rock is normal as AOA
   increases.
   5.9.5. As you approach full aft stick, wing rock will occur and a high sink rate will develop.
   Keep the ailerons neutral and the stick full aft against the stop. Note the buffet and AOA
   progression—especially the definite increase in buffet intensity in excess of 0.8 AOA, full
   stall around 1.0 AOA, and fully-developed stall at 1.1 AOA. In the fully developed stall,
   pitch stabilizes slightly nose-low, airspeed settles around 140 KCAS, AOA reaches the stop
   at 1.1, and vertical velocity increases to a 9,000 fpm descent.
   5.9.6. After the stall is fully developed, recover by leaving the power alone and relaxing
   backstick pressure. As the airspeed increases, reapply backstick pressure and add power as
   required. Recover to a level-flight attitude. Use caution not to overspeed the gear and (or)
   flaps during the recovery.
   5.9.7. Slight variations in aircraft rigging, coupled with flight control inputs, may cause
   severe wing rock. If bank exceeds 90 degrees or stabilizes over 60 degrees, discontinue the
   exercise and recover the aircraft from the stall. Write the aircraft up following completion
   of the mission. Watch for potential gear or flap overspeed if configured.
5.10. Simulated Trim Failure:
   5.10.1. Simulated inoperative trim will familiarize you with the stick pressures required
   when the stabilator trim fails. If you release pressure on the control stick after the stabilator
   trim has failed, the stick will move to the trimmed position and the aircraft will
   aerodynamically search for the trimmed airspeed.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                       45


   5.10.2. Perform this exercise below FL 200. Begin with airspeed above 300 KCAS and trim
   the aircraft for level flight. Without retrimming, slow the aircraft to normal final approach
   airspeed. As the airspeed decreases below 240 KCAS, configure the aircraft with gear and
   full flaps. Note the increase in stick forces as the airspeed decreases and the configuration
   changes.
   5.10.3. After experiencing the pressures at final approach airspeed, retrim the aircraft to
   relieve the stick pressures. Without trimming the aircraft, execute a simulated go-around,
   retracting the gear and flaps, and accelerate to an airspeed above 300 KCAS. Note the
   increasing stick pressures associated with the configuration and airspeed changes. Turn the
   aircraft and note how increased bank helps maintain altitude and provide relief from the
   constant forward stick pressures.
   5.10.4. After completing the exercise, and before any other maneuvering, retrim the aircraft.
   If you encounter approach-to-stall indications at any time, simultaneously execute stall
   recovery procedures and retrim the aircraft to eliminate unwanted stick pressures.
5.11. Rudder Effectiveness at Slow Speed:
   5.11.1. This exercise demonstrates flight characteristics during the landing phase and the
   measurable delay between the time a rudder input is applied and the time it takes effect on
   the aircraft. With the aircraft configured with gear down and flaps at any setting (for
   example, full, 60 percent, or no-flap), apply varied amounts of rudder inputs for varying
   lengths of time and examine the roll characteristics.
   5.11.2. First, configure the aircraft and achieve a level attitude with approach-to-stall
   parameters (approximately 0.8 to 0.85 AOA) simulating a level final turn traffic pattern stall.
   5.11.3. Then, as quickly as possible, apply full top rudder and wait until the aircraft begins to
   react. At that time, neutralize the rudders and note how the aircraft will over-correct to
   approximately 45 degrees of bank in the opposite direction. Maintain neutral aileron inputs
   to isolate rudder characteristics. Note the effectiveness of the rudder with full deflection and
   the delay between rudder input and aircraft reaction.
   5.11.4. Using the same setup up as in paragraph 5.11.2 now apply full top rudder and
   immediately take out the input before the aircraft begins to react. The aircraft will tend to
   right itself close to level flight. Note: When applying near-full rudder deflection, it is
   important to return the rudder to neutral quickly to avoid excessive bank in the direction of
   rudder deflection.
5.12. Aileron Effectiveness Exercise. This exercise demonstrates the increased effectiveness
of the ailerons at low G-loads and AOA. With the power set between 85 percent rpm and MIL
power, roll the aircraft at various G loads and AOA using only the ailerons. One technique is to
establish a 20-degree nose-high pitch attitude, set the power at approximately 90 percent rpm,
and allow the airspeed to decrease to 150 KCAS. At 150 KCAS, increase backstick pressure to
attain moderate buffet. Maintain this buffet, and roll the aircraft using the ailerons. Note the roll
rate. Next, while maintaining the moderate buffet and the same aileron deflection, smoothly
unload the aircraft to approximately 0.5 G. Note how the roll rate increases. Ailerons become
more effective as the angle of attack decreases, regardless of airspeed. Relaxing backstick
pressure will reduce angle of attack, thereby increasing aileron effectiveness.
 46                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


5.13. Turn Reversals:
   5.13.1. This exercise demonstrates the tactical usefulness of turning the aircraft with ailerons
   alone under a low AOA condition vice turning the aircraft with the rudder alone
   under higher AOA conditions. The order in which you accomplish the turns is not
   important, but accomplish both turns between 350 and 400 KCAS with a minimum of MIL
   power.
   5.13.2. For both turns, roll the aircraft into approximately 90 degrees of bank and increase
   the backstick pressure to achieve approximately 4Gs. be careful not to exceed the
   asymmetrical G limits of the aircraft during this exercise.
   5.13.3. After establishing approximately 4Gs, accomplish one reversal by unloading the
   aircraft and using only the ailerons to quickly reverse the lift vector, and establish a 4G turn
   in the opposite direction. Note how quickly you accomplish the turn and how little airspeed
   you lose during the reversal.
   5.13.4. After establishing approximately 4Gs again, accomplish one reversal by using only
   the rudder. Altitude and energy will determine whether you use the top or bottom rudder. If
   using the top rudder, note the airspeed bleed off during the reversal. If using the bottom
   rudder, note the altitude loss. In both cases, the reversal will be slower than the one
   accomplished with ailerons and low AOA.
5.14 Accelerated Stall:
   5.14.1. This stall demonstrates the effect that increasing AOA has on turning
   performance and airspeed loss. For this exercise, use approximately 300 KCAS to decrease
   the necessary G loading and the potential to exceed G limits and to reduce the time required
   to reach the increased buffet or mild wing rock.
   5.14.2. Begin by entering a 2 to 3 G turn with MIL power and approximately 300 KCAS.
   Increase the bank and backstick pressure as required to achieve the light buffet in a level
   turn. Note the turn rate and “light tickle.” This is optimum turn performance for the T-38.
   5.14.3. Then rapidly increase the bank and backstick pressure to achieve either increased
   buffet or mild wing rock. Note that the turn rate will increase initially, but as the AOA
   continues to increase, the turn rate will decrease and the airspeed loss will increase. This is
   also very evident during HUD VTR review during debrief.
   5.14.4. Without reference to any cockpit indications, you should be able to note when the
   AOA has increased beyond a useful point. Next, relax the backstick pressure to decrease the
   AOA and continue the turn with a light buffet.
5.15. Pitchback.
   5.15.1. Fighter aircraft use a pitchback to reverse direction of flight in minimum time
   while attempting to attain and maintain corner velocity. A pitchback is similar to an
   Immelmann except it begins with a bank angle greater than 0 degrees (but less than 90
   degrees) and uses less altitude. The objective is to minimize turn time while maneuvering
   using visual references. Concentrate on the simple mechanics of flying a pitchback without
   regard to energy level or corner velocity.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                       47


   5.15.2. Enter the pitchback from level flight with 450 to 500 KCAS. With the power at MIL,
   roll to the desired bank angle, neutralize the ailerons, and apply backstick pressure to attain 4
   to 5 Gs. Maintain 4 to 5 Gs or a light buffet as airspeed decreases and a straight-nose track
   through approximately 180 degrees of turn.
5.16. Sliceback. A sliceback is similar to a split-S except it begins with a bank angle greater
than 90 degrees (but less than 180 degrees) and uses less altitude. The objective is to reverse
direction of travel using potential energy (altitude) to maintain or gain airspeed. Enter the
sliceback with 200 to 300 KCAS. With the power stabilized at MIL, roll to the desired bank
angle, neutralize the ailerons, and apply backstick pressure to attain the light buffet. Maintain the
light buffet and a straight-nose track through approximately 180 degrees of turn. The higher the
entry airspeed the more you need to watch the Gs at the bottom, and use caution for rolling
inputs which could cause an asymmetrical over-G.
5.17. Pitch-to-Slice Exercise. Fighter aircraft use a pitch to slice when a tactical situation
requires a reduction of airspeed to corner velocity while maximizing turn rate and minimizing
turn radius. Start the exercise by executing a pitchback at 450 to 500 KCAS at MIL power and a
bank angle greater than 0 degrees (but less than 90 degrees). Turn your head to look straight back
toward the tip of the vertical tail; pick a point above you (a cloud if available; if not available,
pick an imaginary point); and execute a 4 to 5G straight pull. As you pull through the horizon (at
greater than 90 degrees of bank), continue with a sliceback with a straight pull at the light buffet.
Continue to look at the vertical tail and pick a point on the ground to pull to. The exercise is
complete when you return to level flight in a bank greater than 0 degrees (but less than 90
degrees). This maneuver teaches a reliance on visual lookout and clearing while sensing bank
and pitch by looking outside the cockpit as well as flying the aircraft by feel for buffet and G.
5.18. Low-Speed Stability Exercise:
   5.18.1. Commonly referred to as the “stab ex,” or “stab demo,” this exercise demonstrates
   the stability potential of high-performance aircraft at extremely low airspeeds. Establish a
   60-degree nose-high pitch attitude, and set power at a minimum of 85 percent rpm. Use the
   power setting to control the airspeed bleed off and altitude gain.
   5.18.2. As the airspeed decreases through 170 KCAS, unload the aircraft and maintain
   approximately 0.5 G. With the aircraft unloaded, note how far the airspeed decreases without
   stall indications or loss of control. As the aircraft passes level-flight attitude, apply full
   backstick pressure and attempt to maintain level flight. Note the immediate onset of stall
   indications.
   5.18.3. Once again, unload the aircraft and note how stall indications cease. Maintain 0.5 G
   until reaching an airspeed between 175 and 200 KCAS; then recover the aircraft to level
   flight. Do not move the throttles until greater than 175 KCAS unless required for safety.
   Maintain at least 0.5 G throughout this maneuver to ensure proper oil system operation. If the
   airspeed decreases below stabilator effectiveness, the aircraft will immediately stall and may
   enter post-stall gyrations.
   5.18.4. Because the coefficient of lift for a symmetrical airfoil is always zero at 0 G, the
   wing cannot exceed the critical AOA. Therefore, when faced with a nose-high, low-airspeed,
   unusual attitude, unloading the aircraft will ensure aircraft control as long as possible.

5.19. Slow Flight. Slow flight demonstrates the low-speed handling characteristics of the T-38
and emphasizes the importance of smooth control inputs during this flight condition. After
configuring, slow to 10 knots below computed final approach airspeed. Normally accomplish
slow flight in level flight; however, a slight descent may be required. The AOA indexer lights
will show a slow indication (approximately 0.7 AOA). Perform coordinated turns, using various
angles of bank. Note how the AOA changes with fore and aft stick movements, throttle
movements, and changes in bank.
5.20. Slow Flight Recovery Demonstration:
   5.20.1. This demonstration shows the effects of various flap settings on aircraft acceleration
   at low airspeeds. It is particularly applicable to aircraft handling during the flare and (or) go-
   around.
   5.20.2. In level flight with gear down, full flaps, slow flight airspeed, and a constant power
   setting, retract the flaps to 60 percent. Note how the aircraft accelerates and the AOA
   decreases. Reestablish full flaps and slow flight airspeed. When stabilized in level flight and
   maintaining a constant power setting, fully retract the flaps. Note that, as the flaps pass
   through 60 percent, the aircraft starts to accelerate and the AOA decreases. As the flaps
   continue toward the full-up position, the buffet increases, airspeed decreases, and aircraft
   approaches a stall.
5.21. Supersonic Flight:
   5.21.1. Due to its unique nature, this type of flight requires additional planning
   considerations. Prior to the preflight briefing, check the forecast temperature at the
   supersonic run altitude, and review engine operating limitations, associated emergency
   procedures, the afterburner climb schedule, and any local coordination requirements and
   restrictions. During flight, use actual outside air temperature (OAT) displayed on the MFD
   DATA display page to verify your minimum Mach number.
   5.21.2. The single significant consequence of going supersonic is wave drag. This increase
   in total drag starts slightly above critical Mach (noticeable by .95 Mach). The transition from
   subsonic to supersonic flight occurs with little apparent aircraft reaction. At Mach 1, a
   detached shock wave forms in front of the pitot tube causing the altimeter and vertical
   velocity indications to jump. Because the engines are operating in an area of increased stall
   susceptibility, use caution when terminating the supersonic run. Smoothly retard one throttle
   out of afterburner, and ensure proper engine operation before retarding the second throttle out
   of afterburner. Also, do not allow the airspeed to decrease below the IMN recommended in
   the flight manual. Finally, use caution to prevent exceeding Mach 1 during the descent below
   FL 300.

Section 5C—Traffic Pattern Stalls and Approach-to-Stall Training

5.22. Purpose:
   5.22.1. The Air Force has lost many lives and aircraft due to traffic pattern accidents. In the
   T-38, it is particularly easy to put yourself into an unrecoverable stall or sink rate situation
   before the indicators get your attention.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                        49


   5.22.2. Stall training in the MOA develops a number of critical skills that can prevent
   catastrophe in the traffic pattern. Stall training keys on the important areas of recognition and
   recovery. Approach-to- stall training is not a precise maneuver. It is designed to teach stall
   recognition and stall recovery. Although approach-to-stall training simulates conditions that
   may arise in the traffic pattern, this training is applicable to all phases of a T-38 mission.
   Practice with 0 percent, 60 percent or full flaps. Note the less defined onset of the increased
   buffet at lower flap settings. There will be a greater possibility for a secondary stall during
   no-flap approach-to-stall training.
   5.22.3. It is important that you are able to recognize all approach-to-stall characteristics.
   Individual aircraft can have slightly different handling characteristics near the approach-to-
   stall region. The definite increase in buffet intensity can occur slightly before or after the
   aural, HUD, or MFD stall warnings (triggered at and above 0.80 AOA). In order to gain an
   understanding of the feel of the aircraft at the definite increase in buffet intensity, the
   AC/instructor can brief to ignore the aural, HUD, or MFD stall warnings during MOA stall
   training. Another reason for needing to understand the feel of the aircraft at the definite
   increase in buffet intensity is so that, during the stall recovery, you are able to maximize
   aircraft performance by flying just shy of the definite increase in buffet intensity. It is not
   abnormal during a wings-level, MAX power stall recovery to be at or above 0.80 AOA and
   have the aural, HUD, or MFD stall warnings activated.
5.23. Turning Approach-to-Stall Exercise. Establish the landing configuration, at or below
FL200 with power at 80 percent rpm minimum, and fly a simulated final turn with an intentional
error. Possible errors include a level final turn, a diving final turn, or an overshooting final turn.
For the level final turn, maintain a fairly constant bank angle and allow the airspeed to decrease
until reaching the definite increase in buffet intensity, or the aural, HUD, or MFD stall warnings.
For errors other than the level final turn, progressively increase the bank and backstick pressure.
For any of the above examples, as you detect a definite increase in buffet intensity, the aural,
HUD, or MFD stall warnings, however briefed by the AC/instructor, execute the stall recovery.
   5.23.1. Level Final Turn Setup/Characteristics. As a technique, after establishing a normal
   final turn (approximately 45 degrees of bank and 5 to 7 degrees nose low). Roll out to
   approximately 30 degrees of bank and raise the nose 4 to 5 degrees while pulling the power
   no lower than (80 percent rpm minimum at or below FL200). The characteristics will be a
   slower stall onset rate and slower rate of recovery. This setup is a useful training aid
   identifying the different stall characteristics listed in section 5.7.
   5.23.2. Diving Final Turn/Overshooting Final Setup/Characteristics. As a technique, after
   establishing a normal final turn, continue to increase bank to 60 degrees of bank while
   increasing back stick pressure and pulling the power no lower than (80 percent rpm minimum
   at or below FL200). The characteristics will be a quicker stall onset rate and proportionally
   quicker rate of recovery.
5.24. Landing Attitude Approach-to-Stall Exercise. Establish the landing configuration, set
the power (80 percent rpm minimum at or below FL200), attain a landing attitude, and allow the
airspeed to decrease. A common technique is to maintain level to approximately 1,000 fpm
vertical velocity. As you detect a definite increase in buffet intensity, or the aural, HUD, or MFD
stall warnings, however briefed by the AC/instructor, execute the stall recovery. Use greater
finesse to recover due to the slow stall speed in a wings-level situation.

5.25. Stall and Approach-to-Stall Recovery Completion. Recovery is complete when the
descent is stopped, a positive controlled climb is established (altimeter and vertical velocity
reversed), and the aircraft has sufficient airspeed for continued flight.

Section 5D—Abnormal Flight Recoveries

5.26. Purpose. You may find yourself in a flight attitude where loss of aircraft control is
imminent unless you initiate a proper recovery. Although the recoveries indicated in paragraphs
5.27 and 5.28 may appear simple, the events leading up to them can result in confusion or
disorientation that would severely hamper your recovery efforts.
5.27. Abnormal Recovery Setup Guidelines:
   5.27.1. During any abnormal flight recovery setup, IP vigilance is paramount. Do not
   compromise safe flight during IP demonstration or student performance of recovery training.
   In all situations where transfer of aircraft control is involved, it will be accomplished IAW
   AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3.
   5.27.2. Abnormal flight recovery training should be thought of in the following three phases
   of proficiency: (Note: These phases are not necessarily linked to a particular block of
   training, but are linked to the student’s flying abilities and situational awareness [SA].)
       5.27.2.1. The IP demonstrates and flies the complete setup and recovery while delivering
       appropriate verbal instruction. Once the student has seen the recovery demonstrated and
       has a basic grasp of why the recovery training is performed, the IP begins setting up
       recovery situations for the student and talking him or her through the recovery
       procedures.
       5.27.2.2. When the student shows proficiency in the recovery procedures, the IP begins
       setting up observable situations requiring an abnormal flight recovery. When the setup is
       completely developed, the IP transfers control of the aircraft to the student, using the
       verbal command, “You have the aircraft— recover.” The student takes the aircraft and
       recovers from the abnormal attitude.
       5.27.2.3. Once the student has seen all the different types of setups and can confidently
       and proficiently recover from various situations, the IP sets up abnormal flight
       recoveries randomly throughout the area profile. Once the setup is complete, the IP
       directs the student to take the aircraft with “You have the aircraft.” The student takes the
       aircraft with proper transfer procedures and recovers in the appropriate manner.
   5.27.3. Once a student learns the correct stick and throttle inputs, it is imperative to build his
   or her judgment and ability to recognize abnormal flight and the need to accomplish an
   abnormal flight recovery. The IP should concentrate primarily on developing the student’s
   SA.
5.28. Nose-High Recovery:
   5.28.1. Use a nose-high recovery to return to level flight following an unrecognizable or
   potentially unsafe nose-high attitude. Choose a recovery technique commensurate with the
   severity of the nose-high attitude. Make any required power increases smoothly to
   prevent engine compressor stalls and flameouts.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                       51


   5.28.2. Some instances, such as moderate pitch attitudes or near wings-level attitudes, may
   simply require relaxing back stick pressure and maintaining slight G forces while recovering
   to level flight. However, extreme pitch attitudes may require rolling toward the nearest
   horizon and pulling the nose down to a level-flight attitude. In addition, extremely low
   airspeeds may require an unloaded recovery resembling the low-speed stability exercise.
   5.28.3. With all of these techniques, if airspeed is sufficient as the nose approaches the
   horizon, rollout and return to level flight. If airspeed is insufficient to comfortably maintain
   level flight as the nose passes the horizon, delay the rollout until the nose is definitely below
   the horizon and continue to accelerate in a slight descent until you can return to level flight.
5.29. Nose-Low Recovery:
   5.29.1. Use a nose-low recovery to return to level flight or a slight climb following an
   unrecognizable or potentially unsafe nose-low attitude in the minimum turn radius. The
   minimum turn radius is achieved by maintaining the aircraft at the aerodynamic or G limit
   between approximately 250 knots and corner velocity (approximately 400 knots). To achieve
   this, quickly roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon and apply backstick pressure to achieve
   the moderate buffet or desired recover G (whichever comes first). Normally, 4 to 5 Gs are
   sufficient for an expeditious recovery in the MOA. In a nose-low recovery situation where
   proximity to the ground is a concern, do not hesitate to pull to the aerodynamic/G limit of the
   aircraft.
   5.29.2. Adjust power and (or) speed brakes to maintain the airspeed between approximately
   250 and 400 knots. The “feel” of the aircraft may be used to help analyze airspeed. If the
   aircraft is at the desired G limit and no buffet is felt, reduce the airspeed to minimize the turn
   radius. If a moderate buffet is felt prior to reaching the desired G, set the power to at least
   MIL until the buffet begins to go away at the desired recovery G.

Section 5E—Aerobatic Maneuvers

5.30. Purpose. Aerobatic maneuvers exploit the maneuvering envelope of the aircraft, develop
skills and confidence required to employ combat aircraft, improve energy management skills,
and build three- dimensional SA. As contact maneuvers, aerobatics require a disciplined
composite cross-check, using references inside and outside the cockpit. For example, airspeed,
altitude, and G loading must be verified inside the cockpit; clearing and ground track control
must be accomplished using outside references; and attitude and area orientation usually require
both inside and outside references. When available, use outside references to enhance clearing
and maneuver precision.
5.31. Aerodynamic Parameters. The mechanics of performing aerobatic maneuvers in the T-
38 are essentially the same as in previous training, but differences exist in power settings,
airspeeds, G loadings, required airspace, and handling characteristics. Entry parameters for each
maneuver are summarized in Table 5.1. Fly all aerobatic maneuvers using the range of airspeeds
and power settings within specified parameters. Remain in visual meteorological conditions
(VMC) during aerobatic maneuvering.

5.32. Factors Affecting Aerobatic Maneuvers in the Vertical. Several factors work together
to affect the altitude required to complete over-the-top or split-S type maneuvers. They are entry
airspeed, power setting, aircraft weight, and pilot technique. The following general rules of
thumb apply when flying aerobatic maneuvers:
     5.32.1. Turn radius depends on G loading and airspeed.
     5.32.2. Holding other parameters constant, higher G loading reduces the altitude required to
     complete the maneuver, while higher airspeed increases the altitude required.
     5.32.3. Higher power settings improve turn performance at low airspeeds. Thrust offsets the
     higher induced drag present under higher AOA, thus preserving airspeed (and, therefore, G
     available). In contrast, a lower power setting combined with high-induced drag degrades the
     ability to acquire or sustain G available. Combinations of these variables can cause up to a
     2,000 to 3,000 feet difference in altitude required for an over-the-top maneuver.
     5.32.4. As a guide, plan for at least 10,000 feet when accomplishing aerobatics in the
     vertical plane (over-the-top and split-S-type maneuvers).
5.33. Energy and Airspace Requirements:
     5.33.1. Table 5.2 shows distances from the start of the actual maneuver to completion
     of the maneuver. Theses distances do not include any airspace used in setting up the
     maneuver or any airspace used to perform the flyout following the maneuver.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                            53

 8          Chandelle        1 nm forward; 1 nm in direction of turn         6,000 to 7,000 feet above

     5.33.2. Entering an over-the-top maneuver involves flying the aircraft to a point where entry
     parameters can be reached with sufficient airspace above or below required to complete the
     maneuver. First of all, the overall energy level must be assessed and adjusted, if required, to
     meet entry parameters. Techniques for making this assessment were discussed in paragraph
     5.3. Once the desired energy level has been attained, the aircraft must be flown to an altitude
     that permits starting the maneuver. If this involves a descent, one technique is to lead the
     pullout by 10 knots and (or) 500 feet for each 10-degree nose-low (for example, for 50-
     degrees nose-low, lead the pullout by approximately 50 knots and (or) 2,500 feet). If the
     over-the-top maneuver involves achieving the starting altitude at the completion of the
     maneuver, ensure that the altitude for starting the maneuver allows for a buffer below the
     starting altitude so that airspace limits are not violated. (Don’t start at the airspace floor with
     no room below for error).
     5.33.3. Energy can be affected by how the maneuver is flown. Low energy can be affected in
     one of two ways. First, if airspeed is relatively high, but altitude is low, fly the first portion of
     the over-the-top maneuver using 4 to 4.5 Gs (vertical airspace permitting). Then use the light
     tickle and “float” the upper portion of the pull. This technique may offer the opportunity to
     gain energy during the loop. If airspeed is low (regardless of altitude), pull closer to 5 Gs
     initially to make it over the top with greater than the minimum over-the-top airspeed of 150
     KCAS. This should allow you to complete the loop; however, this technique may result in an
     overall energy loss. High energy can easily be reduced by increasing induced drag (higher
     AOA and G loading) during the maneuver.
5.34. Aileron Roll. Aileron rolls can be performed at any airspeed and at various pitch
attitudes. The T-38 is capable of an extremely high roll rate, so relax control pressure during the
last part of the roll to prevent overshooting the wings-level attitude. Stay smooth, and don’t
attempt to keep the nose on a point.
5.35. Lazy Eight:
     5.35.1. Entry parameters are 350 to 400 KCAS using 95 percent rpm.
 54                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   5.35.2. From straight-and-level flight, pick a point 90 degrees off the nose (in the direction
   of the first turn). Start a smooth, climbing turn in that direction so the nose describes an arc
   above the horizon, reaching the maximum pitch attitude at approximately 45 degrees of turn.
   5.35.3. One technique is to drag the landing gear handle (left turn) or NAV backup control
   panel (right turn) across the horizon. This should equate to approximately 20 degrees to 30
   degrees nose-high. The nose should then start back down, passing through the horizon after
   90 degrees of turn with approximately 90 degrees of bank at approximately 200 knots. As the
   nose passes through the horizon, begin a smooth, gradual rollout and pull-up, planning to
   reach the maximum nose-down pitch attitude after approximately 135 degrees of turn. At this
   point, the canopy bow should be on or near the horizon (approximately 20 degrees to 30
   degrees nose-low).
   5.35.4. Complete the first half of the maneuver after approximately 180 degrees of turn in a
   wings- level flight attitude with the entry airspeed. Enter the second half of the maneuver by
   turning in the opposite direction. Complete the lazy eight with the aircraft headed in the
   original direction at entry airspeed.
   5.35.5. The emphasis is on flying a smooth, symmetrical maneuver with constantly changing
   parameters.
   5.35.6. A lazy eight will require approximately 2 nm forward, 6 nm to your right or left—in
   the direction of the turns—and 4,000 to 6,000 feet above.
5.36. Barrel Roll:
   5.36.1. Entry parameters are 375 to 400 KCAS using approximately 95 percent rpm.
   5.36.2. The barrel roll is a coordinated roll in any direction in which the nose of the aircraft
   describes a circle around a point. Choose a point on or slightly above the horizon and
   maneuver the aircraft to attain entry parameters in a wings-level attitude with the aircraft 30
   to 45 degrees to the side of the selected point. Begin a rolling pull in the desired direction and
   use smooth control inputs to maintain a circular flightpath around the reference point. You
   should be (1) in 90 degrees of bank directly above the selected reference point, (2) in a
   wings-level inverted attitude when passing abeam the reference point at 180 degrees of roll,
   (3) in 90 degrees of bank directly below the selected reference point, and (4) in a wings-level
   upright attitude when completing the maneuver. The pitch at (1) and (2) should be the same
   amount of degrees above and below the reference point.
   5.36.3. Another technique is to begin the maneuver by choosing a desired roll axis from
   which to fly the barrel. Offset this roll axis the number of degrees that defines the size of the
   roll (normally 30 to 45 degrees). Pick a point on the horizon twice the number of degrees of
   the offset in the desired direction of the roll. For example, if selecting a 45-degree offset,
   pick a point 90 degrees off the nose.
   5.36.4. Begin a coordinated roll and pull to fly the nose of the aircraft to be inverted at the
   point. Continue the coordinated roll or pull to fly the aircraft back to the original offset
   heading. You should be at 90 degrees of bank as the nose of the aircraft passes the original
   roll axis (both on the first and second half of the roll), and the degrees nose-high and -low at
   these points are defined by the number of degrees of the original offset. The ending airspeed
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      55


   should be approximately the same as the entry airspeed for a symmetrically flown maneuver,
   but symmetry is more important than finishing at entry airspeed.
   5.36.5. Maintain positive G loading throughout the roll. To gain energy, use higher power
   settings or a lighter G loading.
   5.36.6. A barrel roll will require a forward distance of approximately 3 nm and 4,000 to
   8,000 feet above.
5.37. Loop:
   5.37.1. Entry parameters are 500 KCAS using MIL power.
   5.37.2. Begin the loop with entry airspeed and approximately 10,000 feet of altitude above
   you. Smoothly apply backstick pressure until reaching approximately 4.5 to 5 Gs in a straight
   pull. Continue to increase backstick pressure to maintain the light buffet “green donut.”
   Ensure wings are level when passing through the horizon inverted. Maintain backstick
   pressure to maintain the light buffet to light tickle as Gs build to approximately 4 to 5 on the
   bottom side of the loop. Finish the maneuver in level flight at entry parameters, unless
   flowing immediately into another maneuver.
   5.37.3. A loop will require approximately 1 to 2 nm forward and 8,000 to 10,000 feet above
   you from the start of the pull until maneuver completion. This does not include airspace used
   to set the maneuver up or post-loop maneuvering.
5.38. Split-S:
   5.38.1. Entry parameters are 200 KCAS using MIL power.
   5.38.2. The split-S is essentially the last half of a loop. Enter the split-S from a slight climb
   to ensure completion of the roll to the wings-level inverted attitude before the nose reaches
   the horizon. One technique is to begin the maneuver with 230 KCAS, pull 10 degrees nose
   high, unload and roll to a wings level inverted position (front cockpit reference—canopy bow
   on the horizon). Once inverted, neutralize the ailerons and increase backstick pressure to
   attain light buffet in a straight pull. Maintain the light buffet until reaching 4 to 5 Gs or the
   completion of the maneuver.
   5.38.3. The maneuver is complete when you are wings level approximately 180 degrees
   from entry heading. There is no exit airspeed, although exits as high as 380 to 440 KCAS are
   typical. If the maneuver is intended to blend into another maneuver, the pull may be modified
   to attain desired follow- on entry airspeed. A split-S requires approximately 1 nm forward, 1
   nm behind, and 7,000 to 10,000 feet below.
5.39. Immelmann:
   5.39.1. Entry parameters are 500 KCAS using MIL power.
   5.39.2. The Immelmann resembles the first half of a loop followed by a half roll at the top.
   Begin the Immelmann by using the same mechanics as a loop. Just prior to reaching the
   inverted, level-flight attitude (front cockpit reference—canopy bow on the horizon), relax
   backstick pressure and execute a half roll in either direction. Complete the maneuver in level
   flight 180 degrees from the original heading.

   5.39.3. An Immelmann will require approximately 1 nm forward and 8,000 to 10,000 feet
   above.
5.40. Cuban Eight.
   5.40.1. Entry parameters are 500 KCAS using MIL power.
   5.40.2. Begin the Cuban eight by using the same mechanics as a loop. Continue to pull
   through the inverted, level-flight attitude. As the aircraft approaches a 45-degree, nose-low
   inverted attitude, relax backstick pressure and execute a half roll in either direction. Set the
   FPM (or CDM) approximately 45 degrees nose-low and hold it until beginning the next 4.5
   to 5 G pull-up (Figure 5.2). In the 45-degree dive, the G loading will be approximately 0.7 to
   hold the dive angle and aimpoint. In the dive, look through the HUD, and pick an object on
   the ground and don’t let it move in the HUD. Do not allow the nose to drift up as airspeed
   increases until initiation of the pull-up.

Figure 5.2. Cuban Eight.




   5.40.3. To obtain entry airspeed for the second half of the maneuver, lead the pull-up by
   approximately 50 knots (10 knots for each 10 degrees nose-low). Initiating a 4.5 to 5 G pull
   at 450 KCAS will allow the aircraft to descend another 2,500 to 3,000 feet before the FPM
   passes through the horizon. Repeat the entire maneuver, except at the 45-degree, nose-low
   inverted attitude, the direction of roll will be opposite that of the first roll. Complete the
   maneuver in level flight, at entry speed, and heading in the original direction.
   5.40.4. A Cuban eight will require approximately 1 nm forward, 2 nm behind, and 8,000 to
   10,000 feet above.
5.41. Cloverleaf:
   5.41.1. Entry parameters are 450 KCAS using MIL power.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     57


   5.41.2. A complete cloverleaf consists of four identical maneuvers (“leaves”), flown
   consecutively and in the same direction, with each entry heading 90 degrees from the
   previous one.
   5.41.3. From level flight, choose a 90-degree reference point and then begin a 2 to 3 G pull-
   up. Approaching 45 degrees of pitch, begin a slow, rolling pull to lay the aircraft on its back
   at your selected 90-degree reference point. The airspeed should be between 175 to 200
   KCAS as the aircraft passes through the inverted, level-flight attitude.
   5.41.4. The pullout part of each “leaf” resembles a split-S. Smoothly increase backstick
   pressure to maintain the light buffet as the Gs increase. After passing the nose-low, vertical
   position, adjust backstick pressure to arrive at the level-flight attitude with entry airspeed.
   Continue the maneuver by starting the next “leaf.”
   5.41.5. A cloverleaf will require approximately 3 nm forward, 2 nm in the direction of the
   first turn, 3 nm opposite the direction of the first turn, and 8,000 to 10,000 feet above. Note:
   Because most of a cloverleaf will be away from your first turn, you should turn into the
   closest border for the first leaf.
5.42. Chandelle:
   5.42.1. Entry parameters are 400 KCAS using 95 percent rpm.
   5.42.2. The chandelle is a steep, climbing turn of approximately 180 degrees with maximum
   altitude gain for a given power setting and entry airspeed. The maneuver involves constantly
   changing your altitude, airspeed, and nose track; the altitude is always increasing, and the
   airspeed is always decreasing.
   5.42.3. Begin on parameters, with the nose below the horizon. Start a climbing turn so the
   nose of the aircraft passes through the horizon after 30 to 45 degrees of turn with
   approximately 60 degrees of bank. The nose of the aircraft should continue to rise at a
   constant rate and describe a straight-line diagonal to the horizon.
   5.42.4. Hold the bank constant, using top aileron and (or) rudder as necessary, until
   approximately 135 to 150 degrees of turn. At this point, continue the nose track and start
   decreasing the bank angle to complete the maneuver with the wings level (not level flight) at
   approximately 200 KCAS and 180 degrees of turn. The lower the nose at the beginning, the
   higher it will be at the end, and vice versa. For example, if you enter at 15 degree nose-low,
   you will finish at approximately 45 degrees nose-high. If you enter at 20 degrees nose-low,
   you will finish at approximately 60 degrees nose-high.
   5.42.5. A chandelle will require approximately 1 nm forward, 1 nm in the direction of the
   turn, and 6,000 to 7,000 feet above.

                                         FORMATION

Section 6A—Formation Administration

6.1. Introduction. The purpose of flying formation is to provide the mutual support required to
accomplish a given mission. Whether the mission is air superiority, interdiction, or close air
support, mutual support is essential for mission accomplishment. More than any other type of
flying, formation provides the best environment for building confidence and for teaching self-
reliance, self-discipline, and the proper application of aggressiveness in military flying.
Procedures used in formation typically remain the same whether in two-ship or larger
formations. Differences in procedures will be highlighted throughout this chapter.
6.2. Responsibilities:
   6.2.1. Flight Lead. The flight lead is ultimately responsible for the safe and effective
   conduct of the mission. The flight lead plans, briefs, and debriefs the flight. This position
   gives both the authority and the responsibility to ensure the flight proceeds as intended. The
   flight lead must concentrate efforts on accomplishing the mission, achieving objectives, and
   returning with the flight intact. The flight lead must consider the capabilities of all flight
   members in planning a sortie. Taking this into consideration, the flight lead should optimize
   training for all flight members and plan missions accordingly, to include briefing mission-
   specific parameters.
       6.2.1.1. Nav Lead. This may be used when the flight lead wants the wingman to navigate
       and clear. The lead will fly the wing position, deconflict within the flight, and keep the
       radios (for example, battle damage [BD] check).
       6.2.1.2. Administrative (Admin) Lead. This is used to pass lead responsibilities to
       another member of the flight. The admin lead is expected to run all aspects of the profile
       to include navigating, managing the radios, and making changes to the profile if external
       conditions dictate. With an admin lead change, the aircraft within the flight are
       administratively renumbered to match the position being flown (for example, Sling 11 is
       now “2” for intraflight communication purposes but retains Sling 11 as his or her
       callsign). However, the flight lead still retains ultimate authority for the formation. Flight
       leads should consider passing the squawk with the admin lead to allow the aircraft
       primarily responsible for clearing outside the flight to have the traffic collision avoidance
       system (TCAS) available (for example, when splitting fuel and number 2 gets the lead
       during a UFT or PIT mission, or when number 3 is given the lead during a four ship).
       6.2.1.3. Tactical Lead. This may be used when the flight lead needs the wingman to lead
       an event or segment of the flight. In this case, the wingman would pick up tactical,
       navigation, and radio responsibilities, but not the overall flight leadership responsibility.
   6.2.2. Wingmen. Wingmen must be tasked commensurate with their skill to achieve the
   mission. Tasks include mission planning, threat study, and providing information in the brief.
   Once airborne, the wingman must execute the plan as briefed. Whether the flight is taxiing
   out to the runway or flying up initial, look and sound good, match lead’s configuration and
   always anticipate, never assume, and always have an aggressive attitude. To contribute
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     59


  successfully, wingmen must prioritize tasks based on the phase of flight. Accomplishing the
  following responsibilities in order will help safely execute the mission: Aviate, Navigate,
  Communicate! In other words, fly your jet, stay visual, be in the perfect formation (or
  aggressively correcting), then do everything else (FENCE-ing in (reference paragraph 6.5.2),
  managing avionics, changing radios, etc.). As proficiency and task management allow, the
  wingman should also strive to back up the flight lead.
  6.2.3. Flight Discipline. The effectiveness of a formation mission is highly dependent on
  solid flight discipline, which begins with mission preparation and continues through briefing,
  ground operations, flight, and debrief. Mission effectiveness requires an in-depth knowledge
  of flight rules, unit standards, and procedures. When lead establishes the precedent, those
  orders must be followed. However, the wingman must speak up rather than allow the flight to
  enter an unsafe or unauthorized situation. If directed tasks are beyond a wingman’s ability,
  the wingman must immediately inform lead. Uncompromising flight discipline is absolutely
  essential for successful mission execution.
  6.2.4. Collision Avoidance. Each aircrew member shares the responsibility of avoiding a
  collision. The wingman retains primary responsibility for deconfliction between flight
  members. This responsibility transfers to lead if the wingman becomes blind or is placed in a
  blind cone during maneuvering. If any conflict develops between flight members, they
  should take immediate action and then transmit their intentions as time permits (“Reno 2 is
  going high.”). They should also avoid attempting to direct other flight members because they
  may misunderstand or be unable to perform the directed course of action.
     6.2.4.1. Lead. Flying in the lead position allows the most flexibility to clear visually for
     the flight while interpreting traffic calls from ATC. Lead should focus on avoiding traffic
     and maintaining a safe altitude above the ground. If a wingman becomes blind or placed
     in a blind cone during tactical maneuvering, lead will assume responsibility for intraflight
     deconfliction. If a wingman calls “padlocked”, the wingman will maintain deconfliction.
     Lead will maneuver to alleviate the padlock situation.
     6.2.4.2. Wingmen:
         6.2.4.2.1. Normally, wingmen will ensure deconfliction. If any conflict exists
         between flight members, the wingman should maneuver predictably and then transmit
         specific intentions, affording the other aircraft a means to deconflict. For example, the
         wingman will transmit, Reno 2 is going low,” while crossing lead’s flightpath in a
         delayed turn nearly in-plane. The transmission indicates Reno 2 will be maneuvering
         below lead to remain well clear. Lead may then maneuver anywhere away from the
         wingman’s predictable POM. This technique prevents an aircraft from directing a
         course of action the other aircraft may be unable to perform.
         6.2.4.2.2. While maintaining position in formation, wingmen also have standard
         visual lookout responsibilities. If they discover a traffic conflict, they will initiate a
         directive call to eliminate any conflict. They will follow with a descriptive call to
         allow other flight members to acquire the traffic and maneuver appropriately. The
         descriptive call should follow the bearing, range, and altitude (BRA) format, for
         example, “Reno 21, climb, traffic, 12 o’clock, 1 mile, level.” Wingmen will also
         provide mutual support by maintaining SA through calls from controlling agencies
         describing the position of potential traffic conflicts.

   6.2.5. Visual Lookout. All flight members share visual lookout responsibilities. Excellent
   visual lookout depends on the ability to focus and refocus the eyes at appropriate ranges
   throughout the flight. Lookout priorities can change at a moment’s notice, depending on the
   mission, weather, threats, altitude, and formation. As a technique, tactical formation lookout
   priorities are depicted in Figure 6.1.
      6.2.5.1. Lead. In addition to briefing visual lookout responsibilities, lead must clear in
      the direction of the flight, focusing on avoiding traffic and maintaining a safe altitude
      above the ground. While employing in a tactical formation, lead shares responsibility
      with wingmen to visually clear for threats and traffic conflicts.
      6.2.5.2. Wingman. The wingman’s primary job is to execute disciplined visual lookout
      without sacrificing proper formation position or deconfliction responsibilities. Emphasis
      on deconfliction is directly related to aircraft proximity. For example, in fingertip,
      deconfliction requires more attention than in route or tactical. Beyond fingertip, the
      wingman must continue an active and systematic visual lookout with an emphasis on
      deconflicting with other flight members. Visual lookout priorities should be briefed by
      lead.

Figure 6.1. Wingman Visual Lookout Priorities in Tactical Formation.

      2




      6.2.5.3. Traffic Conflict. Initiate a directive call to eliminate immediate conflict. Follow-
      up the directive call with a descriptive call to allow other flight members to acquire the
      traffic and maneuver appropriately (“Buzz 21, climb, traffic 12 o’clock, 1 mile, level”).
      TCAS can aid in awareness of potential traffic conflicts but shouldn’t replace a vigilant
      visual lookout. Cross-checking the TCAS will help to focus your visual search as well as
      adjust your flightpath if necessary. If a TCAS intruder will pass within 1 mile or 1,000
      feet of the formation without visual contact, consider a directive call to maneuver the
      formation away.
   6.2.6. Fuel Awareness:
      6.2.6.1. All flight members must understand the factors to consider in determining joker
      and bingo fuel. Afterburner should not normally be used after reaching bingo fuel unless
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    61


       required for safety of flight. Flight members should increase their frequency of fuel
       checks during high fuel flow operations (for example, extended trail (ET), fluid
       maneuvering, and low altitude training). Lead must continually monitor the flight’s fuel
       state and adjust the profile, frequency of ops checks, and joker or bingo, as necessary.
       6.2.6.2. Unless already established on the return to base (RTB) phase of flight, wingmen
       will inform lead when reaching joker and bingo and receive an acknowledgment. If fuel
       drops below joker before informing lead, wingmen will reference the fuel state from
       bingo (“Iron 2 is bingo plus 1.”).
6.3. Radio Discipline and Procedures. Preface all communications to external agencies
(except for wingman acknowledgment) with the complete flight callsign. Communications are a
good indicator of flight discipline. Radio calls should normally begin with the full callsign
(“Ground, Sling 11, taxi 4 T-38s with Zulu” or “Reno 11, FENCE-in”). Voice recognition is
often a significant factor in tactical operations, but it should not be relied upon for primary
identification or communications. Intraflight radio calls to a specific position should reference
that position (“Bam 2, breakout.”). Normally, flights will operate on UHF- with outside agencies
and very high frequency (VHF) intraflight. As a technique, VHF can be referred to as “Aux”.
Setting split volumes could help determine which radio is being used by lead. Wingmen should
acknowledge “go” radio frequency changes with callsign and position (“Mega 21, cleared as
filed, squawk 2345, go channel 4,” acknowledgments: “2, 3, 4”); do not acknowledge radio
frequency changes initiated with “push.” In most cases, wingmen will mimic lead’s radio
transmissions.
   6.3.1. Lead. Ensure calls are clear and concise, and combine calls when practical. Delay
   frequency changes or flight check-in as necessary based on wingman proficiency or flight
   conditions.
   6.3.2. Wingmen. Change radio frequencies only when directed by lead. When performing a
   channel change, maintain your formation position unless otherwise prescribed or briefed.
   During task intensive situations such as IMC fingertip, if unable to change frequencies,
   maintain the proper position, and communicate on the intraflight frequency until the channel
   change can be accomplished. To minimize head-down time, a technique is to identify the
   raised “5” button on the UFCP. UHF preset frequencies may be incremented or decremented
   via the “2” or “8” buttons by feel and then visually confirmed. Wingmen will mimic the
   format of lead’s calls, but will provide accurate information (“Vega 31, Ops Check,” “1 is
   2.3, 5 Gs,” “2 is 2.1, 4.5 Gs,” etc.). Unless briefed, lead speaks for the flight when
   communicating with other agencies until flight split up. Wingmen will normally respond to
   all directive calls, unless briefed otherwise or if the wingman’s action is obvious. Query lead
   if calls are unclear.
6.4. Visual Signals:
   6.4.1. When using visual signals, use AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and Formation Flight
   Signals, to the maximum extent possible. Any nonstandard visual signals must be briefed.
   Do not hesitate to use the radio to avoid confusion. To minimize confusion, only the pilot at
   the controls should give visual signals to another aircraft in the formation. Visual signals
   must be clear and appropriate for range (for example, slight wing rock to reform from route
   versus large wing rock from tactical).
 62                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   6.4.2. Wingmen should acknowledge all visual signals. This acknowledgment may take the
   form of a head nod, a thumbs-up, or a change in formation position as appropriate. To
   minimize confusion, make your head nod big and clear. If a wingman does not acknowledge
   a signal, it should be interpreted as a request for clarification. Repeat the signal or make a
   radio call. Pass visual signals down the line, if appropriate.
6.5. Inflight Checks. Each flight member must accomplish required checks. Visual signals or
radio calls from lead may be used to initiate required checks for the appropriate phase of flight.
Wingmen should be given an appropriate amount of time to complete inflight checks. Lead
should adjust the formation position if necessary based on wingmen’s skill level. Lead should
also avoid any abrupt maneuvering to afford wingmen time to accomplish cockpit tasks without
compromising deconfliction abilities. While performing inflight checks, wingmen will continue
to prioritize their attention on lead, using only short glances to perform cockpit duties.
   6.5.1. Ops Check. When conducting ops checks on the radio, use the following format
   (“Buzz 31, Ops Check, 1 is 2.3, 5.5 Gs”, “2 is 2.2, 5.8 Gs”). If accomplishing an
   admin portion of the mission (departure, RTB, etc.), Gs need not be included. Upon
   completion of ops checks following high-G maneuvering (i.e., > 4 Gs), pilots may reset their
   G meter.
   6.5.2. FENCE Check. “FENCE-in” is normally directed by lead upon entering the
   MOA/route. “FENCE-out” will normally be accomplished exiting the MOA or route at
   lead’s direction. Items to accomplish will vary with the mission type and will change during
   follow-on training. You may accomplish items in any meaningful sequence or cockpit flow.
   Use the following format (“Bully 01 Fence In/out”, “2, 3, and 4”). The FENCE acronym is
   one good technique for accomplishing required items in UFT and is explained as follows:
       6.5.2.1. Fire Control - Master Arm and EGI Master Mode (NAV, air-to-air [A/A],
       or air-to-ground [A/G])
       6.5.2.2. Emitters - TCAS, A/A TACAN, and RALT
       6.5.2.3. NAVAIDS - HSD and area setup
       6.5.2.4. Camera - Confirm VTR on
       6.5.2.5. Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) - CMD
6.6. Lead Changes. Lead changes require a clear transfer of responsibilities from one flight
member to another. During the lead change, both pilots must monitor the other aircraft to
ensure separation is maintained.
   6.6.1. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft than a normal fingertip
   or route position, or greater than 30° aft from line abreast. Flight or element leads will not
   initiate a lead change unless the aircraft assuming the lead is in a position from which the
   lead change can be safely initiated and visual contact maintained. When a lead change is
   done from a close formation, the designated wingman moves out and forward to ensure
   wingtip separation while primarily focusing attention on lead. The wingman accepts the lead
   after reaching lead’s 3/9 line and assumes lead responsibilities. As a technique, reference the
   canopy bow between the FCP and RCP to assess 3/9 line. The old lead will assume wingman
   responsibilities. Unless changed by the new lead, the formation will remain in the formation
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   63


   from which the position change was initiated. For example, if the position change was
   initiated from route, the flight will remain in route.
       6.6.1.1. Lead Change Comm Example from Tactical.
 Fiend 01: “Fiend 2, you have the lead on the left/right.”
 Fiend 02: “Fiend 2 has the lead on the left/right.”
   6.6.2. Three- and four-ship lead changes will be accomplished over the radio, and the new
   lead will acknowledge.
       6.6.2.1. 4-Ship Lead Change Comm Example.
Octane 01: “Octane 3, you have the lead on the left/right.”
Octane 03: “Octane 3 has the lead on the left/right.”
6.7. Ground Operations:
   6.7.1. Chocks. Engine start and check-in procedures will be IAW unit standards or as
   briefed. If delays occur, inform the flight lead as soon as possible but not later than the
   briefed check-in time. If visual, pass a thumbs-up to lead when ready.
   6.7.2. Taxi. Lead should taxi at a speed that allows wingmen to attain proper spacing.
   Wingmen will match lead’s configuration, inspect each other for proper configuration
   and abnormalities prior to takeoff, and continue inspecting throughout the sortie. An
   approximate reference for 150-foot staggered spacing is the 2.5-degree pitch-line just under
   the main gear of the preceding aircraft.
   6.7.3. Runway Lineup (Two- and Four-Ship). Runway lineup is normally determined by
   wind direction and other factors such as direction of traffic and weather turn out. Lead will
   ensure wingmen have sufficient room to maneuver into position. Minimum wingtip spacing
   is 10 feet wingtip clearance, but may be wider as desired or required. On the runway, a head
   nod is used for visual signals instead of a thumbs-up. Note: Always ensure 50 feet of
   wingtip spacing within an element if either crew is solo.
       6.7.3.1. Two-Ship. Each aircraft will usually take the center of its half of the runway.
       Wing will line up lead’s main gear doors as a fore and aft reference (Figure 6.2). Once in
       position with canopy closed, the wingman will give lead a head nod to signal ready for
       engine run-up.
       6.7.3.2. Three-Ship. Normal three-ship lineup is echelon (Figure 6.2). If required
       however, three-ship formations may use any four-ship lineup as briefed. Note: Always
       ensure 50 feet of wingtip spacing between adjacent aircraft if either crew is solo.

Figure 6.2. Two-Ship/Three-Ship Runway Lineup.




      6.7.3.3. Four-Ship. Number 3 or 4 can line up in the slot. In either case, lead should line
      up as far to the side of the runway as practical. Number 2 will place the wingtip closest to
      lead on the centerline and line up the gear doors.
         6.7.3.3.1. Number 3 in the Slot. Normally a four-ship lineup will have number 3 in
         the slot. Number 3 lines up between lead and number 2, pushing forward to clearly
         see number 2’s visual signal and maintaining nose-tail clearances. Number 4 will
         line up offset from number 2’s jet blast while aligning the gear door’s of number 3
         (Figure 6.3).
         6.7.3.3.2. Number 4 in the Slot. Number 3 will line up with wingtip clearance on
         Number 2 in echelon position. Number 4 will pull in between lead and number 2 with
         nose-tail clearance (Figure 6.3).
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   65


Figure 6.3. Four-Ship Runway Lineup.




          6.7.3.3.3. Four-Ship Signals. Number 4 will use a head nod to signal ready for
          engine run-up, and the signal will be relayed up the line (4—3—2). Number 3 may
          need to relay the ready signal via the radio if the lead element is displaced down the
          runway.
   6.7.4. Engine Run-up. Once all aircraft have signaled “ready,” lead may direct run-up
   visually or over the radio. During the engine run-up, continue to primarily focus your
   attention outside the aircraft with only short glances inside the cockpit. Signal ready for
   takeoff with head nods up the line. If three is unable to see two for any reason, call “ready”
   after receiving four’s head nod.
6.8. Formation Takeoff:
   6.8.1. Lead:
      6.8.1.1. A helmet tap is the preparatory command for brake release and selecting MAX
      afterburner. The execution command is a head nod. As your chin hits your chest,
      simultaneously release brakes and select MAX, reduce power slightly on both engines
      (approximately 60 percent nozzles but not less than minimum afterburner), and verify
      both afterburners have lit.
      6.8.1.2. Confirm wingman is safely airborne before retracting the gear and flaps. The
      visual signal for gear retraction is the gear doors opening. Begin a smooth power
      reduction out of MAX between 220 and 280 KCAS, and terminate afterburner operation
      by 300 KCAS. Monitor wingman throughout the takeoff. Pay close attention to airspeed
      to prevent the possibility of overspeeding gear or flaps during the takeoff.
   6.8.2. Wingmen:
 66                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


      6.8.2.1. Monitor lead for the preparatory and execution signals. Release the brakes and
      aggressively advance the throttles to MAX afterburner when lead’s chin hits his or her
      chest. Tap brakes as required to maintain position initially. Do not ride the brakes in an
      attempt to stay behind the lead aircraft. Confirm two good afterburner lights.
      6.8.2.2. If a substantial power advantage or disadvantage is apparent, request one
      increase or decrease in power (for example, “Rocky 3, give me one/push it up.”). Use
      caution to prevent pulling the throttles out of afterburner. If wing cannot remain in
      position (either overrunning lead or falling behind) with power set between minimum
      and MAX afterburner, wing should check both throttles in MAX, maintain separation
      from lead, and perform a separate takeoff.
      6.8.2.3. Rotate with lead’s aircraft and concentrate on maintaining a proper position.
      Normally, the first indication of lead’s rotation will be the movement of the stabilator or
      the extension of the nose gear strut. Duplicate lead’s pitch attitude for lift-off.
      6.8.2.4. When both aircraft are airborne, maintain a stacked-level position until retracting
      the gear and flaps. The visual signal for gear retraction is lead’s gear doors opening.
      Confirm the gear and flaps are retracted then move into fingertip.
      6.8.2.5. After takeoff, if ahead of lead, check slightly away from lead, while continuing
      to fly off lead, if possible. Lead may pass the lead to wing if conditions warrant.
   6.8.3. Interval Takeoff. When ready for takeoff, lead will release the brakes and perform a
   takeoff. Wingmen will delay brake release a minimum of 10 seconds for a single aircraft or
   15 seconds for an element takeoff after the preceding aircraft. If not executing a 2+2 interval
   takeoff, each aircraft should steer toward (but not cross) the center of the runway after the
   start of the takeoff roll. To help expedite the rejoin, lead should terminate afterburner early
   (220 knots minimum), continue to accelerate to 300 KCAS in MIL power, and climb at a
   reduced power setting. Unless briefed otherwise, number 2 will rejoin to the inside of the
   first turn out of traffic. If necessary, coordinate for an intermediate level-off to maintain
   visual VMC until wingmen are joined. Wingmen should delay coming out of afterburner
   until sufficient overtake is achieved.
   6.8.4. Rolling Interval Takeoff. When cleared for takeoff, lead will taxi into position and
   perform a normal single-ship rolling takeoff then follow the procedures above. After takeoff
   has been initiated by lead, wing will taxi into position and perform a normal single-ship
   rolling takeoff with a minimum of 10 seconds interval.
6.9. Instrument Trail Departure:
   6.9.1. When flying an instrument trail departure, the first priority is to follow basic
   instrument flying procedures. Strictly adhere to the briefed climb speeds, power settings,
   altitudes, headings, and turn points. All aircraft will use 30 degrees of bank for all turns.
   Takeoff spacing will be no less than 20 seconds. Unless briefed otherwise, each aircraft or
   element will climb at 300 KCAS with 600 degrees EGT and maintain briefed spacing until
   all aircraft have reached VMC and are cleared to rejoin.
   6.9.2. Until join-up, each pilot or element lead will call with altitude and heading when
   passing multiples of 5,000 feet and when initiating any altitude or heading change. As a
   technique, DME can be added to this call if it enhances situational awareness. Until visual
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                        67


   contact, each pilot or element will maintain at least 1,000 feet of vertical separation from
   the preceding aircraft or element except where departure instructions specifically prohibit
   compliance. If 1,000 feet of separation prevents the wingmen from complying with the
   minimum safe altitude, lead may reduce the vertical separation to 500 feet.
   6.9.3. If a visual join-up at level-off is not possible, lead should request 1,000 feet of altitude
   separation for each succeeding aircraft or element. Wingmen will call visual on preceding
   aircraft and rejoin only after directed by flight lead. If local procedures allow, use the
   TCAS to aid in enhancing positional awareness on all formation members. Do not allow this
   additional SA tool to detract from precisely flying instrument trail departure procedures.
6.10. Area, MOA, or Route:
   6.10.1. G-Awareness Exercise. Formation G-awareness exercises should be flown from line-
   abreast tactical formation (in four-ship wall or box formations only) as described in
   paragraph 6.6. Normally, perform two 180-degree turns for formation G-awareness exercises.
   Lead is responsible for planning the exercise to ensure a minimum of 4,000 feet
   lateral separation for all formation members. Emphasis should be on the AGSM, G-
   awareness, and correct operation of equipment, not on perfect formation position.
   6.10.2. After completion of the G-awareness exercise, wingmen will deconflict, select MIL
   power, attain 350 KCAS, and regain tactical formation position.
6.11. Knock-It-Off (KIO) and Terminate Procedures. Use KIO or terminate procedures to
direct aircraft to cease maneuvering. A KIO or terminate applies to any phase of flight and all
types of missions. Refer to AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3, as supplemented.
   6.11.1. Any flight member can initiate a KIO or terminate. Make directive radio calls if
   danger is imminent. Call KIO when safety of flight is a factor or where doubt or
   confusion exists. Call terminate when safety of flight is not a factor.
   6.11.2. Initiation of a KIO or terminate will start with flight callsign, followed by each
   flight members transmitting his or her position number—in order—with “knock-it-off” or
   “terminate”. Aircraft with radio failure will signal KIO with a continuous wing rock.
   6.11.3. If any flight member fails to respond correctly, the sequence should be initiated
   again. For example, if anyone transmits, “Iron 11, knock-it-off”, all flight members will
   respond as follows: “Iron 1 knock-it-off”, “Iron 2 knock-it-off”, “Iron 3 knock-it-off”, “Iron
   4 knock-it-off”. When hearing a KIO or terminate call, or observing a continuous wing rock,
   all participating aircrew will clear the flightpath, cease current maneuvering, climb or
   descend to a prebriefed safe altitude (1,000 feet AGL minimum), and acknowledge with
   callsign or a wing rock. If able, the aircraft that initiated the KIO or terminate will give the
   reason after the KIO drill is complete, if not obvious (for example, “Iron 2 engine flameout”).
   Lead will be directive before resuming maneuvers.
6.12. Recovery:
   6.12.1. Battle Damage (BD) Check:
       6.12.1.1. Perform a BD check when directed by the lead aircraft from either fingertip or
       route. The signal is either a radio call or a visual “checkmark” signal. To perform the
       check, make a slight check turn away from lead (fingertip), and climb only as necessary
       to visually inspect the top of the near side of the aircraft. Continue the inspection by
68                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


     dropping down to inspect the lower side of the aircraft; perform a cross under; and
     inspect the lower and upper side of the opposite side of the aircraft. Upon completion,
     remain on that side and assume the proper formation position. While inspecting the other
     aircraft, look for any damage, leaks, missing panels, or any irregularities.
     6.12.1.2. During the BD check, the aircraft fulfilling appropriate lead responsibilities
     must navigate and clear for the formation (NAV lead) while the wingman maintains
     deconfliction within the formation.
     6.12.1.3. Use the intraflight radio to pass discrepancies; otherwise, pass a thumbs-up
     after returning to the formation position (fingertip/route) from where the check started.
     The lead aircraft then passes the lead to the wingman and performs a BD check.
     6.12.1.4. For a three- or four-ship BD check, lead will direct number 2 to check the
     flight. All other aircraft will maintain position while number 2 checks the entire
     formation and returns to the original position. When number 2 is in position, number 3
     (three-ship) or number 4 (four-ship) is automatically cleared to check number 2.
  6.12.2. Splitting the Flight. When splitting the flight becomes necessary, lead will verify
  that wingmen have a positive fix from which to navigate and coordinate with ATC for
  separate clearances.
  6.12.3. Formation Approach and Landing. Normally, the best wingman consideration a lead
  can offer is to fly the best single-ship approach and landing possible. Lead will position the
  wingman on the upwind side of the runway if crosswinds are greater than 5 knots. Gear
  and full flaps are normally lowered with one visual signal or radio call unless briefed
  otherwise. Both pilots should check their own aircraft and the other aircraft then pass a
  thumbs-up if all indications are normal.
     6.12.3.1. Lead. After confirming a safe gear indication for both aircraft, transmit a “gear
     down” call for the flight. After reaching VMC and when able to maintain visual contact
     with the runway on short final, line up with the center of the appropriate side, and
     establish an aimpoint that will allow a touchdown approximately 500 to 1,000 feet
     beyond the threshold. Unless one aircraft will circle, fly the final approach airspeed for
     the heaviest aircraft. If either aircraft will circle from the approach, configure with 60
     percent flaps and final turn airspeed for the heaviest aircraft.
     6.12.3.2. Wing:
         6.12.3.2.1. Fly normal fingertip references until on glidepath. Assume the “stack
         level” position when VMC or on glidepath (whichever occurs later), or as briefed.
         The vertical reference for stacking level is to place the helmet of the front cockpit
         pilot in the lead aircraft on the horizon. The visual reference for fore and aft is the
         same for a formation takeoff (lead’s gear doors lined up). Lateral spacing ranging
         from 10-feet to 50-feet wingtip clearance should be adequate in all cases, provided
         the lead aircraft lands near the center of his or her side of the runway. Attempt to
         stabilize at a given spacing in the 10- to 50- foot range, as briefed or as directed by
         other guidance (syllabus or unit standards). See Table 6.1 for front and rear cockpit
         references for wingtip clearances of 10 feet, 25 feet, and 50 feet.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     69

           6.12.3.2.2. Lead is the primary reference for the wing landing. Cross-check the
           runway on short final to ensure proper alignment, and then fly the proper position off
           lead throughout the flare and touchdown. Once on the runway, maintain lateral
           spacing, use normal braking techniques, and in no case allow your aircraft to drift
           across the runway centerline.
           6.12.3.2.3. After establishing nose-tail separation and under control, clear to the cold
           side of the runway. If landing on the cold side of the runway, turn off the landing
           light (at approximately taxi speed) to clear lead to the cold side.
           6.12.3.2.4. If you overrun lead, accept the overrun and maintain the appropriate side
           of the runway. The most important consideration is wingtip clearance. Lead may pass
           the lead over the radio if conditions warrant.
    6.12.4. Formation VMC Drag. These procedures may be used to achieve minimum runway
    separation of 3,000 feet between aircraft in formation when conditions prevent
    accomplishing a wing landing or visual flight rules (VFR) traffic pattern and landing. Prior to
    directing the formation to drag under instrument flight rules (IFR), lead will slow to 250
    KCAS and coordinate with the appropriate ATC agency for nonstandard formation during
    the remainder of the approach. Lead will ensure that all aircraft will be able to maintain
    VMC from the drag point to landing before directing the formation to drag.
       6.12.4.1. The latest drag point will be 8 miles from the runway. On instrument final
       approaches, the drag is normally accomplished so as to establish separation prior to the
       final approach fix or glideslope intercept.
       6.12.4.2. When lead directs the formation to drag, wing will select idle and extend speed
       brakes until airspeed is below 240 KCAS, then select landing gear down, flaps 60 or 100
       percent, and speed brakes up. Wing will set TCAS appropriately as task management
       permits.
       6.12.4.3. The wingman will maintain final approach airspeed minimum and remain
       within standard formation parameters.
       6.12.4.4. Lead will maintain 250 KCAS until 5 miles from the runway, then select idle
       power and speed brakes down until below 240 KCAS. Below 240 KCAS, lead will select
       landing gear down, and flaps 60 or 100 percent, and speed brakes up.
 70                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       6.12.4.5. Lead will maintain a minimum of 180 KCAS until 3 miles from the runway,
       and then slow to final approach speed.
       6.12.4.6. Wingmen will not fly below final approach airspeed and s-turns will not be
       used to gain or maintain separation while on final.
   6.12.5. Traffic Pattern:
       6.12.5.1. Once established in the VFR overhead traffic pattern, turns away from wing
       will normally be in echelon. On or before turning initial, lead should place wingmen on
       the side opposite the direction of the break. Initial is usually flown in fingertip formation;
       route formation is more prudent with reported bird activity or other hazards; tactical
       initial may be flown IAW local guidance.
       6.12.5.2. Lead should break at the beginning of the break zone. Wingmen will delay 5
       seconds before initiating the break. This normally provides a minimum of 3,000 feet
       spacing. If greater spacing is required, the wingmen will delay the break (8 seconds
       normally provides 6,000 feet of spacing). When approaching the perch point, wingmen
       will cross-check the runway and lead to ensure proper spacing from both.
       6.12.5.3. In a four-ship, lead and number 2 should avoid slowing so rapidly that trailing
       wingmen cannot maintain sufficient spacing.

Section 6B—Basic Formation

6.13. Fingertip:
   6.13.1. Fingertip formation (Figure 6.4) is used for weather penetration, airfield arrivals and
   departures, and show formations. Wing will maintain wingtip clearance while flying a
   position from which the front cockpit (FCP) pilot looks down the leading edge of lead’s
   wing. An FCP pilot position abeam the slab bolt provides approximately 3 feet of wingtip
   separation. “(Note: “Abeam the slab bolt” implies visually sighting along a line from the
   FCP to the front slab tip to the slab bolt as shown in Figure 6.5.) From the rear cockpit
   (RCP), lining up the position light with a point on the intake half way between the wing root
   and the lower leading edge of the intake (with head abeam the trailing edge of the burner
   cans) provides3 feet of wingtip clearance.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     71


Figure 6.4. Two-Ship Fingertip.




   6.13.2. Wingwork Exercise. When accomplishing the wingwork exercise, fly a series of
   modified lazy eight maneuvers, using up to 3 Gs and 90 degrees of bank in an airspeed
   range of approximately 200 to 400 KCAS. Lead will emphasize clearing, smoothness, and
   providing a stable platform with consistent, predictable roll rates and no sudden changes in
   backstick pressure. Wing will use small throttle or stick movements and trim to maintain
   position, while avoiding the tendency to stare at any one spot. Practice using all of lead’s
   aircraft as a reference.
   6.13.3. When flying fingertip in a 3- or four-ship formation, there is no difference for
   numbers 2 and 3. Number 4 will fly the normal fingertip position and strive to line up the
   helmets of numbers 1 and 3. When number 3 is adjusting, number 4 should consider flying a
   stable position off number 1 while monitoring and maintaining lateral separation from
   number 3.
6.14. Route Formation. A route formation (Figure 6.5) is flown to enhance clearing and visual
lookout, increase flight maneuverability, and ease the completion of inflight checks, radio
changes, and other cockpit tasks. Lead will send wingmen to route with a radio call or visual
signal. Route is flown from two ship-widths of spacing out to approximately 500 feet. Fly no
farther aft than the extended fingertip line, no farther forward than line abreast, and, when wings
level, maintain a level stack. On the inside of a turn, stack below lead’s POM only as necessary
to keep lead in sight. On the outside of a turn, maintain the same vertical references used in
echelon. In a three- or four-ship formation, number 2 sets lateral spacing for the formation.
Number 3 should fly line abreast with number 2, matching lateral spacing from number 1.
Number 4 should line up the helmets of numbers 3 and 1. Lead should limit bank angle to 60
degrees with wingmen in route. During a climb, the wingman should strive to stack slightly high
signaling to lead that the wingman has more power available.
 72                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


Figure 6.5. Route Formation.




6.15. Chase. Chase is used for a variety of reasons, including performance assessment and
assistance during an emergency. Safety chase observers will maneuver in a 30- to 60-degree
aspect cone out to 1,000 feet. The chase pilot is primarily responsible for aircraft separation.
6.16. Echelon:
   6.16.1. Echelon is a multiship formation where all wingmen are on the same side of the
   formation. Lead directs the flight into echelon by dipping a wing in the desired direction or
   making a radio call (“Sling, echelon left/right”).
   6.16.2. Unless prebriefed (like turns in the VFR overhead pattern), lead normally directs
   echelon turns with a radio call or visual signal for two-ship formations. In a three- or four-
   ship formation, an echelon turn is implied when the wingmen are on the same side. All
   aircraft must be very aware of the importance of smooth corrections, positive backstick
   pressure, and the need to avoid unloading while in the turn.
   6.16.3. Echelon turns can be performed at a variety of airspeeds. A common technique as
   lead is to initiate echelon turns between 300 to 350 KCAS and to minimize throttle
   movements during the turn in order to give the wingmen a more stable platform to follow.
   6.16.4. Except for very gentle turns into the echelon, always turn away from the echelon and
   plan to limit bank to 60 degrees maximum. Number 2 should match lead’s roll rates. Once
   established in a turn, the horizon should split lead’s lower intake (Figure 6.6). As in fingertip,
   the FCP pilot’s helmet should be abeam the slab bolt. Use power to make fore/aft
   corrections, backstick pressure to maintain horizontal spacing, and bank to make corrections
   up or down.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                73


   6.16.5. When in the number 3 or 4 position, the basic references are the same as those for
   number 2. However, you should add lead’s position in relation to the horizon to your cross-
   check, so as not to over adjust for every correction number 2 or 3 makes.

Figure 6.6. Echelon Turn.




6.17. Crossunder:
   6.17.1. Two-Ship Crossunder. Except for prebriefed events (like the BD check), lead
   normally directs a crossunder with a radio call or visual signal. When using a wing dip
   signal, the size of lead’s signal should be appropriate for the distance to the wingman. On
   lead’s signal, the wingman reduces power as required until a small forward line-of-sight
   (LOS) rate develops. The wingman will move back and slightly below lead’s POM and add
   power to stop lead’s forward LOS. He or she will then move across and behind lead with a
   minimum of nose-tail clearance, adding power as required so as not to fall any further
   behind. Once on the opposite side and with wingtip clearance, the wingman will add power
   to move up and forward into fingertip (Figure 6.7).

Figure 6.7. Crossunder.
 74                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   6.17.2. Four-Ship Fingertip Crossunder. In a four-ship fingertip or route formation, a wing
   dip toward number 2 signals a crossunder for numbers 3 and 4, and a wing dip toward
   number 3 signals a crossunder for number 2. If number 2 is crossing to the side that numbers
   3 and 4 are on, number 3 should smoothly move out to create room for number 2. Number 2
   begins a normal crossunder, but must ensure adequate spacing before crossing lead’s 6
   o’clock. As number 2 attains position, number 3 begins flying off number 2 while
   referencing lead. If numbers 3 and 4 are crossing simultaneously, number 3 begins smoothly
   dropping down and aft in a normal crossunder and establishes nose-tail clearance off number
   2 before crossing. As number 3 begins the crossunder, number 4 performs a crossunder on
   number 3, normally crossing number 3's 6 o’clock as number 3 crosses behind lead. Number
   4 must anticipate LOS rates and power changes to avoid falling aft.
   6.17.3. Four-Ship Echelon Crossunder. In a four-ship echelon formation, lead's radio call or
   wing dip (always away from the echelon) directs the entire formation to change sides.
   Ideally, as number 2 begins the crossunder, all the wingmen move together. The entire
   formation is in a straight line as the wingmen cross lead's 6 o'clock. Then all the wingmen
   assume their position on the other side of lead. A wing dip toward the echelon is
   meaningless. Any other formation change, like returning to fingertip, requires a radio call.
6.18. Pitchout:
   6.18.1. The purpose of a pitchout is to provide spacing for a rejoin or follow-on
   maneuvering. After the signal or radio call, lead clears and then turns away from the
   wingman, using G forces to attain 300 KCAS unless briefed or directed otherwise. Lead will
   normally fly a level turn of about 180 degrees. However, he or she may climb, descend, and
   (or) adjust the degrees of turn as necessary for weather, area orientation, or energy
   management. Lead will allow enough time for the wingmen to complete the pitchout, and
   then direct the rejoin with a radio call or visual signal.
   6.18.2. Wingmen keep lead or the leading aircraft in sight, delay 5 seconds (or as briefed),
   and then turn to follow, using about the same bank angle and G loading. A 5-second delay
   provides approximately 1 nm spacing. After turning approximately 90 degrees, the wingman
   will vary bank angle and backstick pressure as necessary to attain desired spacing. He or she
   will rollout behind and slightly below lead or the preceding aircraft, maintaining 300 KCAS
   until directed to rejoin.
6.19. Take Spacing:
   6.19.1. Take spacing is normally used to increase range when reversing the direction of the
   flight is not practical (for example, practice rejoins). When these procedures are not specified
   in unit standards, they must be thoroughly prebriefed. These are VMC-only maneuvers.
   6.19.2. Lead will direct the wingman to take spacing with a prebriefed visual signal or radio
   call. The wingman will acknowledge with a radio call or by maneuvering away from lead to
   take spacing. Spacing can be achieved with a combination of wingman maneuvers, wingman
   deceleration, and lead acceleration.
   6.19.3. One technique, usually done at 300 KCAS, is to direct the wingman to take spacing,
   which the wingman does by performing a series of check turns behind and below lead’s jet
   wash. When the desired spacing is achieved, the wingman calls “ready”. If the plan is for a
   three- or four-ship to take spacing, procedures for each aircraft should be thoroughly briefed.

6.20. Practice Lost Wingman Exercise. This exercise exposes new pilots to procedures that
are critical during lost wingman scenarios in actual instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).
(Practice this exercise in two-ship formation, in day VMC, using the procedures in AFI 11-2T-
38, Volume 3.) Lead will initiate a practice lost wingman exercise with a radio call. Lead will
acknowledge the wingman’s “practice lost wingman” radio call by transmitting altitude, heading,
airspeed, and other parameters as appropriate. The wingman will execute the appropriate
procedures, to include a radio call. The wingman may signify completion of the exercise (as
determined and briefed by the flight lead) by calling visual. Note: The IP or safety observer in
the wing aircraft will monitor lead to ensure separation throughout the exercise.
Practice Lost Wingman Comm Example.
Bully 01: “Bully 2, Go practice lost wingman.”
Bully 02: “2”. “Bully 2 is practice lost wingman.”
Bully 01: “Bully 1, wings level, 15k, heading 350, 300 kts.”
Bully 02: “Bully 2 visual.”
6.21. Rejoins:
   6.21.1. Overview:
       6.21.1.1. The purpose of a rejoin is to get the flight back together safely and efficiently.
       Lead will initiate rejoins with a radio call or a visual signal (wing rock) and, when
       necessary for energy management or area orientation, may use slight climbs or descents
       during the rejoin. Lead should consider initiating the rejoin via a radio call, especially
       when lead cannot see wingmen.
       6.21.1.2. Lead should monitor wingmen closely during all rejoins. Airspeeds and bank
       angles are normally prebriefed or unit standard. Lead should consider making a radio call
       if flying a different airspeed or bank angle. Wingmen should always use LOS cues and
       airspeed awareness when rejoining.
       6.21.1.3. For standard rejoins from basic formation positions (other than tactical), lead
       will maintain 300 KCAS, and 30 degrees of bank, if turning. For standard rejoins from
       tactical, lead will maintain 350 KCAS, and 45 degrees of bank, if turning. The rejoin
       discussions in paragraphs 6.21.2 and 6.21.3 apply to rejoins from all formation positions,
       including the terminal phases of tactical rejoins. (The initial phase of tactical rejoins is
       discussed in Section 6C.)
   6.21.2. Straight-Ahead Rejoin:
       6.21.2.1. Straight-ahead rejoins can be accomplished from a variety of situations,
       including pitchouts, take spacing, and instrument trail. A standard straight-ahead rejoin is
       to the left wing for number 2 and the right wing for numbers 3 and 4.
       6.21.2.2. When initiated from a position behind lead (from a maneuver that places
       wingmen in trail at lead’s 6 o’clock), fly to a position slightly below and at approximately
       0 degree aspect angle (AA) from lead, avoiding lead’s and preceding wingmen’s jet
       wash. Using power for closure, 50 knots of overtake is usually adequate when starting
       from 1 nm. Approaching 2,000 feet, modulate power to arrive at 2,000 feet with
       approximately 20 to 30 knots of overtake. At 2,000 feet lead’s wingspan is
       approximately 13 mils (the width of the HUD bore sight/gun cross. See Attachment
76                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


     2, Stadiametric Ranging. At approximately 1,500 feet behind lead, the figure-eight design
     of the two tailpipes is visible, but two separate engines are not distinguishable. At this
     point, bid away from lead’s 6 o’clock position to a route position, on the side to be
     rejoined to, and continue to reduce overtake. A technique to reduce overtake at this point
     is to retard your throttles at a rate equal to the aft LOS rate of lead on the canopy, such
     that lead’s LOS freezes as you arrive in the route position. Use speed brakes as required
     to assist in slowing the LOS rate. Then, with your overtake under control, close from
     route to fingertip.
     6.21.2.3. During a rejoin in a climb, the aircraft is more responsive to throttle
     reductions when decreasing overtake and slowing lead’s aft LOS rate on the canopy
     compared to during a level-flight rejoin. A common error is for wing to stagnate during a
     climbing rejoin prior to reaching the fore/aft references for the route position. To prevent
     this, you should begin to reduce overtake later and the throttle movement should be
     slower and less than what is required during a level-flight rejoin. During a descending
     rejoin, the opposite is true. The aircraft is less responsive to throttle reductions when
     decreasing overtake and slowing lead’s aft LOS rate on the canopy compared to a level-
     flight rejoin. A common error during the descending rejoin is for wing to overshoot the
     fore/aft references for the route position. Therefore, you should begin to reduce overtake
     sooner, and the throttle movement should be faster and more than what is required during
     a level flight rejoin.
     6.21.2.4. For three-ship and four-ship formations, aircraft will rejoin in the proper
     numerical sequence. Maintain a minimum of 500 feet spacing from the preceding
     aircraft until that aircraft has stabilized in route. Each aircrew will monitor the
     preceding aircraft’s rejoin for excessive closure and anticipate overshoot and breakout
     situations from preceding aircraft.
  6.21.3. Turning Rejoins:
     6.21.3.1. Rejoins to Number 2 (Inside the Turn):
         6.21.3.1.1. The visual signal for a turning rejoin is also a wing rock with the first
         wing dip in the direction of the rejoin. Because turning rejoins can be accomplished
         from many different positions, wingmen must initially assess the combinations of
         range, aspect, energy state, and heading crossing angle (HCA) to establish appropriate
         AA, pursuit curves, and overtake airspeeds.
         6.21.3.1.2. After the rejoin signal and lead’s turn, the wingman begins a turn in the
         same direction to create lead pursuit. Simultaneously establish vertical separation,
         establish approximately 30 knots of airspeed overtake, and adjust lead and lag pursuit
         to maintain moderate aspect angle.
         6.21.3.1.3. Use the airspeed indicator and visual cues to judge closure on lead.
         Control closure by adjusting the pursuit curve (aspect angle) and the power. Use the
         speed brakes as needed, but plan the rejoin so that speed brakes are not required to
         complete the rejoin. Complete the rejoin to fingertip similar to reforming from the
         route position.
         6.21.3.1.4. During a turning rejoin, wingmen should establish and maintain about 50
         feet of vertical separation below lead’s POM until stabilized in route formation. Other
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     77


          airspeed aspect combinations may be used if needed to complete the rejoins.
          Regardless of the rejoin combinations, airspeeds should be less than 50 knots
          overtake for low aspect rejoins, 30 knots for medium aspect rejoins, and 10 knots for
          high aspect rejoins when within 3,000 feet of lead. Avoid the tendency to reduce
          closure by increasing G inside the turn.
      6.21.3.2. Rejoins to Number 3 or Number 4 (Outside the Turn). For three-ship and four-
      ship formations, aircraft will rejoin in the proper numerical sequence. Number 2 rejoins
      to the inside of the turn, and numbers 3 and 4 rejoin to the outside. When the flight lead
      uses a visual signal to initiate the rejoin, each wingman will repeat the signal for aircraft
      in trail. Maintain a minimum of 500 feet spacing from the preceding aircraft until that
      aircraft has stabilized in route. Rejoining aircraft will cross below the preceding
      aircraft’s jet wash with a minimum of nose-tail clearance. Each aircrew will monitor
      the preceding aircraft’s rejoin for excessive closure and anticipate overshoot and breakout
      situations from preceding aircraft.
      6.21.3.3. Figure 6.8 shows three different visual references for various AA rejoins. View
      B (approximately 45 degree AA) is the preferred picture to maintain throughout the
      rejoin. This AA optimizes the use of airspeed and geometry while allowing flight lead the
      flexibility to maneuver the formation as necessary. View C (approximately 60 degrees
      AA) should be avoided because it demands too much flight lead monitoring, and view A
      (approximately 30 degrees AA) does not maximize the benefit of geometry or lead
      pursuit and potentially wastes fuel in a “tail chase”.

Figure 6.8. Various Aspect Views.




6.22. Overshoots:
   6.22.1. Overview. The purpose of an overshoot is to safely dissipate excessive airspeed or
   decrease excessive angular overtake during a rejoin. Wingmen must not delay the overshoot
   in an unusually aggressive attempt to “save” a rejoin. Keep lead and the preceding aircraft in
   sight at all times during any overshoot.
   6.22.2. Straight-Ahead Rejoin Overshoot. A properly executed straight-ahead rejoin with
   excessive closure (VC) will result in a pure airspeed overshoot several ship-widths out, with
   a slight diverging vector. Select idle and speed brakes (if required) as soon as excess overtake
   is recognized. Guard against turning back into lead while looking over your shoulder. A
 78                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   small, controllable 3/9 line overshoot is easily managed and can still result in an efficient
   rejoin. Retract the speed brakes and increase power just prior to achieving co-airspeed
   (stagnant LOS) to prevent falling aft.
   6.22.3. Turning Rejoin Overshoot:
      6.22.3.1. A properly executed turning rejoin with excessive VC will result in a
      combination airspeed- aspect overshoot in a POM about 50 feet below lead. The decision
      to overshoot should be made early so the wingman crosses lead’s low 6 o’clock with a
      minimum of approximately two ship lengths spacing. In all cases, ensure nose-tail
      separation can be maintained. Select idle and speed brakes as required, depending on
      excess airspeed.
      6.22.3.2. Once outside the turn, use bank and backstick pressure as necessary to stabilize
      in route echelon position. During the overshoot, fly no higher than route echelon. The
      more airspeed and (or) angle-off, the more turn radius required to solve the problem. In
      addition, a co-speed overshoot due to an angular problem may not require flying outside
      of lead’s turn circle. Instead, flying to lead’s low six o’clock may allow enough forward
      visibility to safely align fuselages and stop the overshoot. When range, LOS, and angle-
      off are under control, return to the inside of lead’s turn, reestablish an appropriate aspect
      angle, and complete the rejoin to fingertip.
   6.22.4. Three- and Four-Ship Overshoot Deconfliction. As with a rejoin, maintain a
   minimum of 500 feet spacing from the preceding aircraft until it has completed the
   overshoot and is stabilized. If overshooting, preceding aircraft will inform the other
   wingmen with a radio call.
6.23. Breakout:
   6.23.1. When in close proximity to another aircraft, break out when (1) directed by lead, (2)
   unable to maintain sight of lead, (3) unable to rejoin or remain in formation without
   crossing under or in front of lead, or (4) any time your presence constitutes a hazard to the
   formation. In UFT and PIT, breakouts are also flown as training exercises.
   6.23.2. For breakouts, predictability is critical for all players. Lead should continue the
   current maneuver with the current power setting if possible. However, if the wingman is in
   sight, maneuvering to obtain, increase, or guarantee separation may also be appropriate or
   necessary. In all cases, lead should try to stay visual and be directive with the wingman as
   appropriate (for example, “Pistol 2 rollout, visual is your right 2 o’clock high”, “rejoin, left
   turning”, etc.).
   6.23.3. Wingmen should clear in the direction of the breakout, maneuver to ensure safe
   separation from other aircraft, and notify lead, if required, when conditions permit. Once safe
   separation is assured, the wingman may rollout to attempt to regain the visual. After the
   wingman calls visual, lead will direct him or her to the desired formation.
   6.23.4. Control inputs can vary anywhere from maximum rate stick deflection to avoid
   collision to a small check turn away. If breaking out due to a lost-sight situation, the
   wingman will break away from lead’s last known position or direction of turn, using power
   and speed brakes as required.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      79


   6.23.5. A breakout exercise may be accomplished from a variety of positions and situations.
   Lead will direct the breakout with a radio call, after which the wingman will
   simultaneously execute an appropriate breakout maneuver and make a radio call (“Pistol 2’s
   breaking out”). The culmination of the exercise is the same as described in paragraph 6.23.3.
6.24. Close Trail:
   6.24.1. Lead initiates close trail with a radio call from fingertip, echelon, or route. Lead will
   wait for wing’s “in” call (“Iron 2’s in”) before maneuvering and then use any combination of
   turns, modified lazy eights, or barrel rolls.
   6.24.2. Over-the-top maneuvering in close trail is not permitted. Be smooth and
   predictable, avoid rapid or inconsistent roll rates, and maintain a minimum of 1 G at all
   times. Use no more than 4 Gs for close trail.
   6.24.3. Wing will acknowledge the call to go close trail (“2”), maneuver to the close trail
   position, and call in. Proper position is one to two aircraft lengths behind lead and just below
   lead’s jet wash.
   6.24.4. In the correct vertical position, you should see space between the forward edge of
   lead’s horizontal stabilator and the trailing edge of lead’s wing. To prevent encountering jet
   wash, never fly higher than a position where that space disappears.
   6.24.5. For a fore/aft separation reference, use the relationship between the tips of lead’s
   horizontal stabilator and the ailerons. At approximately one ship length, the stabilator tips are
   lined up with the outer two-thirds of the ailerons. At approximately two ship lengths, the tips
   are lined up with the mid- point of the ailerons. When aft of the proper position or when lead
   is turning at higher G loadings, you may need to fly slightly inside the turn to gain or
   maintain position.
   6.24.6. End the exercise by directing wing to the desired formation using visual signal or
   radio call (“Buddy 2, reform left”). If returning to fingertip, lead must avoid any significant
   power changes until wing is in position.
6.25. Fighting Wing. Fighting wing is flown as a maneuverable two-ship administrative
formation. Lead directs number 2 to the fighting wing position with a radio call (“Iron 21, go
fighting wing”). There is no requirement to call in position. The fighting wing position is a cone
30- to 45-degree AA from lead, 500 to 1,500 feet aft (Figure 6.9). As wing, you can approximate
the forward limit of the cone (45-degree AA) by aligning lead’s wingtip with the middle of the
aft canopy and the aft limit (30- degree AA) by aligning lead’s wingtip with the nose of the
aircraft. Another technique to estimate AA is to compare the apparent wingspan to the apparent
length of the T-38. At 30-degrees AA, the apparent length equals the apparent wingspan. At 45-
degrees AA, the apparent length is approximately 30percent longer than the apparent wingspan.
For estimating range, at 500 feet you should easily read lead’s tail number; at 1,000 feet, you
should easily see, but not be able to read, lead’s tail number; and you should be able to discern
two separate tail pipes. The wingman should strive to maintain a position inside lead’s turn circle
using lead and lag, resulting in lower power settings. Do not fly aerobatic maneuvers in fighting
wing.

6.26. Extended Trail (ET) Exercise:
   6.26.1. Desired Learning Objectives (DLO). The ET exercise is an initial building block that
   introduces some of the concepts and skills required in future short-range basic fighter
   maneuvers (BFM). The ET exercise allows pilots to practice the use of pursuit curves and
   dynamic maneuvering in relation to another aircraft. The DLOs of ET are as follows:
      6.26.1.1. To practice recognizing and solving problems of range, closure, AA, HCA,
      angle-off and turning room from short-range, simulated “offensive” position behind a
      cooperative aircraft flying a scripted training profile.
      6.26.1.2. Perch Setup:
          6.26.1.2.1. The DLOs of the Perch Setup are as follows:
              6.26.1.2.1.1. To practice maintaining briefed training parameters.
              6.26.1.2.1.2. To introduce and practice a composite cross-check, administrative
              setup, termination and reset for advanced maneuvering.
              6.26.1.2.1.3. To practice maneuvering to, entering, and maintaining the ET cone
              from a position outside the cone.
      6.26.1.3. To introduce and practice the application of A/A training rules (TR).
   6.26.2. The ET Cone. The cone for ET is defined as 30°- 45° AA on lead and between 1,000
   to 3,000 feet range. Wing evaluates position in the ET cone using visual references and
   stadiametric range estimation.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   81


     6.26.2.1. Visual References. For wing, the reference for the 30° and 45° AA is the same
     as for the fighting wing position. For visual ranging:
         6.26.2.1.1. At 1,000 feet, you should easily see, but not be able to read, lead’s tail
         number, and you should be able to discern two separate tailpipes.
         6.26.2.1.2. At 3,000 feet, you can just start to make out detail on the airplane. You
         should be able to recognize detail such as a clearly visible canopy and canopy bows,
         distinct lines where the wings and tail meet the fuselage, a distinct horizontal
         stabilizer, and clear lines where the colors on the paint scheme change.
         6.26.2.1.3. At 4,000 feet, just outside the ET cone, is where the VHF antenna (“shark
         fin”) disappears; however, this reference requires the belly of lead’s aircraft to be in
         view.
     6.26.2.2. Stadiametric Range Estimation. Stadiametric ranging (described in Attachment
     2) is another technique that can be used to determine ranges. The HUD symbology
     provides known size references for stadiametric ranging. “Mil-sizing” lead relative to
     HUD symbols does not require lead to be within the HUD field of view (FOV). You
     should be able to visualize references to HUD symbols with lead outside the HUD FOV.
     You must maintain a vigilant composite cross-check, especially outside of the cockpit
     and with lead’s aircraft, in order to recognize cues that could result in a potential
     deconfliction problem with lead.
  6.26.3. Responsibilities. All pilots must fulfill the following common responsibilities during
  the ET Exercise and Perch Setup:
     6.26.3.1. Collision Avoidance. As with other formation maneuvering, each pilot has the
     responsibility to take whatever action is necessary to avoid a collision. Because of the
     dynamic nature of the extended trail position, the problems of collision avoidance are
     compounded and require uncompromising flight discipline. All flight members must be
     vigilant with regard to clearing their flightpath and recognizing and avoiding the
     prebriefed minimum range limitation (often called “the bubble”).
     6.26.3.2. Fuel Awareness. Because the Extended Trail Exercise and Perch Setups
     generally involve higher power settings for longer periods of time, all pilots must
     continually monitor their fuel state to prevent overflying joker/bingo. Lead should call for
     an ops check prior to each engagement. Ops checks accomplished between engagements
     or after the last engagement will include G’s.
  6.26.4. Exercise Setups. There are two ways to send wingmen to the ET position—the ET
  Exercise and the Perch Setup (which is accomplished from tactical line abreast).
     6.26.4.1. ET Exercise. Accomplish the entry ET exercise from any basic formation
     position. Lead initiates the entry with a radio call (“Colt 21, go extended trail”) and wing
     acknowledges (“2”). Lead maneuvers by pulling away from wing with a military power
     and moderate G turn. Wing maneuvers as required to attain the ET position. Once wing
     calls in (“Colt 2’s in”), Lead begins the maneuvering phase (as defined below).
     6.26.4.2. Perch Setup. The purpose of the perch Setup is to introduce and practice a
     composite cross-check, the administrative setups, terminations, and resets used in follow-
     on BFM. The need for standardization of the setup is critical for reconstruction,
82                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


     debriefing, and assessment of DLOs. Each exercise will be preceded by a descriptive
     preparatory radio call by lead (“Colt 21, next exercise is Perch Setup,
     (Offensive/Defensive) for #2.”) followed by an acknowledgement from wing (“2”). Each
     pilot must strive to be in the correct starting position and must not call ready until the
     prebriefed starting parameters have been achieved.
        6.26.4.2.1. Avionics. Lead and wing should select the A/A master mode after lead’s
        descriptive preparatory radio call (“Colt 21, next exercise is Perch Setup,
        (Offensive/Defensive) for #2.”). The A/A master mode will be selected prior to the
        respective ready call.
        6.26.4.2.2. Lead. Starting parameters for lead are: 14,000 feet MSL (or as
        briefed), 350 + 15 KCAS.
            6.26.4.2.2.1. Once lead has achieved the correct starting parameters, lead calls
            ready (“Colt 1’s ready.”).
            6.26.4.2.2.2. After wing’s ready call, lead directs a check turn (“Colt 21, check
            45 left/right”), and turns 45 degrees away from wing for a defensive setup and
            into wing for an offensive setup.
            6.26.4.2.2.3. As the offender achieves near pure pursuit, the defender reverses the
            turn direction while monitoring the offender, modulates power as required to
            arrive at the fight’s on at 315 + 15 KCAS, and adjusts bank angle and Gs to set
            the desired AA of 30 to 45° while maintaining altitude. For a level flight, 40°
            Angle off Tail (AOT) reference, the defender should look over his or her shoulder
            and see the offender slightly above the horizon (roughly a beer can on its side)
            and roughly a beer can in front of the rear canopy bow. The offender’s lateral
            position can also be visualized above the wingtip (in relation to the aircraft) or
            just outside the wingtip (in relation to the horizon). See Figure 6.10. A common
            error during this phase is not to maintain level flight while looking over your
            shoulder. Maintain a composite cross-check.
            6.26.4.2.2.4. Once the offender calls “fight’s on,” the defender begins the briefed
            exercise phase (as defined below).
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    83


Figure 6.10. 40-Degree AA Picture from Lead Aircraft Front Cockpit.




          6.26.4.2.3. Wing. Starting parameters for wing is stack level with lead, 350 + 15
          KCAS, and 1.0 nm ±0.1 line abreast.
             6.26.4.2.3.1. If starting parameters have been achieved, wing calls ready (“Colt
             2’s ready.”) after lead’s ready call. If starting parameters have not been achieved,
             wing responds with the appropriate alibi (for example, “Colt 2, standby
             airspeed”), and then calls ready (“Colt 2’s ready.”) when within starting
             parameters.
             6.26.4.2.3.2. At the check 45 left/right call, the offender executes a contract
             tactical turn to near pure pursuit (lead under the HUD gun cross) and then
             modulates power to arrive at the fight’s on 350 + 15 KCAS while maintaining
             near pure pursuit. The defender will need to arrive at the fight’s on 315 + 15
             KCAS. Decelerating from 350 knots and arriving at the fight’s on with less than
             320 knots and 30° to 40° of AOT is a challenge. During the initial check turn,
             modulate power and pull to the buffet to bleed down to 320 to 330 knots; then
             allow the jet to decelerate the last 5 to 15 knots with throttle modulation after you
             have reversed your turn and have set the desired AOT.
             6.26.4.2.3.3. As range decreases, the offender calls down ranges until 3,000 feet
             (“6,000…5,000…4,000). The offender estimates ranges using visual references or
             using the stadiametric ranging technique discussed in Attachment 2.
             6.26.4.2.3.4. At 3,000 feet, the offender initiates the Reposition Phase with a
             fight’s on call (“Colt 21, fight’s on.”).
             6.26.4.2.3.5. Floor. 10,000 ft MSL (or as briefed for local airspace requirements).
84                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


     6.26.5.1. Reposition Phase. The purpose of the reposition phase is to allow the offender
     to solve range, aspect, closure, and HCA issues against a stable platform. Always enter
     the reposition phase from a perch entry. Prior to the offender’s “fight’s on” call, the
     defender will modulate power as required to arrive at the “fight’s on” at 315 + 15 KCAS
     and continue a level turn. After “fight’s on”, the offender will maintain gun cross on the
     defender until a reposition picture is achieved shortly before reaching the 1,000 ft DLO
     (500 ft bubble). At the reposition picture, the offender will set LV away from lead (“feet
     on lead”), modulate power as required, and execute a pull to stop forward closure and
     then reposition to be stabilized within the ET cone. Reference Figure 6.31.
        6.26.5.1.1. Defensive aircraft. The defender’s specific DLOs are to maintain visual
        and practice the composite cross-check. The execution entails setting power at 550
        EGT and performing a continuous 2 to 3 G descending turn maintaining 315 + 15
        KCAS. The defender will maintain SA on the offender’s position, even when he
        temporarily transits the defender’s six o’clock. The defender should develop a cross-
        check that allows him or her to maintain visual and maintain awareness of his own
        ship’s energy state. If the defender loses visual he will transmit, “Colt (1/2) Blind”
        and continue to maneuver predictably (continue the turn). The offender will
        immediately transmit “continue” if he remains visual on the defender. If the offender
        is not visual, a “knock-it-off” will be transmitted and the offender will lag the
        defender’s last known position. Reference sections 6.63 to 6.63.2.
        6.26.5.1.2. Offensive aircraft. The offender’s specific DLOs are to position the
        aircraft at the inside of the defender’s turn circle and on the forward edge of the ET
        cone (1,000 feet at 45° AA), execute a controlled reposition, and then continue to
        maneuver as required to maintain the ET cone. The offender must constantly assess
        dynamic visual cues to assess and control range, AA, HCA, and closure. Based on
        these cues, the offender must select the appropriate pursuit curve to reposition the
        aircraft as required.
     6.26.5.2. Maneuvering Phase. The purpose of the maneuvering phase is to allow wing
     to explore the ET cone against a dynamic platform. From the pre-proficiency entry or
     after the reposition phase DLOs have been achieved from the perch entry, wing will
     initiate the maneuvering phase with an in call (―Colt 2’s in‖). Flight lead may brief to
     omit the continuous turning phase described above from the perch entry. In this case, lead
     begins the maneuvering phase after wing’s “fight’s on” call. Unless briefed otherwise,
     lead’s power setting will be 550 degrees EGT and wing’s power setting will be 600
     degrees EGT for the maneuvering phase. The flight lead may brief different power
     settings for lead and wing to achieve a DLO. As wing gains proficiency, the flight lead
     may brief to allow wing the ability to modulate power, which will positively transfer to
     follow-on training.
        6.26.5.2.1. Lead. Lead’s specific DLOs are to challenge wing with aerobatic
        maneuvering while maintaining visual or SA on wing’s position, maintaining area
        orientation, and properly managing energy. Lead is not required to perform
        maneuvers to the precise parameters used in contact flying and should vary the
        attitudes and airspeeds as necessary for effective training, area orientation, visual
        lookout, and smoothness.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     85


            6.26.5.2.1.1. Consider wing’s skill level while maneuvering to prevent exceeding
            his or her capabilities, but continue to challenge wing with ET position problems
            to solve. High-G maneuvers are of little value if wing is unable to maintain the
            proper position. Remain constantly aware of G forces because wing is often
            exceeding lead’s G level to maintain or regain position.
            6.26.5.2.1.2. Limit ET maneuvering to turns, lazy eights, barrel rolls, cloverleafs,
            loops, and Cuban eights. Do not perform abrupt turn reversals; that is, turns in one
            direction followed by a rapid, unanticipated roll into a turn in the opposite
            direction. Lead will not maneuver in an attempt to force wing to overshoot.
            6.26.5.2.1.3. Lead should attempt to keep wing in sight but shouldn’t sacrifice
            flightpath deconfliction to do so. Lead must, however, keep SA of wing’s position
            at all times.
         6.26.5.2.2. Wing. Wing’s specific DLOs are to maintain the ET cone without
         stabilizing on lead’s turn circle. The correct ET position is rarely static in relation to
         lead. Wing should strive to maintain a position from which lead can stay visual.
         Avoid lead’s jetwash by avoiding lead’s POM when crossing lead’s turn circle. If you
         determine you will pass through lead’s jetwash, unload the aircraft to approximately 1
         G to prevent an asymmetric over-G.
  6.26.6. Terminate. Terminate the ET exercise according to AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3. Flight
  lead or the instructor can terminate for the attainment of DLOs. Lead can terminate IAW the
  brief or to continue with his or her mission profile. If wing terminates the ET exercise
  because of being outside the ET cone and unable to get back in the cone in a timely manner,
  then lead will smoothly transition to a turn and either direct wing to continue (“Colt 21,
  continue”) once wing calls in (“Colt 2’s in”), rejoin, or maneuver to another formation
  position.
     6.26.6.1. Post-terminate Maneuvering:
         6.26.6.1.1. Flight Rejoins. The post-terminate maneuvering following the pre-
         proficiency entry will normally be to a flight rejoin. However, lead can also direct
         wing to another formation position (except close trail). Until lead directs a rejoin or
         another formation position, wing will attain and maintain the fighting wing position.
         If lead directs a rejoin, lead will establish 300 KCAS and either a 30-degree bank
         turning or a straight-ahead rejoin platform unless briefed or called otherwise. Lead
         will not change power settings below what was set during the maneuvering phase of
         the ET exercise until visual with wing, or wing acknowledges the rejoin.
         6.26.6.1.2. Reset to Tactical. From a perch entry, the normal post-terminate
         maneuver is a reset to tactical with a climb back to the starting altitude block. The
         reset to tactical is dynamic due to the likely differences in airspeed between lead and
         wing. Minimal time should be spent heads down in the cockpit for both lead and wing
         while the formation resets to tactical. Lead must maintain a vigilant lookout for wing
         as wing solves tactical formation problems.
            6.26.6.1.2.1. After the terminate call, wing will lag lead, roll wings level, and set
            military power. Lead will reverse the direction of turn, set military power and
            achieve and maintain 350 KCAS in the most energy efficient manner (airspace
 86                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


              permitting).
              6.26.6.1.2.2. The timing of lead’s turn reversal will be relative to wing’s position
              at the terminate call and will put wing line abreast. Once line abreast, wing will
              set pitch and airspeed as required to remain line abreast and attain 4,000 to 6,000
              feet spacing.
              6.26.6.1.2.3. The only communications required is during the termination drill.
              After the termination drill, a reference heading by lead may be used to increase
              wing’s SA, but is optional. Wing must continuously assess lead and maneuver to
              stay in position.
       Colt 1: “Colt 21 Terminate”
       Colt 1: “Colt 1 Terminate”
       Colt 2: “Colt 2 Terminate”
              6.26.6.1.2.4. Once the formation is reset to line abreast, wing must rely on visual
              cues from lead’s aircraft to maintain tactical position and continue an efficient
              climb to the starting altitude block. During the climb, it is essential both aircraft
              maintain 350 KCAS without bleeding off airspeed in the turns. Lead may elect to
              turn at less angle of attack than a level tactical turn. Wing must evaluate lead’s
              turn rate, and adjust turn timing and turn rate to stay in position. Typically these
              turns are referred to as “easy” turns.
          6.26.6.1.3. Avionics. Lead and wing will return to the NAV master mode after the
          terminate drill and no later than completion of the post-terminate ops check.
   6.26.7. Energy Conservation. Energy conservation is very important for wing. Buffet in a
   high-performance airplane signifies a loss of energy. When encountering buffet, wing must
   decide what is more important, nose track or energy. If nose track is more important, wing
   may have to sacrifice airspeed by pulling in the buffet.
   6.26.8. Training Rules. AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3 provides training rules, including KIO,
   terminate, and minimum weather requirements. In addition:
      6.26.8.1. Extended trail is limited to two-ship formations.
      6.26.8.2. When one or more flight members lose visual contact, follow the loss of visual
      contact procedures in AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3.

Section 6C—Tactical Formation

6.27. Types and Principles:
   6.27.1. “Tactical” is an umbrella term covering several formations characterized by
   increased separation between the members of the flight. Tactical is the primary formation
   flown when employing fighter aircraft. It is designed to optimize weapons and radar
   employment while improving visual lookout and increased maneuverability.
   6.27.2. A variety of tactical formations may be flown depending on the number of aircraft in
   the formation and the type of employment desired. For two-ships, tactical formations include
   line abreast and wedge. Both may be referred to on the radio by their separate names;
   however, if the lead refers to “tactical”, this is understood to mean “line abreast”. For four
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      87


   ships, tactical formations include fluid four, wall, and box or offset box. Regardless of the
   variety of tactical formation being flown, some basic principles apply:
       6.27.2.1. The lead aircraft is primarily responsible for maneuvering the formation, and
       the wingman is primarily responsible for maintaining formation position and
       deconfliction.
       6.27.2.2. The wingman’s primary reference for heading and airspeed is lead. The lead
       must cross-check the wingmen to monitor their positions, and the wingmen must back
       lead up by monitoring area orientation, navigation, etc.
       6.27.2.3. Both aircraft share equal responsibility with visual lookout––one of the primary
       reasons for flying tactical line abreast. Line abreast provides excellent lookout capability.
       Scan patterns should include the extremes above and below the horizon. See figure 6.1.
       6.27.2.4. Tactical formations are normally flown at airspeeds near corner velocity (350
       to 400 KCAS), but other airspeeds may be flown. Unless otherwise briefed, the standard
       airspeed for tactical formation is 350 KCAS at or above 10,000 feet MSL, and 300
       KCAS below 10,000 feet MSL.
6.28. Line Abreast (LAB). The parameters of this tactical formation are 4,000 to 6,000 feet
spacing, line abreast to 10 degrees aft, and a vertical separation (stack) of up to 2,000 feet
(Figure 6.11).

Figure 6.11. Tactical Line Abreast.
 88                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   6.28.1. To enter tactical formation, lead may use a radio call (e.g., “Rocky 51, tactical left
   side”) or a visual signal by porpoising the aircraft. The wingman then moves out into the
   tactical position (see paragraph 6.28.6), clearing the flightpath while moving out. In order,
   the priorities for correcting formation position are fore and aft positioning, lateral separation,
   and vertical stack. Strive to fly line abreast—no further aft than 10 degrees—by varying
   power and trading altitude for airspeed (or vice versa) to make fore or aft corrections.
   6.28.2. Visual references for lateral spacing include the following (Can change based on
   environmentals):
      6.28.2.1. At 4,000 feet, the VHF antenna (shark fin) disappears, the underside
      rotating beacon disappears, and (or) the canopy bow disappears, and both canopies blend
      into one.
      6.28.2.2. At 6,000 feet, the “L” formed by the aft edge of the vertical stabilizer and the
      burner cans start to disappear (depending on environmental visibility). Also, depending
      on the environmentals, the canopy disappears or blends into the aircraft.
      6.28.2.3. Outside 6,000 feet, most details disappear, and the aircraft loses most of its
      definition.
   6.28.3. If local procedures allow, TCAS symbology on a 2.5 nm EHSI can be used to help
   calibrate your eyes. Six thousand feet is approximately at the outer CDI dot, and 4,000 feet is
   midway between the two dots. The A/A TACAN is also a useful tool to calibrate your eyes.
   6.28.4.
   priority and should only be increased as proficiency allows. Some situations may warrant a
   stack in excess of 2,000 feet such as using altitude to correct fore or aft positioning. When
   restricted by airspace or weather, wingmen may be required to fly co-altitude with lead.
   6.28.5. Accomplish small course corrections through check turns. Accomplish turns of more
   than 30 degrees by means of a delayed turn (45 through 90 degrees), in-place turn, or fluid
   turn. For reversing the flightpath 180 degrees, use a hook turn or cross turn.
   6.28.6. When given the signal to go to tactical LAB, the wingman will:
      6.28.6.1. Clear the flightpath in the direction of the turn away from lead.
      6.28.6.2. Turn away from lead to achieve 4,000 to 6,000 feet of lateral spacing. One
      technique for achieving the appropriate spacing is cross-checking lead’s heading then
      check away while monitoring lead ensuring zero fwd/aft LOS rate.
      6.28.6.3. Roll back to lead’s approximate heading when approaching 4,000 to 6,000 feet
      of lateral spacing, and set power and airspeed to match lead’s current parameters.
      6.28.6.4. Assess LOS and adjust power, airspeed, and heading as required to zero out
      LOS and HCA.
6.29. Tactical Turns.
   6.29.1. Radio Calls and Visual Signals. Radio calls or visual signals may be used to signal
   tactical turns. For example, the radio call for a delayed 90-degree turn would be “Buzz 21, 90
   left/right.” No radio response is required from the wingmen. All tactical turns except a cross
   turn or hook turn into the wingman may be signaled with a wing flash in the direction of the
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     89


   turn. Lead should show the wingman the full planform (approximately 90 degrees of bank)
   when signaling a tactical turn to avoid confusion with minor course corrections (usually
   use 30 degrees of bank or less). If needed to attract the wingman’s attention, a “zipper”
   (double-click on the radio microphone switch) may be combined with the visual signal.
   Wingmen should assume a delayed 90-degree turn until signaled otherwise.
   6.29.2. Turn Contract. As turns are executed, all aircraft need to adhere to a “contract”
   during the turn to help ensure turn rate and radii are similar. Use the following parameters for
   contract turns: MIL power, G to hold altitude and airspeed (at medium altitude,
   approximately 0.35 AOA or just short of the light tickle). The second aircraft to turn (the
   aircraft getting turned into) may vary power, altitude, and G as necessary to finish the turn in
   position on the appropriate side of the formation. At lower altitudes, all aircraft must remain
   aware of terrain elevation, descent rate, and bank angle.
   6.29.3. Deconfliction. The wingman takes the initiative to deconflict from lead. If the
   wingman is stacked high or low, he or she should maintain that stack when commencing the
   turn especially if he or she is the first to turn. If there was no stack at turn initiation, the
   wingman should “telegraph” his or her intentions for vertical deconfliction by positively
   maneuvering the jet. Bottom line, both lead and wing are ultimately responsible for flightpath
   deconfliction and must clear during turns and take appropriate evasive action if required. If
   the formation is assigned a hard altitude (no altitude block), the wingman should climb or
   descend slightly for deconfliction—both aircraft must adhere to the cleared altitude.
6.30. Delayed 90-Degree Turns:
   6.30.1. Turns Into the Wingman (Figure 6.12):
      6.30.1.1. If the turn is called over the radio, lead begins the contract turn immediately
      after the call. Otherwise, lead’s contract turn into the wingman signals the turn. As lead
      begins the turn, the wingman continues straight ahead and deconflicts the turn by
      maintaining or obtaining sufficient vertical clearance. The wingman should use this
      opportunity to clear lead’s new 6 o’clock position.
      6.30.1.2. The wingman initiates a 90-degree contract turn to rollout in tactical on the
      other side of lead. The timing for starting this turn occurs just prior to observing a rapid
      increase in lead’s LOS. If the wingman is in position, the increase in LOS will occur after
      lead has turned approximately 45 degrees or just prior to looking down lead’s intakes.
      This reference does not work if wing is out of position. If out of position, the wingman
      must vary the timing and G loading of the turn, based on lead’s LOS, to finish the turn in
      position. Generally, when inside 6,000 feet or aft of LAB, the wingman should begin the
      turn earlier than looking down lead’s intakes. When outside 6,000 feet or forward of
      LAB, the wingman should begin the turn after looking down the intakes. Also, when in
      proper position, at lower altitudes, the wingman should begin the turn later. The opposite
      is true at higher altitudes.

Figure 6.12. Delayed 90-Degree Turn.




   6.30.2. Turns Away From the Wingman. This is a mirror image of the 90-degree turn into
   the wingman. When directed, the wingman begins a contract turn into lead and uses all
   available references to rollout after approximately 90 degrees of turn. Lead delays and then
   performs a contract turn to rollout on the desired heading. During lead’s turn and rollout, the
   wingman maneuvers to the correct position.
6.31. Delayed 45-Degree Turns:
   6.31.1. Turns Into the Wingman (Figure 6.13). If the turn is called over the radio, lead
   begins the turn immediately after the call. Otherwise lead’s turn into the wingman signals the
   turn. As lead begins the turn, the wingman continues straight ahead and deconflicts by
   maintaining or obtaining sufficient vertical clearance. The wingman should use this
   opportunity to clear leads new 6 o’clock position. When lead rolls out, the wingman
   maneuvers as required to achieve a tactical position on the other side of lead’s aircraft by
   either delaying the turn until lead crosses the 6 o’clock position or by immediately
   maneuvering to the other side of lead. Either way, the aircraft being turned into should pass
   in front of (not over top or underneath) the other aircraft for the geometry to work out.
   During comm.-out turns, lead must ensure the rollout occurs before the wingman begins a
   delayed 90-degree turn. If the wingman begins a 90-degree turn, lead should use the radio to
   achieve the desired turn (“Vega 2, rollout”).
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   91


Figure 6.13. Delayed 45-Degree Turn.




   6.31.2. Turns Away From the Wingman. This is a mirror image of the 45o turn into the
   wingman. The wingman begins a contract turn into lead when directed. Lead signals the
   wingman’s rollout by beginning a contract turn into the wingman. Lead will maneuver to the
   opposite side of the wingman in LAB position. After lead rolls out, the wingman is
   responsible for obtaining the correct spacing and position.
6.32. Other Tactical Turn Variations. For turns greater than approximately 60 degrees, lead
will generally direct a delayed 90-degree turn. For turns between approximately 30 to 60
degrees, lead will generally direct a delayed 45-degree turn. For turns approximately 30 degrees
or less, lead will call a check turn and turn to the desired heading. In all cases, the wingman’s
responsibility is to maintain or regain position.
   6.32.1. Check Turns. The check turn is usually no more than 30 degrees of turn. Initiate the
   turn by transmitting “Felon 31, check (degrees to turn) left/right.” Normally, both aircraft
   execute simultaneous contract turns, and the wingman remains on the same side.
   6.32.2. In-Place Turns (Figure 6.14). Use an in-place turn when you want the formation to
   maneuver in one direction at the same time. To initiate, lead transmits “Felon 31, in-place 90
   left/right.” Both aircraft turn at the same time—in the same direction—using contract turns.
   If executed from line abreast tactical, a 90-degree turn will put the formation in trail at
   whatever lateral spacing existed prior to the turn.

Figure 6.14. In-Place 90-Degree Turn.




6.33. Shackle:


   6.33.1. Use a shackle (Figure 6.15) to put the wingman on the opposite side or to allow him
   or her to regain the correct position. Initiate the shackle by transmitting, “Mega 21, shackle.”
   Both aircraft turn toward each other, with the wingman ensuring vertical deconfliction.
   Generally, the wingman rolls out with lead to minimize fore-aft LOS. Both aircraft reverse
   the turn after crossing flight paths. Lead rolls out on the original or desired heading, and the
   wingman assumes proper tactical position.
   6.33.2. If not starting out line abreast, aircraft will maneuver during the shackle as
   appropriate for the situation. If the shackle is to allow the wingman to correct a forward
   position, the correct lead maneuver may be to continue straight ahead. If the wingman is
   behind at the start of a shackle, he or she may use less bank angle and (or) angle-off to regain
   the proper position. If the wingman is ahead at the start of a shackle, he or she may use more
   bank angle or angle-off to regain the proper position.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      93


Figure 6.15. Shackle.




6.34. Hook Turns. During a hook turn (Figure 6.16), the formation turns 180 degrees with both
aircraft performing a contract turn at the same time in the same direction.

Figure 6.16. Hook Turn.




   6.34.1. Hook Turns Into the Wingman. A hook turn into the wingman must be called over
   the radio (“Bam 41, hook right/left”). During the first half of the turn, lead is responsible for
   keeping the wingman in sight. Shortly after halfway through the turn, the wingman should
   acquire, maintain sight of, and fly off of lead. If the turn is flown properly, the wingman will
   roll out in the correct position. If not, he or she must maneuver to obtain the proper spacing
   and position.
   6.34.2. Turns Away From the Wingman. Hook turns away from the wingman may be
   signaled visually by a wing flash or called over the radio. If initiated with a wing flash, lead
   will begin turning when the wingman begins his or her turn. Lead’s immediate turn tells the
   wingman this is not a 90- degree turn. For the first half of the turn, the wingman should
   match lead’s turn rate, be at 0 degrees AA at the 90-degree point of the turn. Shortly after
   halfway through the turn, lead should acquire and maintain sight of the wingman. If this turn
 94                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   is flown properly, the wingman will be in position at the completion of the turn. If not, wing
   must maneuver to obtain the proper spacing and position.
6.35. Cross Turns:
   6.35.1. Cross turns (Figure 6.17) are another 180-degree reversal option. Both aircraft make
   a contract turn into each other with altitude split for flightpath deconfliction. Two basic
   challenges occur during the turn: (1) reacquiring visual contact with the other aircraft, and (2)
   too much lateral spacing caused by the T-38’s turn performance.

Figure 6.17. Cross Turn.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    95


Figure 6.18. Cross Turn with Shackle




   6.35.2. Cross turns will be executed on a verbal command from lead (“Buzz 31, cross
   turn”). Immediately, both aircraft will commence a contract turn toward each other. Aircraft
   should cross after 60 to 90 degrees of turn and continue their turn through 180 degrees. The
   flight is now on a reciprocal heading, but, because of the large turn radius, the lateral
   separation will be wide (2 to 3 nm) if the original spacing was correct. Conversely, if the
   wingman’s spacing was initially wide, a cross turn should result in reduced lateral separation.
   6.35.3. As quickly as possible after turning through 90 degrees, each pilot must reacquire
   and maintain visual with the other aircraft. If the other aircraft is not reacquired during the
   second half of the turn, call “blind” immediately upon rollout.
   6.35.4. Following completion of the turn, unless briefed otherwise, wing will begin to
   correct back to the tactical LAB position. To correct lateral spacing, lead may direct a
   shackle (Figure 6.18). If the wingman is blind but lead is visual, lead may direct a shackle
   while maintaining altitude separation and attempting to talk the wingman’s eyes back onto
 96                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   lead. Due to the distance between aircraft, it is possible for neither pilot to regain sight after
   the cross turn. If this happens, both will maintain the reciprocal heading until directed
   otherwise by lead. Lead will ensure altitude separation.
6.36. Fluid Turns. These turns are used to maneuver a formation when there is very little G or
excess thrust available (heavy weight and (or) higher altitudes). Lead will normally make
heading changes in 90-degree increments, using approximately 45 degrees of bank and
maintaining airspeed and altitude. Also, fluid turns are almost purely “geometry” turns with
power settings normally constant. If a 180-degree turn is required, combine the techniques for
two 90-degree turns (Figure 6.19). The radio call for a fluid turn is “Snake 21, fluid left/right.”
No acknowledgement is required.

Figure 6.19. Fluid Turn.




   6.36.1. Turns Into the Wingman. As a wingman, start a turn in the same direction as lead
   (Figure 6.19). Whatever bank angle technique is used, you must continuously monitor lead’s
   position. You should normally have 20 to 30 degrees of turn completed as lead passes your 6
   o’clock position, depending on lead’s position at the start of the turn. For example, if you
   were behind when the turn started, you may want to delay the cross. If you were ahead, you
   may want to cross earlier. Once you have crossed lead’s flightpath, adjust the turn to assume
   proper spacing and lower the nose to pick up airspeed, if necessary.
   6.36.2. Turns Away From the Wingman. The wingman is immediately behind at the onset of
   the turn. He or she will roll into more bank than lead and lower the nose slightly to gain
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    97


   airspeed in order to move to the inside of the turn behind lead. As the turn progresses, the
   wingman will reduce the bank to attain proper lateral spacing and trade excess airspeed for
   altitude as he or she approaches the LAB position.
6.37. Belly Check. A Belly Check is a momentary reduction in bank performed by a turning
fighter to clear the area hidden by the fuselage of the aircraft. This is typically a maneuver
performed in formation, often by the inside fighter of a formation executing a tactical hook turn.
6.38. High Altitude Tactical. When flying tactical formation above FL 250, the following
techniques are useful:
   6.38.1. Normally, 0.85 to 0.9 IMN is a good airspeed range because it provides both
   maneuverability and good fuel flow at the higher altitudes. These speeds also provide excess
   power and, except with extremely cold outside air temperatures, will maintain operations
   within the engine envelope.
   6.38.2. Do not plan formation flights above FL 350. However, if you must operate above FL
   350, use 0.9 IMN or slightly higher as the base airspeed.
   6.38.3. Energy conservation is a priority at the higher altitudes because less thrust is
   available. Additionally, throttle movements must be small to avoid compressor stalls. The
   basic maneuvering remains the same, but due to the increased emphasis on energy
   conservation, buffet should be avoided as much as possible. To accomplish this and to
   compensate for the higher true airspeed, use earlier lead turns than at lower altitudes. For
   example, during a delayed 90-degree turn into, start the turn as the other aircraft turns
   through approximately 30 degrees of turn (rather than 45 degrees). This should be apparent
   with the LOS concept discussed in paragraph 6.30.1.2.
6.39. Wedge. Lead might direct the wingman to wedge formation (Figure 6.20) when terrain,
tactics, etc., require an increased degree of flight maneuverability. The wedge position is
primarily used in the low altitude environment. Turns do not need to be called. The wingman
will maneuver as required to maintain position. Wedge is defined as a position 30 to 45 degrees
off lead’s 6 o’clock (30 to 45 degrees AA) at a range of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The wingman will
not fly lower than lead in the low altitude environment and will fly no higher than approximately
500 feet above lead unless required to fly higher due to obstacle clearance during turns.
Maneuver as required to maintain position to include crossing lead’s 6 o’clock if required.

Figure 6.20. Wedge Formation.




6.40. Tactical Rejoins:
   6.40.1. Overview. All rejoins will be initiated with a wing rock or radio call.
   Wingmen will acknowledge all radio calls to rejoin. The standard platform for lead is 350
   KCAS, 45 degrees of bank, and level flight. Different parameters may be briefed or called on
   the radio. Proficient wingmen will not require a radio call when different parameters are
   used. Wingmen should strive to maintain closure during the rejoin.
   6.40.2. Straight-Ahead Tactical Rejoin. As the wingman, rejoin to the side occupied when
   given the radio call or visual signal. Unlike a normal straight-ahead rejoin from a trail
   position, a tactical straight- ahead rejoin begins from a lateral spread. The mechanics of
   flying this maneuver will vary based on position when initiating the rejoin. If necessary,
   maneuver vertically or laterally to gain turning room. The following should provide a
   systematic approach on which to build from a LAB starting position:
       6.40.2.1. If there is excessive stack (greater than 500 feet), attempt to work toward a
       stack-level position.
       6.40.2.2. Roll and pull the aircraft to put lead slightly forward of the LAB picture on the
       canopy.
       6.40.2.3. Use power as required to remain slightly aft of LAB (90 degree AA off of
       lead). The aimpoint should be toward the close trail position (slightly aft/low).
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                       99


       6.40.2.4. As range closes, lead will begin to move further forward on the canopy if
       nothing is done with HCA. As this begins to occur, start taking out some of the HCA
       (align fuselages) to maintain lead in a slightly forward of LAB position on the canopy.
       6.40.2.5. Once in a route position, finish the rejoin to fingertip.
       6.40.2.6. Tactical Straight-Ahead Rejoin Overshoot. Wing should not cross to the other
       side of lead (cross lead’s six). If closure is so excessive requiring wing to lose visual of
       lead, consider this a breakout. Select idle and speed brakes (if required) as soon as excess
       overtake is recognized. Guard against turning back into lead while looking over your
       shoulder. A small, controllable 3/9 line overshoot is easily managed and can still result in
       an efficient rejoin. Retract the speed brakes and increase power just prior to achieving co-
       airspeed (stagnant LOS) to prevent falling aft.
   6.40.3. Turning Rejoin into the Wingman. Even before lead turns, wing has excessive AA
   and must use lag pursuit. Maneuvering to lag helps solve the initial AA problem but
   introduces excessive HCA as the wing approaches lead’s turn circle. An initial move in the
   vertical is therefore required to build maneuvering room (turning room) to solve HCA. As
   wing approaches leads turn circle, available turning room must be used to zero out HCA or to
   align fuselages. With wing slightly outside lead’s turn circle, wing should see a slight
   forward LOS rate across the canopy out of lead. At this point, wing should modulate power
   to stabilize lead’s LOS on the canopy to cross lead’s six o’clock at the desired range while
   remaining clear of his or her jet wash. Wing establishes himself or herself back inside the
   turn at the desired airspeed and AA. From here, wing follows the turning rejoin procedures
   described in paragraph 6.21.3 to the briefed or directed position. As proficiency increases,
   wing can work to cross lead’s six o’clock at closer ranges to a point to where wing performs
   a maneuver similar to the second half of a crossunder to the inside of lead’s turn.
   6.40.4. Turning Rejoin Away From the Wingman. As soon as lead turns, wing is outside the
   turn and needs to maneuver to the inside of the turn with lead pursuit. Use caution because an
   excessive amount of lead pursuit may result in excessive AA, HCA, and (or) closure. Cross
   lead’s six o’clock while remaining clear of the jet wash and assess your energy (airspeed,
   altitude differential and, angular closure). Once inside lead’s turn, wing follows the turning
   rejoin procedures described in paragraph 6.21.3 to the briefed or directed position.
6.41. Four-Ship Tactical. A four-ship formation combines the basic elements of two-ship
tactical formation into a formation of four aircraft. The three four-ship tactical formations
include fluid four, wall, and box or offset box. With the increased number of aircraft in the
formation, all flight members must maintain visual awareness or SA on the other aircraft to
ensure deconfliction. Strictly adhering to the contract turns and aggressively maintaining proper
formation position will greatly reduce the risk of a midair collision. Although each pilot
maintains an obligation to maintain visual on all aircraft, there are situations that may prevent
this. The priority for wingmen is to maintain visual with, and maneuver in relation to, their
element lead. Number 3’s priority is to maintain visual with number 1, while fulfilling element
lead responsibilities for number 4. Any time these priorities cannot be fulfilled, the flight must be
informed with a timely “blind” call. It is imperative for all flight members to fly the aircraft
efficiently and to try to anticipate what lead may do next.
6.42. Fluid Four. This is a simple and efficient formation for medium and high altitudes.
 100                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   6.42.1. Element leads (numbers 1 and 3) fly two-ship tactical LAB. Numbers 2 and 4 fly a
   fighting wing position off their respective element lead, striving to maintain a position on the
   outside of the formation when not maneuvering (Figure 6.21). Tactical turns (Figure 6.22)
   are made between number 1 and number 3, the same as in two-ship tactical. Element leads
   can make it easier for their respective wingmen to stay in position by pausing momentarily
   between banking up and beginning to pull during turns, allowing the wingman to begin to
   maneuver for the turn.

Figure 6.21. Fluid Four Formation.




Figure 6.22. Fluid Four Turns.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     101


   6.42.2. The highest potential for conflict occurs during the turns as the elements cross during
   the turn. If the element leads are LAB at the start of the turn, this conflict is minimized but
   still exists if the wingman in the element being turned into has fallen back. If the element
   being turned into is aft of LAB at the start of the turn, there is a much higher opportunity for
   conflict, and all players must use extreme caution. Vertical stack between the element leads
   minimizes the opportunity for conflicts. However, the primary means of deconfliction is
   visual lookout. If the wingman of the high element is below his or her element lead, use extra
   caution to ensure deconfliction between wingmen during turns.
6.43. Four-Ship Wall Formation. The four-ship wall formation (Figure 6.23) is four aircraft in
LAB tactical formation. To establish the formation, all flight members fly LAB tactical
formation as described in paragraph 6.28. The wingmen (numbers 2 and 4) fly LAB off their
respective element leads. The flight lead should brief specific stack guidance for all wingmen.

Figure 6.23. Four-Ship Wall Formation.




   6.43.1. Four-Ship Wall Delayed Turns. Delayed turns (Figure 6.24) are executed similar to a
   two-ship tactical. Turns are directed by a radio call or visual signal. If lead gives the signal
   requiring number 4 to be the first to turn, number 3 should repeat the signal down to number
   4. The wingman on the outside of the turn (the first aircraft to turn) flies a contract 90-degree
   turn, and each pilot in succession uses two- ship tactical references and adjustments to
   execute a contract 90-degree turn. As number 1 completes the turn, wingmen maneuver to
   regain position. As in fluid four, conflicts are minimized if all aircraft are relatively LAB at
   the start of the turn. If aircraft have fallen back, the potential for conflicts is increased.

Figure 6.24. Four-Ship Wall Delayed Turn.




   6.43.2. Four-Ship Wall Hook Turns. Hook turns are tactical turns executed by all members
   of the formation simultaneously, resulting in LAB formation heading approximately 180
   degrees from the original heading (Figure 6.25). Potential for conflicts during hook turns
   increases if flight members do not fly the contract turn causing the turn radii to be different.
   Ensuring 0 degrees AA off of the flight member nearest to you in the direction of the turn at
   the 90-degree point of the turn and flying the contract for the remainder of the turn should
   result in LAB formation at the completion of the hook turn.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     103


Figure 6.25. Four-Ship Wall Hook Turn.




6.44. Four-Ship Box or Offset Box Formations:
   6.44.1. Overview. Four-ship box formation is essentially two elements flying LAB tactical,
   separated in trail by 6,000 to 9,000 feet (Figure 6.26). Unless specifically briefed by the
   flight lead or directed by their respective element lead, number 2 and number 4 can be on
   either side of their element lead, and the side number 2 and number 4 are on is irrelevant to
   one another. The rear element can fly directly in trail of the lead element (box) or offset the
   lead element (offset box) at lead’s discretion. Generally, by flying offset box, it is easier for
   all flight members to maintain visual contact with one another. In offset box formation,
   number 3 may elect to place number 4 in the slot. The rear element should normally stack
   either high or low from the lead element, based on the brief or environmental conditions,
   unless required to maintain level because of weather or airspace restrictions. Cockpit
   visibility from the lead aircraft and the small size of the T-38 can make visibility between the
   front and rear elements a challenge because of environmental conditions and range. This may
   result in the rear element padlocking on the lead element to maintain visual.

Figure 6.26. Box and Offset Box Formation.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      105


   6.44.2. Box Formation Turns:
      6.44.2.1. Lead directs delayed 45- and 90-degree turns with a radio call or visual signal.
      Each element performs a standard delayed turn (Figure 6.27), with number 3 turning the
      trailing element to finish in the correct position relative to the leading element.

Figure 6.27. Offset Box Formation Delayed Turn.




      6.44.2.2. For turns in box formation, the rear element must delay for several seconds
      prior to initiating its turn. One technique is for the trailing element to attempt to turn over
      the same geographical point or the “same point in the sky.” For turns in offset box
      formation, the timing for the trailing element’s turn could vary from 3 to 4 seconds (when
      turning away from the rear outrigger) to 7 to 10 seconds (when turning into the rear
      outrigger).
      6.44.2.3. For hook turns in box or offset box formation, lead directs the turn with a radio
      call (“Card 1&2, hook left/right”). The standard hook turn while in box formation is for
      the second element to delay, so as to remain in trail (“Card 3&4, hook left/right”).
      (Figure 6.28). Each element performs a contract hook turn, with all four pilots turning in
      the same direction. Number 3 delays momentarily prior to turning the second element to
      complete the turn in trail of the lead element. (Generally, the trailing element must start
 106                                                         AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       its turn before the lead element passes). If starting level with the lead element, the trailing
       element must immediately climb or descend to establish vertical deconfliction.

Figure 6.28. Offset Box Formation Hook Turn.




       6.44.2.4. If lead intends all aircraft to simultaneously hook, thereby placing the trailing
       element in front, he or she will call for an in-place hook turn (“Colt 21, in-place hook
       left/right”) (Figure 6.29). This will put the trailing element out in front of the lead
       element. A second in-place hook turn in either direction will put the four-ship back in
       standard box formation. One possible application of an in-place hook turn is while
       accomplishing a G-awareness exercise.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   107


Figure 6.29. Offset Box Formation Delayed Turn.




6.45. Three- and Four-Ship Tactical Rejoins. The basic two-ship tactical rejoin concepts also
apply to three- and four-ship formations. All three- and four-ship tactical rejoins will be called
on the radio and acknowledged.
   6.45.1. Straight-Ahead Rejoins. Wingmen will join on lead as described in paragraph 6.40.2
   (straight- ahead tactical rejoin). Wingmen will not cross lead’s 6 o’clock during a straight-
   ahead tactical rejoin. They will join in sequence and fly no closer than 500 feet to the
   preceding aircraft until the preceding aircraft are in position.
   6.45.2. Turning Rejoins. In a four-ship tactical formation, number 2 rejoins to the inside
   of lead’s turn, number 3 rejoins to the outside of lead’s turn, and number 4 rejoins to the
   outside of number 3. Wingmen will rejoin in sequence and fly no closer than 500 feet to
   the preceding aircraft until the preceding aircraft are in position. Number 4 may use
   reasonable pursuit on number 3 during the rejoin. Each wingman is responsible for keeping
   the preceding aircraft in sight and should avoid becoming a conflict or hazard to formation
   aircraft ahead or behind.
6.46. Three-Ship Options. Maintenance problems will occasionally cause one aircraft to “fall
out,” leaving a three-ship. Specific details—deputy lead, callsign changes, positions to fly,
planned position changes, etc.—should be briefed by lead for each mission.

Section 6D—Fluid Maneuvering (FM)

6.47. Objectives. FM is an advanced building block that introduces the concepts and skills
required in future medium-range BFM. FM builds on the short-range maneuvering practiced in
ET by requiring the understanding of turn circle geometry and the creative use of pursuit curves
and energy management to close from medium to short-range. The objectives of FM are to:
   6.47.1. Introduce and practice the administrative setups, terminations, and resets for
   medium-range BFM.
   6.47.2. Introduce and practice the application of air-to-air ROE.
   6.47.3. Practice recognizing and solving problems of range, closure, aspect, angle-off, and
   turning room from a medium-range, simulated “offensive” position behind a cooperative
   aircraft flying a scripted training profile.
   6.47.4. Practice setting and controlling AA and maintaining briefed training parameters for
   the training aircraft.
   6.47.5. Practice maneuvering to, recognizing, and stabilizing in the ET cone from a position
   well outside that cone, simulating the recognition of a weapons engagement zone.
6.48. Responsibilities:
   6.48.1. Collision Avoidance. Flight members must be vigilant with regard to clearing their
   flightpath and recognizing and avoiding the prebriefed minimum range limitation (“the
   bubble”).
   6.48.2. Fuel Awareness. Because FM generally involves higher power settings for longer
   periods of time, pilots must continually monitor their fuel state to prevent overflying joker or
   bingo. Leads will call for an ops check before and between engagements.
   6.48.3. Setup Standardization. During FM training, the need for setup standardization is
   critical to the reconstruction, debriefing, and assessment of desired learning objectives. It
   follows, therefore, that the training aircraft must not deviate from the prebriefed profile
   (“contract”).     Leads are primarily responsible for accurately briefing and aggressively
   controlling these aspects of FM. The pilot in the maneuvering aircraft must strive to be in the
   correct starting position and must not call “ready” until the prebriefed starting parameters can
   be achieved.
6.49. FM Exercise. In addition to fulfilling the common responsibilities in paragraphs 6.48, the
two pilots in an FM exercise have distinctly different roles. (See paragraphs 6.50 through 6.62
for details of these roles.)
6.50. Training Aircraft. Although the primary training objectives are for the maneuvering
aircraft pilot, there are significant training opportunities for the training aircraft. These include
over-the-shoulder SA, POM assessment, lift vector control, floor awareness, G awareness, and
energy management. The responsibilities of the pilot in the training aircraft include adjusting
bank or backstick pressure to “set” the aspect, monitoring the maneuvering aircraft, and, most
importantly, flying the prebriefed parameters (“the contract”).
6.51. Maneuvering Aircraft. FM’s primary objectives are for the pilot in the maneuvering
aircraft. The responsibilities of the pilot in the maneuvering aircraft include being in level, pure
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                         109


pursuit to start, helping the training aircraft pilot adjust the starting aspect, and remaining vigilant
for high over-G potential situations. Between setups, the maneuvering aircraft should maintain or
regain the prebriefed position until directed otherwise by lead while climbing at MIL power or
350 KCAS back into the briefed starting block.
6.52. FM Exercise Levels. The building block approach is used in FM training by decreasing
the maneuvering limitations of the training aircraft as the wingman’s proficiency increases
(Table 6.2).

 NOTES:

 1. Maintain constant G and airspeed. Increase G as proficiency allows.
 2. IP demo or continuation training only. The wingman is allowed use of power up to MAX
 afterburner.

6.53. Special Instructions (SPINS), TRs, and ROE. These three terms intertwine in their
application to training scenarios. Violation of TRs has serious implications for flight safety.
Adherence to TRs is essential to becoming a disciplined combat aviator. Outside the UFT and
PIT environment, AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, mandates numerous TRs,
which have been developed over years of combat aviation training and are designed to provide a
safe, effective training environment. Although AFI 11-214 does not apply in UFT or PIT, the
concept of TRs remains the same. The term “ROE” has real-world combat applications, but is
also commonly used in training. The following ROE apply:
     6.53.1. The floor is 1,000 feet above the bottom of assigned airspace.
     6.53.2. Power setting—MIL power or less. See Table 6.2.
     6.53.3. The “bubble”—1,000 feet. (If a transition to ET is briefed, the 1,000-foot FM bubble
     is no longer applicable after the “in” call.) When the maneuvering aircraft closes to
     approximately 2,000 feet and approaches a stabilized position, the training aircraft will begin
     a level to slightly descending turn, maintaining constant G and airspeed.
     6.53.4. The training aircraft will not execute turn reversals after the call to begin
     maneuvering.
 110                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


6.54. Starting Parameters. A T-38’s 400 KCAS, 4 G turn radius at 15,000 feet MSL is
approximately 5,200 feet. Therefore, the FM exercise begins at or slightly outside the training
aircraft’s turn circle as follows:
   6.54.1. Altitude block—15,000 to 17,000 feet MSL. (This may be adjusted.)
   6.54.2. Airspeed—400 (± 10) KCAS.
   6.54.3. Maneuvering aircraft pursuit—pure pursuit, stacked level.
   6.54.4. Aspect angle—30 to 45 degrees or as briefed. The maneuvering aircraft is just
   forward of the training aircraft’s wingtip. (This may be adjusted for training objectives.)
   6.54.5. Range—6,000 feet.
   6.54.6. Stack—Level (±500ft)
6.55. Setup Comm. Each setup should be preceded by an ops check, a descriptive preparatory
call (“Lance 01, next set FM level 3 for #2”. “2”.)
6.56. FM Exercise Setups. There are three ways to set up the FM exercise; from directed
positions, from a pitchout, or from tactical formation. Flexibility will afford every opportunity to
maximize training despite area and (or) weather constraints.
   6.56.1. From Directed Positions. This option is a little more comm.-intensive, but is
   especially efficient for dealing with weather-restricted airspace. Lead maneuvers or directs
   the flight as necessary back into the block and back to clear airspace for the next setup. The
   maneuvering aircraft simply maintains a directed position until directed to a different
   position by the flight lead.
   6.56.2. From a Pitchout. Lead can accelerate in a route position to starting airspeed before
   the pitchout or direct acceleration afterward. The maneuvering aircraft delays to rollout 7,000
   to 9,000 feet (about 5 to 6 seconds) behind lead. The training aircraft turns to acquire a visual
   and set the desired aspect. When the range decreases to 6,000 feet, the call is made to begin
   maneuvering.
   6.56.3. From a Tactical Formation:
       6.56.3.1. After maneuvering into the block, completing setup admin, and acknowledging
       the descriptive call for the next exercise, the maneuvering aircraft slides out to 7,000 to
       9,000 feet LAB. If transitioning from a 350 KCAS climb or tactical, an acceleration
       maneuver is required and will be directed by lead (“Lance 01, push it up, reference
       heading 180”, “2”.) If transitioning from 400 KCAS tactical, no acceleration maneuver is
       required. The wingman should strive to be ready before the flight lead. Once the flight
       lead calls “Lance 1 ready”, the wingman will respond immediately with his/her status
       (“Lance 2 ready” or “Lance 2 standby airspeed/stack/spacing/etc.”). If the wingman
       makes a “standby” call, he/she will call ready as soon as they are in starting parameters
       for the exercise.
       6.56.3.2. After the “ready” calls, lead directs a check turn into the training aircraft
       (“Lance 01, check left.” The training aircraft normally turns about 45 degrees away from
       the maneuvering aircraft, but may adjust as necessary. The maneuvering aircraft
       continues the turn as needed to place the gun cross on the training aircraft. The training
       aircraft acquires visual on the wingman, remains on the roll-out heading until the
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    111


       wingman has achieved pure pursuit, and then reverses the turn and adjusts back stick
       pressure to “set” the desired aspect. The maneuvering aircraft will verify the correct
       aspect angle and call “ease off” or “tighten up” if required. When range decreases to
       6,000 feet, the call is made to begin maneuvering from the maneuvering aircraft (“Lance
       01, fight’s on.”)
   6.56.4. Avionics. Lead and wing should select the A/A master mode after lead’s descriptive
   preparatory radio call. The A/A master mode will be selected prior to the respective ready
   call.
6.57. Initial Moves:
   6.57.1. Finding the Turn Circle. If the call to begin maneuvering comes right at 6,000 feet,
   the opening move is normally a delay to preserve turning room. From 6,000 feet, just a small
   delay will preserve the optimum turning room for the offensive break turn, which should be
   executed on—or close to—the training aircraft’s turn circle. Use caution during this delay to
   ensure the airspeed does not increase beyond that desired for the break turn. The aspect of the
   training aircraft will increase during this delay. The delay may be accomplished in-plane or
   out of plane. (Many pilots prefer to create some vertical turning room as well by adding a
   slight climb to their delay.)
   6.57.2. Break Turn. A break turn too early—from inside the training aircraft’s turn circle—
   will cause a cut across training aircraft’s turn circle, which quickly decreases range, but also
   creates very high aspect. A break turn too late will waste turning room, cause a turn circle
   overshoot, and result in excessive lag and range. To execute the first break turn, roll to place
   the lift vector approximately on or slightly below the training aircraft and smoothly apply
   backstick pressure in a symmetrical pull to stop the training aircraft’s LOS across the canopy.
   The goals of the first break turn are to realign fuselages as much as possible and decrease
   range while preserving enough energy and turning room to solve subsequent geometry
   problems. Heightened G awareness and careful reference to current G on the HUD are
   required to prevent over-Gs during the first break turn.
6.58. Lag Reposition. The lag reposition (Figure 6.30) is used to generate turning room to
solve excessive closure and angle-off problems.
 112                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


Figure 6.30. Lag Reposition.




   6.58.1. Position your lift vector up and out of the training aircraft’s POM. (The out-of-plane
   angle required will vary. In cases where aspect is decreasing too slowly, a lift vector position
   of more than 90 degrees to the training aircraft’s flightpath may be necessary). Add backstick
   pressure as required to generate turning room.
   6.58.2. Once sufficient turning room has been achieved, crisply roll back to place the lift
   vector on or below the training aircraft and pull to attempt to align fuselages. Use the radial
   G and out-of-plane turning room made available by the lag reposition to help establish lead
   pursuit. Once established in the ET cone, call “in.” The entire lag reposition is normally
   flown at the maximum allowable power setting (MIL for UPT or PIT).
6.59. Lead Reposition. The lead reposition (Figure 6.31) is used to generate closure to decrease
range while preserving or building energy.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  113


Figure 6.31. Lead Reposition.




   6.59.1. Place the nose and lift vector such that you pull lead pursuit in a POM below the
   training aircraft. (How much lead and (or) descent will vary with range, closure, the training
   aircraft’s LOS, and your energy state.) This out-of-plane maneuver uses turning room below
   lead. Analysis of the training aircraft’s LOS will tell you whether you need more or less lead
   pursuit. When desired range or closure is reached, a lag maneuver or reposition may be
   required to preserve turning room for realigning fuselages. Once established in the ET cone,
   call “in”.
   6.59.2. Until the end-game, the lead reposition is normally flown at the maximum allowable
   power setting (MIL for UFT or PIT). Note that the “picture” during a lead reposition may at
   times look very similar to that of a turning rejoin.
6.60. Quarter Plane. The quarter plane (Figure 6.32) is an exaggerated lag reposition used as a
last- ditch maneuver to control closure and prevent a 3/9 line overshoot (often referred to as
“preserving the 3/9 line”) at close ranges and high LOS rates.
 114                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


Figure 6.32. Quarter Plane.




   6.60.1. Crisply rollout of plane and pull to the training aircraft’s high 6 o’clock. The pull
   out-of-plane is at least—and often more than—90 degrees from the training aircraft’s POM,
   but the amount depends on closure, range, and aspect. This pull to the training aircraft’s
   “high six” reduces closure and aspect to prevent the loss of 3/9 line advantage.
   6.60.2. A momentary power reduction may be required, but leaving the power back at high
   AOA with the nose up can quickly result in an excessive loss of energy.
   6.60.3. Following the pull and once assured you will maintain 3/9 line advantage, unload
   and crisply roll to regain a visual and analyze your new position. Key on the training
   aircraft’s LOS. If the training aircraft is still moving aft, the closure problem is probably not
   yet solved. If the training aircraft is stopped or moving forward, closure is under control.
   Once established in the ET cone, call “in”.
6.61. Transition to ET. If briefed, FM may culminate with a transition to the maneuvering
phase of the ET exercise. A radio call from the maneuvering aircraft (for example, “Lance 2’s
in.”) usually marks the transition, after which both pilots will adhere to ET parameters and
restrictions.
6.62. Post-Terminate Flow. The normal post-terminate maneuver is a reset to tactical with a
climb back to the starting altitude block. The reset to tactical is dynamic due to the likely
differences in airspeed between lead and wing. Minimal time should be spent heads down in the
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      115


cockpit for both lead and wing while the formation resets to tactical. Lead must maintain a
vigilant lookout for wing as wing solves tactical formation problems.
   6.62.1. After the terminate or knock-it-off call, wing will check to lag the training aircraft
   and set military power. Lead will reverse the direction of turn, set military power and achieve
   and maintain 350 KCAS in the most energy efficient manner (airspace permitting).
   6.62.2. The timing of lead’s turn reversal will be relative to wing’s position at the terminate
   call and will put wing LAB. Once LAB, wing will set pitch and airspeed as required to
   remain line abreast and attain 4,000 to 6,000 feet spacing.
   6.62.3. The only communication required is during the termination drill. After the
   termination drill, a reference heading by lead may increase wing’s SA but is optional. Wing
   must continuously assess lead and maneuver to stay in position.
   6.62.4. Once the formation is reset to LAB, wing must rely on visual cues from lead’s
   aircraft to maintain tactical position and continue an efficient climb to the starting altitude
   block. During the climb, it is essential both aircraft maintain 350 KCAS without bleeding off
   airspeed in the turns. Lead may elect to turn at less AOA than a level tactical turn. Wing must
   evaluate lead’s turn rate and adjust turn timing and turn rate to stay in position. Typically
   these turns are referred to as “easy” turns.
   6.62.5. Avionics. Lead and wing will return to the NAV master mode after the terminate
   drill and no later than completion of the post-terminate ops check.
6.63. Blind Procedures. If any aircraft goes blind, he/she will immediately call “no joy”. If the
maneuvering aircraft is blind, he/she will lag the training aircraft’s last known position and
power modulate as required to maintain current airspeed (300kts minimum) and altitude. If the
training aircraft is blind, he/she will remain predictable (which usually means continuing the turn
under current parameters).
   6.63.1. If the other aircraft is visual, he/she may direct the blind aircraft to continue while
   talking the blind aircraft onto the visual. “Lance 2, no joy”. “Lance 2, continue, visual is
   your 2 o’clock, slightly low.” Once the blind aircraft calls “tally” he/she may continue
   maneuvering. If the blind aircraft does not regain the visual immediately, either aircraft may
   call a knock-it-off.
   6.63.2. If both aircraft are blind, call a knock-it-off, establish altitude deconfliction, and the
   training aircraft must be directive with the wingman in order to deconflict and regain mutual
   support.

Section 6E—Handling Abnormal Situations in Formation

6.64. Takeoff Aborts.
   6.64.1. Formation Takeoff:
       6.64.1.1. If an abort becomes necessary, maintain aircraft control, ensure separation from
       the other aircraft by maintaining your side of the runway, and make a radio call as soon
       as practical (“Flank 2 is aborting, barrier, barrier, barrier.”). However, do not sacrifice
       aircraft control to make a radio call.
 116                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       6.64.1.2. During a formation takeoff, there will normally be no sympathetic aborts within
       the element after brake release. Sympathetic aborts can create situations where a
       good aircraft is risking simultaneous barrier engagement, hot brakes, or blown tires.
       6.64.1.3. During an abort situation, the aircraft continuing the takeoff will maintain
       its side of the runway, select full afterburner, and execute a normal single-ship
       takeoff. If lead determines both aircraft should abort, he or she will direct the wingman
       to abort. For example, lead will transmit, “Sting 21 flight, abort, abort, abort.” Being in
       minimum afterburner and still overrunning lead could be the first indication that lead is
       aborting. If this occurs, accomplish a separate takeoff.
   6.64.2. Interval Takeoff. If you abort as lead, make a radio call to your wingman. It is
   difficult for the wingman to recognize an abort using only visual cues. If, as the wingman,
   you have not released brakes, reduce your power and hold your position until lead clears the
   runway. If you have started the takeoff roll but are below 100 knots, consider aborting
   because you may not have sufficient spacing to takeoff behind lead. If you are above 100
   knots, you should continue the takeoff using MAX afterburner.
   6.64.3. Element Abort. If an element abort is necessary, each aircraft must maintain its
   respective side of the runway and make every effort to stop prior to the end of the runway.
   Any aircraft requiring a barrier engagement should transmit its callsign and “barrier,
   barrier, barrier.” If neither aircraft can stop prior to the end of the runway, the first aircraft
   to the barrier will engage the barrier and the second aircraft will take any necessary action to
   prevent barrier engagement, to include departing the runway surface.
6.65. Airborne Emergencies. As much as possible, maintain formation integrity for all
airborne emergencies. If any aircraft malfunction occurs while in close formation, ensure aircraft
separation before handling the emergency. The pilot of an aircraft experiencing an abnormal
situation will advise lead of the problem, his or her intentions, and assistance required.
   6.65.1. Lead. As a minimum, offer the lead to a wingman as soon as you realize he or she
   has an aircraft malfunction and is in a position to take the lead. If the wingman refuses the
   lead, try to pass the lead on recovery and on final with clearance to land or as the situation
   dictates. Except in unusual circumstances, do not land in formation with a disabled aircraft. If
   the wingman is able to transmit and receive with the radio, give him or her verbal assistance
   as necessary. Follow the preflight briefing instructions for emergencies so the wingman
   knows what to expect.
   6.65.2. Wingman. When an aircraft malfunction is discovered, call “knock-it-off’ and then
   inform lead of the problem. Normally, if you are able to communicate with outside agencies
   and navigate, take the lead when offered. As much as possible, avoid flying the wing position
   with an emergency. If you must fly the wing position with an emergency, fly no closer than
   route spacing when weather allows.
   6.65.3. Radio Failure. An aircraft experiencing radio failure will normally assume or retain
   the wing position. If experiencing radio failure as lead, put the wingmen in route and give the
   appropriate AFI 11-205 visual signal. Then pass the lead to either number 2 or number 3 as
   appropriate. If experiencing radio failure as a wingman while in close or route formation,
   maneuver within close or route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member,
   and give the appropriate visual signals. In other positions, do not rejoin closer than 500 feet.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     117


  Rock your wings to gain lead’s attention, and wait for a rejoin signal from lead. When
  signaled, rejoin as close as necessary to pass the appropriate visual signals.
  6.65.4. Lost Wingman Procedures:
     6.65.4.1. Lead. To minimize the possibility of a lost wingman situation, brief pertinent
     IMC procedures during the preflight briefing. Bring all wingmen into fingertip spacing,
     and reform any three- or four- ship formation into fingertip prior to entering IMC.
     6.65.4.2. Wingman. If lead fails to coordinate for a separate clearance, contact the
     controlling agency. Keep in mind that lost wingman procedures do not guarantee obstacle
     clearance when close to the ground. Therefore, each pilot who is executing lost wingman
     procedures is responsible for terrain and obstacle clearance.
  6.65.5. Bird Strike. If a bird strike appears imminent, do not hit the other aircraft in an effort
  to miss the bird. The primary concern is still aircraft separation. If a bird strike does occur,
  ensure aircraft separation before handling the emergency. Lead should consider the option of
  a wing landing if the rear cockpit pilot must land the affected aircraft and forward visibility is
  severely restricted.
  6.65.6. Lost Sight. In some cases, losing sight of the other aircraft does not require a
  breakout or lost wingman procedure because sufficient spacing already exists. If the other
  aircraft is not in sight when anticipated, use the following procedures:
     6.65.6.1. Notification. Notify the other aircraft of your situation (“Sting 2’s blind.”). In
     some cases, heading, altitude, or turn information may also be appropriate with this call.
     If only lead is blind, the call “Sting 2 posit?” is posed as a question for the wingman, who
     responds with his or her position ("Sting 2, visual, your right 3 o'clock, high").
     6.65.6.2. One Aircraft Is Blind. If the other aircraft has not lost sight, transmit “visual”
     with a relative position to the blind aircraft. If lead is the blind aircraft, but the wingman
     has lead in sight, lead has the option to direct a rejoin or continue to search for the
     wingman based on the response to a “posit” call.
     6.65.6.3. Both Aircraft Are Blind. If both aircraft have lost sight, lead will immediately
     ensure a minimum of 1,000 feet altitude separation. Once separation is assured, TCAS
     may be used to affect the rejoin. By determining relative position and heading, lead can
     determine a rejoin geometry that will allow both aircraft to close and regain the visual.
     Lead will be directive and may use terms as” “reference” for heading, “set” for airspeed,
     and “maintain” for altitude. Wing will comply with these directives establishing lead’s
     determined geometry to attain visual. Both aircraft will maintain altitude separation until
     one aircraft regains visual. The aircraft that gains visual may request the other aircraft to
     rock its wings for positive iden-tification. The aircraft with the visual is responsible for
     maintaining separation and may request the other aircraft to maneuver to maintain the
     visual.
     6.65.6.4. Three- or Four-Ship Formations. All members of a multi-ship formation should
     strive to maintain visual on all other members of the formation. However, the wingman’s
     primary responsibility is to maintain visual on his or her element lead. If a member of the
     flight loses sight of any other aircraft, call blind or visual with the number of aircraft seen
     (“Snake 4, blind” or “Snake 4, blind,visual two aircraft”). With high situational
118                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


      awareness, call blind on the appropriate aircraft (“Snake 3, blind on 2”.) This call may be
      delayed if there is no doubt as to the identification of the aircraft with which they are
      visual, and no conflict exists. For instance, in wall or offset box, if a wingman loses sight
      of the opposite wingman but has maintained visual on his or her element lead and lead, a
      “blind” call would not be required. If any doubt exists, call “blind”.
  6.65.7. Midair Collision. If a midair collision occurs between formation members, under
  no circumstances will they act as chase ships for each other.
  6.65.8. Ejection. If one aircraft in a formation must perform a controlled ejection, the chase
  ship should fly abreast of the disabled aircraft and no closer than 1,000 feet.
  6.65.9. Spatial Disorientation:
      6.65.9.1. Lead. If you experience spatial disorientation as lead, immediately advise the
      wing-men, and if possible, transfer aircraft control to the other crewmember. If transfer of
      aircraft control is not an option, confirm attitude with the other crewmember or wingmen.
      If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the simplest and
      safest means possible.
      6.65.9.2. Wingman. Wingmen experiencing spatial disorientation will advise their other
      crewmember and (or) lead when disorientation makes it difficult to maintain position.
      The crewmember not in control of the aircraft or lead will advise the wingman of aircraft
      attitude, altitude, heading, and airspeed. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, lead
      should establish straight-and-level flight for 30 to 60 seconds and consider passing the
      lead to the disoriented wingman. If necessary, terminate the mission and recover by the
      simplest and safest means possible.
      6.65.9.3. Three- and Four-Ship. Lead should separate the flight into elements to more
      effectively handle a wingman with persistent spatial disorientation symptoms. The
      element with the disoriented pilot should remain straight-and-level while the other
      element separates from the flight.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      119

7.1. Introduction. Instrument flying procedures are described in detail in AFMAN 11-217,
Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures. There will be circumstances when you must rely on
your instrument flying ability to operate safely. This section will familiarize you with a few of
the instrument procedures specific to the T-38.
7.2. Instrument Cross-Check. The control and performance concept is the foundation of good
instrument flying. The T-38 HUD is certified as a primary flight reference (PFR) and may be
used as a standalone reference for instrument flight. Note: Use the UFCP AUT/DAY/NIGHT
toggle switch and H BRT control to set the desired HUD brightness during changing visual
conditions. A solid instrument cross-check will use control instruments (attitude indicator, HUD
pitch/bank scales, and engine tachometers) and performance instruments (HUD or MFD
altimeter, airspeed indicator, vertical velocity, AOA, and horizontal situation indicator [HSI]) to:
   7.2.1. Establish an attitude and power setting on the control instruments. Note: Setting
   precise pitch settings is easiest on the HUD; however, it may increase potential for
   spatial disorientation or complicate the cross-check during IMC.
   7.2.2. Trim until control pressures are neutralized.
   7.2.3. Cross-check performance instruments to determine if the established attitude and
   power settings are providing the desired performance.
   7.2.4. Adjust attitude and power setting using control instruments, and retrim as necessary.
7.3. Prior to Instrument Takeoff (ITO). Update weather conditions and TOLD; review the
instrument departure, radar routing, terminal approach NAVAIDs and radar approach capability
at the departure airfield, and review an emergency return plan based on single-engine climb
capability and obstacle features of the departure airfield. Set up your NAVAIDs accordingly.
7.4. Rear Cockpit Takeoffs with an Instrument Hood. As you start to close the rear canopy,
pull the instrument hood forward enough to ensure it will remain clear of the canopy rails and the
canopy piercer on top of the ejection seat. When the rear canopy is fully closed, pull the
instrument hood back out of the way.
7.5. ITO. The ITO is similar to the contact takeoff except you will transition to instruments as
outside visual references deteriorate. Once airborne, hold a wings-level, takeoff attitude by
setting 7 degrees nose-high on the bore sight cross (F-16 HUD) or waterline (MIL-STD HUD)
and confirm a definite rate of climb. After verifying a positive climb on the altimeter and a
positive vertical velocity, retract the landing gear and flaps. As visual references deteriorate, the
decision to transition to either the HUD or EADI will be based on proficiency, experience, and
comfort level with interpreting the applicable display. During this critical phase of flight, a
composite cross-check is essential especially if using the HUD as the primary flight reference.
Note: Use extreme caution when transitioning to instruments during the takeoff. The pitch
changes associated with gear and flap retraction in the T-38 may cause momentary disorientation
at very low altitude. A proper instrument cross-check is essential to maintain SA during this
phase of flight.

7.6. Instrument Departure. In most cases, you will use the restricted MIL power climb
schedule for instrument and navigation departures. You must maintain a constant cross-check in
order to divide attention between aircraft control, departure procedures, and checklist duties.
This can be accomplished by quickly completing one item at a time and returning to your
instrument cross-check in between, with primary emphasis on the EADI or HUD.
7.7. Level Off. The lead point for level off, from either a climb or descent, will vary depending
on the vertical velocity you are using. The following techniques will help you develop smooth
lead points:
   7.7.1. With low or moderate climb or descent rates, begin the level-off at 10 percent of the
   vertical velocity reading. For example, with a vertical velocity of 2,500 fpm, begin the level-
   off 250 feet early.
   7.7.2. With a vertical velocity greater than 6,000 fpm, reduce the pitch attitude by one-half at
   2,000 feet prior to level-off, and then use 10 percent of the vertical velocity.
7.8. Arc and Radial Intercepts:
   7.8.1. Turn Radius.
       7.8.1.1. Arc and radial intercept techniques are based on making a 90-degree turn, using
       30 degrees of bank in no-wind conditions. Because these techniques are also based on
       established turns, the slower you roll into 30 degrees of bank, the more you will need to
       “pad” your lead point. Turn radius lead points for the T-38 in miles can be calculated
       using the following techniques:
           7.8.1.1.1. For higher airspeeds (greater than 300 KCAS), Mach number - 2 =
           approximate turn radius (in miles) using 30 degrees bank.
           7.8.1.1.2. For slower speeds, 1 percent of CAS = approximate turn radius (in miles),
           using 30 degrees bank.
       7.8.1.2. To adjust for less than 90 degrees of turn, use the following techniques:
           7.8.1.2.1. For a turn of 60 degrees, use one-half of the calculated lead point.
           7.8.1.2.2. For a turn of 45 degrees, use one-third of the calculated lead point.
           7.8.1.2.3. For a turn of 30 degrees, use one-sixth of the calculated lead point.
   7.8.2. Arc-to-Radial Intercepts. After calculating your lead point, use the 60-to-1 rule to
   translate the lead point in miles to the lead point in radials. For example:
       7.8.2.1. Using the 1-percent technique, flying at 250 KCAS corresponds to a 2.5 nm turn
       radius. By applying the 60 to 1 rule, on the 10 DME arc where there are 6 radials per
       mile, use a lead point of 15 radials.
       7.8.2.2. At .5 Mach, using the Mach-number-minus-2 technique, the turn radius is 3 nm.
       On the 20 DME arc where there are 3 radials per mile, use a lead point of 9 radials.
7.9. Basic Aircraft Control Maneuvers:
   7.9.1. Vertical “S” Maneuvers. Fly Vertical “S” maneuvers as described in AFMAN 11-217,
   Volume 1, at various airspeeds and configurations. Normally, use a vertical velocity of 1,000
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      121


   to 2,000 fpm and a 1,000-foot altitude block. The following techniques can be used to
   anticipate the pitch and vertical velocity changes at different airspeeds:
       7.9.1.1. IMN x 1,000 = vertical velocity change for a 1-degree pitch change. For
       example, at .6 IMN, you will get about 600 fpm per degree of pitch change.
   7.9.2. Steep Turns. Practicing steep turns builds confidence and instrument skills that
   sometimes become necessary when 30 degrees of bank is not sufficient for safety or other
   reasons. Practice steep turns at various airspeeds using 45 to 60 degrees of bank. AFMAN
   11-217, Volume 1, describes factors associated with flying steep turns. Either holding the
   HUD FPM or CDM on the horizon line or making desired pitch changes on the EADI can be
   used to maintain altitude. The HUD heading scale or EHSI can be used for rollouts. In the T-
   38C, the EHSI makes lead points for rollout negligible, usually less than 5 degrees.
   7.9.3. Instrument Aileron Roll. The instrument aileron roll is one of the confidence
   maneuvers discussed in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. As the name implies, this maneuver
   builds confidence and teaches aircraft control throughout wider ranges of pitch, bank, and
   airspeed. It also helps develop skills required to recover from unusual attitudes, using the
   EADI during extreme pitch and bank attitudes. Perform instrument aileron roll as described
   in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, using a minimum of 300 KCAS and 85 percent rpm.
   7.9.4. Unusual Attitudes. Refer to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for procedures on recovering
   from instrument unusual attitudes.
7.10. Direct to Fix (Fix-to-Fix with EGI). Proceeding direct to a radial/DME fix is not a basic
requirement to operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) nor does it comply with Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) accepted practices and procedures. Therefore, T-38 pilots will
normally use the aircraft’s RNAV capability (EGI) when proceeding direct to a fix.
   7.10.1. For pilot to file or accept a clearance to navigate direct to a radial/DME fix, either the
   aircraft must be RNAV capable; the flight must be conducted where radar monitoring by
   ATC is available; the locally defined arrival/departure procedures must have been authorized
   by the FAA; or an operational necessity must dictate the requirement.
   7.10.2. A common error is mistakenly entering the wrong ICAO identifier. Verify that the
   bearing and range to the steerpoint makes sense relative to your current position. To proceed
   direct to a fix using the EGI, type the name of the fix into the UFCP, select EGI as the PNS,
   and center-up the CDI. Approaching the fix, EGI can be used as the secondary nav source
   using the ground track (GT) pointer centered on the EGI pointer to proceed direct. This will
   allow sufficient time to dial in appropriate follow-on procedures prior to arriving at the fix.
7.11. Fix-to-Fix (without EGI). In accordance with USAF and FAA guidance, EGI is the
primary means to navigate directly to a radial/DME fix. However, proceeding directly to a
VOR/DME or TACAN fix without the use of EGI can be accomplished to understand the basics
of maintaining SA off of a ground NAVAID or common reference point (e.g., determining your
position relative to another aircraft off of a bullseye point) and is a valued core competency skill
for AF pilots. To accomplish this training, follow guidance outlined in AFMAN 11-217,
Volume 1. Normally, this training will only be accomplished in the simulator.
7.12. Arrival Checks. AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, describes how to prepare for an instrument
arrival or approach. One technique for accomplishing arrival checks is the “WHOLDS” check.
 122                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


This check is meant to be a memory aid to ensure required items are accomplished en route to an
initial approach fix (IAF), a holding fix, or prior to beginning an en route descent. It may also be
used between approaches. If an item such as a descent check or obtaining the weather has been
accomplished, it does not need to be reaccomplished between approaches. (Note: Items in bold
and italics are mandatory checks required by AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.)
   7.12.1. WHOLDS—A Memory Aid.
Weather. Recheck weather (if appropriate). Determine the landing runway and altimeter
setting, and ensure the weather and airfield are suitable for the approach.

Holding or Heading and Attitude Systems. Obtain clearance to hold, review the holding
pattern, and determine the appropriate point to slow to holding airspeed. Review holding entry
techniques to determine the most appropriate entry. Check heading and attitude systems.

Obtain clearance for the approach and coordinate for climb out instructions if applicable.

Letdown Plate Review or Lost Comm. Review the IAP for the type of final planned. Refer to
AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for approach review techniques. Set up NAVAIDs as
appropriate. Coordinate lost communication procedures (if required) and consider a plan for a
backup approach.

Descent Check. Items on the descent check, such as altimeter settings and airspeeds, may
need to be updated in the course of the approach. Check the heading and attitude systems.

Speeds. Calculate final approach speeds and review configuration.
7.13. Holding:
   7.13.1. AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, provides guidance for holding. Most holding fixes are
   defined by DME limits; however, there are still many holding patterns that require timing.
   ATC expects you to slow to holding speed no earlier than 3 minutes prior to the holding fix.
   7.13.2. As a technique, begin reducing speed 5 to 10 nm prior to the holding fix (1 to 2
   minutes) to ensure entering holding at holding airspeeds (250 to 265 KCAS). Approximately
   88 to 90 percent rpm will hold 250 to 265 KCAS in level flight. When correcting for position
   and (or) winds, adjust the displacement on the outbound leg to intercept the holding course
   inbound.
   7.13.3. A technique for a no-wind starting point follows: 360 divided by DME equals the
   number of radials displacement desired at the outbound DME limit. For example, a 30 DME
   outer limit for holding requires about 12 radials of displacement (360 ÷ 30 = 12).
7.14. En Route Descents. En route descents usually provide the quickest and most efficient
way to get from the middle or high altitude structure to a landing. The goal of an en route descent
is to arrive at a point from which vectors to an instrument final can be followed. Continually
update the progress of your en route descent. If in doubt, the conservative choice is to get down a
little early. The following techniques will help you determine an appropriate pitch gradient:
   7.14.1. Mathematical Gradient. Divide your altitude to lose (in thousands of feet) by the
   distance to travel (in nm) and then translate the result into degrees of pitch change. For
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    123


    example, you are at a cruising altitude of FL 270, 60 nm from where you would like to be
    when you reach the final approach fix (FAF) altitude of 2,000 feet MSL. So, with 25,000 feet
    to lose in 60 nm, you will need a descent gradient of 417 feet per nm. Because each degree of
    pitch change results in 100 feet per nm, a nose-low attitude of 4 to 5 degrees will work.
    7.14.2. Visualizing the Gradient. Divide your altitude (in thousands of feet) by the distance
    to travel (in nm), and then superimpose that ratio using the first 10 degrees of dive gradients
    on the EADI. Designate the 10-degree nose-low line on the EADI as the distance to travel.
    Then visually determine where the altitude-to-lose (in thousands of feet) falls between the
    level flight line and the 10-degree dive line. For example, using the same scenario as in
    paragraph 7.14.1, you need to lose 25,000 feet in 60 nm. Designate the 10-degree dive line to
    be the 60 (nm) and superimpose the 25 (thousands of feet) on the EADI as a visual ratio of
    altitude over distance. The 5-degree dive line would represent 30 (thousands of feet), so 25
    (thousands of feet) would fall about 4 degrees nose-low.
    7.14.3. Pitch/Power Techniques. During the initial portion of a high altitude descent—
    or if the potential for icing exists—consider power settings of at least 80 percent rpm. Also
    consider engine- operating restrictions when changing power at high altitudes. Headwinds
    and tailwinds can drastically affect the descent distances resulting from any pitch and power
    setting combination. Table 7.1 lists pitch and power setting combinations for various 300
    KCAS descent gradients.

6     1,300 feet/nm         13 degrees           idle
7.15. VORTAC Penetration. The purpose of a VORTAC penetration is to descend from an en
route altitude to a position from which an approach and landing can be made using the VORTAC
as the primary NAVAID. If the VORTAC and EGI steerpoint are identical or close, use caution
not to confuse the bearing pointers. Select the correct PNS before passing the IAF. Penetrations
are normally flown at 300 KCAS. However, you may fly the penetration at a slower speed—or
slow down early—if factors like a relatively short penetration or a low-DME arc make it smarter
to do so. Remember, descent gradient is based strictly on pitch attitude (independent of
airspeed). Therefore, an idle descent at 7 degrees nose-low and 300 knots will get you lower in
less forward distance than an idle descent at 6 degrees nose-low and 240 knots. If holding is not
accomplished, slow to 300 KCAS, and set the inbound course prior to the IAF. Consider
requesting maneuvering airspace if your inbound heading does not conveniently align you with
the initial inbound course. Remember to set the local altimeter setting IAW Flight Information
Handbook procedures.

7.16. Precision Approaches:
   7.16.1. Instrument Landing System (ILS). The ILS is a precision approach that provides the
   pilot with final approach course and glidepath information, as follows:
       7.16.1.1. Intercepting Final:
          7.16.1.1.1. If you are still up near 300 KCAS during the last segment of a penetration
          (or as you turn onto the base leg), start slowing down. No later than dogleg to final or
          approximately 10 to 15 nm from touchdown, you should be slowed to 240 to 260
          KCAS. Note: From 85 to 87 percent rpm will hold these airspeeds.
          7.16.1.1.2. If a VORTAC is located on or near the field, selecting TACAN or VOR
          as the PNS can provide useful information for position orientation and can provide a
          lead radial for starting the turn to intercept the final course. If the VORTAC is not
          located on the field, consider setting the EGI steerpoint to the field or the FAF in
          order to maintain orientation relative to the field or the FAF.
          7.16.1.1.3. No later than after commencing the turn to final, select ILS as the PNS
          and set the published front course either via UFCP or MFD rocker switch. If the
          course was previously set and EGI was the PNS, double-check that the EGI did not
          change the course while updating the navigation solution. Once ILS is selected, all
          VOR steering disappears. Use all available references and SA for the turn to final;
          don’t expect the bank steering bar to guide you perfectly onto final. If established on
          a dogleg to final within 30 degrees of the final course, starting the turn to final as the
          CDI begins to move should allow a comfortable intercept without overshooting final.
       7.16.1.2. Prior to the FAF. Configure the aircraft approximately 2 to 5 nm prior to the
       FAF. Trim and adjust the pitch attitude appropriately on the EADI as the aircraft
       decelerates. Power settings between 93 and 95 percent rpm will hold final approach
       airspeed in level flight with gear and full flaps. Use 90 to 91 percent rpm for
       configurations with 60 percent flaps.
       7.16.1.3. Course and Glidepath Control:
          7.16.1.3.1. On final, make heading changes of 5 degrees or less for precise course
          control. Bank angles of 5 degrees or less are sufficient for small, controlled heading
          changes. To prevent overcorrecting while on the final approach course, make small
          but positive corrections to centerline deviations. If configured on speed at glideslope
          intercept, a pitch change corresponding with the glideslope (normally 2.5 to 3.0
          degrees) should provide a good initial rate of descent.
          7.16.1.3.2. At final approach speeds, you are traveling at approximately 2.5 to 3 nm
          per minute so a 3- degree pitch change will produce a vertical velocity of about 750 to
          900 fpm. Adjust descent rate using pitch changes of 2 degrees or less to start. Then
          use changes of about 1 degree for precise glidepath control. Course and glideslope
          sensitivity increases as you approach decision height (DH); therefore, smaller
          corrections are required to regain or maintain “on course, on glidepath.”
          7.16.1.3.3. Cross-check raw data (glideslope indicator, CDI) to ensure proper
          performance of the flight director steering. Precise pitch inputs can be made if using
          the HUD. However, because of the precision available, you must avoid the tendency
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    125


          to chase the flight director. Constantly monitor your altitude in relation to appropriate
          weather minimums and (or) DH. Monitor your altitude in relation to localizer
          minimums in case glideslope information becomes unreliable.
   7.16.2. Precision Approach Radar (PAR). The PAR is a precision approach for which a final
   approach controller provides verbal course and glidepath information.
      7.16.2.1. Intercepting Final. The precision final approach starts when the aircraft is
      within range of the precision radar, and contact is established with the final controller.
      Normally, this occurs approximately 8 miles from touchdown. Prepare and configure the
      aircraft the same as for an ILS.
      7.16.2.2. Course and Glidepath Control. The same basic techniques for flying an ILS
      (paragraph 7.16.1) can be used to fly a PAR. Follow controller instructions for heading
      control. Bank angles of 5 degrees or less are sufficient for small, controlled heading
      changes. If called “below” or “above” glidepath, use pitch corrections of l degree on the
      EADI with corresponding 1 percent rpm changes. If called “well below” or “well above”
      glidepath, use pitch corrections up to 2 degrees with corresponding 2 to 3 percent rpm
      changes. As with the ILS, course and glideslope sensitivity increases as you approach
      DH.
   7.16.3. Transition to Landing. When approaching the DH, start glancing outside to pick up
   the runway or approach lighting. You will need to look through the HUD symbology to see
   the runway environment which may necessitate adjusting the HUD brightness down. Do not
   fixate on the HUD while attempting to acquire sufficient visual cues to continue the
   approach. Transition to a composite cross-check as you gain adequate visual references, but
   be ready to transition back to instruments if weather conditions deteriorate. After the runway
   is sighted, cross-check visual cues, glidepath lighting, and instruments to ensure that a safe
   landing is possible. If you follow the glidepath of a precision approach down through
   minimums to a landing, your touchdown will be approximately 2,000 feet down the runway.
   Do not transition your glidepath to the threshold (“Duck Under”) in accordance with
   AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, paragraph 13.2.4.2.2.
   7.16.4. Precision Approach Backup. Whenever you are flying a precision approach, be ready
   to transition to a backup approach. This could be a transition from a PAR to an ILS (or vice
   versa), or to a non-precision approach. To make this transition easier, have the approach page
   and or approach minimums readily available.
7.17. Non-precision Approaches:
   7.17.1. Intercepting Final. If intercepting a localizer final, use the same techniques as
   described for precision approaches (paragraph 7.16.1.1). If intercepting a VORTAC final
   from an arc 12 to 15 nm from the field, normally a 10-degree lead point provides a
   comfortable intercept to final. This is indicated by the CDI “coming off the wall.” Once
   established on a dogleg to a VORTAC final, approximately 3 to 4 degrees of CDI deflection
   should provide a good point to turn to intercept final.
   7.17.2. Prior to the FAF. Prepare and configure the aircraft the same as for a precision
   approach (paragraph 7.16).
   7.17.3. Non-Precision Final Descent:
 126                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       7.17.3.1. The goal of a non-precision final is to descend to an altitude—below the
       weather—from which you can make a safe transition to landing. Therefore, it is
       imperative that you plan and fly the descent so as to reach the minimum descent altitude
       (MDA) prior to the visual descent point (VDP).
       7.17.3.2. At the FAF, or when directed by the controller to “descend to your minimum
       descent altitude,” lower the nose about 4 to 5 degrees on the EADI. Reduce power by
       approximately 10 percent rpm to maintain final approach airspeed in the descent.
       Normally, a descent rate of 1,200 to 1,500 fpm will ensure you arrive at the MDA prior to
       the VDP. Use caution for intermediate stepdown restrictions prior to the MDA. As a
       technique, reduce your descent rate 200 to 300 fpm prior to the MDA. Level off above
       the MDA by an amount appropriate to your proficiency level and readjust power (93 to
       95 percent rpm will hold final approach airspeed).
   7.17.4. Transition to Landing. If the runway environment is in sight at the VDP and you are
   in a safe position to land, a 3-degree nose-down pitch change along with a slight power
   reduction should set up a transition to landing for the normal landing zone. If you begin the
   transition late or if the runway is sighted after the VDP, you can either accept a slightly
   longer landing (if runway length and condition allows) or, if weather and conditions permit,
   use a momentarily steeper glidepath to re-intercept a 3- degree glidepath.
WARNING: Use extreme caution to avoid excessive sink rates during transition to landing. If
not in a position to execute a safe landing, execute a low approach, missed approach, or climb
out.
7.18. Circling. Circling is accomplished at final turn airspeed with 60 percent flaps. During
the instrument final approach, descend no lower than circling MDA for the runway to which
the instrument approach is flown. Maintain circling airspeed and 60 percent flaps throughout
the entire circling maneuver until aligned with the landing runway. Do not descend below
MDA until in a position to place the aircraft on a normal glidepath to the landing runway.
Once aligned with the landing runway in a safe position to land, slow to final approach airspeed
and select full flaps, if desired.
   7.18.1. Downwind Displacement:
       7.18.1.1. For circling maneuvers requiring a downwind leg, proper displacement from
       the runway is critical (approximately 1.5 nm). A low circling altitude will make you feel
       much wider than you are. Attempting to use sight pictures for the normal overhead
       pattern may cause an overshooting, high-bank angle situation during the turn to final. Do
       not hesitate to go around if you will need to overbank to prevent an overshoot.
       7.18.1.2. Unlike the normal overhead pattern in which a good part of your turn radius is
       consumed in the vertical, the circling final turn radius is almost entirely absorbed
       horizontally. The amount of spacing required to complete the turn to final will vary with
       airspeed (fuel weight), bank angle, and winds. Poor visibility may require you to stay
       closer to the runway, but do not use a displacement that requires more than 45 degrees of
       bank to complete the final turn. As a technique, you should plan to practice circling to
       remain within published visibility minimums.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     127


   7.18.2. Downwind Spacing Techniques. The following techniques assist the transition from
   the instrument approach portion to arrive at a perch with sufficient spacing to complete the
   final turn. (Note: When using any of these techniques, you must correct for winds.)
       7.18.2.1. To Circle 180 Degrees or the Opposite Direction:
          7.18.2.1.1. Turn 45 degrees away from the runway until you have flown “down” the
          runway about the same distance as your desired displacement. Then turn to parallel
          the runway prior to the turn to final. For example, for a 10,000-foot runway, hold the
          45-degree offset until approaching the end of the runway in forward runway distance
          covered. This will build about 10,000 feet of spacing.
          7.18.2.1.2. A second option is to perform two 90-degree turns using the desired final
          turn bank angle— the first to turn perpendicular to the runway, and the second to turn
          to parallel. Keeping the runway in sight will be more challenging using this
          technique.
       7.18.2.2. To Circle 270 Degrees. Fly past the runway 15 seconds. Then use the desired
       final turn bank angle to turn downwind. After passing the landing runway, a second
       option is to turn downwind, using a bank angle with twice the turn radius of your desired
       final turn bank angle.
       7.18.2.3. To Circle 360 Degrees. Consider delaying the initial turn so you can more
       easily keep most of the runway environment in sight over your shoulder. If you begin a
       360-degree circle at the approach end of the landing runway, you will be belly-up to the
       runway environment and you could lose sight.
   7.18.3. Circling Considerations. You must remain vigilant for stall indications and have the
   discipline to execute a go-around or stall recovery when required. The circling approach
   presents a potential sink rate problem in the T-38 that may not be accompanied by a stall
   warning. An overbank during a circling approach creates an insidious descent, which adds to
   the potential danger.
   7.18.4. Unplanned Circling. There may be occasions when you must begin circling from
   final approach airspeed. For instance, if the runway becomes “wet” during a formation
   approach, one aircraft may have to circle to land while the other full stops. In these instances,
   remember to check and reset the flaps to 60 percent and accelerate to final turn airspeed
   before starting the circle.
7.19. Sidestep:
   7.19.1. A sidestep maneuver is a small visual ground track adjustment at the end of a
   straight-in approach to allow an approach to one runway and a landing on a parallel runway.
   Where this maneuver is authorized, there may or may not be sidestep procedures or MDAs
   published on the approach plate. If you are cleared to sidestep where there are no published
   sidestep MDAs, use circling minimums. Clearance to sidestep will be issued by the tower.
   7.19.2. Although sidesteps are not circling maneuvers, one technique is to configure with
   gear and 60 percent flaps and maintain a minimum of final turn airspeed. In any case,
   maintain no less than final approach airspeed during the sidestep. You may begin the sidestep
   maneuver anytime after the landing runway is in sight and inside the FAF. Lower full flaps

   and slow to final approach speed when aligned with the landing runway in a safe position to
   land.
7.20. Missed Approach:
   7.20.1. Perform a missed approach IAW conditions outlined in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1,
   and the flight manual. Advance power to MIL, close the speed brakes if open, and raise the
   nose to 5 degrees nose-high on the EADI (7 degrees nose-high on the bore sight cross and
   waterline). With a positive climb established on the altimeter and the vertical velocity
   reversing, retract the gear and flaps. Accelerate to and maintain 240 to 300 KCAS in a
   positive climb until reaching missed approach altitude. After attaining 240 KCAS, power
   can be reduced to slow the rate of climb.
   7.20.2. If a single-engine missed approach is necessary, apply single-engine go-around
   boldface. Use extreme caution in attempting to attain 5 degrees above the last known level-
   flight pitch attitude. If the ability to maintain airspeed, positive climb, and terrain clearance is
   in question, consider ejection.
   7.20.3. For circling approaches, if the runway environment is not in sight at the missed
   approach point, execute the verbally issued climb out instructions or published missed
   approach. If the circling maneuver has been started and the airport environment is
   visually lost, perform a missed approach for the runway to which the approach was flown
   IAW AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    129

                                        NAVIGATION

8.1. Introduction. The purpose of navigation is to get from point A to point B. Whether
accomplished on a cross-country mission or used to find a target, navigation requires significant
preflight planning. Planning a navigation sortie requires you to consider many factors—runway
length, barriers, servicing availability, airfield operating hours, etc.—taken for granted at the
home field.
8.2. Preflight Planning. Prior to departing on any off-station mission, familiarize yourself with
the strange-field procedures located in applicable FLIP guidance and Section II of the flight
manual. Throughout all your planning, be very careful to use accurate local or Zulu time, as
appropriate. Before starting detailed mission planning, verify the following basic requirements:
   8.2.1. Ensure your arrival and departure fall inside operating hours for the airfield and the
   transient alert or servicing fixed base operator (FBO).
   8.2.2. Make a preliminary check of the weather, winds, notices to airmen (NOTAM), and
   airfield suitability and restriction report for showstoppers, like runway closures, winds out of
   limits, or forecasts below minimums. For RNAV operations, check GPS NOTAMs and
   receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) availability before flight. Note: There is
   an approved FAA website for RAIM checks at http://www.raimprediction.net/ac90-100/.
   8.2.3. Call your destination to ensure you can go there, get proper servicing, have a place to
   stay (if applicable), and depart on schedule. If necessary, obtain a prior permission required
   number. While you have the destination station on the phone, ask about the landing runway,
   multiple approach availability, serviceability of the start cart (has it been started and used
   recently?), and any unusual procedures or facility changes that are not in the NOTAMs.
   Variations in off-station pressure altitude, temperature, and runway length could result in
   TOLD numbers significantly different from typical home field computations. Where the
   combination of pressure altitude and temperature might be a factor, ensure the TOLD at the
   out base will not prohibit your departure.
8.3. Single-Engine Planning. Due to the performance limitations of the T-38 during single-
engine situations, departures require detailed planning IAW current MAJCOM and subordinate
guidance to meet AFI 11-202, Volume 3, requirements.
8.4. Planning an IFR Navigation Mission:
   8.4.1. Weather and Winds. The weather and winds determine if you can takeoff; where, how
   far, and (perhaps) how high you can fly en route; whether you can land at your destination;
   and if an alternate is required. Prior to the detailed planning, check the following:
       8.4.1.1. Departure, en route, destination, and drop-in weather—observation and forecast.
       8.4.1.2. Climb and cruise winds, Delta-T, and temperature at altitude for each leg.
       8.4.1.3. Surface winds at each base.
       8.4.1.4. Possible hazards—icing, thunderstorms, etc.
130                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


  8.4.2. Routing. Look at the high or low charts to determine the most suitable route of flight.
  Consider any hazards, no-fly areas, MOAs, standard terminal arrival routes (STAR), and
  preferred routing. Failure to consider these can cause lengthy delays or changes to your
  planned flight route.
  8.4.3. Distance. Make sure your planned leg lengths provide you with enough fuel to
  complete training objectives and land with a buffer above minimum fuel. Planning to arrive
  at your destination with minimum fuel will greatly reduce your options if you experience any
  delays or—worst case—if you need to divert. Headwinds and tailwinds are often significant
  factors. If your plan requires the use of reduced visual separation measures (RVSM) airspace,
  you will need a suitable alternate that does not require access to RVSM airspace (reference
  AFI 11-202, Volume 2). Some techniques for leg-length decision making are as follows:
      8.4.3.1. High altitude, no wind, no drop-in, no pod, one approach to full stop—
      approximately 700 nm max.
      8.4.3.2. High altitude, some wind, no drop-in, pod or clean, one approach—
      approximately 500 nm.
      8.4.3.3. Drop-ins with various approach combinations, pod or clean—approximately 300
      nm.
  8.4.4. Adjustments for the Weapon System Support Pod (WSSP):
      8.4.4.1. Flying with the WSSP will cause higher fuel flows due to increased drag. The
      faster and farther you travel, the greater the fuel effect from a pod.
      8.4.4.2. Based on the flight manual’s high altitude cruise charts and 11,000 to 12,000
      pounds gross weight:
         8.4.4.2.1. The WSSP will increase fuel consumption by about 125 pph per engine at
         FL 250 and 0.75 Mach. Depending on climb, descent, approach, and distance
         requirements, a reasonable technique would be to plan for using an additional 150 to
         200 pounds for these scenarios.
         8.4.4.2.2. The WSSP will increase fuel consumption by about 220 pph per engine at
         FL 350 and 0.9 Mach. Depending on climb, descent, approach, and distance
         requirements, a reasonable technique would be to plan for using an additional 250 to
         300 pounds for these scenarios.
  8.4.5. Cruising Altitude. Select cruising altitudes and airspeeds consistent with mission
  requirements, applicable directives, and safety. RVSM restrict your ability to fly above FL
  280. The optimum cruise- climb altitude chart in the flight manual provides the best altitude
  for initial level-off based on fuel weight. The best altitude for fuel economy will increase as
  gross weight decreases. However, due to the need to fly at higher Mach, the susceptibility of
  the J-85 engines to flameouts and compressor stalls and the inefficiency of the PMP modified
  engines at higher altitudes virtually negate any fuel consumption advantage at higher
  altitudes. At or above FL 280, the min mach (MM) caret will appear on the airspeed indicator
  in the MFD. MM is the minimum speed to cruise for the altitude corresponding to the black
  stripe region for the altitude and temperature conditions.
  8.4.6. AF IMT 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log. Although it can be very useful in many
  ways, the AF IMT 70 is primarily a fuel-planning template. You must do enough fuel
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                 131


   planning to ensure mission safety. Beyond that, filling out an AF IMT 70 is left entirely to
   pilot technique.
   8.4.7. DD Form 175/1801, Military Flight Plan. Air Force pilots are required to file a flight
   plan (FPL) for all flights. After completing the AF IMT 70, fill out the DD Form 175 or
   1801 as appropriate according to FLIP General Planning. On the DD Form 175, designate
   the T-38C TD code as “/G” (slant G) meaning Advanced RNAV with Transponder and Mode
   C with enroute & terminal capability. If filing RNAV-based procedures or routing, use the
   DD Form 1801 and designate the T-38C equipment code as “DGILOPTUV/S” (D (DME), G
   (GNSS), I (Inertial navigation), L (ILS), O (VOR), P (RNAV), T (TACAN), U (UHF), V
   (VHF), S (Mode S)). Use the en route charts when filling in the route of flight portion to
   avoid errors. On UFT student solo navigation missions, add the letter “Z” as a suffix to the
   aircraft callsign (Do not use the “Z” in air or ground communications).
   8.4.8. Destination Review. Note obstacles, airfield layout, barriers, approach lighting, type
   of visual glidepath guidance, field elevation, runway data, important frequencies, for your
   destination and any possible en route or destination divert options.
8.5. Planning a VFR Navigation Mission. Maintaining SA will be different on a VFR mission
because, although you have fewer distractions from ATC, you also receive less information. This
affects the way you plan the mission and the tasks you perform while airborne.
   8.5.1. Weather and Winds. VFR conditions do not necessarily mean the absence of clouds.
   The pilot is responsible for determining that VFR conditions and cloud clearances can be
   maintained for the entire proposed route of flight.
   8.5.2. Map Selection. Choose an operational navigation chart (ONC) or tactical pilotage
   chart (TPC) based on the desired level of detail. As a technique, use an ONC when flying
   above 6,000 feet AGL and a TPC when flying below. A joint operations graphic (JOG) chart
   may be used for detailed route study and preflight planning. World aeronautical charts
   (WAC) and sectional charts are the same scale as ONC and TPC respectively and include
   airspace boundaries and frequencies.
   8.5.3. Map Preparation. There is a wealth of information you may choose to put on your
   VFR map. You may want to highlight emergency airfields, VORTAC stations, tower
   frequencies, etc. Additionally, you need to mark turn points, courses, headings, checkpoints,
   obstacle elevations, etc., for your route. You will need to plan for a specific GS and make
   tick marks for timing. You may run either a continuous clock or individual leg times. Other
   handy information would include Class B, C, and D airspace boundaries and frequencies,
   conflicting airways, air route traffic control center (ARTCC) sector frequencies, and planned
   fuels. Flight planning software specified by your MAJCOM provides excellent tools for
   preparing and printing VFR maps. Once you receive appropriate training in the use of the
   planning software, the time spent preparing your VFR map will be significantly less than if
   you did it manually.
   8.5.4. Routing. You must do enough research on special use airspace, victor airways, and
   Class B, C, and D airspace to avoid them. Don’t forget to consult the temporary flight
   restrictions (TFR) NOTAMs to identify any temporary airspace restrictions along your route
   of flight. Use very prominent features that you could still navigate by despite potential low
   scattered clouds when selecting turn points.
 132                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   8.5.5. Distance. When determining the length of a VFR leg, consider the altitude you plan to
   fly and the winds at altitude. VFR legs between 250 and 350 nm work well, with or without a
   travel pod. This will allow you fuel for several overhead patterns or the option of
   coordinating for practice instrument approaches after your VFR arrival. As a guide, do not
   plan a VFR leg greater than 400 nm.
   8.5.6. AF IMT 70 for VFR Missions. If all pertinent information—including fuel
   requirements—is on your VFR map, an AF IMT 70 is not required for the portion of the VFR
   mission covered by the map. Measure headings and distances directly from the VFR map.
   Compute your GS by using the forecast winds, and use it to determine the total time en route
   and fuel required. As a technique, include all information you’ll need for the VFR arrival
   (frequencies, pattern altitudes, etc.) on your map.
   8.5.7. DD Form 175 for VFR Missions. The Route of Flight block on the DD Form 175
   should include enough information to allow search and rescue operations to trace your
   flightpath. You may use any of the following: names of cities and towns, prominent
   landmarks or bodies of water, VORTAC radial and DME, latitude and longitude, or VFR
   reporting points.
8.6. Preflight Ground Operations:
   8.6.1. Logistics. As many pilots have discovered over the years, being without necessary
   equipment, paperwork, or supplies can seriously degrade your cross-country experience.
   Maintenance should help you launch with tires and aircraft inspections that will last for the
   duration of the cross-country flight. In addition to personal baggage, before launching from
   any home station or out base, consider including the following “don’t leave without it” items:
   (Note: These are not all-inclusive.)
       8.6.1.1. Required low and high en route charts.
       8.6.1.2. Required approach plates and STARs.
       8.6.1.3. Low-level and VFR maps.
       8.6.1.4. Instrument hood.
       8.6.1.5. Aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781-series).
       8.6.1.6. Civilian and military fuel cards.
       8.6.1.7. Fuel receipts.
       8.6.1.8. Intake, exhaust, and HUD covers.
       8.6.1.9. AOA vane lock.
       8.6.1.10. Grounding wire.
       8.6.1.11. Flashlights and clear visors.
       8.6.1.12. Data transfer cartridge and VTR tape(s).
   8.6.2. Transient Alert or FBO Ground Crews. Ensure transient alert FBO personnel are
   familiar with starting and post-start procedures. Become familiar with how to operate the
   manual diverter valve in case you need to explain its operation. Strange Field Procedures of
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  133


   the 1-T-38C-1CL-1 checklist provides T-38C compatible oil, fuel, oxygen, hydraulic, and air
   starting unit information.
   8.6.3. Getting Clearance. Prior to engine start, determine the status of your clearance with
   clearance delivery or ground control. If you anticipate any delay, consider postponing engine
   start until receiving your clearance. Be sure you can comply with any differences between
   your received clearance and your planned route of flight. For VFR flights, local directives
   and good sense may require you to ask for a squawk for flight following.
   8.6.4. Cockpit Organization. Cockpit organization is very important. Arrange your
   publications so you can get to everything without cluttering up the cockpit. Arrange
   publications in the map case in the order you will likely use them. More than for other types
   of missions, you will need a place to write on short notice, so put your cards, AF IMT 70,
   and kneeboard near your writing hand. Do not have any publications loose with the canopy
   open.
8.7. Departure:
   8.7.1. Departing from a Nonmilitary Airfield. When departing from a nonmilitary field and
   not filling a flight plan or activating a flight plan, you must contact the nearest flight
   service station (FSS) or coordinate through tower with your actual departure time so
   you do not arrive unannounced at your destination.
   8.7.2. Departing VFR. After you are cleared for takeoff, squawk “1200” and remain on
   tower frequency until you depart their airspace. If departing an airfield that lies within
   Class B or C airspace, you must contact departure control after takeoff. Until you exit ATC
   airspace, comply with any instructions (headings, altitudes, squawks, etc.) issued by ATC. If
   you depart from a civilian field, you will need to contact the nearest FSS on 255.4 or 122.2
   to activate your FPL. You are responsible for maintaining VFR cloud clearances. Once
   you leave tower frequency, you have two options:
      8.7.2.1. VFR Option Number 1. Contact ATC for flight following. Squawk the assigned
      code (if other than 1200), and fly requested altitudes if weather allows. ATC will provide
      you with traffic advisories as time permits, but you must aggressively clear at all times.
      You will be passed from controller to controller as you proceed along your route.
      8.7.2.2. VFR Option Number 2. You may remain on 255.4 or 122.2 (the FSS frequency)
      for the entire route of flight. If you choose this option, contact subsequent FSSs as your
      sortie progresses. Remember to set the local altimeter at least every 100 nm.
8.8. En Route IFR and VFR:
   8.8.1. Airspeed. When flying at high altitude, maintain an IMN appropriate for the engine
   envelope. The flight manual checklist’s Engine Compressor Stall/Flameout Susceptibility
   chart specifies a minimum IMN for a given altitude and temperature. Anything that induces
   turbulence or interrupts airflow, such as bank, yaw, or abrupt throttle movement, can increase
   susceptibility to flameout or compressor stall.
   8.8.2. Groundspeed (GS) Check. Once stabilized at your planned cruise airspeed, compare
   your actual GS to the planned GS to determine the effect of the actual winds and how they
   might impact fuel planning.
134                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


  8.8.3. Waypoint Checks. As you pass your planned waypoints, compare your actual fuel and
  flight time to those you planned.
  8.8.4. Flight Plan and Route of Flight Adjustments. Unusual ground delays, low altitude
  step-up restrictions, and (or) unforecast headwind velocity could place you in a potentially
  fuel-deficient situation. Apply any significant differences between planned GS and (or)
  fuel remaining to the remaining route of flight and modify your FPL, if necessary. In a
  worst-case situation, you may have to divert to a suitable airfield short of your destination.
  The emergency divert mode of the EGI can be helpful in determining fuel remaining at the
  destination.
  8.8.5. Lead Points:
      8.8.5.1. When flying on published jet routes or airways, remaining within the protected
      airspace requires the use of good lead points during turns to new courses. The most
      mathematically unusual situation occurs when making a significant turn over a VORTAC
      waypoint because the cone of confusion will begin at a rather large slant-range DME.
      The technique (Mach minus 2) will give you the correct lead point in nm, but triangle
      hypotenuse math is required to turn it into a useable, close-to-the-station DME.
      8.8.5.2. The following is an easier technique to calculate no-wind DME lead points for
      30-degree bank turns at normal cruising airspeeds or altitudes: lead point equals 1 nm for
      each 30 degrees of turn plus altitude in nm above the station. For example, approaching a
      VORTAC at FL 360, you would be turning from a 270-degree inbound course to a 330-
      degree outbound course. For this 60-degree turn, you would take 2 nm (1 nm for every 30
      degree of turn) and add 6 (your altitude in nm). Your lead point would be approximately
      8 DME.
      8.8.5.3. When conducting RNAV operations using waypoints in an activated FPL,
      ensure the waypoints are set as flyby points (FBY). FBY points will ensure that the FD
      commands proper lead turns appropriate for en route navigation. FBY can be confirmed
      and selected via UL-4 on the UFCP FPL submenu display or viewed on the MFD FPL
      display page.
  8.8.6. Radio Frequencies. Maintain a record of assigned frequencies in case you are sent to a
  bad frequency and must recontact the last controller.
  8.8.7. Positional Awareness. Because a radio or NAVAID failure can occur at anytime,
  maintain constant positional awareness through the use of NAVAIDs, map reading, and dead
  reckoning (DR).
  8.8.8. Weather and Winds. Check the weather far enough out (80 to 120 nm) so you can be
  thoroughly prepared for your arrival as well as any unexpected changes or diverts. In
  addition to checking destination or drop-in weather, you may want to check the weather at
  your planned alternate. If you have time and (or) are queried by a pilot to metro service
  (PMSV) forecaster, make a pilot report (PIREP). (The format is in the Flight Information
  Handbook [FIH].) To obtain destination, drop-in, or alternate weather and winds en route,
  there are several options:
      8.8.8.1. Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS). This is the easiest and
      quickest option but not always a reliable one. Some ATIS messages are less complete and
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                 135


     less frequently updated than others, especially on weekends. Listen for the time group to
     see how old the information is and make decisions accordingly. Note the letter identifier
     for your check-in with approach control.
     8.8.8.2. PMSV. If the weather is poor, PMSV is usually a better source of updated
     information if it is available. The information provided should be current; you can talk to
     a forecaster if needed; and you can ask real-time questions about trends, actual
     thunderstorm activity, divert options, etc.
     8.8.8.3. Approach or Tower. Consider this option if: (1) you are unable to receive ATIS
     or contact PMSV, or (2) you are arriving at a civilian field with no ATIS. Use discretion
     on what could be a busy frequency. A quick request for the landing runway and current
     observation will give you enough information to make initial decisions.
     8.8.8.4. SOF. At military fields, the SOF on duty can be an excellent option in lieu of
     ATIS or PMSV. In fact, in certain circumstances (timing of exercises, ceremonial events,
     FBYs, etc.), talking to the SOF may be highly preferred.
     8.8.8.5. FSS. Contact an FSS on frequency 255.4 or 122.2, using the callsign “radio” (for
     example: (“Greenwood radio”). FSSs contain reliable, full-service teams, complete with
     PIREP information, when it’s been provided.
     8.8.8.6. Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS). Many civilian fields are
     modernizing their weather service by installing automated weather equipment to provide
     timely and accurate surface weather conditions to pilots, ATCs, other aviation users, and
     the national weather data network. AWOS provides an automated and continuous real-
     time weather reporting system that transmits weather data to both airport personnel and
     aircraft via VHF radio. AWOS collects and transmits data on wind direction and speed,
     altitude, density altitude, temperature, dew point, and relative humidity. It may also
     report cloud heights and thunderstorm activity.
  8.8.9. VFR Altitudes En Route. Fly appropriate VFR altitudes according to FLIP. Assuming
  you have the weather and have cleared carefully, you may change your altitude at any time
  during the flight. You do not need permission to alter your altitude, but you should inform
  the controlling agency of your intentions if you are getting flight following service. In
  formation, all flight members should be at an appropriate VFR altitude.
  8.8.10. Encountering Unexpected Weather While VFR En Route. If you encounter
  unexpected weather, you have the following three options:
     8.8.10.1. Alter Route of Flight and Continue. You may alter your route and (or) altitude
     to avoid unexpected weather, but you must continue to maintain the required VFR cloud
     clearance and visibility requirements. Ensure your fuel allows any deviations from the
     plan. Inform FSS personnel of any major route changes and pass them a PIREP
     describing the unexpected weather.
     8.8.10.2. Return to Base of Origin or Divert. If you have not proceeded far from your
     departure field, turning around and returning there may be the best option. If you are
     significantly down track on the route, proceeding to an alternate airfield may be
     preferred. In either case, maintain VFR conditions and ensure sufficient fuel exists.
 136                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       Inform FSS personnel of route or destination changes; give them a PIREP; and obtain the
       NOTAMs for your new destination.
       8.8.10.3. Pick Up an IFR Clearance. Contact an FSS or controlling agency to file an IFR
       clearance. (ARTCC frequencies can be found on FLIP low altitude en route charts). Until
       your IFR clearance is activated, you must maintain VFR conditions. Picking up an IFR
       clearance while airborne is really quite simple but requires some preparation. You will be
       required to provide the same type information that you would use on a DD Form
       175/1801. Use the sequence on the back cover of the IFR en route supplement to help
       you organize and provide the right information.
8.9. VFR Lost Procedures. First, use every possible resource to regain positional awareness.
Use EGI steering to determine the course to a known point. Use your lat/long present position on
the MFD EGI display page or radial/DME from a known NAVAID to plot your position onto
your VFR map. If the DME is inoperative, attempt to identify your location by cross-tuning
radials from two different NAVAIDs. If, after using every possible resource for positional
awareness you still cannot determine your position, follow this habit pattern:
   8.9.1. Climb—Conserve—Confess:
       8.9.1.1. Climb. For fuel conservation, climb to the highest possible altitude below FL
       180 where you can maintain VFR.
       8.9.1.2. Conserve. Establish the maximum endurance airspeed for your fuel weight (230
       KCAS + total fuel). Another technique is to use the Endurance (ENDR) profile in the
       Emergency Divert Mode and fly the commanded CAS/IMN for your current altitude.
       BNGO in the Emergency Divert Mode display block on the MFD also provides you
       with time to reach your selected Bingo fuel under current conditions when
       operating in the ENDR profile.
       8.9.1.3. Confess:
           8.9.1.3.1. Call for help. Admitting you are lost and getting help is far better than
           delaying until you are low on fuel. Start with appropriate ARTCC and approach
           frequencies (try several if necessary), but do not hesitate to use guard frequency. For
           guard calls, preface the call with “mayday, mayday, mayday,” give your callsign, and
           request help from any agency hearing the transmission.
           8.9.1.3.2. A number of controlling agencies will probably answer your distress call.
           Select one and direct the rest to remain silent. Select Emergency on the identification,
           friend or foe/selective identification feature (IFF/SIF) using the UFCP or set code
           7700 in Mode 3/A. When the Emergency function is selected, the IFF/SIF IDENT
           feature will not be available, so consider entering 7700 into the Mode 3/A instead.
           The controlling agency can give you heading and distance information to the nearest
           suitable airfield, your home field, or your destination.
       8.9.1.4. Check the Compass. Ensure your EHSI is operating properly and compare it to
       the standby magnetic compass.
       8.9.1.5. Without Radio Contact. Attempt to pick out a prominent landmark on the
       ground—a body of water, a town, a large airport, or a railroad crossing are all good
       landmarks. Try to orient your map with the selected landmark. If you cannot locate the
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     137


       landmark on your map, do not wander aimlessly. Fly a definite heading until you can
       identify a good landmark.
8.10. IFR Arrival:
   8.10.1. Descent from High Altitude. Consider preheating the canopies with the canopy defog
   because descents into warmer, humid air may cause the canopies to fog up.
   8.10.2. Clearances. There are at least three clearances requiring careful attention during any
   arrival:
       8.10.2.1. IAF or Beginning En Route Descent. Before arriving at an IAF or holding fix,
       or before beginning an en route descent, know your clearances and any restrictions.
       These often include holding instructions, approach clearance, clearance to use
       maneuvering airspace, expect further clearance times, en route descent instructions, etc.
       This is especially important when on an en route descent in the event of radio failure.
       8.10.2.2. Missed Approach or Climbout. Before the FAF, coordinate climb out, missed
       approach, alternate missed approach, and (or) departure instructions, as appropriate.
       Write them down!
       8.10.2.3. Landing. Passing the FAF, ensure you know your clearances and restrictions;
       for example, proper runway, low approach, land, touch-and-go, option, sidestep, circling,
       restricted low approach, etc.
8.11. VFR Arrival on an IFR Flight Plan. If flying in Class A airspace or in IMC, coordinate
with the en route ARTCC for a descent to VFR conditions below the Class A airspace. Cancel
IFR when able to maintain VFR, and navigate to the airfield using a VFR map and NAVAIDs.
Clear visually and over the radios. Coordinate with ATC to proceed VFR-to-initial or to a visual
straight-in. When practical, remain on ATC frequency for traffic advisories.
8.12. VFR Arrival at an Unfamiliar Field:
   8.12.1. Coordination. Know the classes of airspace affecting your VFR arrival. These may
   be obtained from FLIP AP/1 or the IFR en route supplement. You must abide by these
   airspace rules even when VFR. Approximately 40 nm out, you should check the weather and
   current runway (ATIS, if available). Approximately 30 nm out, contact ATC and request the
   VFR arrival.
   8.12.2. VFR to Initial. You should plan on a 3- to 5-mile initial. To maintain positional
   awareness approaching airports with several offset or crossing runways, keep SA on your
   inbound bearing to the field and your current heading comparing them to an airport diagram.
   Setting the runway heading for the heading set marker or the course window on the MFD is a
   familiar way to visualize the pattern for the correct runway. The IFR en route supplement
   normally indicates the pattern altitude and direction of break, but listen carefully for modified
   instructions and other guidance like wake turbulence, runways, type landing, etc. Clear for
   other aircraft or helicopters, stay aware of wake turbulence separation, and be vigilant for
   degraded aircraft performance at high density altitudes.
   8.12.3. Visual Illusions. Use caution when landing on unfamiliar runways. Start with a
   careful study of the airport diagram and the IFR en route supplement so you know what to
   expect. Plan for how you might adapt to a runway without an overrun or one with a displaced
   threshold. Remember that a wider runway may contribute to a high flare and a long or
 138                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   dropped-in landing, while a narrower runway may lead to an incomplete flare and early
   landing. Usually a wider runway will have side stripe markings approximately 150 to 200
   feet wide to help with depth perception. Use all available references to determine your height
   above the runway. As a technique, transition your eyes to the departure end of the runway
   during the flare to help gauge your height above the runway.
8.13. Off-Station, Postflight Ground Operations:
   8.13.1. Canopy Management and FOD. With so many items potentially cluttering the
   cockpit during a cross-country mission, you may want to leave the canopies closed until
   engine shutdown. In any case, double-check to ensure all loose items are accounted for and
   secure before opening the canopies.
   8.13.2. Taxiing on a Strange Field. Although you can request progressive taxi from the
   ground or tower controller, you can maintain higher SA by referencing the airport diagram
   and signs posted along your taxi route. With a little prior study, you can often anticipate your
   taxi route and parking area. Many civilian and military transient operations use a “follow-
   me” vehicle as well. If desired to expedite your next leg, accomplishing a stored heading
   alignment once in parking and prior to engine shutdown can reduce your alignment time to
   1.5 minutes or less.
   8.13.3. Closing Flight Plans. Normally, there is no need to close an IFR FPL with the FSS.
   The tower should do this for you at a military or civilian field. However, because some
   civilian fields are not as reliable as others in always closing your IFR FPL, it is usually wise
   to verify with the FSS or tower that it has been closed. Remember, IAW AFI 11-202,
   Volume 3, you are responsible for closing a VFR FPL with FSS.
   8.13.4. After Engine Shutdown. Refer to the checklist and other appropriate items in your
   inflight guide. Conduct a thorough postflight inspection of the aircraft, and ensure transient
   alert personnel are familiar with the T-38’s servicing requirements. Also, ensure they
   properly secure, pin, and ground the aircraft. Ensure you are familiar with alternate fuel
   procedures, if applicable. Complete all required paperwork. When possible, give transient
   alert a phone number where you can be reached, even if it is the billeting number. You are
   ultimately responsible for your aircraft until it returns to the home station.
   8.13.5. Stopovers. As a technique, the following acronym—WANTS—will help you
   remember what to accomplish at a stopover location:
       8.13.5.1. Weather, winds, temperatures, bird status.
       8.13.5.2. Activate flight plan or Alternates and emergency fields.
       8.13.5.3. NOTAMs.
       8.13.5.4. TOLD.
       8.13.5.5. SID or departure instructions. Call the SUP, SOF, or command post.

                                           Chapter 9

                                LOW-LEVEL NAVIGATION

Section 9A—Purpose

9.1. Introduction. The purpose of low-level navigation is to fly a preplanned ground
track to a designated target so as to arrive at a designated time over target (TOT). Flying high-
performance jet aircraft on low-level missions puts you close to the ground at high speed. Your
close proximity to the ground increases the risk. In addition to the ground, other threats include
aircraft, birds, and obstacles. Therefore, your margin for error and your time to react are
significantly reduced. The intent of low-level training in the T-38 is to provide the basic
foundation from which to build as you transition into the Combat Air Force (CAF). Each low-
level will be broken down into mission planning, briefing, and flying phases.

Section 9B—Mission Planning

9.2. Overview. The first step in preparing for the mission is becoming completely familiar with
the route requirements and any associated restrictions. Consider referencing a sectional chart to
determine national airspace restrictions. Applicable publications include FLIP General Planning
(GP), AP/1B Manuals, the Chart Update Manual (CHUM), and command and local guidance.
Low-level routes and corridors can be loaded in the DTC during mission planning for use in
flight if desired and IAW training requirements.
9.3. Military Training Route (MTR) Selection:
   9.3.1. In the United States, military low-level training is conducted in designated airspace as
   outlined in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publication 7610.4, Special Military
   Operations. Use FLIP AP/1B as the primary reference for MTR selection. The slow routes
   (SR) are not used by T-38s due to airspeed restrictions.
   9.3.2. When selecting a route, identify your departure and recovery bases and find a route
   nearby. In many cases, the instrument routes (IR) and visual routes (VR) described in FLIP
   AP/1B are too long to successfully fly from the primary entry to the primary exit. Therefore,
   alternate entry or exit (or both) may have to be used. Route selection should be made so
   navigation to the desired entry, flying the route, and recovery to the desired destination can
   be completed within the T-38’s fuel limitations.
   9.3.3. For initial fuel planning, approximately 45 pounds per minute at 360 knots GS (6 nm
   per minute) works while on the low-level. (For example, in 40 minutes, 240 nm of low-level
   will use approximately 1,800 pounds of fuel.) The longer the planned low-level, the less fuel
   remaining for navigation to and from the route, and therefore, the closer the route needs to be
   to the planned departure or recovery base. Additionally, ensure the en route and on-route
   weather will allow you to fly the selected low-level. Refer to AP/1B for the VR route
   weather minimums and AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3, for the IR route weather minimums.
9.4. Map Preparation. On low-level missions, each pilot must carry a current map of the
route. Refer to map preparation requirements in AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3, and any command or
local supplements.
 140                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   9.4.1. Map Selection. For sufficient detail and quality of terrain features, a published TPC
   (1:500,000 scale) or a chart generated from flight planning software should be used. With
   greater detail, JOGs can be excellent for low-level missions. However, they can be
   cumbersome because of their size. For low- level routes flown with TPCs, you may want to
   carry JOG sections of the turn points and the target areas. You may also find JOGs especially
   useful for detailed route study during preflight planning.
   9.4.2. MTR Corridor:
       9.4.2.1. Draw the MTR corridor from the planned entry point to the planned exit point,
       using the latitude-longitude of the published waypoints and designated route corridor
       lateral displacements. Additionally, make annotations for the vertical limits of the route
       segments. Update the chart with the latest information from the CHUM (hard copy or
       electronic) to include all the area within the route corridor and any significant
       obstacles outside the route corridor that could be a hazard to the flight. This step is
       imperative for flight safety and may be completed using approved flight planning
       software.
       9.4.2.2. Study the route enough to gain an initial feel for all obstacles and terrain features
       at or above planned flight altitude. Highlight any obstacles or high-terrain features that
       may be a factor along your route of flight using appropriate thin-line “bubbles.” One
       technique is to use 2- to 3-mile bubbles to mark decision making points for those
       obstacles not acquired visually.
       9.4.2.3. Lastly, use the appropriate sectional chart to determine all crossing MTRs. Note:
       Sectional charts do not show SR.
   9.4.3. Emergency Route Abort Planning. Compute the emergency route abort altitude
   (ERAA) IAW AFMAN 11-217. Route abort frequencies can be obtained from the “postage
   stamps” on FLIP low charts. Highlight the map with emergency or alternate airfield locations
   and information such as VORTAC channels and tower and approach frequencies.
9.5. Route Development. As a minimum, you will need a route entry point, a high-confidence
“hack” point for your clock or timer, recognizable turn points, a clearly discernible initial point
(IP), and an appropriate target. The best features for turn points are usually natural because these
features change very little over time. You may also use manmade features such as bridges, road
intersections, and towers. Choose points for their uniqueness, vertical development, funneling
features, and surrounding terrain. Avoid using features that may be hidden by high terrain or
trees.
   9.5.1. Route Entry and Hack Point. Note that your route entry point must be within the route
   corridor and should correspond with a published entry point (or alternate). An EGI steerpoint
   is an excellent confirmation of the entry point; however, a VORTAC radial and DME also
   works well. The hack point can either be the FLIP-designated route entry point or down track
   following an acceleration corridor or route entry corridor. Choose an easily discernible hack
   point because the first key to good DR is to start from a known point. Do not plan a hack
   point that requires an immediate turn to remain on course. The hack point is a high-task
   portion of the sortie. Therefore, minimize maneuvering to ensure a safe and effective route
   entry.
   9.5.2. Turn Points:
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   141


     9.5.2.1. Draw thin-line circles around turn points to prevent obscuring the surrounding
     details. When choosing turn points, consider the turn radius of the T-38 at your planned
     GS and the type of turn you will be using. Avoid choosing points so close to the corridor
     edge that your planned turn radius will not allow you to stay within the corridor. Use a
     tactical plotter or planning software to plot the turn radius based on starting turns right
     over the turn points.
     9.5.2.2. There are two common choices for low-level turns. One choice is a hard (4 G)
     turn, similar to the kind used in tactical formation. Use approximately 1 nm for a turn
     radius for these hard turns. A second choice is a 55- to 60-degree bank, 2 G turn. This
     turn matches the 55-degree bank turn radius circle on most tactical plotters.
     9.5.2.3. If planning a route using flight planning software, ensure the programmed
     profile reflects the method you will use to fly the route; otherwise, timing errors will be
     induced on the low-level. For example, if the flight plan reflects 45-degree bank turns and
     you use 4 G hard turns, you will find yourself ahead of time on each leg, and anticipated
     headings will be off by a factor related to the length of the next leg.
  9.5.3. IP and Target. Choose an IP located about 1 to 3 minutes prior to the target. An IP
  should be an easily identifiable point used to fine-tune navigation and increase the
  probability of target acquisition. Choosing an easily identifiable IP in an advantageous
  position relative to your target is a good technique since you may not be able to choose your
  target in follow-on real-world scenarios. Minimize the heading change (up to 30 degrees) at
  the IP in order to increase the accuracy of the IP-to-target leg. If using a running time, you
  will normally continue the running time at the IP to the target. If your running time to the
  target is off, re-hacking at the IP may help you identify the target.
  9.5.4. Course Lines, Timing Marks and Mileage Ticks. When drawing course lines between
  the turn points, use thin lines and be sure to account for the turn radius corresponding to your
  planned GS and bank angle. Select a GS that easily converts to miles-per-minute, but still
  allows room for required airspeed corrections. A GS of 360 knots works well at relatively
  low MSL altitudes to allow an easy conversion to 6 miles per minute. It also permits enough
  airspeed correction capability to maintain above a minimum of 300 KCAS and below a
  maximum of 420 KCAS (450 KCAS for IFF). Place timing tic marks along one side of the
  route to represent the timing intervals counting up from the hack point. A 1- or 2-minute
  interval is sufficient. Account for the fact that the IP-to-target run may be planned at a
  different airspeed. Mileage tics placed along the other side of the route can greatly enhance
  SA if EGI is used. Using 10 nm intervals for each route leg working back from each turn
  point is a common technique.
  9.5.5. Headings and Drift Corrections. Plot the no-wind headings for each segment of your
  route and ensure proper application of the magnetic variation. Low-level winds are generally
  light, not exceeding 15 to 20 knots. However, they can be quite significant under certain
  weather conditions, such as wind shears, frontal passage, or thunderstorms. Wind direction
  and speed is available on the MFD on the wind direction and speed display below the right
  side of the EADI. The arrow indicates the magnetic wind direction. The drift angle and
  airspeed will change on each leg of the route, depending on the aircraft’s heading in relation
  to the relative wind. You must apply drift correction to maintain course, and you must also
  adjust airspeed to keep GS constant. Compute and post wind-
 142                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   correction factor) for each leg of your route. If your planned GS is 6 miles per minute, a
   simple technique is to apply l degree of drift correction for every 6 knots of crosswind.
   9.5.6. Calibrated Airspeed. Use the forecast temperature, pressure altitude, and low-level
   winds to compute wind-corrected calibrated airspeeds for each leg at the planned GS. To
   keep GS constant, KCAS should be decreased for a tailwind and increased for a headwind.
   To simplify airspeed computations, assume there is a one-to-one relationship for increases
   and decreases in airspeed between calibrated airspeed and GS.
   9.5.7. Course Arrow Blocks. The course arrow block is a symbol used to efficiently present
   the information needed to help you fly the low-level. The course arrow block should include
   the information pertinent to navigation along the applicable leg of the route which, as a
   minimum, would include heading, airspeed, and leg time. This emphasizes the core
   requirements for good DR of time, distance, and heading. Additional information can be
   added per individual desires, but too much information could become distracting and divert
   your attention inside the cockpit when it needs to be outside.
   9.5.8. Fuel Planning. Compute a planned fuel at designated points along the route. Refer to
   the flight manual charts for the required fuel flow. As a technique, a fuel flow of 1,350
   pph/engine will normally maintain 350 KCAS. Additionally, compute a continuation fuel
   for the designated points along the route. Continuation fuel is the minimum required to
   complete the route at planned speeds and altitudes and RTB with the minimum required fuel
   reserves. Finally, compute and annotate the bingo fuel for RTB by the most practical
   means from the most distant point on the route. Consider factors such as cloud ceilings,
   winds, freezing level, MOAs, VFR hemispheric altitudes, forecast icing, and minimum
   required fuel reserves.
   9.5.9. Restrictions. Highlight and plan to remain clear of any noise-sensitive areas or
   airfields specifically listed in FLIP AP/1B or local directives.
9.6. Routing To and From the Low-Level Route. Good route study includes more than the
low-level route between the entry point and exit point. Pilots must have a solid understanding of
how to get to and return from the MTR. According to FLIP AP/1B, flight to and from IR or VR
routes should normally be conducted on an IFR FPL. You should normally include the planned
route of flight to and from the MTR on your map to include headings, airspeeds, and times.
Ensure your planning includes both no- earlier-than and no-later-than takeoff times, which will
allow you to enter your low-level on time and also permit completion with the amount of fuel on
board.
9.7. Scheduling. Schedule the low-level route for your desired entry time with the scheduling
activity as designated in FLIP AP/1B. In instances where there is no published entry timing
tolerance window or standard command or local guidance, coordinate an acceptable entry
window with the scheduling activity. This becomes important in helping deconflict the route
especially with multiple users of dissimilar aircraft. It becomes most important on VR routes
where ATC is not responsible for the separation of aircraft. Note: On routes with which you are
not familiar or do not routinely fly, it may be beneficial to accomplish this scheduling step early
in the planning process to verify there is no unpublished or short-term restriction which would
prevent you from flying the route.

9.8. Filing. File for your low-level sortie on a DD Form175, following the procedures outlined
in FLIP GP. Annotate your low-level entry and exit times in the Remarks section of the DD
Form 175. If flying a local low-level route, the operations personnel at the duty desk typically
file your requested local stereo FPL, like for other local mission profiles.
9.9. Map Study:
   9.9.1. A detailed study of your map is essential after planning the route. You must prepare so
   as to minimize your heads-down time during the low-level. Noting the general shape of the
   land and its most significant features is a good starting point. A JOG (1:250,000 scale) may
   initially help you interpret data on the TPC (1:500,000 scale).
   9.9.2. Try to visualize the key points along the route and general features around them.
   Funneling features, such as converging ridgelines, rivers, and roads, are especially helpful in
   locating selected turn points. Use large, prominent features to funnel your eyes to the smaller
   features leading to your points. (Navigate from large to small.) To make course
   measurements significantly more obvious on the route, note the distance you expect to be left
   or right of features, such as towers, bridges, dams, river bends, etc.
   9.9.3. For mid-leg reference points, it is also critical to note the expected time along the
   route that point becomes significant. This chronological understanding of key navigation
   points will help reinforce clock-to-map-to-ground pilotage and minimize unnecessary
   deviations from basic DR. It is also a good technique to memorize the sequence of events,
   features, and actions required during the IP-to-target run. Thorough map study will
   significantly aid in a smooth, efficient brief of the sortie. Much of your map study will be
   accomplished by preparing your map and drawing your route. This step becomes
   especially important if you are planning to fly a low-level with a map you did not prepare.

Section 9C—Briefing.

9.10. Overview. The overall effectiveness of the sortie can be dramatically affected by how
thoroughly and completely the sortie is briefed. Reference the Avian Hazard Advisory System
(AHAS) Web site (http://www.usahas.com/) prior to the brief and address any significant bird
threats.
9.11. Route Briefing:
   9.11.1. A commonly accepted technique is to structure your brief so the last thing you cover
   is the low- level routing itself. This will emphasize the important points and keep them fresh
   in everyone’s mind.
   9.11.2. The briefing should include how you plan to identify and enter the route. As you
   progress down the route, highlight the critical action points—where you expect to see good
   track or timing correction points, when to climb or laterally avoid unseen towers or airfields,
   how high to climb and remain in the route structure, where potential aircraft threats or
   crossing routes are expected, your specific exit procedures, and what altitude, heading, and
   frequency you can use in IMC.
   9.11.3. Emphasizing specific action points along the route will set the groundwork for good
   DR (clock- to-map-to-ground). A thorough understanding of what to look for (and when) will
 144                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   also help minimize the airborne tendency to spend too much time map-reading or trying to
   make what you see on the ground fit what you see on the map.
9.12. Emergency or Contingency Briefing. Emergency or contingency options pose their own
unique challenges in the low-level environment. Diverting your attention into the cockpit for too
long may have catastrophic consequences. In all abnormal situations on the low-level, your first
reaction should be climb-to-cope. You can cover emergency or contingency by leg as you brief
or you can cover it as a separate topic from the route brief. Remember, not all emergencies can
be covered, but the more thoroughly you brief initial actions, how high (top of the block or
ERAA), which way (left or right), which recovery field (primary or emergency), who to talk to,
what frequency, the more likely you are to successfully recover the aircraft during a contingency
situation. Many aircraft systems are available to assist in building SA in an emergency. Consider
briefing incorporation of all EGI and HSD capabilities, even if the capabilities will not be used
for the training portion of the sortie.

Section 9D—Flying the Route

9.13. Departure and Route Entry:
   9.13.1. Before departing for the jet, referencing AHAS one more time may provide real-time
   radar tracking of bird activity.
   9.13.2. During ground operations, if using an activated FPL for the low-level route, you
   should ensure:
       9.13.2.1. Automatic (AUT) waypoint switching is selected on the UFCP NAV submenu
       display via Window 3L/UL-3. Automatic waypoint switching continues even when EGI
       is not the PNS.
       9.13.2.2. The TOT calculation method is set to either TOT or TTT, as appropriate. This
       is set in the FPL sub-menu at UR-2. Selecting the incorrect clock could result in
       confusing or erroneous data presentation throughout the sortie.
       9.13.2.3. Each FPL low-level waypoint is set as a flyover (OVR) point. For OVR
       waypoints, switching occurs when the aircraft passes within 2 nm of the waypoint, and
       the EGI bearing pointer swings through the 3 or 9 o’clock position relative to the nose of
       the aircraft. The waypoint types are available on the MFD FPL display page by selecting
       the desired FPL. If necessary, change the waypoint type via Window 4L/UL-4 on the
       UFCP FPL submenu display. Designating en route FPL waypoints as FBY waypoints
       could make departure and return navigation easier.
       9.13.2.4. TOTs are programmed. The FPL waypoints with an associated TOT are
       designated in the FPL. Waypoint TOTs are visible on the MFD FPL display page by
       selecting the desired FPL, or may be set on the UFCP FPL key display.
       9.13.2.5. The flight plan waypoints are loaded correctly in the MDP. This can prevent
       loss of situational awareness once airborne due to a system malfunction, error made
       during mission planning, or mistakes in other avionics setup. The flight plan waypoints
       can be quickly verified by:
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    145


          9.13.2.5.1. Displaying the flight plan track lines on the HSD. This may require you to
          increase the scale on the HSD to see the entire flight plan. Verify the flight plan route
          (white line) displays correctly within the displayed route corridor, if available.
          9.13.2.5.2. Performing a swing check. During mission planning, determine a bearing
          and range to each point along the route from a predefined position, typically the EOR.
          Flight planning software usually has a function that can do this automatically. Manual
          calculation can be done using your low-level map; however, it may not be as
          accurate. Once in the aircraft, activate the FPL. Then, when near the position from
          which the bearing and range were calculated, cycle through each route waypoint as
          your EGI steerpoint to check the EGI bearing and range against what you calculated
          during mission planning.
   9.13.3. Maintain positional awareness en route to the entry point, using all available visual
   references and NAVAIDs, to include EGI. If you are unable to make your originally
   scheduled entry time, coordinate for a new time or fly an alternate mission.
   9.13.4. Make an entry call with the appropriate controlling agency or FSS, and perform a
   FENCE check into the low-level. Once inside the route structure, accelerate to the planned
   airspeed. Identify the entry or hack point as early as possible, and maneuver the aircraft to
   overfly the entry point on the correct heading and at the correct airspeed.
   9.13.5. Being at the correct airspeed and heading is more important than immediately
   descending to your planned route altitude. Start your clock as you pass over the hack point.
   The aircraft clock can be used via the UFCP; however, you should back it up with an
   additional hack, either on a watch or the EED clock. Positive identification of your hack
   point is of utmost importance.
9.14. Route Basics.
   9.14.1. Priorities. Avoiding the terrain and anything attached to it is the most critical task
   during low- level flying. Your first priority will never change—keep your aircraft under
   positive control and at an appropriate altitude. Keep your primary attention out of the
   cockpit, and do not become fixated on the map, HUD, MFD presentation, or anything else
   inside the cockpit. Ensure the HUD brightness is at a low enough setting that it doesn’t
   prevent you from effectively clearing for hazards along your flightpath (e.g., birds, other
   aircraft, changing terrain, and towers). Comply with command-prescribed minimum
   altitudes, but do not exceed any crewmember’s comfort level in an attempt to fly at that
   altitude. An unfamiliar route, poor visibility, mountainous terrain, or other factors may
   require a higher altitude to maintain a reasonable level of comfort.
   9.14.2. Map-Reading and Pilotage:
      9.14.2.1. Map-reading is the determination of aircraft position by matching symbols on a
      map with corresponding terrain features or manmade objects on the ground. Aircraft
      position should be determined and navigational errors detected or corrected by using a
      clock-to-map-to-ground cross- check. Thorough route preparation, study, and briefing
      will have already determined the best “clock” points to make track or time verifications
      and adjustments. While flying the route, you must first stay aware of the time elapsed,
      remembering to consider any timing error from the last leg and how it might affect your
 146                                                      AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       current position. Then reference the map for where that should put you (interpolating
       between tic marks, as necessary) and match the map with what you see outside.
       9.14.2.2. When using the full system capabilities of the T-38C, including EGI and HSD,
       pilots must be extremely vigilant not to become complacent. Avionics systems can
       provide information to enhance your SA, but failing to integrate the information available
       with basic low-level flying skills can be catastrophic.
       9.14.2.3. Basic pilotage requires pilots to maintain SA above and beyond the aircraft
       systems’ capabilities. The aircraft systems can reduce the workload immensely; however,
       system errors, data input errors, and poor systems knowledge can negate any benefit
       gained from the added technology. Unchecked erroneous data may lead you out of
       the route structure or into unforeseen obstacles. Positional awareness is the only way
       to ensure terrain and obstacle clearance is maintained.
   9.14.3. Flying the Plan. Flying well-planned, accurate headings and airspeeds on each leg
   will get you close to your selected points. Trust your plan and rely on good DR. Arriving
   over checkpoints at anticipated times confirms the accuracy of DR and indicates reliability of
   preplanned headings, winds, and GSs. If a prominent landmark is not available as a reference
   at a turn point, rely on DR and turn-on time. Conditions such as a cloud cover or extensive
   areas of featureless land or water may make map- reading extremely difficult. By learning
   to apply the basic principles of DR (time, distance, and heading), you will minimize the
   loss of SA.
9.15. Altitude:
   9.15.1. Judging Altitude. Assessing your height above the ground can be done using
   several techniques. Obviously, the most accurate method is to use the radar altimeter
   (RALT). You should cross-check the altimeter, against known elevations of towers, lakes,
   airfields, or peaks, and use those “snapshots” outside to calibrate your eyes and refine your
   ability to judge height visually. Set the RALT warning to activate at or above 90 percent of
   your planned low-level altitude (for example, 500 feet AGL = 450 feet RALT setting).
   9.15.2. Terrain and the Horizon. Altitude awareness and the ability to maintain a desired
   altitude are relatively easy over terrain where large ground objects are present. However,
   most pilots have a tendency to descend lower than desired over flat, even terrain. This is
   especially true if there are few significant manmade or natural objects to reference for
   altitude, such as in high desert plateau country. Very flat terrain, snow, or calm water is
   exceedingly and insidiously dangerous due to the lack of reliable depth perception. Flat, up-
   sloping terrain is even more dangerous because of the insidious change in elevation as you
   fly into the gentle upslope. Flying across sloping terrain may provide a false horizon that can
   slowly draw you off course as you dip a wing to maintain level flight.
   9.15.3. Terrain and Ridge Crossings. Flying low-level in an environment with rapidly
   changing terrain is demanding and requires constant positional awareness and SA. Realize
   that terrain can easily hide checkpoints or turn points. Fly upwind of ridges when possible
   and be alert for areas of turbulence on the downwind side of large terrain features. When
   planning to cross steep peaks or ridges, consider calculating a start-climb point. Begin the
   climb early enough to arrive at your minimum AGL altitude prior to the terrain feature or
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   147


   obstacle. To maintain your desired terrain clearance when crossing ridges, either bunt or roll,
   but do not exceed the limits established in AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 3.
   9.15.4. Obstacle Avoidance. If lead is unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral
   separation from known vertical obstructions that are a factor to the route of flight, he or
   she will direct a climb no later than 3 nm prior to the obstacle to ensure vertical separation
   by 2 nm from the obstacle. If you visually acquire the vertical obstruction, avoid it
   vertically by 500 feet or laterally by 0.5 nm.
9.16. Heading Control. Make every attempt to cross your chosen route start point—usually the
hack point—on the precomputed, wind-corrected heading. While on the route, “fly the plan.” If
using pure DR, consider using the heading set function of the EGI to help maintain the proper
heading. When using EGI steering, selecting the flight director or placing the flightpath marker
directly over the steerpoint symbol in the HUD will provide wind-corrected heading information.
When it is clear that a heading correction is required, consider the following techniques:
   9.16.1. Drift Analysis in Flight. In flight, use pilotage to compare your plan against what is
   actually happening. If the forecast winds were accurate, little or no change should be required
   to maintain the proper ground track. However, if the winds are inaccurate, adjustments will
   be required. Look for cues (for example, blowing smoke or an unexpected crab to maintain a
   known ground track) to verify actual wind direction and adjust accordingly.
   9.16.2. Heading Errors. Heading errors can be caused by extracting the wrong heading from
   the map during preflight planning, applying the magnetic variation incorrectly, or not
   maintaining the appropriate preplanned magnetic heading in flight. Flying your planned
   heading is essential. At 360 GS, a 10-degree heading error will take you 2 miles off your
   course in just 2 minutes.
   9.16.3. Visual Track Correction. The simplest and most reassuring way to make a low-level
   track correction is to positively identify a ground reference and visually reposition your
   aircraft in proper relation to it. As soon as you determine you are off course, immediately
   attempt to position yourself back on or near track and assume the correct heading again. Be
   aware that this technique can add to your leg time. With EGI steering available, you can
   generally point at the next turn point and concern yourself primarily with timing corrections.
   9.16.4. Heading Correction. If you have passed the reference point used to determine your
   position and you know the distance displaced from the correct ground track, you can correct
   your error by using the 60-to-1 rule to correct ground track. At 360 knots GS, a 10-degree
   heading correction held for 1 minute will correct you back toward course 1 mile.
   9.16.5. Take Advantage of Unmistakable References. Continue to adjust ground track and
   airspeed until aircraft position and elapsed time position coincide (especially at
   predetermined, unmistakable points). When you identify a landmark that shows you are off
   track, make small corrections immediately to avoid having to make large heading changes
   later as you get closer to the landmark.
9.17. Timing:
   9.17.1. General:
       9.17.1.1. The TOT can be based off a TTT hack or a real TOD TOT. If you are using a
       real-time TOT, back your times up to takeoff so you know the latest possible takeoff time
 148                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       to meet your TOT without modifying preplanned flight parameters. If planning to use
       aircraft-generated speed cues, ensure the correct format option (TOT or TTT) is set in the
       FPL sub-menu at UR-2. Allow for the possibilities of being delayed or getting to the start
       point early. An early arrival may necessitate holding at the entry point, if allowed.
       9.17.1.2. When using a TTT running time hack, the system clock provides several
       unique options. Leg times can be used since the WIT function key on the UFCP will
       immediately zero out the clock and restart it. This can be accomplished quickly and
       easily at each turn point or at the IP.
   9.17.2. Timing and Airspeed Errors:
       9.17.2.1. Low-level route timing is dependent upon flying a precise GS for a precise
       amount of time. Inaccurately planned airspeed (not corrected for temperature, pressure
       altitude, or wind) or poor throttle control will almost certainly result in timing errors.
       Timing errors are further complicated by poor airspeed control when climbing,
       descending, and turning. For example, if your airspeed and (or) bank angles during turns
       are not as planned, the turn radius (and thus the timing) will be different. Additionally,
       timing errors are further complicated by incorrect map-reading and (or) the use of poorly
       defined landmarks for timing references.
       9.17.2.2. If EGI steering is available and a TOT is set, the commanded airspeed will
       correct for timing errors. There are, however, no limits to the commanded airspeed, and
       the system could potentially place the aircraft outside the flight envelope and direct you
       to exceed airspeed training rules. As you get close to the target, the TOT calculations
       may become less reliable. Disregard large commanded airspeed changes as you approach
       the steerpoint with the TOT and be careful not to exceed command-directed minimum or
       maximum airspeeds.
   9.17.3. Timing Corrections. There are two basic methods of correcting elapsed time errors
   on a low- level mission—changing the airspeed and changing the route of flight. The
   following subparagraphs indicate several methods of airspeed correction:
       9.17.3.1. Airspeed Correction—10-Percent Method. This method is based on the
       approximation that a 10 percent increase or decrease of GS, held for 10 minutes, will gain
       or lose 1 minute. However, it is not necessary to wait until a 1-minute error exists
       because the time error (in fractions of a minute) is directly proportional to the duration of
       the speed change. The calculations for the 10-percent method are as follows:
10 percent of GS = GS factor.
GS ± GS factor = corrected GS.
Maintain corrected GS for [number of seconds early or late x 10] seconds.
       9.17.3.2. Airspeed Correction—Incremental Method. In the incremental method of time
       control, airspeed in miles per minute is used to determine the speed change. To obtain nm
       per minute, divide your planned GS by a factor of 60. At 360 knots GS, you are traveling
       at 6 nm per minute; at 420 KCAS, you are traveling at 7 nm per minute. To determine the
       speed change increment, multiply the nm per minute by a factor of 10 (for example: 6 nm
       per minute x 10 = 60 knots). Maintain corrected GS (GS ± the speed change increment)
       for 1 minute for every 10 seconds early or late.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   149


      9.17.3.3. Airspeed Correction—Proportional Method. This method is simple and closely
      resembles the incremental method. For each second early or late, increase or decrease
      airspeed by 1 knot for the number of minutes equal to the GS in NMS per minute. For
      example, if you are on a 360 knots GS route (6 nm per minute) and 10 seconds early,
      decrease airspeed by 10 knots and hold that correction for 6 minutes.
      9.17.3.4. Airspeed Correction—Next-Leg Method. This method of timing correction is
      simple and particularly useful to single-seat pilots. Airspeed (in nm per minute) is used to
      determine the speed change increment (in GS). First, determine the number of seconds
      early or late. Divide this by the time (in minutes) for the next leg of the low-level route.
      Multiply the dividend by the nm per minute. The result is the GS correction. Add or
      subtract the GS correction to the original cruise airspeed. Fly the corrected GS for the
      entire next leg. For example, if you are on a 360 knot GS route and 20 seconds late at the
      IP, the IP to target is 2 minutes and 40 seconds. Increase airspeed by 45 knots and hold
      the correction for the entire IP-to-target leg.
      9.17.3.5. Airspeed Correction—Leg Correction Method:
         9.17.3.5.1. Derived from the proportional and next-leg methods, the leg correction
         method uses a time or distance increment and the next-leg time or distance (either one
         works) to establish a correction factor for each leg. The time/distance increment is
         that time or distance at which the proportional method would result in a one-to-one
         relationship between speed change and seconds early or late. (For example, at 360
         knots planned GS, the time or distance increment is 6 min/36 nm. This is because
         using the proportional method when you are 10 seconds early or late would result in a
         10-knot correction held for 6 min/36 nm. At 420 knots planned GS, the time/distance
         increment is 7 min/49 nm).
         9.17.3.5.2. When planning to use this technique, it is best to calculate the correction
         factor during the planning stage and annotate it on the low-level map. To calculate the
         correction factor, take the time/distance increment and divide it by the next-leg
         time/distance. For example, dividing the time/distance increment (6 min/36 nm) by
         the next-leg time/distance (4 min/24 nm), 6 min/4 min or 36 nm/24 nm yields a leg
         correction factor of 1.5. Write that correction factor on the low-level map next to that
         leg. When airborne, determine your timing deviation in seconds and multiply it times
         your leg correction factor. Apply that correction for the entire next leg. For example,
         10 seconds late times the correction factor of 1.5 yields a correction of 15 knots, so
         fly 15 knots faster for the entire leg. Another technique, increase/decrease ground
         airspeed 30 knots per one minute for every 5 seconds in timing correction.
      9.17.3.6. Airspeed Correction—Ground Track Method. This method is viable only when
      prominent ground features are used as turn points. If you are within 10 seconds early or
      late, plan to make the next turn point prior to or just after the desired turn point.
      Remember to add an additional ground track correction to return to the planned routing
      and consider the time required for route correction. This technique is heavily based on
      TLAR (That Looks About Right), but can be used effectively to adjust timing and
      minimize task saturation. Another technique, a 20 degree check for 30 seconds for every
      mile off course.
9.18. Turn Point Techniques:
 150                                                            AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


    9.18.1. Approaching the Turn Point. Accomplish administrative tasks early to avoid multiple
    cockpit tasks when performing high bank turns at low altitude. Determine the direction of
    turn and the desired new heading. Many pilots like to put the heading marker on the next
    heading. If you approach the turn point from a different ground track than the one on the
    map, realize that your preplanned turn to the next leg must be altered to put you back on
    track. Check outside references to visualize the approximate amount of turn required.
    9.18.2. At the Turn Point. Cross-check time at (or abeam, if not directly overflying) the turn
    point to confirm overall elapsed time or the real-world time. Make necessary adjustments
    after rolling out of the turn. If rehacking at each turn point for DR, rehack just prior to
    starting the turn.
    9.18.3. Making the Turn:
           9.18.3.1. Low altitude turns make up 5 percent of low-level flying but account for 52
           percent of all low- level accidents. Turn to the next leg when directly over the turn point,
           using the bank angle and G loading your planned ground track and timing are based on. If
           you do not visually acquire the turn point, turn on time. Note: Use caution when making
           turns at low altitude because sink rates can quickly develop if you overbank, and there
           will be little time or altitude with which to recover.
           9.18.3.2. In the turn, 100 percent of your attention should be focused on making the turn
           until you have rolled out, wings level. Make the turn, maximizing outside references.
           Place the HUD FPM on the horizon, roll and pull to maintain a level turn. In rising
           terrain, a level turn using the FPM or CDM may not provide sufficient ground clearance.
           If you detect a descent, immediately rollout of the turn and climb back to a minimum of
           the altitude you had at the beginning of the turn. If you detect a climb, control the bank to
           arrest the climb, but do not attempt to descend back to 500 feet during the turn. If you
           have misjudged the turn, make corrections after rolling wings level and referencing the
           HSI and HSD.
           9.18.3.3. It is critical that you clear throughout the maneuver. Clearing for where the
           aircraft is going will require you to cross-check the FPM not focus on it. While in a turn,
           clear from the top of the canopy to the pitot tube, until you approach the outside reference
           point for rolling out on course.

    level flight at higher bank angles and your time to impact from 500 feet AGL at various
    overbank or G conditions at any airspeed.

     9.18.6. After the Turn. After completing the turn, ensure NAVAIDs are set with the new
     heading, fuels are checked, and EGI steerpoint has updated to the next segment.
9.19. Approaching the IP or Target Area. Strive to fly over the IP as close as possible to your
planned time. Make any small corrections to timing early to prevent large airspeed corrections
later. Depart the IP on planned heading and airspeed. Deviate only as necessary to react to threats
(birds, aircraft, obstacles, etc.). Everything that takes place in the target area is critical. In fact,
you should have most of the IP-to-target run memorized so that you are not heads-down in
the cockpit trying to pick up references from the map.
9.20. Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) and Air-to-Air (A/A)/ Air-to-Ground (A/G)
Master Modes. The T-38C provides avionics capabilities that are used in follow-on training and
are similar to follow-on weapon systems. Use of these capabilities during UFT missions for pilot
familiarization with HUD and MFD symbology, task management training, and as a HOTAS
exercise will help build sound habit patterns for follow-on training. In UFT, the purpose of
introducing these capabilities is not to understand weapons employment or how to achieve
weapons release parameters. The following is a description of how the T-38C can be used in the
UFT environment during low-level training once the student pilot understands the basic
principles of flying low-level and demonstrates the ability to safely operate the T-38C in the low-
level environment.
     9.20.1. Pre-Mission Planning. Units will have a standard DTC load that will provide pilots
     with mission parameters in the mission planning software for the MFD weapon (WPN)
     display page that will be suitable for familiarizing pilots with A/G MFD and HUD weapons
     symbology during low-level missions. The following is an example of parameters that will
     accomplish this objective: RELEASE ALT: 0; RELEASE VELOCITY: 360; DIVE ANGLE:
     0; CONFIGURATION: CLEAN; PROG: A; WPN: BDU-33; BREAK-X: 100; RIPPLE:
     0FT. Pilots will confirm these settings on the MFD WPN display page during the “DTC
     Data – LOAD/VERIFY” step of the “BEFORE TAXIING” checklist.
     9.20.2. HOTAS Low-Level Exercises. While flying the low-level, pilots can use the T-38C
     HOTAS features (e.g., master mode switch [MMS], default display switch [DDS], weapon
     mode switch) to change HUD and MFD symbology as part of a task management exercise.
            9.20.2.1. Route Entry to IP. Fly the low-level route in the NAV master mode.
 152                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


       9.20.2.2. IP-to-Target. In follow-on training, the IP-to-target run will be the point where
       tasking will shift to air-to-ground (A/G) weapons delivery. At the IP, it is optional to
       switch to the A/G CCIP master mode using the MMS and overfly the target level straight
       through to familiarize yourself with the A/G HUD weapons symbology.
       9.20.2.3. Target Egress. Return to the NAV master mode for the remainder of the low-
       level route.
9.21. Route Exit:
   9.21.1. Give the return route leg the same emphasis as the entry leg. If your target is not at
   (or near) your route exit point, you may need to preplan an off-target point to start route
   egress.
   9.21.2. Once you are clear of the MTR, you are no longer in the low-level structure and are,
   therefore, limited to 300 KCAS below 10,000 feet MSL. Consequently, a route exit almost
   always calls for an immediate climb, during which you can trade airspeed for altitude.
   FENCE out of the low-level.
   9.21.3. Whether you are returning IFR or VFR, you will need to coordinate arrival with
   ATC. When exiting a VR, maintain VFR conditions until you have an IFR clearance.
   Continue on your IFR clearance when exiting an IR.
9.22. Abnormal Procedures:
   9.22.1. Single-Ship, Low-Level Problems and Emergencies. Every low-level emergency,
   including encountering IMC, requires a climb to a safe AGL altitude. Climb-to-cope is a
   common phrase to describe your initial action when faced with a problem at low altitude.
   You must put the aircraft into a position where you can safely analyze the situation and
   coordinate your recovery with outside agencies.
   9.22.2. Unable to Make Radio Contact. If you cannot contact a controlling agency while
   airborne, follow the local lost-communications procedures, specific route lost-
   communications procedures (listed in FLIP AP/1B), or general lost-communications
   procedures in the FLIP Flight Information Handbook. If you have maintained positional
   awareness and are able, proceed to your home base or the nearest suitable airfield, as
   appropriate, while handling the problem.
   9.22.3. IMC Route Abort:
       9.22.3.1. When it becomes obvious you cannot continue the route without going IMC,
       abort the route. Pilots must exercise extreme caution in marginal weather conditions and
       avoid the false sense of security the EGI provides. If possible, turn as necessary to remain
       VFR. If you cannot avoid IMC while flying a low-level route, immediately abort the
       route and climb on course to the RAA as a minimum. Make an expeditious climb, using
       MIL power and a maximum of 300 KCAS. High terrain may require the use of
       afterburner in some instances. In all cases, immediately establish a climb on course. Do
       not, under any circumstances, attempt to reenter the low-level route after initiating an
       abort. Route aborts are potentially disorienting and require an immediate transition to
       instruments and close attention to aircraft control and flight parameters.
       9.22.3.2. Once you are level at or above the RAA, squawk “emergency” as appropriate
       and coordinate for an IFR clearance to your destination airfield. Because the RAA only
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      153


       provides obstacle clearance within 5 nm of the route, the recovery to your destination
       may require a higher altitude to ensure obstruction clearance.
   9.22.4. Lost Procedures. If you miss consecutive checkpoints or turn points, do not
   recognize any references from your map, or are unable to reorient yourself (using the EGI if
   needed), abort the route and follow the VFR lost procedures in Chapter 8.

Section 9E—Low-Level Formations

9.23. Two-Ship, Low-Level Navigation. A successful two-ship, low-level mission is the
culmination of all your navigation and formation training to this point, requiring a combination
of solid low-level practices, formation skills, and discipline.
9.24. Preflight Planning. Preflight planning for a two-ship, low-level mission is usually more
involved than either a single-ship, low-level mission or a standard two-ship formation
mission. The major addition in the planning process is you are effectively drawing two parallel
blackline routes one mile apart. This may require altering the choice of turn points to ensure the
formation stays in the corridor, avoids obstacles, and can adjust for significant terrain changes. It
is possible to use a preexisting low- level planned for a single-ship mission. However, extra time
should be spent during the route study and briefing phases to ensure all formation members are
aware of where the wingman should fly to comply with the considerations above.
9.25. Types of Low-Level Formations:
   9.25.1. Tactical LAB. When flying over relatively level terrain, LAB formation can work
   well. The same parameters described in Chapter 6 should be used, but the wingman should
   stack level to slightly high on lead. Low-level flying introduces some additional visual cues
   and takes some time to visually calibrate the proper distance.
   9.25.2. Wedge. When substantial maneuvering is required or while you are over terrain with
   vertical development, wedge formation may be a better choice than LAB tactical. It gives the
   wingman the flexibility to alter sides as necessary and may lessen lead’s saturation in
   ensuring the wingman is on the proper side. The parameters described in Chapter 6 should be
   used, but the wingman should stack level to slightly high on lead.
   9.25.3. Fighting Wing. When a clearing formation is needed or aggressive maneuvering is
   required, fighting wing may be flown. The parameters described in Chapter 6 should be used,
   but the wingman should stack level to slightly high on lead.
9.26. Departure. In addition to managing normal formation responsibilities, you must navigate
to the start point and accomplish all other low-level entry requirements for the particular MTR.
To enhance clearing and increase the formation’s maneuverability, spread the wingman to route,
fighting wing, or a tactical formation as soon as possible after takeoff. Unless weather or other
procedures dictate, maintain a clearing formation to the route entry.
9.27. Route Entry. If not already accomplished, lead will put the wingman in fighting wing,
wedge, or another formation suitable for visual lookout and maneuverability prior to route entry.
In a relatively short span of time, lead must call “entering the route,” locate the entry point,
maneuver the formation as necessary for course alignment, call the time hack over the radio, and
accelerate to the planned airspeed. Prior planning and solid SA are imperative for a smooth entry
into the low-level structure.
 154                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


9.28. Low-Level “Contract” and Priorities as Lead:
   9.28.1. Do Not Hit the Ground or Anything Attached to It. As much as possible, lead should
   position the wingman on the side opposite high terrain features or known obstacles. Climb
   the formation in sufficient time to avoid all obstacles within 2 nm of your planned ground
   track unless you are able to visually acquire and ensure lateral separation from obstacles
   along the flightpath of the entire formation. Call out any obstacles (towers, etc.) that could be
   a factor to the formation. Direct the wingman to climb if flying lower than he or she should.
   9.28.2. Maintain Vigorous Visual Lookout. Find, call out, and avoid any traffic or birds that
   could be a factor to the formation. Avoid conflicts and potential midair collision situations
   with the wingman. TCAS may help to focus the visual lookout and provide additional SA on
   traffic outside the formation.
   9.28.3. Communications and Brevity Code. Use standard brevity code in referring to objects
   or positions on the ground. Unless lead briefs otherwise, formations use the following plan to
   communicate whether or not obstacles are in sight. The flight member sighting the obstacle
   transmits his or her call sign and the clock position of the obstacle relative to their own nose
   position (for example, "Mach 2, tower, 1 o’clock 4 miles"). The other flight member
   acknowledges (for example, "Mach 1, contact" or "Mach 1, negative contact"). For traffic
   acquired on the TCAS but not visually, transmit the position on the TCAS display (for
   example, "Mach 2, TCAS hit, left 11 o’clock, 5 miles, 300 feet above, descending") The
   other flight member acknowledges (for example, "Mach 1, same” or "Mach 1, no joy").
   9.28.4. Navigate and Lead. Use single-ship, low-level route and timing corrections to fly the
   route, identify all turn points, and be in a position to arrive at the target on time. In addition
   to single-ship techniques, you will probably need to incorporate formation check turns,
   tactical turns, and shackles. Climb the formation for all avoidance areas either you or your
   wingman will penetrate. Accomplish all turns as briefed, and, unless called otherwise, rollout
   of each turn on the heading for the next leg.
   9.28.5. Maintain SA on the Wingman. Stay visual, direct formation adjustments as
   necessary, and stay aware of the wingman’s fuel state. Initiate ops checks at appropriate
   intervals (every 10 minutes or every other leg, as a minimum).d
9.29. Low-Level “Contract” and Priorities for the Wingman:
   9.29.1. Do Not Hit the Ground or Anything Attached to It. Climb in sufficient time to avoid
   all obstacles within 2 nm of your ground track unless you are able to visually acquire and
   ensure lateral separation from them. Call out any obstacles (towers, etc.) that could be a
   factor to the formation.
   9.29.2. Maintain Vigorous Visual Lookout. Find, call out, and avoid any traffic or birds that
   could be a factor to the formation. Avoid conflicts and potential midair collision situations
   with lead and of course, stay visual—don’t go blind!
   9.29.3. Fly the Prebriefed or Directed Formation Position. Always strive for the briefed
   formation position unless turn requirements or safety dictate otherwise. In tactical LAB or
   wedge formations, stack level to slightly high. At 500 feet AGL, lead will be on the horizon
   to very slightly above the horizon when you are stacked level at 6,000 feet laterally.
   Whenever a flightpath conflict with lead exists, cross high in relation to lead.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    155


   9.29.4. Maintain SA on Navigation, Route, and Timing. Strive to maintain sufficient
   positional awareness so you know when to expect key events such as turns, climbs, and
   position changes. Unless called otherwise, rollout of each turn on the planned heading for the
   next leg. Strive to maintain enough SA to confidently assume the lead if necessary.
9.30. Low-Level Turns as Lead:
   9.30.1. Wingman on the Inside of the Turn. Begin your contract turn over the planned turn
   point to keep your aircraft on the planned ground track. Unless briefed otherwise, the
   wingman should climb to deconflict, if necessary.
   9.30.2. Wingman on the Outside of the Turn. From tactical LAB, start the wingman turning
   early enough to allow you to delay your turn until right over the planned turn point. A turn of
   90 degrees will require a lead point of 1 nm, a turn of 45 degrees will require a lead point of
   ½ to ¾ nm, and a turn of more than 90 degrees will require a lead point of more than 1 nm.
   For a 90- or 45-degree turn, use the same references described in Chapter 6 for tactical turns.
   For a turn of greater than 90 degrees, turn sooner than the 90-degree turn reference.
   9.30.3. Turns of 30 Degrees or Less. Normally, you can simply turn to the new heading; a
   delayed turn is not necessary. For a planned check turn into the wingman, brief him or her to
   drop back closer to the 30-degree line before the turn. Depending on the formation at the
   time, it will always be your option to direct an unplanned check or tactical turn.
   9.30.4. Misjudging a Tactical Turn. If you misjudge the timing of a tactical turn at a turn
   point, the corrective action depends on several factors (threat, positional awareness, width of
   corridor, fuel remaining). It may be more important to maintain good formation (threat, fuel,
   good positional awareness) or, it may be more important to fly the route (poor positional
   awareness, narrow corridor). If maintaining formation parameters is most important and the
   lateral limits of the low-level corridor permits, lead may time the turn to complete it with the
   formation in the desired position, and then reintercept the planned routing further down the
   route. If, however, corridor width will not permit, or if this would excessively degrade your
   navigational SA, lead should turn over the planned point and have the wingman regain
   formation position as soon as possible.
9.31. Low-Level Turns as the Wingman. Turns during low-level tactical maneuvering will
rarely be exactly 90 or 45 degrees. You must anticipate turns and remain aware of the new
heading at each turn point. Once lead is established on the next leg of the route, expeditiously
correct back to the briefed or directed formation position if out of position.
   9.31.1. Wingman on the Inside of the Turn. Delay your turn until lead has turned an
   appropriate number of degrees to allow you to complete the turn in the proper tactical
   position. For a turn of 90 or 45 degrees, use the same references as a turn in the MOA. For a
   turn of greater than 90 degrees, turn sooner than the 90-degree turn reference. If you
   misjudge your turn, vary your power and (or) G loading to compensate and regain proper
   tactical position. Unless briefed otherwise, climb to deconflict if necessary.
   9.31.2. Wingman on the Outside of the Turn. Anticipate the turn and the call or signal from
   lead. Have the rollout heading in mind, execute a contract turn, and climb to deconflict if
   necessary.
 156                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


9.32. Low-Level Position Changes. Accomplish position change by following the guidance in
Chapter 6.
9.33. IP-to-Target Run. Lead will designate what specific target point each formation member
will overfly in the target area and the formation position to fly. Lead should brief the wingman
when and how to begin maneuvers to attain the planned formation position for target overflight.
This maneuver can occur at a given distance from the target, over a specific ground reference, or
upon lead’s direction. If both aircraft overfly the same target point, ground tracks will be
designed to ensure timing deconfliction. Maneuvers can include a check away from lead
followed by a turn toward the target at a given range, or the wingman can deploy to wedge prior
to turning in toward the target. The wingman must remain visual with lead at all times. All
formation members will overfly their designated target point level-straight-through.
9.34. Target Egress. The flight lead should plan and brief a method for achieving a designated
tactical formation (preferably LAB) off the target. An example would be a preplanned turn by
the wingman to the egress heading, and a lead ground track to that heading that brings the
wingman forward to LAB.
9.35. Lost-Sight Situations:
   9.35.1. When Wingman Loses Sight. During low-level tactical turns, you may momentarily
   lose sight of lead. This is acceptable as long as you regain sight of lead at an appropriate
   time. However, if you do not regain sight at an appropriate time or if you unexpectedly lose
   sight at any other time, transmit your callsign along with “blind.” Maintain your current
   heading and climb to 1,000 feet AGL or as briefed to help ensure deconfliction and terrain
   clearance while you search for lead. If you regain sight of lead, call “visual” and continue the
   mission. However, if you are unable to regain sight of lead after the climb, continue to ensure
   terrain clearance and follow lead’s instructions.
   9.35.2. Lead Actions When Wingman Loses Sight:
       9.35.2.1. If the wingman calls “blind” and you have the wingman in sight, start a climb
       to 1,000 feet AGL, and transmit your callsign, the word “visual,” and your relative
       position. If the wingman visually acquires you in the climb, you may descend back to 500
       feet AGL.
       9.35.2.2. If the wingman is still unable to visually acquire you, direct him or her to
       maintain or pick up an appropriate altitude and heading. Consider a moderate, controlled
       wing rock, but guard against excessive maneuvering that could lead to disorientation. If
       necessary, rejoin on the wingman while talking their eyes onto you. Once the wingman
       has you visually, direct him or her to an appropriate formation position and continue the
       route if conditions and corridor boundaries allow.
   9.35.3. A “Double-Blind” Situation—Wingman and Lead Both Lose Sight:
       9.35.3.1. If the wingman calls “blind” and you, as lead, do not have him or her in sight,
       maintain your current heading, and direct the wingman to maintain the same heading.
       Begin a climb to 1,000 feet AGL, and direct the wingman to climb to 1,500 feet AGL.
       9.35.3.2. If both aircraft regain sight of each other in the climb, lead may descend back
       to 500 feet AGL and continue the mission. If lead visually acquires the wingman in the
       climb, both will follow the procedures in paragraph 9.35.2.1. If neither aircraft regains
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  157


      sight, both will continue to the next turn point, using landmarks along the route to try to
      find each other. When arriving at the next turn point, if still not visually acquired, lead
      will be directive. Do not continue the route as a formation.
      9.35.3.3. You must be aware of fuel remaining, aircraft scheduled after you on the low-
      level, and how much time can be spent attempting to get back together. Relay your
      position to the wingman, using a timing reference or landmark along the route.
      9.35.3.4. Normally, lead and the wingman will both abort the low-level route. Once they
      climb out of route, they do not reenter the MTR. If still unable to regain sight of
      each other with altitude deconfliction during the abort, accomplish single-ship
      recoveries. During single-ship recoveries, ensure altitude separation from the wingman
      until confirming radar contact with a controlling agency.
      9.35.3.5. Techniques to help regain sight include: using TCAS, comparing distance to
      next EGI turn point, differential airspeeds to create closure, ground references, position
      off bullseye, using air-to-air TACAN, holding at the next time point, etc.
9.36. Radio Failure:
   9.36.1. Lead Loses Radio. Accomplish all radio failure cockpit and equipment checks. If
   radio failure is confirmed or strongly suspected, climb to a minimum of 1,000 feet AGL and
   rejoin the wingman. Once rejoined, give the appropriate AFI 11-205 visual signals, and
   follow the briefed no radio (NORDO) procedures.
   9.36.2. Wingman Loses Radio. Accomplish all radio failure cockpit and equipment checks.
   If radio failure is confirmed or strongly suspected, climb to a minimum of 1,000 feet AGL
   and rock your wings to get lead’s attention. However, do not sacrifice aircraft control in an
   attempt to gain lead’s attention and do not close to within 500 feet of lead until given the
   proper signal. If, as lead, you notice the wingman flying at 1,000 feet AGL or higher and
   rocking his or her wings, climb to at least 1,000 feet AGL and have the wingman rejoin.
   Once rejoined, give the appropriate AFI 11-205 visual signals for the situation.
9.37. IMC Route Abort:
   9.37.1. Lead Actions:
      9.37.1.1. When possible, avoid IMC by climbing or turning. Use an in-place turn if
      necessary. If IMC penetration is imminent, attempt to rejoin the wingman while
      maintaining VMC. If unable to maintain VMC until the wingman is rejoined, ensure the
      flight initiates a wings-level climb to RAA minimum with the required altitude
      separation. This will allow the wingman to stay above you. RAA deconfliction should be
      briefed.
      9.37.1.2. Ensure the wingman is paralleling your heading and squawk “emergency” on
      the IFF/SIF as soon as practical. To lessen the chances of a midair collision with the
      wingman, do not turn while in IMC.
      9.37.1.3. If unable to reach VMC above the RAA, ensure altitude separation with the
      wingman and attempt to contact a radar facility. If you are unable to contact a radar
      facility, climb to a higher altitude while still ensuring altitude separation with the
      wingman. Continue to climb, and squawk “emergency” until reaching VMC or
      contacting a radar facility.

  9.37.2. Wingman Actions. When directed, rejoin as expeditiously as possible without
  becoming a hazard to the formation. If you are unable to rejoin prior to entering IMC, make a
  slight turn away from lead until ensuring altitude separation. Then parallel lead's heading and
  follow lead's instructions. Wingman should squawk as briefed as soon as task
  management allows so TCAS can confirm separation.

                                       NIGHT FLYING

10.1. Ground Operations:
   10.1.1. Mission Briefing. In addition to the normal briefing items, night flying requires
   discussing, in detail, the lighting (cockpit, aircraft, airfield, and environment), taxi spacing
   and distance, radio procedures, alternate or emergency airfields, and a host of other items
   that, during day operations, are simply considered standard. Accomplishing something as
   simple as filling out a lineup card in black ink will ease your task requirements for night
   flight.
   10.1.2. Preflight Power. If external power is available, pilots will use it to thoroughly check
   all aircraft lighting (interior and exterior) including the map light. Ensure the marshaller
   has two illuminated wands.
   10.1.3. Interior Inspection and After Start:
      10.1.3.1. During the interior inspection:
          10.1.3.1.1. Dim the marker beacon, takeoff trim, and AOA indexer lights.
          10.1.3.1.2. Rotate the three lighting rheostats on the right console (instrument, flood,
          and console lights) out of the OFF position.
          10.1.3.1.3. Set the EED OFF/NIGHT/DAY (OND) power knob to night, and adjust
          the EED brightness via the brightness (B) rocker switch.
          10.1.3.1.4. Position the instrument panel map lights and the utility light as desired.
          Consider selecting the red lens on the utility light and your flashlight.
      10.1.3.2. With external power:
          10.1.3.2.1. Adjust the lighting on the instrument, flood, and console lights to the
          lowest practical setting.
          10.1.3.2.2. Dim the warning, caution, and advisory lights to avoid excessive cockpit
          reflection or glare.
          10.1.3.2.3. On the UFCP, place the NT/AUT/DAY toggle switch to NT for the HUD
          night brightness range.
          10.1.3.2.4. Adjust the display brightness of the UFCP using the UFCP U BRT rocker
          switch on the UFCP. Note: UFCP key illumination is controlled by the instrument
          light rheostat.
          10.1.3.2.5. Adjust the display brightness of the HUD using the HUD H BRT rocker
          switch on the UFCP.
          10.1.3.2.6. Set the MFD OND power knob to night, and adjust the MFD display
          brightness via the BRT rocker switch.
      10.1.3.3. Without external power, check all interior lights mentioned in paragraphs
      10.3.1.2.1 through 10.3.1.2.5 after starting engines.
 160                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


   10.1.4. Before Taxi. If adequate airfield lighting exists, delay turning on the landing light
   until you are out of the chocks to avoid blinding the crew chiefs. Because the rotating
   beacon may hinder maintenance personnel while they are under the aircraft, consider turning
   it off.
   10.1.5. Taxi. Taxi on centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing from preceding
   aircraft. Taxi speeds should be slower because speed and distance estimation are difficult
   during night operations. Solo students should accomplish all checklist items while stopped.
10.2. Single-Ship Takeoff. Line up on the runway centerline, and recheck the EADI and EHSI.
After run-up checks and brake release, use the composite method of aircraft control you learned
during day contact flying. Remain oriented to the instrument references as well as outside objects
to minimize the chance of spatial disorientation. Certain weather conditions or a lack of visual
cues may necessitate a complete transition to flight instruments immediately after takeoff. The
rate of transition to instruments should correspond with the rate at which outside references fade.
Ensure the aircraft is safely airborne before raising the landing gear handle, and be aware that the
retracting landing light can give a false sensation of increasing pitch.
10.3. Use of Night Visual References:
   10.3.1. Visual references and depth perception change with night operations. To overcome
   the decrease in visual cues, use instruments to a greater extent. Throughout the sortie,
   continue to adjust cockpit lighting to maximize your night vision, decrease glare, and
   minimize reflections.
   10.3.2. At night, lighted objects often appear closer than they actually are. Because altitude
   and rate of descent are more difficult to judge close to the ground, rely more on the altimeter
   and IVV than on visual perception. Cross-check the EADI to determine the proper aircraft
   attitude when no definite horizon exists.
   10.3.3. Although there is an increased emphasis on flight instruments at night, visual
   references are still the primary means of orientation during night VMC operations. However,
   if you detect an unusual attitude or feel the effects of spatial disorientation, immediately
   make a transition to flight instruments and recover.
10.4. Depth Perception. Use caution when descending for the initial traffic entry at night
because height above the ground is difficult to judge. Check the altimeter closely during night
operations to ensure a proper interpretation.
10.5. Night Optical Illusions. Use caution when flying approaches, especially to a strange
field. Sloping or featureless terrain, sloping runways, varying runway widths, runway lighting
intensity, and (or) weather phenomena can cause visual illusions at night. One of the best
defenses against illusions at a strange field is thorough preparation. Study the airfield and
approach diagrams, and become thoroughly familiar with its lighting and glidepath guidance
systems.
10.6. Visual and Instrument Straight-In Approaches. Whether practicing visual or
instrument straight-in approaches at night, approach control normally provides positive radar
control for pattern spacing and sequencing to final. Do not rely entirely on visual cues. Use
composite flight references, to include glidepath, course, and lighting system guidance.
10.7. Overhead Patterns:
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                     161


   10.7.1. Clearing. The night pattern can get very busy so it is critical to clear visually, on the
   radios, and on TCAS. It is difficult to tell whether an aircraft is turning crosswind or pulling
   closed. Listening carefully to the radio call will help you know aircraft position and intention.
   If in doubt, turn crosswind, carry straight through initial, or break out, as applicable.
   10.7.2. Pattern Entry and Break. Clear and complete the entry and turn onto initial or radar
   initial the same as during daylight operations. Because you may not see the runway clearly,
   initiate the break by referring to the ramp or other lighted areas on the field. Initiating the
   break with traffic abeam you on closed downwind will ensure 6,000 feet of runway
   separation. Continue to use a composite cross-check during the break to maintain aircraft
   control.
   10.7.3. Final Turn and Final. Fly the turn to final and final approach using a composite
   cross-check, because some visual cues will be hard to see (for example, an horizon). A
   good technique is to emphasize being on airspeed at desired altitudes for the perch, halfway
   through the final turn, and especially rolling out on final.
   10.7.4. Transition to Landing and Landing. The references for night landings are the same as
   daytime references. The main difference between night landings and day landings is the lack
   of peripheral cues to help judge glideslope angle and height above the runway. Long, fast
   landings at night are especially dangerous as many of the daytime runway’s cues may not be
   available. As you approach the overrun, the landing light will illuminate the surface of the
   overrun and runway, helping with depth perception. Do not use the runway lights as the only
   reference to judge height above the runway because they can lead to a high flare and a
   dropped-in landing. Plan to land on the runway centerline.
10.8. Night Formation:
   10.8.1. Mission Briefing. In addition to normal briefing items, emphasize visual signals,
   radio procedures, crew coordination, spatial disorientation, and lost wingman procedures.
   10.8.2. Takeoff:
      10.8.2.1. Lead. In addition to winds, etc., consider the location of ramp lights when
      positioning a wingman for a night takeoff. As you take the runway, dim the position
      lights and turn off the rotating beacon. Normally, unless specified in unit standards,
      replace the daylight visual signals with radio calls for engine run-up, brake release, and
      gear retraction. When lighting conditions permit, you may brief visual signals.
      10.8.2.2. Wingman. Position lights should remain bright and rotating beacon on.
   10.8.3. In Flight:
      10.8.3.1. Lead. Based on weather, natural lighting, visible horizon, and available ground
      references, use the same wingman considerations during night formation maneuvering as
      during day IMC maneuvering. Depending on proficiency, slower roll rates may be
      preferred.
      10.8.3.2. Wingman. To maintain the normal fingertip position at night, cross-check
      references more often than during the day. Do not stare at any one light on lead’s aircraft
      because this may result in a loss of depth perception. When you are in fingertip position,
      your rotating beacon will reflect off lead’s aircraft and help your depth perception. If you
      fall low, you will lose that effect.
162                                                       AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


      10.8.3.3. Route. Because of reduced visual cues, flying route at two- to three-ship widths
      and forward of the wing line will maximize the illumination effect of the rotating beacon.
      During turns into the wingman, number 2’s beacon will illuminate lead. During turns
      away, this effect is lost. Under certain conditions (little moon illumination, poor horizon,
      haze), consider reforming number 2 into fingertip before a turn away.
      10.8.3.4. Crossunder. Crossunders may be initiated with a visual signal or radio call.
      Make all control inputs smooth and deliberate. Crossunders should take a little longer at
      night due to reduced visual cues.
      10.8.3.5. Formation Approach. Normally, lead will call gear extension and retraction
      over the radio. If the wingman’s landing light becomes a distraction, lead should direct
      him or her to turn it off. A radio call or zipper may be used to initiate a go-around from
      the low approach.
      10.8.3.6. Position Change. Night position changes will be made over the radio. The
      aircraft assuming the lead should dim the position lights and turn off the beacon. The
      aircraft assuming the number 2 position should do the opposite.
      10.8.3.7. Night Overhead Traffic Pattern Split-up.As soon as practical after the split-up,
      lead will turn on the rotating beacon and return the position lights to the bright setting.
      Normally, the wingman should delay the break for about 8 seconds to build 6,000 feet of
      spacing behind lead.

Terms
3/9 Line—An imaginary line extending through the 3- and 9-o’clock positions of an aircraft
(also known as the pitch or lateral axis).
Abort—Directive to cease the action, attack, event, or mission.
Acceleration maneuver—A maneuver flown to increase airspeed. Zero G is optimum.
Admin lead—Used to pass lead responsibilities to another member of the flight. The
administrative (admin) lead is expected to run all aspects of the profile to include navigating,
managing the radios, and making changes to the profile if external conditions dictate (for
example, changing the bingo fuel with a change in the alternate). With an admin lead change, the
callsigns within the flight are administratively renumbered to match the position being flown.
Lead still retains ultimate authority for the formation.
Angle—off—The angle formed by the extension of the longitudinal axes of two aircraft; the
difference in headings. Also called the heading crossing angle (HCA).
Aspect angle—The angle measured from the tail or longitudinal axis of one aircraft to another
aircraft’s position. For example, 0 degrees aspect angle is directly behind and 180 degrees aspect
angle is directly in front. The aspect angle is independent of the other aircraft’s heading.
Bingo—A prebriefed fuel state needed for recovery using prebriefed parameters.
Blind—No visual contact with friendly aircraft; the opposite of “visual.”
Break (Up, Down, Right, or Left)—To perform an immediate maximum performance turn in
the indicated direction. Assumes a defensive situation.
Cleared—Requested action is authorized.
Closure—Overtake created by airspeed advantage and (or) angles. The rate at which range
decreases (also known as VC: closure velocity “V-sub-C”). Closure can be positive (getting
closer) or negative (getting farther away).
Cross turn—A 180-degree heading reversal by a flight where aircraft turn into each other.
Divert—Proceed to alternate mission or base.
Element lead—The pilot responsible for the conduct of a two-ship element. In a two-ship
formation, the element lead is the flight lead (see definition). Number 3 is the element lead in a
four-ship formation. (Normally, one wingman should not fly formation off of another wingman.)
Extension or acceleration maneuver—An unloaded maneuver, almost always at a high-power
setting, to gain airspeed and either generate closure (decrease distance) or increase
opening velocity (separation).
FENCE—The boundary separating hostile and friendly areas. Entering or exiting designated
area.
FENCE check—Set cockpit switches as appropriate.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                      169


Flight lead—Although perhaps not the most experienced pilot in the flight, the flight lead
(referred to as “lead”) is charged with the safe and successful completion of the mission.
Wingmen may lead portions of the mission, but the designated flight lead does not change.
High six—A position physically above and behind an aircraft regardless of heading or bank
angle.
Joker—Fuel state above bingo at which separation, bug out, or event termination should begin
and proceed with the remainder of the mission.
Knock—it-off—Training term used to stop maneuvers in progress for safety of flight issues.
Lag pursuit—Maneuvering to control closure, range, and (or) aspect angle by positioning the
lift vector (or flightpath) toward the outside of another aircraft’s turn circle. Lag pursuit usually
decreases aspect angle.
Lag reposition—An out-of-plane maneuver performed to control overtake, decrease aspect
angle, and (or) prevent an overshoot by using vertical turning room above and behind another
aircraft’s plane of motion.
Lead pursuit—Maneuvering to control closure, range, and (or) aspect angle by positioning the
lift vector (or flightpath) toward the inside of another aircraft’s turn circle. Lead pursuit usually
increases or maintains aspect angle.
Lead reposition—An out-of-plane maneuver generally performed to increase overtake and
aspect angle and (or) decrease range by using vertical turning room below another aircraft’s
plane of motion.
Lift vector—An imaginary plane going vertically through the top of the aircraft, representing the
plane of motion in a straight pull. “Set the lift vector” means to roll the aircraft to set the point
you want to pull to at your 12 o’clock high.
Line abreast—Two groups, contacts, formations, or aircraft side by side.
Line of sight (LOS)—A direct line between two aircraft.
LOS rate—Speed of apparent drift of one aircraft in relation to another, speed of angular change
of LOS.
Nav lead—May be used when lead wants the wingman to navigate and clear. Lead will fly the
wingman position, deconflict within the flight, and keep the radios; for example, battle damage
(BD) check.
Ops check—Periodic check of aircraft systems performed by the aircrew (including fuel) for
safety of flight.
Overshoot (flightpath)—Results in one aircraft crossing through or behind the flightpath of the
other aircraft, but not necessarily in front of the other aircraft’s 3/9 line.
Overshoot (3/9 line)—Results in the aft aircraft flushing forward of the other aircraft’s 3/9 line.
Perch—A position behind and to the side of an aircraft used to define a starting point for follow-
on maneuvering.
Plane of motion—A plane extending from the flightpath of an aircraft to the center of its turn
radius.

Pure pursuit—An aircraft with its nose pointing at another aircraft is in “pure pursuit.”
Push—Change frequency without acknowledgment.
Quarter plane—A last-ditch maneuver used to prevent a 3/9 overshoot or to “preserve 3/9 line”
at closer ranges and higher LOS rates.
Radial G—The vector sum of the aircraft's lift vector and gravity when turning in a vertical
POM; that is, the G effectively turning the aircraft.
Squawk—Operate IFF as indicated or IFF is operating as indicated.
Tactical lead—May be used when lead needs the wingman to lead an event (for example,
extended trail) or a segment of the flight. In this case, the wingman will pick up tactical,
navigation, and radio responsibilities but not the overall flight lead responsibility. Individual
callsigns do not change.

Terminate—Training term used to stop maneuvers in progress for nonsafety of flight issues.
Turn circle—The flightpath described by an aircraft in a turn.
Turn radius—The distance between an aircraft’s flightpath and the center of the turn circle.
Turn rate—Degrees per second an aircraft turns.
Turning room—Volume of airspace in the vertical, horizontal, or both, which can be used to
execute a desired maneuver.
Visual—Sighting of a friendly aircraft or ground position; the opposite of “blind.”
Zipper—A double-click of the microphone button used to attract the attention of another pilot in
the formation without compromising mission information (for example, callsigns or flight

                                STADIAMETRIC RANGING

A2.1. Stadiametric Ranging. Stadiametric ranging (“mil sizing”) is a crude method for
estimating target ranges. It uses the relationship between angles and the arcs they subtend over a
given distance to help determine the distance to a target. A radian is the angular measurement in
a circle where the arc length (radian) is equal to the radius length. One milliradian (mil) is an
angular measure. Further explanation on calculations follows:
   A2.1.1. One radian = 57.3 degrees (approximately)
   A2.1.2. One mil = radian ÷ 1,000 = 0.057 degrees
   A2.1.3. One degree = 17.45 mils
   A2.1.4. One mil = arc length ÷ range
   A2.1.5. Range can be any unit: foot, meter, etc.
   A2.1.6. Example: 1 mil = 3 feet at 3,000 feet or 3 meters at 3,000 meters
A2.2. Range and Mils:
   A2.2.1. Range and mils have the following relationship:
       A2.2.1.1. Range = Wingspan / mils X 1,000
       A2.2.1.2. Mils = Wingspan / Range X 1,000
   A2.2.2. Since the size of the T-38 is known, mil sizing can be used to determine range from
   the other aircraft or predict aircraft size at a given range. Table A2.1 shows T-38 mil sizes at
   0° AA (T-38 wingspan = 25 ft 3 in) and at 90° AA (T-38 length = 46 ft 4 in) using
   stadiametric ranging.
A2.3. General Procedures and Examples. Since ET is flown at low AAs, these examples use
wingspan as the known distance in examples for 0° AA.
   A2.3.1. To determine range from another aircraft, divide wingspan in feet by apparent size
   in mils and multiply by 1,000. For example, a T-38 (25 foot wingspan) at 0° AA is 25 mils
   wingtip to wingtip in your HUD. Your range is 25 feet divided 25 mils multiplied by 1,000 =
   1,000 feet.
   A2.3.2. To predict size (in mils) of another aircraft at a defined range, divide wingspan in
   feet by the desired range and multiply by 1,000. For example, at 6,000 feet and 0° AA, a T-
   38 will be 25 feet divided by 6,000 feet multiplied by 1,000 = 4.1 mils.

   A2.3.3. In general, mil sizing could be adjusted when you are not approaching your target on
   an exact aspect. However, you may consider the 0° AA number suitable for perch entries to
   ET.
A2.4. HUD Symbol References. Once you know what size, in mils, an aircraft should be at
different ranges, you can use symbol references available to you on the HUD to determine your
range from the aircraft. Dimensions of the HUD bore sight cross/gun cross are illustrated in
Figure A2.1, dimensions for the MIL-STD HUD aircraft waterline are illustrated in Figure A2.2,
and dimensions for the F-16 HUD FPM are illustrated in Figure A2.3 The following examples
show how mil sizing can be used during UFT formation flying when you are approaching an
aircraft at low aspect , for example as wing during a straight-ahead rejoin or during the perch
entry to ET:
   A2.4.1. At 6,000 feet, Lead is approximately 4 mils which equates to slightly less than the
   width of a single horizontal line on the gun cross.
   A2.4.2. At 5,000 feet, Lead is approximately 5 mils which equates to the width of a single
   horizontal line on the gun cross.
   A2.4.3. At 4,000 feet, Lead is approximately 6 mils, approximately half the width of the
   entire gun cross.
   A2.4.4. At 3,000 feet, Lead is approximately 8 mils, approximately the width of the gun
   cross minus one of its horizontal lines.
   A2.4.5. At 2,000 feet, Lead is approximately 13 mils, the width of the gun cross.
   A2.4.6. At 1,000 feet, Lead is approximately 25 mils, approximately twice the width of the
   gun cross. A2.4.7. At 500 feet (inside the cone), Lead is approximately 50 mils,
   approximately 4 times the width of the gun cross.

           GUNS-TRACKING EXERCISE AND HEAT-TO-GUNS EXERCISE

A3.1. Purpose. The purpose for the guns-tracking and heat-to-guns exercises is to build on the
fundamentals learned in FM to place the aircraft in a position to employ weapons. The objectives
are the same as those for FM (paragraph 6.46) but also include:
   A3.1.1. Introduce and practice using HUD air-to-air symbology.
   A3.1.2. Introduce simulated infrared missile and gun employment from a stabilized WEZ.
A3.2. The WEZ. The WEZ is an area in relation to another aircraft from which valid weapons
may be employed with the greatest probability of achieving desired results. The WEZ is different
for each type of weapon. The exercises in this attachment will simulate the use of the AIM-9P
air-to-air missile and the 20 millimeter (MM) cannon.
   A3.2.1. The WEZ for the 20MM cannon during the guns-tracking exercise is a range
   between 2,500 feet and 1,000 feet and an AA <135 degrees. Desired aspect angle for gun
   employment is 20 to 50 degrees. Offenders must cease weapons employment with enough
   time and range to avoid a 1,000foot training bubble.
   A3.2.2. The WEZ for the AIM-9P during the heat-to-guns exercise is a range between 9,000
   and 2,000 feet and AA <45 degrees.
A3.3. The Control Zone. The control zone (Figures A3.1 and A3.2) is generally defined as
2,500 to 4,500 feet behind the training aircraft’s 3/9 line where range divided by 100, AA, and
angle off nose are all roughly the same number, and when the maneuvering aircraft is on or near
the training aircraft’s turn circle. The control zone allows the maneuvering aircraft to “control”
the training aircraft’s actions by forcing it to keep turning for survival or immediately allow for a
potential AIM-9P or gun WEZ entry. It is a position that also makes the training aircraft
predictable prior to pulling lead pursuit or setting pure pursuit for weapons employment. The
back of the control zone represents a “pressure” limit, forcing the training aircraft to turn to stay
alive. The front of the control zone represents a “reaction” limit, generally forcing the
maneuvering aircraft to reposition if closure or AA increases by even a small amount. In order to
transition to a stable WEZ, it is critical to maintain energy while in the control zone. As a rule of
thumb, the “heart” of the control zone is between 3,000 and 3,500 feet with an aspect of 30 to 40
degrees from the training aircraft. From this position, the maneuvering aircraft can transition to
an AIM9P or 20MM gun WEZ with enough time to employ valid ordnance and then reposition
in a timely manner (if required).

A3.4. Shot Validity. Valid gun and missile shots must be taken from within the WEZ for the
weapon and must meet either of the criteria in paragraph A3.4.1 or paragraph A3.4.2 for sighting
and time of flight (TOF). A snap is any valid gunshot less than 15 frames. A track is any
combination of valid guns shots equaling 15 frames. The T-38C VTR records 30 frames per
second.
   A3.4.1. Gunshots Using the Enhanced Envelope Gunsight (EEGS) Funnel. Use the firing
   evaluation display system (FEDS) developed at trigger pull to determine TOF and valid
   frames. Any part of the center of the FEDS touching the target at the correct range (matching
   the width of the FEDS dots) counts as a valid frame.
   A3.4.2. Gunshots Using the Lead Computing Optical Sight (LCOS). Use one frame per 100
   feet (range to training aircraft) to assess TOF. A frame is assessed as valid if the two mil
   pipper is touching the target inside 2,500 feet after the TOF requirement is satisfied.
   A3.4.3. AIM-9P Shot Validity. A valid uncage consists of the target’s heat source in the 17.5
   mil seeker reference circle (caged FOV) during the transition to the 30-mil (uncaged) circle.
   Once uncaged, the target must remain in the HUD FOV until pickle. The sun in the HUD
   FOV at pickle will invalidate the shot.
A3.5. Guns-Tracking Exercise:
   A3.5.1. DLO. The DLO is a valid guns track. This exercise can be flown in conjunction with
   the heat-to-guns exercise.
   A3.5.2. Guns-Tracking Exercise Setup and Special Instructions (SPINS) (Figure A3. 3):
       A3.5.2.1. Altitude block—15,000 to 17,000 feet MSL (or as briefed). Aircraft will be co-
       altitude (+500 feet) before beginning the exercise.
       A3.5.2.2. Airspeed—350 (+10) KCAS.
       A3.5.2.3. Range—6,000 feet line abreast.
       A3.5.2.4. Minimum Range. The minimum range between aircraft at all times is 1,000
       feet.
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   177

                    “C/S 1 ready”

                    heading XXX”
    “C/S, next set: guns-tracking
                 exercise for #2”




   A3.5.3. Avionics. When the flight lead initiates the “next set” call, ensure air-to-air master
   mode is selected, and cycle the master arm and CMD switches as required to reset the
   weapons.
   A3.5.4. Communication. When both aircraft are ready, lead will initiate a check 45 left/right
   away from the maneuvering aircraft. When the maneuvering aircraft reaches 3,000 feet with
   a 30- to 40degree aspect, the maneuvering aircraft will make a “C/S, fight’s on” call. Refer to
   unit standards for specific communications guidance.
   A3.5.5. Training Aircraft. After the check left/right is initiated, the training aircraft will
   select MIL power and initiate a level turn away from the maneuvering aircraft while
   maintaining 350 KCAS. After 45 degrees of turn, roll out and regain the visual of the
   maneuvering aircraft. Once the maneuvering aircraft reaches pure pursuit, reverse the
   direction of turn and use G as required to ensure a 30- to 40degree AA is set for the
   maneuvering aircraft. This picture equates to roughly one fist width above the canopy bow
   (Figure A3.4 [Note: Bandit not to scale]). At the “fight’s on” call, pull 4 Gs with MIL power
   in a level turn, allowing airspeed to slow toward 300 KCAS. Continue flying a level to
   slightly descending constant airspeed turn at MIL power (usually no slower than 300 KCAS).

Figure A3.4. Setting the “Fight’s On” AA.




   A3.5.6. Maneuvering Aircraft. After the check left/right is initiated, select MIL power and
   make a level turn toward the training aircraft while maintaining 350 KCAS. Pull the nose of
   the aircraft until just prior to achieving pure pursuit then reverse direction to maintain pure
   pursuit. At a range of 3,000 feet and a 30- to 40-degree AA, make the “fight’s on” call. The
   maneuvering aircraft is in the heart of the control zone.
       A3.5.6.1. Transitioning from the Control Zone to the Gun WEZ. Align POM with the
       training aircraft and pull lead to place the training aircraft inside of the gunsight. When
       transitioning from the control zone to a WEZ, the maneuvering aircraft is building
       geometric closure as it cuts to the inside of the training aircraft’s turn circle. Be aware
       that the training aircraft will be cooperative and will not maneuver to present additional
       closure and POM problems for the maneuvering aircraft. Expect initially to maintain the
       “fight’s on” power setting until established in the heart of the WEZ, followed by power
       modulation to sustain the WEZ. To control closure, reduce power as required once lead is
       assured. Generally, “lead is assured” if pulling the training aircraft into the HUD creates
       little to no buffet. With a good airspeed advantage, power can be pulled to idle as early as
       when the training aircraft reaches the canopy bow. The faster the training aircraft reaches
       the HUD, the earlier the power needs to be pulled back. Contrarily, if barely able to get
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  179


      the training aircraft to the HUD due to moderate buffet, lead may not be attained or
      maintained without an increased power setting, to include the use of afterburner.
      A3.5.6.2. In Range. While maneuvering from the control zone to the WEZ, expect the
      training aircraft to be within range by the time lead and POM are solved; however, use
      mil sizing to ensure employment inside MAX range (2,500 feet).
          A3.5.6.2.1. Funnel. The training aircraft is in range when the wings fill the width of
          the funnel at the middle pipper (2,500 feet). The minimum range of 1,000 feet is
          achieved with the training aircraft’s wings reaching the edge of the funnel at the top
          dot.
          A3.5.6.2.2. LCOS. The training aircraft is in range when the wings fill the width of
          the inner circle of the LCOS sight. The minimum range of 1,000 feet is achieved
          when the training aircraft’s wings are at the edges of the outer circle of the LCOS
          sight.
      A3.5.6.3. POM. The funnel and the gun-sight depression line connecting the LCOS
      pipper to the gun cross show the maneuvering aircraft’s POM, making the POM solution
      intuitive. Nonetheless, pulling the gun cross in front of the training aircraft to its
      predicted flightpath before attempting to align the POM will mitigate over controlling
      inputs and aid in stabilizing the gunshot.
      A3.5.6.4. Lead. With the funnel, a good technique of ensuring lead prior to weapons
      employment is to pull until the target aircraft’s wings are just slightly overlapping the
      funnel at the 2,500-foot reference, then gently relax backstick pressure allowing the
      aircraft’s wingspan to match the outside of the funnel edges. With the LCOS, pull lead to
      position the pipper on the training aircraft’s nose, then gently relax backstick pressure
      allowing the aircraft to fly through the pipper.
      A3.5.6.5. Gun Employment. Prior to opening fire, ensure feet are on the floor or exerting
      symmetric pressure on the rudder pedals. Unintentional yaw inputs will case POM errors.
      Using fine muscle movements, stabilize the aiming reference on the center of the target
      aircraft. Adjust power as required based on closure, aircraft buffet cues, and LOS rate.
      Small adjustments in back-stick pressure and lateral stick displacement will be required
      to refine aiming based on continuously changing range and POM. Adjust for POM error
      using lateral stick pressure by attempting to adjust for one-half the distance of FEDS or
      LCOS pipper displacement. A controlled gunshot could be considered a 2- to 3-second
      lethal burst. This time may be shortened based on range, closure, and significant aiming
      errors. Consider it a waste of bullets to attempt a gunshot for longer than 3 seconds.
      Marksmanship is critical. At 60 rounds per second, 450 rounds of simulated bullets will
      be depleted in approximately 7 seconds. Expect approximately 90 to 120 degrees of turn
      to obtain a valid track prior to terminating the exercise. Be aware of the potential to fly
      through the target aircraft’s jet wash.
A3.6. Heat-to-Guns Exercise:
   A3.6.1. DLOs. The DLOs are achieved by employing a valid Fox 2, executing an effective
   turn circle entry, and achieving a valid guns track. A common termination point for the
   exercise occurs at the completion of a valid gun attempt or if the student fails to achieve a
   valid gun solution on the initial attempt.

   A3. 5):
       A3.6.2.1. Altitude block—15,000 to 17,000 feet MSL (This may be adjusted). Aircraft
       will be co-altitude (+500 feet) before beginning the exercise.
       A3.6.2.2. Airspeed—410 +5.
       A3.6.2.3. Range—6,000 feet line abreast.
       A3.6.2.4. Minimum Range. The minimum range between aircraft at all times is 1,000
       feet.

   A3.6.3. Avionics. Ensure air-to-air master mode is selected, and cycle the master arm and
   CMD switches as required to reset weapons.
   A3.6.4. Communication. Refer to specific communications guidance in unit standards. See
   Figure A3.5 for a communications example. Lead will initiate an ops check then inform the
AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                    181


  wingman of the next setup (e.g., “C/S, next set will be a heat-to-guns exercise for #2.”). Two
  will acknowledge with position number. While in tactical formation, lead will then give a
  “C/S, push-it-up” call, with a reference heading if required. After reaching briefed starting
  parameters, lead will initiate a “ready” call. When both aircraft are ready, lead will call “C/S,
  fight’s on.”
  A3.6.5. Training Aircraft. At the “fight’s on” call, the training aircraft will initiate a MIL
  power, 4-G level turn away from the maneuvering aircraft. At 90 degrees of turn, roll out and
  modulate power not to exceed 410 KCAS. As soon as a ”FOX 2” is called by the
  maneuvering aircraft, the training aircraft will either immediately reverse the turn (if still
  checking away) or begin a turn in either direction and maintain 3 to 4 Gs while slowing to
  350 KCAS and MIL power. Continue flying a level to slightly descending constant airspeed
  turn at MIL power.
  A3.6.6. Maneuvering Aircraft. At the “fight’s on” call, select MAX afterburner, set the LV
  on the training aircraft, start the AGSM, and pull using light buffet (4 to 5 Gs). As the
  training aircraft enters the HUD FOV, simultaneously relax the G, reduce the throttles to
  maintain 410 +10 KCAS, and attempt a valid AIM-9 shot. Call “FOX 2,” and prepare to
  enter the training aircraft’s turn circle
     A3.6.6.1. AIM-9 Employment. When pulling the training aircraft into the HUD, consider
     a slight relax of G as required to slow the training aircraft’s LOS rate to the missile
     seeker FOV. With the target’s heat source in the missile FOV, uncage the missile.
     Attempting to hold or freeze the target aircraft in the center of the seeker FOV for too
     long can result in a significant closure problem and decrease the time available to prepare
     for follow-on maneuvers. After employing the AIM-9, call “Vega 2, Fox 2,” roll out, and
     begin a slight climb (normally FPM 3 to 5 degrees above the horizon) to avoid the
     training aircraft’s jet wash. Modulate power to accelerate back to or maintain 410 KCAS
     while approaching the target aircraft’s point of return.
     A3.6.6.2. Turn Circle (TC) Entry Recognition Cues. Recognizing the proper TC entry
     cues proves vital to successfully entering the control zone. The maneuvering aircraft is on
     the TC when an increase in the aft LOS rate of the training aircraft occurs. Another
     recognizable cue happens when the rotational motion of the training aircraft turns into aft
     translational motion (AA stops increasing). Due to the low turn rates of the T-38, this
     increase in LOS rate is relatively subtle. The most common visual crutch is to begin
     maneuvering once the training aircraft reaches a point just outside the canopy bow.
     A3.6.6.3. Assessing a WEZ. At the turn circle entry, select G and power as appropriate
     (usually MIL), begin the AGSM, set the LV near the training aircraft, and start a light to
     moderate buffet pull. Be aware of the potential to fly through the training aircraft’s jet
     wash. As the training aircraft approaches the canopy bow, assess range, aspect, and
     closure. The area within one to two fists of the canopy bow is referred to as the
     “assessment window.” Commonly briefed cues to search for during this assessment
     include 3,000 feet of range, 30 to 45 degrees of aspect, and steady, controllable closure
     (referred to sometimes as the “rule of threes”). Details on the training aircraft’s jet
     provide the most accurate method to determine range. At 3,000 feet, the training aircraft
     has a clearly visible canopy and canopy bows, distinct lines where the wings and tail
     meet the fuselage, and clear lines where the colors on the paint scheme change. To
182                                                        AFMAN11-251V1 1 AUGUST 2013


      determine 30 to 45 degrees of aspect, refer to the wingspan versus length relationship. To
      determine acceptable closure, the training aircraft’s jet should slowly grow larger. If the
      jet is rapidly growing larger or smaller, improper closure exists. During the heat-to-guns
      exercise, range and aspect should look appropriate for transition to the gun WEZ. If all
      three cues from the training aircraft exist at the canopy bow assessment window, continue
      to pull the training aircraft into the HUD and employ ordnance. If one or more of the cues
      are not met, execute an ease reposition as described in paragraph A3.6.6.4. An ease
      reposition will help to solve range and aspect by realigning turn circles.
      A3.6.6.4. Ease Reposition. If the range, aspect, and closure cues are not met at the
      canopy bow assessment window, execute an ease reposition to drive the range and aspect
      lower. An ease reposition drives the maneuvering aircraft back toward the training
      aircraft’s turn circle, reducing closure and aspect in the process. Execute an ease
      reposition by relaxing backstick pressure to reduce G. Modulate power as required to
      maintain the desired rate fight airspeed. When reducing G, the fighter will see aft LOS
      from the training aircraft (away from the canopy bow) as well as a reduction in aspect.
      Expect LOS to be immediate, although the amount of time required during the ease will
      vary based on the range, angles, and closure presented by the training aircraft at the time
      of the ease. Select MAX afterburner; reset the LV for best rate; and blend the G back in.
      Maintain the best rate until the training aircraft again enters the canopy bow assessment
      window. Assess and either execute another ease reposition or pull G as required to enter
      the AIM-9/gun WEZ.
      A3.6.6.5. Gun Employment. Once committed to transitioning from the control zone to
      the gun WEZ, pull lead and establish POM while controlling closure. For mechanics,
      refer to gun employment in paragraph A3.5.6.5. While employing the gun, the
      maneuvering aircraft may need to reposition. The reposition is a calculated bid to lag,
      using the vertical and induced drag to solve range, aspect, and closure problems. The
      maneuvering aircraft should reposition for either frag created from the valid gun kill or
      range and closure problems created during the gun attempt. Always reposition the aircraft
      before entering the 1,000-foot bubble around the training aircraft.
      A3.6.6.6. Reposition Mechanics. Rotate the LV away from the training aircraft; power
      placement, degree of LV change, G, and AOA used will depend on the severity of the
      BFM problem the maneuvering aircraft is trying to solve. If unsure, a good default is to
      use idle, set the LV 60 to 90 degrees above the training aircraft (typically, perpendicular
      to the horizon), and use a smooth but deliberate pull to the moderate buffet. Once arriving
      on or near the training aircraft’s turn circle, begin pull back towards the training aircraft
      to reduce HCA and begin the reassessment. Throttle position will depend on LOS and
      range cues from the training aircraft. Recommit as required for an AIM-9 opportunity on
      the way back to the gun WEZ. Be aware of position relative to the training floor during
      the recommit.
