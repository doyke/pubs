1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the guidance in this AFI except when the
situation demands immediate action to ensure safety.
     1.4.1. Although this publication provides guidance for aircraft operations under most
     circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment. When it is necessary to protect the
     crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and immediate action is
     required, the Pilot in Command (PIC) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the course
     of action to be taken. Report all deviations or exceptions to this instruction without a waiver
     through channels to HQ AFSOC/A3. (T-2)
     1.4.2. Unless otherwise indicated, HQ AFSOC/A3 is the waiver authority for operational
     procedure requirements contained in this instruction. HQ AFSOC/A3 may delegate this
     authority to the Commander Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF) for
     operationally assigned Special Operations Forces (SOF). Request waivers to this instruction
     through proper command and control channels. (T-2)
     1.4.3. Waivers. Waiver authority for the contents of this document is AF/A3O. IAW
     AFI 11202, Vol 2, the MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                    9


   requirements on a case-by-case basis, but the MAJCOM/A3 may not approve blanket or
   group (two or more aircrew) waivers. Waiver requests should be submitted through
   MAJCOM Standardization and Evaluation channels to the A3. As applicable, MAJCOM/A3
   will forward requests to AF/A3O, with an info copy to AF/A3O-AI.
       1.4.3.1. Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk.
           1.4.3.1.1. “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-
           compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority.
           1.4.3.1.2. “Tier 1” (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-
           compliance may put airman, mission, or program strongly at risk, and may only be
           waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate with concurrence of publication approver.
           When multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate.
           1.4.3.1.3. “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially
           put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only
           be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.
           1.4.3.1.4. “Tier 3” (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-
           compliance has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC
           but no lower than the OG/CC.
1.5. Supplements. Supplements or Local Procedures will not duplicate or be less restrictive
than the provisions of this instruction or any other publication without prior authorization from

                                           Chapter 2

                             COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

2.1. General. The AFSOC Command and Control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring and decentralized command, control and execution. The result is a C2
mechanism which keeps the AFSOC/CC informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while
enabling the Wing/CC, Group/CC, or Squadron/CC to exercise control over the day-to-day
operations.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)-assigned Air Force Special
Operations Forces (AFSOF) aircraft, while the Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC)
have OPCON of theater-based assets. Exception: In practice, responsibility for planning and
executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the Wing/CC or Group/CC. The Wing/CC
or Group/CC, in turn, exercises control of non-close-hold missions through command post
supporting wing or group. In the event that assigned forces undergo a change in operation
control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility
to the gaining command. Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent operational plan
(OPLAN), operational order (OPORD), deployment order (DEPORD), or execution order
(EXORD). Note: For certain close-hold activities, security considerations may compel the
Wing or Group Commander to shift mission monitoring responsibilities from the command post
to another wing, group, or theater agency. The Wing/CC or Group/CC will ensure procedures
are established for the responsible agency to monitor mission progress and advise the HQ
AFSOC/A3 or AFSOF/CC as appropriate. (T-2)
2.3. Mission Monitoring. AFSOC Wing (or equivalent) command posts are the focal point for
all assigned, non-CHOPed, not-close-hold aircraft flight and mission monitoring. Command
post accomplishes this via the Air Mobility Command (AMC) C2 system, direct reporting from
aircrew and communication from other command posts. Key components of the AMC C2
system are the Airlift Implementation and Monitoring System (AIMS), the Global Decision
Support System (GDSS2), and various AMC C2 facilities at theater and other wing locations.
Wings input AIMS data for all upcoming missions except local missions not scheduled to land
outside the local flying area or close-hold missions that cannot be accommodated by classified J-
coded AIMS setups. When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the
Command Post obtains additional information from Situation Reports (SITREP) and Deployed
Status Reports (DSR). The wing command posts keep the AFSOC Operations Center informed
on all non-CHOPed aircraft moving to, from, or between off-station locations. The following
mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not close-hold in nature and
have not been CHOPed to another C2 agency: (T-2)
   2.3.1. Wing (or equivalent) command posts directly monitor their aircraft movements in the
   continental United States (CONUS) and outside the CONUS (OCONUS) until a CHOP
   occurs. (T-2)
   2.3.2. Information on aircraft movement (CONUS or OCONUS) comes to the wing
   command posts via GDSS and telephone/fax/e-mail notification directly from the aircrews or
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                               11


   via the Special Operations Command and Control Squadron or Element (SOCCS or
   SOCCE). (T-2)
   2.3.3. Unclassified Missions at Bases with an AMC C2 Facility. The Mission Commander
   (MC) or PIC should ensure the following information is relayed to the AMC C2 facility at
   least 30 minutes prior to landing: call sign(s), mission number(s), estimated time of arrival
   (ETA), maintenance status, and additional service requirements. After landing, the MC or
   PIC will contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements and departure
   information. In addition, CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS must keep their
   home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times, projected
   takeoff times, and other related information. (T-2)
   2.3.4. Unclassified Missions at Bases without an AMC C2 Facility. The MC or PIC will
   report, as soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times, maintenance status, projected
   takeoff times, and other pertinent data to their wing command post. Methods of
   communicating this information include aircraft mission communication systems, high
   frequency (HF) phone patch, Defense Switched Network (DSN), e-mail, fax, and commercial
   telephone. CONUS-based crews operating within the CONUS must also ensure that their
   home station command posts receive real-time reports on aircraft movements. (T-2)
   2.3.5. J-coded AIMS Missions. When operating on J-coded missions, the MC or PIC will
   pass movement reports to the appropriate C2 facility. The MC or PIC will make
   arrangements with the theater command post/reporting agency or Air Force Special
   Operations Command (AFSOC) Command Center to pass pertinent flight information via
   secure voice or data communications. If necessary, call on an unclassified line and report.
   For example, “Loaded and ready to go. Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) is as fragged.”
   Note: For missions requiring special handling above and beyond basic J-code procedures,
   C2 procedures will be outlined in the tasking directive. (T-2)
   2.3.6. Close-hold or Sensitive Missions. These missions may operate without AIMS setups.
   Reference the note preceding this paragraph. (T-2)
2.4. Mission Commander (MC). A MC will be designated when more than one aircraft or
crew are deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other operations.
Designated MCs must have attended the Special Operations Air Warfare Center (SOAWC)
Mission Commanders Course. Waiver authority for this requirement is OG/CC. The MC will be
a mission ready aircraft commander (AC) and should not be used as a primary crew member. In
cases where it is necessary for the MC to fly, ensure a senior unit member or designated
representative is delegated to fulfill MC duties. The MC’s responsibilities include, but are not
limited to: (T-2)
   2.4.1. Briefing crews on local operating procedures.
   2.4.2. Coordinating with Air Traffic Control (ATC), Combat Control Teams (CCT), Special
   Tactics Squadron (STS) teams, range control, users, and other agencies that may have an
   impact on the mission.
   2.4.3. Ensuring Landing Zones (LZ) have current surveys (when necessary).
   2.4.4. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, eating, and transportation
   arrangements.

   2.4.5. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.
   2.4.6. Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements and mission SITREP.
2.5. Pilot in Command Responsibility and Authority. AF Form 4327A, Crew Flight
Authorization (FA), designates a PIC for all flights. The PIC is:
   2.5.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.5.2. Responsible for the welfare of their crew, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.5.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage the crew and accomplish the mission.
   2.5.4. The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to a
   higher authority.
   2.5.5. The final authority for accepting a waiver affecting the crew or mission.
   2.5.6. Charged with keeping the applicable commander informed of mission progress and
   difficulties.
   2.5.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a MC.
2.6. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either by
the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start
or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.
If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or
improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to
take the same mission under the same conditions. (T-2)
   2.6.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission should be authorized by the commander with
   OPCON, except in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather
   conditions or facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the
   MC or PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible. (T-2)
   2.6.2. The controlling agency directing the diversion or rerouting is responsible for ensuring
   destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew. (T-2)
   2.6.3. The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that
   may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission. (T-2)
   2.6.4. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure
   the PIC is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate. If the planned alternate
   is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the PIC of other
   suitable alternates. (T-2)
2.7. Civilian Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD)
to cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DCSA), incorporates the appropriate directive and
provides uniform policies and procedures service members must follow when supporting federal,
state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations and
restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law
enforcement organizations. Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from
civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels. (T-0)

                   AIRCREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Each person assigned as a primary crew member must be qualified
or in training for qualification in that crew position and mission. (T-2)
   3.1.1. Basic proficiency crew members may perform primary crew duties on any non-
   mission sortie and on mission sorties (including unilateral training, joint training, and
   exercises) when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations under the supervision
   of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position. (T-2)
   3.1.2. Noncurrent (NC) or Unqualified (UNQ) crew members may perform crew duties only
   under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew
   position. (T-2)
       3.1.2.1. Refer to AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, for guidance on transporting
       passengers with NC or UNQ crew members.
3.2. Crew Complement. The minimum crew complement for flight operations is two pilots and
one loadmaster. The squadron commander may add crew members to enhance mission
accomplishment or maximize training. During cases when no loadmaster is available, the
minimum crew complement is two pilots. The squadron commander or deployed mission
commander is the approval authority for such operations. This option should only be authorized
in exceptional circumstances and not for matter of convenience. (T-2)
   3.2.1. A minimum of one additional pilot or one loadmaster is required when carrying more
   than 10 passengers. (T-2)
   3.2.2. A loadmaster is not required for engine ground runs.
   3.2.3. Additional Crew Members. Additional aircrew members assigned in addition to the
   normal aircrew complement required for a mission, will travel in MEP status. See AFI 11-
   401, AFSOC Sup 1. The PIC or designated representative will brief all MEPs on emergency
   procedures, egress, and appropriate FCIF items. MEPs will possess a security clearance
   appropriate to the mission being performed. (T-2)
   3.2.4. Other US Military Service Members Performing Duties on Air Force Aircraft.
   Reference AFI 11-401, AFSOC Sup 1.
3.3. Interfly. Interfly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft
between MAJCOMs to accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to
specific operations/tests, exercises, or special circumstances.
   3.3.1. HQ AFSOC/A4RX maintains current Memorandum of Agreements (MOA) between
   AFSOC, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air
   Education and Training Command (AETC), and Air Combat Command (ACC) for interfly
   using AFSOC-assigned aircraft. Unless specified in the MOA:
       3.3.1.1. Aircraft ownership will not be transferred. (T-2)
       3.3.1.2. The operational squadron will prepare and sign AFSOC/AFRC/AETC flight
       orders. (T-2)

                          AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.
The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the PIC. If one
crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this
acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with
the same item or system inoperative. When the PIC considers an item essential, designate the
component Mission Essential (ME) on the aircraft maintenance forms, and the item will be
repaired or replaced prior to departure. (T-2)
   4.1.1. The PIC is the approval authority for operations with degraded equipment within the
   guidelines of the aircraft Minimum Equipment List (MEL) and Minimum Equipment
   Subsystems List (MESL). Operating outside of the aircraft MEL or MESL guidelines
   requires Group/CC or COMAFSOF approval.                For contingency operations when
   communication issues prevent any possibility of a waiver request, the PIC is the approval
   authority for operating outside the aircraft MEL guidelines but must notify the chain of
   command of the situation as soon as conditions permit. (T-2)
   4.1.2. One Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. A one-time flight is defined as a required flight to a final destination
   including required fuel stops. (T-2)
       4.1.2.1. The squadron commander, chief of maintenance, MC, or deployed maintenance
       representative must authorize this release. (T-2)
       4.1.2.2. The OG/CC or COMAFSOF must authorize the flight after maintenance has
       released the aircraft for flight operations. (T-2)
       4.1.2.3. The maintenance release, OG/CC or COMAFSOF approval, and the PIC’s
       concurrence are all required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified repair
       destination. (T-2)
4.2. Policy. This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment. If the
PIC elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, the PIC will coordinate
mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance
requirements, etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not
adversely impact follow-on missions. Reference the aircraft MEL and MESL for aircraft
systems and equipment required for operations. (T-2)
   4.2.1. Pressurization and/or Air-conditioning Systems. Pressurization and/or the air-
   conditioning system should be operational if patients are carried. If a system fails at an en
   route stop, the mission may continue (coordinate with the senior medical crew member when
   patients are carried) to a destination with repair capability. Required en route stops with
   inoperative pressurization and/or air-conditioning systems are authorized. The PIC will brief
   passengers and patients on the possibility of personal discomfort. (T-2)
   4.2.2. Retractable Landing Gear System. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only
   a full stop landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight.
16                                                     AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


  (T-2) Exception: If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that
  further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown
  to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down
  and locked position. Required en route stops are authorized. (T-2)
  4.2.3. Radar. The weather mode radar must be operative for flights into areas of known or
  forecast thunderstorms. (T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                   17

                         AIRCRAFT OPERATING PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete
until all items have been accomplished. (T-2)
   5.1.1. The Pilot Flying (PF) will initiate all checklists unless the Aircraft Operating
   Handbook (AOH) or this instruction establishes an alternate procedure. (T-2)
   5.1.2. Each aircrew member will use the HQ AFSOC/A3V approved checklist for the
   appropriate aircraft and duty position when conducting ground or flight operations. Self-
   prepared or “cheat sheet” checklists are not authorized for ground or flight usage. (T-2)
   5.1.3. Aircrews may use approved checklists modified with notes, amplifying procedures,
   and limits provided the checklist and notes are current. Currency of notes is the crew
   member’s responsibility.
   5.1.4. Before Landing Checklists. Aircrew will complete the Before Landing Checklist no
   lower than 200 feet (ft) Above Ground Level (AGL). Aircraft will be established on final,
   wings level, with a controlled rate of descent in a position to execute a safe landing no lower
   than 100 ft AGL. (T-2)
5.2. Duty Stations. All crew members will be at their duty stations during all takeoffs,
departures, approaches, and landings. During other phases of flight, crew members may leave
their duty stations to meet physiological needs and perform normal crew duties. Only one pilot
may be absent from their duty station at a time. Notify the AC prior to departing assigned
primary duty station. (T-2)
   5.2.1. The loadmaster’s primary duty station is the jump seat for critical phases of flight.
   The AC may assign an alternate duty station for abnormal situations. (T-2)
5.3. Seat Belts.
   5.3.1. Crew members occupying a primary crew position will have seat belts fastened at all

       5.5.2.4. Missions operating in areas of hostile activity unless conditions prevent
       compliance.
   5.5.3. A qualified Mission Pilot (MP), Instructor Pilot (IP), or Evaluator Pilot (EP) may
   takeoff or land from either seat. Any combination of mission events is permissible (i.e., short
   field, semi-prepared and/or NVGs). (T-2)
   5.5.4. First Pilots (FPs) are authorized to conduct takeoffs and landings from either seat on
   prepared surfaces. Short field procedures and/or semi-prepared surfaces are not permitted.
   FPs may use NVGs for takeoff and landing at airfields with Airfield Marking Pattern (AMP)-
   1 lighting. (T-2)
   5.5.5. FPs will make all takeoffs and landings when the right seat is occupied by a Copilot
   (CP) and the crosswind component exceeds 15 knots. (T-2)
   5.5.6. A qualified CP may takeoff or land from the right seat: (T-2)
       5.5.6.1. With an MP, IP, or EP as PIC.
       5.5.6.2. When an FP is PIC and crosswinds are 15 knots or less.

218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, comply with the following:
   5.6.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 ft. With wing walkers,
   avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 ft. (T-2) Exception: When operating at a civilian
   airport and taxiing on a Fixed Based Operator (FBO) ramp, the PIC may taxi the aircraft
   within 25 ft of obstacles or other aircraft without wing walkers when using marked taxi
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                 19


   routes. The PIC will comply with marshaller instructions. Taxi routes must be used by
   similar types of aircraft for which the routes were designed and in specifically designed
   parking spots. Support equipment shall be located in appropriately designated areas. In
   austere locations where wing walkers and taxi lines do not exist and obstacle distances are
   questionable, the PIC must use good crew coordination and sound judgment to effectively
   mitigate risk to the aircraft. (T-2)
   5.6.2. Do not taxi aircraft closer than 10 ft to any obstacle. (T-2)
   5.6.3. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker. If wing walkers are unavailable
   or if provided and doubt still exists as to proper clearance, deplane a crew member to
   maintain obstruction clearance. (T-2)
5.7. Takeoff and Landing Runway Criteria.
   5.7.1. PICs will comply with the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR)
   requirements prior to operating at airfields classified as “special PIC airports” or
   “certification airfields” by the ASRR. Reference AFI 11-202, Vol 3, AFSOC Sup 1, for
   information on ASRR waiver authority. (T-2)
   5.7.2. Runway Requirements. Use normal takeoff and landing procedures whenever
   practical. For mission accomplishment, if approach end overruns are available and stressed
   or authorized for normal operations, the overruns may be used to increase the runway
   available for takeoff.      Base aircraft performance requirements on actual or predicted
   environmental conditions (e.g., pressure altitude, temperature, aircraft weight, runway
   surface conditions, etc.). (T-2)
      5.7.2.1. Taxiway width. Minimum width for all operations is 22 ft. (T-2)
      5.7.2.2. Runway width. Minimum width for normal operations is 35 ft. (T-2)
          5.7.2.2.1. Minimum runway width for narrow field operations is 22 ft. Note:
          Approval authority for operations with less than 35 ft runway width is the squadron
          commander or Joint Special Operations Air Component (JSOAC) commander for
          deployed operations. Note: Operations on runways with widths less than the
          minimum turn radius of 47 ft 6 inches require an additional level of risk management.
          Runways narrower than the minimum turn radius will require the crew to accomplish
          star turns or other procedures to reposition the aircraft for departure. Crews must also
          consider the distance from the nose landing gear to the main landing gear (24 ft 4
          inches) when attempting turnarounds. (T2)
   5.7.3. Normal Operations:
      5.7.3.1. Takeoff and Landing. Minimum runway length is the greater of Takeoff
      Distance or Accelerate-Stop Distance. (T-2)
      5.7.3.2. Touch-and-go operations. A touch-and-go will not be continued unless
      sufficient touch-and-go distance remains. A minimum of 6,000 ft of runway is required
      for Flaps 20 touch-and-go landings. A minimum of 7,000 ft of runway is required for
      zero-flap or Flaps 32 touch-and-go landings. (T-2)
          5.7.3.2.1. Touch-and-go distance is defined as Flaps 12 landing distance plus 1,000 ft
          prior to takeoff power application. (T-2)
 20                                                       AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


       5.7.3.3. Stop-and-go operations. Available runway distance remaining after stopping the
       aircraft will be at least Takeoff Distance or Accelerate-Stop Distance, whichever is
       greater. If the runway remaining is less, taxi the aircraft to achieve the required distance.
       (T-2)
   5.7.4. Short field operations:
       5.7.4.1. Takeoff. Minimum runway length for a short field takeoff is the greater distance
       of Takeoff Ground Roll + 10% of Takeoff Ground Roll, Accelerate-Stop Distance at
       KVS 1.13-V1/VR 0.85, or 2,000 ft. (T-2)
       5.7.4.2. Landing. Minimum runway length for a short field landing is the greater
       distance of landing ground roll + 10% of landing ground roll or 2,000 ft. (T-2)
       CAUTION: Landing at an airfield based on landing ground roll may not provide the
       aircrew with the required takeoff ground roll without off-loading pax, cargo, or fuel.
       5.7.4.3. Short Field Stop-and-Go Operations. Short field stop-and-go operations are not
       authorized. If a landing is conducted and sufficient distance does not remain to conduct a
       normal takeoff, taxi the aircraft back until sufficient distance allows using normal takeoff
       procedures. (T-2)
   5.7.5. Semi-prepared surface operations:
       5.7.5.1. Semi-prepared surfaces are defined in AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, Drop Zone
       and Landing Zone Procedures.
       5.7.5.2. Pilots will only perform stop-and-go or full stop landings on semi-prepared
       surfaces. Reference AOH for information on aircraft performance on semi-prepared
       surfaces. (T-2)
5.8. Landing Gear and Flap Operation.
   5.8.1. The copilot will operate the landing gear. Actuate the landing gear upon command of
   the PF. Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the PNF will acknowledge the PF command by
   repeating the command. (T-2)
   5.8.2. The flaps will be actuated by the PNF, upon command of the PF. (T-2)
   5.8.3. Unless an emergency situation dictates otherwise, zero-flap takeoffs are prohibited.
   (T-2)
5.9. Aircraft Navigation Systems.
   5.9.1. Global Positioning System (GPS) approaches. The C-146A is approved to use GPS
   for navigation during en route operations and terminal procedures to include area navigation
   (RNAV) arrivals and departures and RNAV instrument approaches. Navigational Aids
   (NAVAIDS) will be used for backup when available. Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 3 AFSOC
   Sup 1, and AFMAN 11-217, Vol 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, and C-146A AOH
   guidance for procedures and limitations. (T-2)
5.10. Aircraft Lighting.
   5.10.1. Operate aircraft lighting IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, AFSOC Sup 1, and AFI 11-218,
   except when in compliance with contingency requirements or guidance. (T-2)

      in a position to execute a safe landing.
      5.11.1.4. “Go-around” at or below MDA or at the missed approach point and the runway
      environment is not in sight, when the aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe
      landing, when directed by ATC facility, or conditions on the runway will not allow a safe
      landing (e.g., personnel, equipment, or aircraft on the runway).
   5.11.2. Precision Approaches.
      5.11.2.1. “100 above” when 100 ft above final approach altitude, glideslope intercept
      altitude, or decision height (DH).
      5.11.2.2. “Continue” at DH with approach light system visible and the aircraft is in a
      position to execute a safe landing. Do not continue the approach below 100 ft if usable
      runway visual cues are not present.
      5.11.2.3. “Land” at DH with the runway environment in sight and the aircraft is in a
      position to execute a safe landing.
      5.11.2.4. “Go-around” at or below DH and the runway environment is not in sight or if
      the aircraft is not in a position to execute a safe landing, when directed by ATC facility,
      or conditions on the runway will not allow a safe landing (e.g., personnel, equipment, or
      aircraft on the runway).
   5.11.3. Climb/Descent.
      5.11.3.1. “1,000 ft above/below” assigned altitude or flight level.
   5.11.4. Altimeter settings. Both pilots will state and set the altimeter setting as issued by
   ATC, weather reporting facilities (Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS),
   Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS), Automated Surface Observing System
   (ASOS), etc.), or when passing a Transition Level or Altitude (e.g., Flight Level 180).
   5.11.5. Deviations:
      5.11.5.1. Any crew member will immediately advise the PF when observing
      unannounced heading deviations greater than 10 degrees, airspeed deviations of 10 knots,
      altitude deviations of 100 ft during approach or 200 ft while en route, or potential terrain
      or obstruction problems and no attempt is being made by the PF to correct the deviation.
 22                                                     AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


       5.11.5.2. Any aircrew member will announce deviations from prescribed procedures for
       the approach being flown to the PF when no attempt is being made to correct the
       deviation.
5.12. Communications Guidance. The PIC will determine communication requirements
during mission planning. Ensure all mission frequencies, cryptological data, mission radio
configuration, and mission radio monitoring responsibilities are outlined during the preflight
briefing. (T-2)
5.13. Wake Turbulence Avoidance.
   5.13.1. Refer to AFMAN 11-217, Vol 3, Supplemental Flight Information, FLIP General
   Planning, and the Airman’s Information Manual (AIM) for additional wake turbulence
   information and wake turbulence avoidance techniques.
5.14. Landing Zone (LZ) Operations and Criteria.
   5.14.1. For C-146A specific LZ dimensions, criteria and suitability requirements refer to
   AFI 13-217 AFSOC Sup 1.
   5.14.2. All LZs must be surveyed and approved in accordance with AFI 13-217, AFSOC
   Sup 1. (T-2)
   5.14.3. The LZ program is a squadron tactics function. The squadron tactics office must
   ensure surveys are conducted and updated IAW AFI 13-217, AFSOC Sup 1, and the
   procedures below. It is the responsibility of all aircrew and/or ground personnel to notify the
   point of contact (POC) for the squadron LZ survey program, in a timely manner, of any
   changes or discrepancies on existing surveys. (T-2)
   5.14.4. The overt or covert markings and signals to be used during LZ operations will be
   established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing. Refer to AFI 13-
   217, AFSOC Sup 1, for LZ marking descriptions. (T-2)
   5.14.5. Navigating to Landing Zones. Some missions may require operations into unmarked
   and uncontrolled LZs. Mission effectiveness depends upon detailed intelligence, extensive
   aircrew planning and study, precision en route navigation and time control, accurate and
   timely LZ recognition, and positive aircrew coordination.
   5.14.6. Landing Zone Arrival Procedures (LZAP). LZAPs may be used for arrivals to
   conventional airfields and landing zones, in both day and night environments, and either for
   overt or covert NVG operations. LZAPs will be flown at airfields without approved
   instrument approach procedures.         Comply with ATC restrictions and host nation
   requirements, as appropriate. (T-2) WARNING: LZAPs are a situational awareness tool
   and do not guarantee obstacle or terrain clearance.
       5.14.6.1. Weather minimums.      All LZAPs must be flown in Visual Meteorological
       Conditions (VMC). (T-2)
       5.14.6.2. LZAP construction. Use the most current sources for topological, obstacle, and
       airfield information.
       5.14.6.3. En Route Altitude. Plan an en route altitude and en route descent point that
       allows the aircraft to be in a position to cross the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) at the
       planned glide slope intercept altitude. Carefully consider all terrain and obstacles along
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                               23


     the planned en route descent path that are not considered as part of the LZAP terrain
     analysis.
     5.14.6.4. IAF. The IAF is the transition point between the en route phase and the
     approach phase. Plan to cross the IAF at the glide slope intercept altitude. The IAF will
     be no less than 3 miles from the Final Approach Fix (FAF).
     5.14.6.5. Final Approach Course. Plan a straight-in final approach course. If terrain,
     obstacles, or airspace prevent a straight-in final approach course, crews may use an offset
     course up to 30 degrees either side of the final approach course centerline.
     5.14.6.6. FAF. The FAF is defined as the glideslope intercept point. The distance is
     based on the distance from the Touch Down Zone (TDZ). The before landing checklist
     will be completed prior to the FAF.
     5.14.6.7. Glide Slope. Final approach glide slope will be between 2.5 and 5 degrees. (T-
     2)
     5.14.6.8. Required Calls.
        5.14.6.8.1. Pilot Not Flying: In addition to normal calls, the PNF will announce the
        following calls on LZAPs: “IAF” at the IAF, “FAF” at the FAF, each 1.0 mile
        increment inside the FAF, “100 above” when 100 ft above MDA, “Minimums” at
        MDA, “Runway in sight” when runway is in sight and aircraft is in a position to
        execute a safe landing, “Go-around” at or below MDA or at the Missed Approach
        Point (MAP) and runway environment is not in sight or the aircraft is not in a position
        to execute a safe landing. (T-2)
        5.14.6.8.2. Loadmaster. In addition to normal calls, the loadmaster will announce the
        preplanned glide slope MSL altitude at each 1.0 mile increment from the FAF until
        the MDA immediately after the PNF makes the distance remaining to TDZ call. (T-2)
        5.14.6.8.3. Pilot Flying: In addition to normal calls, the PF will reference the
        altimeter and acknowledge the preplanned glide slope MSL altitude call made by the
        Loadmaster. If within 100’ of preplanned glide slope altitude, announce “On glide
        slope”. If outside of 100’ of preplanned altitude, announce the deviation by stating
        “Below/Above glide slope” and take corrective action. (T-2)
     5.14.6.9. Touchdown Zone (TDZ). The TDZ is defined as the coordinates at the front of
     the touchdown zone.
     5.14.6.10. MDA. To compute an MDA, add 500 ft to the Touchdown Zone Elevation
     (TDZE). Do not descend below the MDA unless the LZ is in sight and in a safe position
     to land. If the LZ is not in sight, level-off and proceed to the MAP. If the runway
     becomes visible while proceeding to the MAP and in a safe position to land, execute a
     landing. (T-2)
     5.14.6.11. MAP. The MAP is at the zero distance to go point on the mileage remaining
     to the TDZ. Upon reaching the MAP, execute the missed approach procedures. (T-2)
     5.14.6.12. Missed Approach Course. The missed approach course will be designed to
     track a direction that provides the most appropriate terrain, obstacle, or airspace
 24                                                       AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


       avoidance. Plan to return to the published 25 mile Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA)
       altitude and return to IAF. (T-2)
       5.14.6.13. Obstacle Analysis.
           5.14.6.13.1. Significant obstacles. Significant obstacles are those within 300 ft of the
           desired glide slope. Crews will brief the location of all significant obstacles located
           within the horizontal template. (T-2)
           5.14.6.13.2. Critical Obstacles. An obstacle is considered critical if it falls above the
           reference line for the planned glide slope or its extension along the depicted baseline.
           (T-2)
           5.14.6.13.3. For each critical obstacle identified, preplan and brief a specific means
           of avoidance to be used during the approach. The following examples may be used
           separately or in combination: (T-2)
               5.14.6.13.3.1. Use a steeper glide slope. Glide slopes exceeding 4.0 degrees
               should be carefully considered due to the high rate of descent required.
               5.14.6.13.3.2. Move the touchdown point further down the runway.
               5.14.6.13.3.3. Increase MDA.
               5.14.6.13.3.4. Establish intermediate step-down altitude above the MDA at which
               the aircraft will level off until a positive separation from the obstacle is assured.
5.15. Terminal Area Landing Procedures.
   5.15.1. Initial Approach. When pre-mission intelligence requirements are not satisfied for
   LZs, additional maneuvering and reconnaissance may be required to accomplish a safe
   landing. Perform reconnaissance maneuvering with approach flaps. Note: If the PF
   determines that the actual touchdown point is going to be different than what was briefed, the
   PF must verbalize the updated touchdown point.
   5.15.2. Tailwind takeoff and landing operations at short, austere LZs are discouraged and, if
   necessary for mission requirements, limited to the absolute minimum required.
   5.15.3. Do not land if the LZ is not properly identified or an abort signal is given. (T-2)
   5.15.4. Brief the ground party and subsequent aircrews on any unexpected hazards
   encountered during takeoff or landing.
   5.15.5. If landing clearance or go-around signals are to be given via radio, two-way
   communications with the reception committee must be established prior to landing. If
   communications out procedures are used, presence of a pre-briefed signal constitutes
   clearance to land. A signal must be pre-briefed to direct a go-around. Radio clearance to
   land is the primary method when more than one aircraft is using the LZ. (T-2)
5.16. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military
and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and
are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this
critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to
stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                               25


  5.16.1. The following criteria apply to all approaches:
     5.16.1.1. At 1000 ft AGL:
         5.16.1.1.1. Aircraft is in approach configuration. Circling configuration is acceptable
         for circling approaches. Note: In those cases where VFR traffic pattern is 1,000 ft
         AGL (as opposed to 1,500 ft), the aircraft will be configured for landing prior to
         commencing the base turn to final.
         5.16.1.1.2. Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions.
         5.16.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1000 fpm. Note: Under certain conditions
         (WX, Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs and Tactical Approaches may require greater
         than a 1000 fpm descent rate.
             5.16.1.1.3.1. Non-Precision Approaches. Pilots should calculate a constant
             descent gradient profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-217,
             Vol 1, Instrument Flight Procedures). This is considered the safest profile and
             should be used to the max extent possible. During a go-around, ensure descent
             below the MDA does not occur.
         5.16.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete unless contrary to TO guidance.
         5.16.1.1.5. Aircraft is on the correct track.
         5.16.1.1.6. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track for
         instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
         5.16.1.1.7. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
         5.16.1.1.8. If these criteria are not met by 1,000 ft AGL, the pilot monitoring (PM)
         will announce the deviation and the PF will take immediate corrective action. PM
         states “1,000 xxxx,” where “xxxx” equates to a concise description of the unstable
         characteristic(s) which clearly relay to the PF what actions are required to return the
         aircraft to a stable platform. Examples: “1,000, fast,” or “1,000, half dot low”. If
         criteria are met, PM will simply state “1,000.”
     5.16.1.2. From 500 AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
     announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
     for stable approach are met, the PM will state “500.”
         5.16.1.2.1. Parameters are the same as those at 1,000 ft AGL.
         5.16.1.2.2. If unstable at 500 ft crews should perform a go-around.
     5.16.1.3. From 300 ft AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
     announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
     for stable approach are met, the PM will state “300 ft, Stable.”
         5.16.1.3.1. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as:
             5.16.1.3.1.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 KIAS from target.
             5.16.1.3.1.2. Bank Angle: ± 15°.
             5.16.1.3.1.3. Rate of Descent: ± 300 fpm from target.
 26                                                       AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


5.17. NVG Operations.
   5.17.1. Aircrews may land at an LZ marked with any AMP configuration provided the pilots
   define identifiable touchdown and go-around points (e.g., visual point/location, timing past
   intended landing point, etc.) prior to landing. (T-2)
   5.17.2. AMP-3 markings will consist of a box marked by four lights at the corners of the
   touchdown zone and a strobe will mark the end of the usable LZ surface or distance. The
   box width of the markings should be the width of the LZ up to 60 ft maximum. The box
   length should be 300 ft for both short field and non-short field procedures. (T-2)
   5.17.3. AMP-4 landings will have a clearly defined intended point of landing. (T-2)
   5.17.4. A STS controller (or qualified equivalent) or an active control tower is required to
   conduct NVG landings at unlit or covertly marked landing zones or airfields. (T-2)
      5.17.4.1. Squadron qualified landing zone safety officers (LZSO) may accomplish these
      duties IAW AFI 13-217. (T-2)
5.18. Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Requirements. ARFF requirements at non-
USAF active flying bases are as follows:
   5.18.1. Up to eight takeoffs and landings within four consecutive days may be accomplished
   at a LZ or airfield without ARFF equipment or local established aircraft incident procedures.
   Each flying squadron will track airfield usage to ensure this requirement is met. OG/CC or
   COMAFSOF is waiver authority for more frequent flight operations at these locations. (T-2)
   5.18.2. Refer to AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Exercises and Contingency
   Response Operations, to calculate ARFF requirements. Non-USAF ARFF vehicles may be
   used if the agent and pumping capabilities are equivalent.
   5.18.3. Waivers to the ARFF requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   Required information for waiver request can be found in AFPAM 32-2004.
   5.18.4. The squadron commander may authorize operations at training LZs and local
   airfields that do not possess local ARFF services. (T-2)
5.19. Reverse Taxi. CAUTION: Using brakes to stop the aircraft while reverse taxiing may
result in aircraft empennage contacting the ground.
   5.19.1. The pilot performing reverse taxi operations will coordinate reverse taxi directions
   and signals to be used with the marshaller (if applicable) and loadmaster prior to
   commencing reverse taxi operations. (T-2)
      5.19.1.1. The loadmaster or another crew member will be in a position to direct reverse
      taxi, report any hazards and provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns,
      distance remaining, condition of the maneuvering area, and stopping point. (T-2)
      WARNING: Ensure the aircraft is depressurized prior to opening the crew door. (T-2)
   5.19.2. During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot will ensure visibility in the taxi area is
   sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations. (T-2)
   5.19.3. Stop no less than 25 ft from an obstruction even if using a wing walker. (T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                   27


   5.19.4. Secure all cargo and ensure passengers are seated prior to reverse taxi operations. (T-
   2)
5.20. Aircraft Maximum Operating Weight Policy. Waiver authority for operations above
the maximum ramp, takeoff, or landing weights listed in the aircraft AOH is OG/CC or
COMAFSOF. Waivers will be forwarded to HQ AFSOC/A3V for tracking purposes. (T-2)
5.21. Operations Over Arresting Cables. Do not roll over arresting cables at high speed
during taxi, takeoff, or landing to preclude damage to bottom of aircraft. (T-2)  CAUTION:
Do not taxi over raised arresting cables when the gravel guard is installed on the nosewheel.
Raised runway barriers are elevated above the runway surface using rubber "doughnuts".(T-2)
5.22. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi. Ground crews using
appropriate equipment will normally recover the aircraft. Aircrews may recover the aircraft at
austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the
surface will support the aircraft. (T-2)
5.23. Inter. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the runway. The decision to
make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the aircraft commander. Base TOLD computations
on the runway remaining at the point the takeoff is initiated. (T-2)
5.24. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO).
   5.24.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or
   cargo. Comply with all AOH limitations and checklists. (T-2)
   5.24.2. General Procedures:
       5.24.2.1. The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
       specific crew member duties. (T-2)
       5.24.2.2. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, and weight and balance for the
       subsequent sortie if passengers or cargo are onloaded or downloaded. (T-2)
       5.24.2.3. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the crew may remove all tie-downs
       except one forward and one aft restraint. Remove remaining restraints only after the
       aircraft is stopped. (T-2)
       5.24.2.4. The loadmaster will direct all onloading or offloading operations using pre-
       briefed signals. Other qualified crew members may assist the operation; however, the
       PIC and loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation. (T-2)
       5.24.2.5. Passengers will be escorted by the loadmaster when enplaning or deplaning. (T-

6.8. Intelligence Briefing. Before departing on missions outside the United States, crews will
receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and
military development in the area in which they will be operating. In theater, aircrews should
receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location, or en route stop,
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                 31


and thereafter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible intelligence
value to the local intelligence officers at the completion of each mission. (T-2)
6.9. Classified Material. Obtain and safeguard classified materials required for the mission.
The communications security (COMSEC) material required depends on the theater of operation
and user.
6.10. International Procedures. The PIC will review the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) and
brief crew members on applicable items before flights outside the CONUS. Comply with all
country over flight and landing diplomatic clearances, as well as customs, immigration,
agriculture, immunization, and quarantine requirements. The unit dispatching the mission is
responsible for coordinating diplomatic clearance approval and other special clearances when
required. (T-2)

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.11. Briefing Requirements. Briefings should be clear, concise, and designed to provide
mission essential information. The PIC will ensure their crews receive a briefing, prior to each
mission, covering all specific areas to be accomplished. (T-2)
   6.11.1. Aircraft commanders will brief the planned profile to the flight authorization
   authenticating official and submit documentation the day prior to the flight. On missions that
   are scheduled to span several days, the entire profile will be briefed prior to departure. Any
   changes to the briefed profile after departure, including (but not limited to) weather changes
   that require filing of an alternate not already planned and briefed or maintenance issues that
   degrade the performance of the aircraft, will be discussed with the authenticating official
   prior to subsequent departure. This discussion will ensure the risks associated with the
   modified profile are fully understood by the aircraft commander and operations supervisors
   as well as to establish a dialogue regarding appropriate levels of risk mitigation. (T-2)
   6.11.2. Passenger Briefings. Prior to each flight, the loadmaster will ensure that all
   passengers are briefed. When more than one flight is accomplished by the same crew and
   passengers, subsequent briefings are not required, except to brief route information, mission
   changes, etc. When additional passengers are added, brief them completely. (T-2)
6.12. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Review Volume I, Part A, of the FCIF before all
missions.
   6.12.1. Crew members will use Patriot Excalibur (PEX) to review and sign FCIFs and Read
   Files. When unable to complete electronic FCIF review procedures, initialing and numbering
   the latest FCIF by an individual’s name on the flight authorization order certifies the FCIF
   currency review of all items are complete. (T-2)
   6.12.2. PIC will ensure any crew members joining a mission en route receive an FCIF
   update. Instructor pilots who fly with senior officers are responsible for briefing FCIF items.
   (T-2)
   6.12.3. Crew members not assigned or attached to the squadron will certify FCIF review by
   entering the last FCIF number and their initials next to their name on the file copy of the
   flight authorization orders. (T-2)
 32                                                        AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


6.13. Flight Planning Systems. The primary flight/mission planning system is PFPS.
Upgraded or new versions of flight planning systems will be released and authorized by the HQ
AFSOC/A3 for use after applicable testing has been completed. (T-2)
6.14. Coordinates. Aircrew will confirm a common datum with their mission users during the
mission planning process. Failure to plan navigation to LZ or mission areas using a common
datum may result in errors of up to several miles. Computer based mission planning systems and
aircraft navigational systems generally use WGS84 as reference datum. Attempt to use WGS84
whenever possible to minimize confusion. (T-2)
6.15. Flight Logs. Prepare a flight log (i.e., AF IMT Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight
Log) for each off-station mission and include the following as a minimum: turn points, headings,
distances, estimated time en route (ETE), MSA, and fuel computations. A flight log is not
required if the above information is included on a flight map. (T-2)
6.16. Weather Planning. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, AFSOC Sup 1, weather minimums
unless local or theater specific weather minimums are more restrictive. (T-2)
6.17. Lunar Illumination. WARNING: NVGs worn during flights with illumination less than
10% can lead to induced motion illusions and spatial disorientation.
   6.17.1. Any mission planned when the lunar illumination is forecast to be less than 10%
   during the mission will require an additional level of Operational Risk Management (ORM),
   as determined by unit supplement. (T-2)
6.18. Fuel Planning. Use criteria outlined in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, AFSOC Sup 1. Aircrews will
conduct appropriate in-flight planning to ensure proper fuel management.         Reference
Attachment 2 for Equal Time Point (ETP) discussion and calculations. (T-2)
   6.18.1. Pilots will plan fuel consumption rates in order to optimize training or mission
   accomplishment. Crews will attempt to conserve fuel to the maximum extent possible. (T-2)
   6.18.2. Plan to arrive in the terminal area at destination or alternate (if required) with: (T-2)
       6.18.2.1. 600 lbs of fuel remaining during day VFR or night VFR conditions when using
       NVGs. (T2)
       6.18.2.2. 900 lbs of fuel remaining during night VFR conditions when not using NVGs
       or IFR conditions. (T-2)
       6.18.2.3. When two alternates are required, flight plan to the most distant alternate. (T-2)
   6.18.3. Holding Exception for Remote or Island Destinations. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3,
   AFSOC Sup 1, aircrew are authorized to hold for one hour in lieu of an alternate for remote
   or island destinations. (T-2)
   6.18.4. Land with no less than 450 pounds of fuel on board. (T-2)
   6.18.5. Plan to consume 300 lbs of fuel for each instrument approach to be flown. (T-2)
   6.18.6. Minimum Fuel is 450 pounds and Emergency Fuel is 250 pounds. Pilots will declare
   “Minimum Fuel” or “Emergency Fuel” to ATC when fuel quantity reaches the respective
   value and the aircraft has not been given an approach or landing clearance. (T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                    33


   6.18.7. Plan an additional 15 minutes of fuel per hour at a maximum cruise power fuel
   consumption rate for that portion of the flight where structural icing or thunderstorms
   requiring off-course maneuvering are forecast or reported. (T-2)
   6.18.8. For missions with extended periods over large bodies of water or desolate land areas,
   if no suitable alternate exists between the ETP and final destination, pilots will include an
   additional 10% of en route fuel to their total fuel requirements for contingencies (ex., flight at
   aircraft depressurization altitude). Waiver authority for this requirement is the OG/CC or
   COMAFSOF. (T-2)
6.19. VFR En Route Planning.
   6.19.1. Map Selection. VFR Sectional or Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC) 1:500,000 are
   required for en route VFR navigation legs and objective area planning, such as an LZ arrival.
   The VFR sectional is consulted because it is updated more frequently than the Joint
   Operations Graphic (JOG). It also provides accurate information on controlled airspace,
   major towers, airports, beacons, and power lines as well as current magnetic variation. Maps
   with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater are highly desired for objective areas. (T-2)
      6.19.1.1. Pilots will ensure all maps used for flight have the most current hazards posted.
      Aircrew will also ensure appropriate civil airspace is annotated along their route of flight.
      (T-2)
   6.19.2. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). An ESA is an altitude that will provide positive
   terrain clearance should Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) be encountered. Use
   1,000 ft (2,000 ft in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstacle or terrain feature within
   10 nm of the intended flight path/objective area. An ESA will be computed for all objective
   areas. Note: Mountainous areas are defined as having a 500 foot change in surface altitude
   over ½ nm. (T-2)
   6.19.3. MSA. An MSA is an altitude that provides VMC terrain clearance and limited threat
   avoidance during degraded aircrew situational awareness or periods of task saturation. Use
   500 ft above the highest obstacle or terrain feature within 5 nm of the intended flight
   path/objective area. An MSA will be computed for all objective areas. (T-2) WARNING:
   Failure to maintain an accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than planned
   terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed ESA/MSA.
   6.19.4. During VFR en route navigation training (outside of the terminal area), the minimum
   altitude is 1000’ AGL above the highest obstacle within 2 nm of the desired course. During
   operational and contingency missions, lower altitudes are permitted with the approval of the
   mission commander. (T-2)
   6.19.5. GPS/FMS (Flight Management System) Procedures. Aircrews may use the
   GPS/FMS for situational awareness and as a backup to visual navigation.
6.20. Objective Area Planning.
   6.20.1. A thorough review of the LZ survey and accompanying photographs, computer
   drawings, or imagery will be accomplished by all crew members during the aircrew brief.
   The PIC is responsible for ensuring that any crew member unable to attend the brief either
   reviews the landing zone survey or is briefed on the hazards associated with the LZ. Review
   the following items: (T-2)
 34                                                    AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


      6.20.1.1. For an LZ, brief the runway orientation, the run-in orientation, the LZ
      coordinates, dimensions, significant obstacles, expected surface conditions, weight
      bearing capacity, LZ markings, planned point of touchdown, go-around point, escape
      route in the event of a balked landing, and performance data for landing and for takeoff.
      (T-2)
      6.20.1.2. High quality imagery of the landing zone.       This facilitates final approach
      planning and LZ recognition.
      6.20.1.3. Moisture at the LZ or any other meteorological elements that might affect
      landing surface weight bearing capability.
6.21. Aircraft Performance.
   6.21.1. Weight and Balance. A copy of each mission’s weight and balance will be
   maintained at the squadron or operations center (as applicable) and carried with the aircrew.
   For en route stops, weight and balance need not be recomputed provided the zero fuel weight
   has not changed. Weight and balance computations will be briefed during the crew or
   mission brief or during flight, as required. (T-2)
   6.21.2. TOLD. Compute TOLD using the AOH performance data charts or approved
   tabulated data. Compute TOLD for initial takeoff prior to engine start. Recompute data for
   pressure altitude changes of 500 ft, temperature changes of 5° Celsius (C), or gross weight
   changes of 500 lbs. (T-2)
      6.21.2.1. Options for calculating TOLD are in priority order:
      6.21.2.2. Option 1: Use 1.2 Variable V2 (KVS) and a V1/VR of 1.0.
      6.21.2.3. Option 2: If the runway length is limiting and climb gradient is not a factor,
      use 1.13 KVS and V1/VR of 1.0.
      6.21.2.4. Option 3: Use TOLD calculations to find an optimized KVS and V1/VR
      combination. Note: All qualified MPs and MCs may perform takeoffs and landings
      using Options 1-3.
      6.21.2.5. Option 4: Use short field performance planning data. Note: Only short field
      certified MPs may perform takeoffs or landings when using Option 4.
      6.21.2.6. If none of these options offer suitable TOLD values for the given field length
      and conditions, consider reducing gross weight or delaying the mission until
      environmental conditions allow for use of one of the above 4 options.
   6.21.3. Computed Engine Out Service Ceiling. The computed engine out service ceiling will
   not be below the published Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) on IFR flights or planned VFR
   cruising altitude for VFR flights unless the following requirements are met: (T-2)
      6.21.3.1. The forecast weather for each critical route segment, as defined in Paragraph
      6.21.3, is day VMC allowing a VFR descent to a safe VFR altitude during an emergency,
      and; crews have planned emergency routes to emergency airfields on VFR charts
      (1:500,000 or larger) for the critical route segments, or;
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                  35


      6.21.3.2. Single engine drift down performance from the planned cruise altitude provides
      the opportunity to remain above the MIA until reaching a sector with a lower MIA and
      then safely continue to an emergency airfield.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.22. Aircraft Maintenance Forms.
   6.22.1. Review the aircraft maintenance forms before applying power to the aircraft or
   operating aircraft systems. (T-2)
   6.22.2. Ensure that the USAF fuel card and/or other authorized method of payment are on
   board the aircraft. The Air Card is used to pay for services such as aviation fuel, aircraft oil
   and fluids, minor maintenance items, landing fees, aircraft de-icing, follow-me trucks and
   other airfield related services at commercial FBO locations. The PIC is responsible for
   ensuring the receipt is correct and all appropriate signatures are obtained before departing the
   military base, airport, or FBO. The PIC is responsible for turning in all service receipts to
   maintenance upon return to home station. If services does not generate a receipt, the PIC will
   ensure the location and services performed are noted and relayed to maintenance. (T-2)
   6.22.3. The aircraft preflight or exceptional release (if applicable) must be signed before
   flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized contract civilian
   will sign the preflight or exceptional release. (T-2)
   6.22.4. Ensure that aircraft locking keys are in aircraft maintenance forms prior to takeoff.
   (T-2)
   6.22.5. Ensure the aircraft protective covers are on board aircraft prior to flight. (T-2)
6.23. Aircraft Inspections and Ground Operations.
   6.23.1. The aircraft commander will review the forms and conduct an exterior inspection.

   exterior inspection according to the AOH. (T-2)
   6.23.2. The copilot will complete the Cockpit Preparation Checklist in accordance with the
   AOH expanded checklist. (T-2)
   6.23.3. The loadmaster will check the mission circuit breakers, Blue Force Tracker (BFT),
   PRC-117G (load radio mission plan, load crypto, conduct Line of Sight [LOS] and Satellite
   Communications [SATCOM] checks on Portable Radio Communicator [PRC] #1 and #2),
   Audio Control Panel (ACP) #5 and #6, and check the laptop mission computer GPS moving
   map is operational. Coordinate with the copilot for loading the crypto fills into the Airborne
   Radio Communicator (ARC)-231. (T-2)
   6.23.4. Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Operations. Anytime the APU is running, at least one
   crew member or maintainer will remain within the immediate vicinity of the APU fire
   suppression control panel in order to adequately hear the APU fire bell. The immediate
   vicinity is considered anywhere inside the cockpit/cabin or a radius of 15 ft from the external
   APU control panel. If it is necessary to leave the immediate vicinity of the APU control
   panels, shutdown the APU prior to leaving. (T-2)
 36                                                      AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


       6.23.4.1. Crew members will wear hearing protection when operating aft of the 3-9 line
       while the APU is operating. The loadmaster will also offer hearing protection to
       passengers required to assist in loading/unloading baggage while the APU is running.
       The loadmaster will ensure adequate hearing protection is stored onboard the aircraft. (T-
       2)
   6.23.5. During higher headquarters directed exercises or contingency operations, any
   qualified aircrew may accomplish the preflight inspection and brief the oncoming aircrew.
6.24. Required Equipment. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a
mission rests with the PIC. If one PIC accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission
segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that PIC, or a different PIC,
to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative. If the PIC elects to operate
with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission requirements prior to flight
with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on
missions. (T-2)
6.25. Required Forms. Aircraft should contain an appropriate and current airworthiness
certificate, effective registration certificate, appropriate Weight and Balance information, and
applicable maintenance forms.
6.26. Alert Aircraft Procedures. To accept an aircraft on alert, complete a normal aircraft
preflight. After 72 hours on alert, allow maintenance personnel access to inspect the aircraft. (T-
2)
   6.26.1. Parking. Park the alert aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and
   takeoff.
   6.26.2. Climatic Protective Facilities. During periods of extreme cold, hot, or severe
   weather, every effort should be made to shelter alert aircraft and essential equipment in a
   hangar to ensure operational readiness in the event of a mission.
   6.26.3. Flying Alert Aircraft. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual
   alert missions provided the following conditions are complied with: (T-2)
       6.26.3.1. Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet mission requirements. If not,
       upon flight completion, refuel the aircraft to required alert fuel quantity.
       6.26.3.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agencies.
       6.26.3.3. A qualified (for the alert mission) aircrew is on board.
       6.26.3.4. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local
       area.
   6.26.4. Once accepted for alert, the alert aircrew will make an entry in the aircraft
   maintenance forms, stating, “Aircraft accepted on alert at _____.” (zulu time and date). No
   maintenance may be performed on it without prior approval of the alert crew PIC and
   notification of the squadron Director of Ops (DO) or deployed MC. To ensure integrity of
   the aircrew preflight, an alert crew member must be present whenever maintenance is
   performed, or at the completion of the maintenance, the aircrew is required to check the area
   in which maintenance was performed. The check should be performed as soon as practical
   after the maintenance and must be performed prior to flight.
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                    37


6.27. Aircraft Servicing.
   6.27.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew qualified in refueling operations may perform refueling
   duties at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support. Aircrews are allowed
   to add engine oil, if needed, at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support.
   (T-2)
   6.27.2. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Runs. Mixed aircrew/maintenance engine runs should
   not normally be accomplished. If conducted, the AOH or maintenance inspection procedures
   will be used. (T-2)
6.28. Life Support and Oxygen Requirements.
   6.28.1. Upon reporting to the aircraft, the PIC or designated representative will ensure
   sufficient quantities of appropriate serviceable life support, survival equipment, and
   protective clothing for the entire mission are aboard the aircraft. Verify Air Force Technical
   Order (AFTO) IMT Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, prior to departing home
   station. (T-2)
   6.28.2. When route of flight is beyond power off gliding distance from land, aircrew
   members will have Life Preserver Units sized and immediately available at the aircrew
   member’s duty station while flying over water. Passengers will have life preservers available
   and will be worn at the discretion of the PIC. Life rafts will be available to accommodate all
   personnel on board. Life rafts and life preservers are not required when overwater flight
   occurs during instrument approach procedures under ATC control, immediately after takeoff,
   and before landing. (T-2)
   6.28.3. Anti-exposure suits for the aircrew will be readily available during any preplanned
   overwater flights which are beyond power off gliding distance from land and the water
   temperature is 60° Fahrenheit (F)/(16°C) or less. (T-2)
   6.28.4. Oxygen requirements are outlined in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, AFSOC Sup 1.
   6.28.5. Eye Protection. Eye protection will be used during refueling operations. (T-2)
6.29. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.29.1. The flight deck area will be kept as uncluttered and orderly as possible for all flight
   and ground operations. Specifically: (T-2)
       6.29.1.1. During engine start and ground operations, no items (checklist, charts, etc.)
       should be placed in a position that would prevent inspection of aircraft and engine
       instruments or switches.
       6.29.1.2. During flight, no items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed in a position that
       covers or hides any flight or engine instruments from the view of the PF.
       6.29.1.3. Publication kits, flight kits, and personal kits will not be placed where they may
       interfere with the flight controls or egress.
       6.29.1.4. Drinking containers with liquids are not permitted in the cockpit unless covered
       with a lid.
6.30. Preparation for Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Operations. Cockpit and cabin lights
may be taped or covered with NVG compatible film if they will interfere with NVG operations
 38                                                       AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


and cannot be otherwise disabled without removing aircraft power (e.g., pulling circuit breakers).
Landing gear indicators will not be covered with tape. (T-2)

Section 6D—Departure

6.31. Departure Briefing. Before initial takeoff, the PF will brief the aircrew on the procedures
to be followed during takeoff and departure, performance data, and intentions in case of an
emergency. (T-2)
6.32. On Time Takeoffs and Landings. Mission departures are considered “on time” if the
aircraft is airborne no later than +30/-15, landing is +/-15 hours after the scheduled takeoff time.
Early departures are authorized provided local, down range and aircrew impact are evaluated and
no adverse effect will result. (T-3)

Section 6E—En Route

6.33. En Route Briefings. Conduct in-flight briefings, as necessary, to cover any unusual
circumstances and when flight safety or other conditions require the nonstandard
accomplishment of any maneuver. (T-2)
6.34. Flight Progress. Use all available navigation aids to maintain course centerline and a
positive fix on the aircraft’s position. When conducting navigation using a GPS for primary
navigation or autopilot flight coupling, the pilots will also use appropriate navigation aids (e.g.,
VHF Omnidirectional Range [VOR]) to maintain a positive fix on the aircraft’s position and
back up the GPS. (T-2)
6.35. In-Flight Crew Duties and Responsibilities.
   6.35.1. Change of Aircraft Control. The change of aircraft or flight controls will be
   accomplished using a positive change of controls. Use the statement “Pilot/Copilot has
   controls” to transfer control. The other pilot will acknowledge the change of aircraft control
   by stating “Pilot/Copilot has controls”. (T-2)
       6.35.1.1. During approach briefings the PF should transfer aircraft control and the radios
       to the PNF. Transferring the autopilot is not necessary.
   6.35.2. Interphone Communications. Limit interphone conversations to those essential for
   crew coordination. Do not discuss classified information on interphone during radio
   transmissions.
       6.35.2.1. All crew members will monitor aircraft interphone prior to engine start.
       Clearance is required from the PIC prior to an aircrew member removing headset. The
       aircrew member will advise the PIC when they have resumed monitoring the aircraft
       interphone. (T-2)
   6.35.3. Radio Communication. A thorough pre-brief should be accomplished by the aircraft
   commander to specify who is in control of which radio during all phases of flight. Aircrew
   will be specific when transferring control of radios in flight. (T-2)
       6.35.3.1. Record and read back all ATC clearances except when ATC instructions
       require immediate execution and read back would interfere with the timely performance
       of aircrew duties.
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                   39


6.36. Communication Instructions for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings (CIRVIS) and
Other Reports. Refer to AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Report all vital intelligence
sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP Planning or Flight Information Handbook (FIH). (T-
2)
6.37. In-Flight Emergency (IFE) Procedures. Report deviations from directives that occur as
a result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, AFSOC Sup 1, and this instruction.
   6.37.1. During an emergency situation, the pilot flying will continue to fly the aircraft. The
   AC may take control of the aircraft if the situation dictates. The aircraft commander will
   assign specific duties based on the situation. The AC will conduct the emergency landing
   unless conditions do not permit. (T2)
   6.37.2. The PNF should be the primary crew member responsible for executing emergency
   checklist procedures. The PF maintains aircraft control and calls for appropriate critical
   action procedures and checklists. The PF will confirm any switches or levers prior to being
   actuated and will reference the Emergency/Abnormal Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) for
   guidance during the emergency. The PNF or Loadmaster (LM) should review the AOH as
   appropriate and as time permits. (T-2)
   6.37.3. The loadmaster will backup the PNF with the QRH checklist reading/actions as
   directed, visual confirmation of the memory items, and scanning of engines/passenger
   compartment. During engine shutdown procedures, the aircraft commander may direct the
   loadmaster to perform a visual scan of the engine and inform the pilots when/if the engine
   shuts down correctly (i.e., “Number 1 scans clear, standing tall”). Any abnormalities to
   include fluid leaks, smoke, fire, or damage will be verbalized to the pilots. (T-2)
   6.37.4. During any emergency procedure, the aircraft commander may direct the loadmaster
   to reposition from the jump seat to another location on the aircraft to perform duties.
       6.37.4.1. The loadmaster is the primary crew member responsible for fighting fires in the
       cabin/cargo area. (T-2)
       6.37.4.2. If necessary, the loadmaster will assist passengers in an emergency situation
       (i.e., oxygen masks, evacuation, etc.) and maintain general order in the cabin. (T-2)
   6.37.5. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the
   aircraft emergency procedure checklist or critical action procedures, furnish the controlling
   agency a description and extent of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any
   further pertinent information.
   6.37.6. Turnaround Procedures. When a turnaround is necessary, use procedures in FLIP.
   Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request
   ATC clearance. If unable to maintain VFR, obtain an ATC clearance before reversing
   course. A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, will be made only after a
   thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known
   traffic operating in the immediate area. Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change
   in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level will result in minimum exposure to other aircraft,
   if a turnaround is required.
   6.37.7. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical
   care, the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical
 40                                                       AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


   personnel may meet the aircraft. The request will include the individual‘s gender,
   approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem. (T-2)

Section 6F—Arrival

6.38. Arrival. Before starting each approach, the PF will brief the procedures to be followed
during approach, landing, and go-around/missed approach, as necessary. Performance data will
be reviewed. This briefing should be accomplished prior to the completion of the Before
Landing Checklist. (T-2)
6.39. Go-Around Calls. If any crew member calls “Go-around”, the PF will immediately apply
power to establish a climb that clears all obstacles. Minimum altitude for overflight of aircraft,
equipment, or personnel on the runway is 500 ft AGL. (T-2)

Section 6G—After Landing

6.40. Maintenance and Bed Down. Complete aircraft maintenance forms after each flight.
   6.40.1. Immediately after arrival, the PIC and any aircrew member documenting a
   maintenance discrepancy will debrief maintenance personnel on the status of the aircraft and
   subsystems. The PIC or aircrew member noting a discrepancy will document the problem in
   the aircraft maintenance forms. At locations where there is no maintenance personnel and
   maintenance support is required, the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the
   MC or command post prior to entering crew rest. (T-2)
   6.40.2. The loadmaster will perform servicing when maintenance personnel are not
   available. When executing refueling operations, loadmasters will wear gloves and eye
   protection. (T-2)
   6.40.3. All crew members will ensure the aircraft is clean, stow publications, deposit trash in
   proper receptacles, and account for all personal equipment before leaving the aircraft. (T-2)
   6.40.4. The AC and the LM will complete a post mission walk around to determine any
   changes from their pre-mission inspection ( i.e., bird strike). (T-2)
6.41. Classified Material. Turn in classified materials at destination (if applicable) and obtain
receipts for classified material. At locations where no storage facilities exist, the PIC will ensure
classified material is properly protected. Refer to AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
Management, for further information about storing of classified on the aircraft. (T-2)
   6.41.1. Mission Radios. Do not leave the aircraft unattended with crypto loaded into the
   mission radios. The aircraft commander is ultimately responsible for ensuring the radios are
   zeroized prior to leaving the aircraft. (T-2)
       6.41.1.1. If the aircrew is going to leave the aircraft unattended for any period of time,
       remove the CIK (Crypto Ignition Key) from the Secure Key Loader (SKL) and lock the
       SKL in the lockbox on the mission radio rack. Ensure all entry points to the aircraft are
       locked as well. The copilot will maintain positive control of the CIK for the duration of
       the period away from the aircraft. If available, the CIK may be stored in an approved
       COMSEC storage location (i.e., Command Post). (T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                    41


   6.41.2. Remove/Zeroize any potential or classified information in the FMS, aircraft radios,
   or mission systems/software when not required for flight or continuous mission operations.
   The PIC is responsible for all classified materials. (T-2)
   6.41.3. In an emergency, destroy or damage classified material and equipment prior to crash
   landing if possible. (T-2)
6.42. Aircraft Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a ground or in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately and contact the squadron CC, DO, MC or
appropriate controlling agency for further instructions.
6.43. Clearwater Rinse Facility (Birdbath). If directed by aircraft maintenance personnel,
aircrews may use Clearwater Rinse facilities in order to prevent damage to the aircraft.
   6.43.1. An entry will be placed in the aircraft maintenance forms, “Aircraft Subjected to Salt
   Spray” anytime the aircraft is flown over salt water below 1,000 ft AGL, except for takeoffs
   and landings. Document the lowest altitude and duration the aircraft was subjected to salt
   spray. (T-2)
6.44. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections.
   6.44.1. Complete customs, agriculture, and public health clearance forms, as required, prior
   to opening any doors other than the crew door or enplaning and deplaning personnel. (T-2)
   6.44.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to customs, immigration, or agricultural inspection
   for processing at those stations where federal or local inspections are required. The PIC or
   designated representative should complete the necessary forms before reporting to inspectors.
   (T-2)
   6.44.3. After clearing with border clearance agencies, the PIC or designated representative
   will return to the aircraft for offloading and other post-flight procedures. (T-2)
   6.44.4. A US military aircraft is a sovereign instrument. When cleared to over-fly or land in
   foreign territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges
   and immunities which customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities
   include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
   immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections);
   or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or
   cargo on board. The PIC will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises
   of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or
   the American Embassy in the country concerned. (T-2)
   6.44.5. PIC will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any foreign
   government. If requested to do so, the PIC and crew will deny access and seek aid from the
   senior AFSOC or USAF representative or US Embassy or consulate within the host nation.
   Inform customs or other officials of the above policy and request that they confirm their
   request through their own government and with US Department of State representatives. If
   necessary, the aircrew will seal the aircraft and enter into crew rest, and relay departure
   intentions, until resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Use communications by
   the fastest means available to inform command and control facilities should this situation
   occur. (T-1)
 42                                                     AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


   6.44.6. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
   consider the following procedures:
      6.44.6.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of the PIC to the
      foreign officials that the aircraft is a sovereign instrument not subject to search without
      consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be
      clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may
      honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. (T-2)
      6.44.6.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate to
      delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/A3OFN or the appropriate
      embassy (US or other friendly nation). The PIC should unequivocally state, the aircrew
      has no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the foreign request to
      these agencies for decision. The PIC should then notify these agencies of the foreign
      request by the most expeditious means available. Thereafter, the PIC should follow
      instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF. (T-2)
      6.44.6.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should
      indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical
      considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission for immediate departure.
      (T-2)
      6.44.6.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way
      on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action being
      pursued and that he intends to notify both HQ USAF and the US Embassy of the foreign
      action. The PIC should then allow the foreign agents on board the aircraft, without
      physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and the US Embassy
      as soon as possible. (T-2)
   6.44.7. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or
   equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the
   foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable. (T-2)
6.45. Crew Debriefing/Post-Mission Actions.
   6.45.1. Training Missions. The PIC will conduct the debriefing session and complete the
   appropriate documentation. The PIC will ensure all applicable information is passed to
   controlling agencies. (T-2)
   6.45.2. Combat Operations. Each aircrew participating in operations under actual combat
   conditions will participate in an intelligence and mission debriefing session. (T-2)
   6.45.3. The squadron CC or MC will ensure that all aircrews are debriefed immediately
   following a combat or combat support mission during which any tactics or procedures were
   observed that may affect other operations. (T-2)
   6.45.4. Crews encountering hostile fire will submit an immediate airborne report to their
   controlling agency followed by a hostile fire incident report to intelligence immediately after
   landing. (T-2)
   6.45.5. Other Missions. The PIC has the responsibility of affording each crew member the
   opportunity to discuss unusual aspects of the mission. Debriefings may be formal or
   informal, as the situation requires. (T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                 43


   6.45.6. When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a point of contact with the base
   operations or FBO for overnight billeting. The PIC will be immediately notified in the case
   of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft. (T-2)

Section 6H—Miscellaneous

6.46. Electronic Devices. The use of electronic devices is as specified in AFI 11-202, Vol 3,
AFSOC Sup 1. For electronic devices not listed, the user will provide the aircrew a letter from
the Aeronautical Systems Division, Deputy for Engineering (ASC/ENAE) certifying the device
is approved for airborne use. If the aircrew detects any interference from an electronic device
used aboard the aircraft, discontinue the use of this device for the duration of the flight. (T-2)
6.47. Jamming and Interference. All aircrews and other radio users must be familiar with the
procedures for reporting incidents of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference (MIJI) or
Spectrum Interference (SI). Info copy HQ AFSOC/A3V on all MIJI/SI reports. (T-2)
6.48. Passenger Guidance. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria
for passenger movement on DOD aircraft. AFI 11-401, AFSOC Sup 1, provides further
guidance on orientation and public affairs travel. Refer to these publications directly. In all
cases, passengers will be manifested on DD Form 2131. (T-2)
   6.48.1. During spouse orientation flights, spouses will not fly together on the same aircraft.
   (T-2)
   6.48.2. Space-required. The OG/CC or COMAFSOF will determine and approve eligibility
   for all space required categories. Reference AFI 11-401, AFSOC Sup 1, for more
   information. (T-2)
6.49. Utilization of Civilian Law Enforcement or Medical Personnel. Generally, before
transporting civilian law enforcement officials or civilian medical personnel, obtain proper
authorization through OG/CC or COMAFSOF. (T-2)
6.50. Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Procedures. The term “hazardous material” includes
any material, which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life
or property. Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DOD Hazard
Class/Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 explosives, Department of Transportation (DOT) Class A and B
poisons, etiological or biological research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III
labels, and inert devices. Also included are DOD Hazard Class/Division 1.4 explosives,
oxidizers, compressed gases, flammable solids and liquids, and corrosive liquids listed in
AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment. (T-2)
   6.50.1. Briefing. Reference AFMAN 24-204(I).
   6.50.2. Cargo Documentation.        Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes

     6.50.3.1. Enters “Hazardous Cargo” in the appropriate section of the flight plan. Use
     remarks section of DD Form 175, information section of DD Form 1801, or ICAO Flight
     Plan Form.
     6.50.3.2. Plans the flight to minimize over-flying heavily populated or otherwise critical
     areas.
     6.50.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message
     should include the following:
         6.50.3.3.1. DOT class and DOD hazard class or division, if applicable, of hazardous
         material on board (include net weight of DOT Class A or B poisons and net explosive
         weight of Class A or B explosives).
         6.50.3.3.2. Request for special support (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical
         escort teams, etc.).
         6.50.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
     6.50.3.4. If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely receipt at
     destination, notify base operations at the first intended landing, by priority telephone.
  6.50.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency
  parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify that the firefighting agency has
  the hazardous materials information. If not, request the following be relayed to the
  firefighting agency: (T-2)
     6.50.4.1. DOT class of hazardous material on board and the DOD hazard class or
     division for explosive material on board.
     6.50.4.2. Net Explosive Weight.
     6.50.4.3. Request for isolated parking (if necessary).
     6.50.4.4. Estimated time of departure.
  6.50.5. En Route. Normal procedures apply.         Avoid flying over heavily populated or
  otherwise critical areas. (T-2)
  6.50.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the
  theater commander or FLIP planning: (T-2)
     6.50.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or
     other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to
     announce that hazardous materials are on board and to verify that the appropriate base
     support agencies have received the departure message. If not, transmit the ETA and
     pertinent HAZMAT information.
     6.50.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the previous
     information to the nearest Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight service station.
     6.50.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil
     airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support agencies.
  6.50.7. Parking: (T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                              45


      6.50.7.1. DOD requires aircraft carrying DOD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
      explosives, DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked
      in areas isolated from personnel. PIC’s are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly
      identified to the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated
      area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control. When identification is
      acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host
      procedures be questionable, submit trip reports, as appropriate, to document such
      occurrences.
      6.50.7.2. The military host is responsible for ensuring aircraft are properly placarded.
      For non-military installations, the briefing to the PIC will include placard requirements
      and, if required, placards will be furnished at the on load base. The shipper must make
      prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials
      requiring placards. The shipper is responsible for cargo identification, firefighting
      procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
   6.50.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to IFE. Transmit unclassified information to the
   appropriate air traffic control facility as follows: (T-2)
      6.50.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
      6.50.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
      6.50.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
      6.50.8.4. Fuel on board.
      6.50.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable
      information.
6.51. Hazardous Medical Equipment.
   6.51.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use AFSOC air
   evacuation services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment
   are of major concern:
      6.51.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference, and
      therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
      6.51.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
      A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
      regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.51.2. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
      6.51.2.1. Pararescue or aeromedical evacuation personnel must inform the PIC when
      nonstandard electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft. (T-2)
      6.51.2.2. The PIC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment
      during the mission. (T-2)
      6.51.2.3. The crew must be alert for any interference with aircraft communications or
      navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment. (T-2)
 46                                                     AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


       6.51.2.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
       the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
       additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
       navigational equipment. (T-2)
   6.51.3. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions: (T-2)
       6.51.3.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
       manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
       and lateral axes.
       6.51.3.2. Pararescue or aeromedical evacuation personnel must continually monitor the
       operation of the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.
6.52. Transporting Narcotics. Aircrew members will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized
items are not smuggled onboard the aircraft. Maintain narcotics that are part of official medical
kits in accordance with appropriate directives. (T-2)
6.53. Dropped Objects. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components, which could potentially be dropped objects. If a dropped
object is discovered and the mission is continued, the PIC will: (T-2)
   6.53.1. Ensure documentation is entered into the aircraft maintenance forms.
   6.53.2. Notify the controlling agency as soon as practical. Include route of flight, altitude,
   and weather conditions encountered.
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                 47


                                           Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for aircraft security on the ground and in-flight.
AFSOC C-146A aircraft are Protection Level (PL) 4 resources in CONUS and PL3 while
OCONUS. This security priority designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are
located, worldwide. Some aircraft contain equipment and documents that require protection per
DoD 5200.1, DoD Information Security Program; Vol 1-4, and AFI 31-401.
7.2. Security Procedures. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the security of their aircraft
when located away from US military installations. AFJI 31-102, Physical Security, covers
security arrangements when US Air Force aircraft are located on other US military installations.
Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US protected
locations. If US military security forces are not available, the US embassy assigned to that
country must be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made. For missions involving a
planning agency, the agency must coordinate with the PIC to ensure the planned security
measures conform to mission requirements. The amount of security required will vary,
depending on location and ground time. (T-2)
   7.2.1. For nonpermissive or uncertain environments, airfield and LZ security is the
   responsibility of the agency requesting support. Crew will work with the agency requesting
   support to insure security meets the requirement for the mission. (T-2)
   7.2.2. For permissive environments, the PIC will receive a threat assessment and force
   protection capability evaluation briefing at home station prior to departure and receive
   updates en route, if required. When landing at DOD component installations, the installation
   commander is responsible for providing adequate security for the aircraft. The PIC will
   determine if security is adequate. Planning agencies and the PIC will use Table 7.1, to help
   assess the risk to parked aircraft for planned overnight stops located at non-US military
   installations overseas and civilian airfields. Note: Aircrews possess the training to provide
   the appropriate security when present at the aircraft. For unscheduled or emergency landings
   at non-USAF installations, the PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the
   following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient: (T-2)
       7.2.2.1. Aircrew surveillance. If the aircraft is not remaining overnight, aircrews are
       capable of maintaining appropriate aircraft security. The PIC will direct armed crew
       members to remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and
       activities in the aircraft vicinity. (T-2)
       7.2.2.2. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include
       back-up response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF
       Form 15 or cash. (T-2)
       7.2.2.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or
       unavailable, the PIC may waive FDP restrictions and depart as soon as possible for a
       destination with adequate force protection. If unable to depart the location due to system
       malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case,
       will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be
       subordinate to aircraft security when the aircraft may be at risk. The PIC should rotate a
 48                                                       AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


       security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until
       relief is available. The PIC will coordinate through appropriate C2 channels to acquire
       additional security. (T-2)
       7.2.2.4. Tailored Security Measures. Standard physical security measures may be
       impractical at times due to mission, terrain, climate, sociopolitical sensitivities, or other
       factors. At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when
       necessary. As a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches. Contact with US
       Embassy personnel is required at locations where security agreements are not in
       existence. (T-2)
   7.2.3. Ground security teams. Ground security teams may be considered to guard the
   aircraft for planned overnight stops. Teams may travel in MEP status and are responsible to
   the PIC at all times. The PIC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing,
   aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate. The flying squadron commander is
   the final approval authority for the need of ground security teams for their aircraft and
   authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC. (T-2)
       7.2.3.1. Ground security teams will comply with AFMAN 24-204(I), at all times when
       carrying weapons, ammunition, and equipment onboard the aircraft. (T-2)
   7.2.4. Unauthorized Entry. At the discretion of the PIC, the aircraft should be locked and
   sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry. (T-2)
       7.2.4.1. The aircraft should be locked during all off-station missions remaining
       overnight. (T-2)
   7.2.5. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas to include aircraft wheel
   wells, air-conditioning compartments, and cargo compartment for unauthorized packages,
   personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
   Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities. (T-
   2)
7.3. Aircraft Security Risk Assessment Matrix. Planning agencies and the PIC will use this
matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment. This matrix will be
used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.
A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are
adequate. A score of 55 to 90 implies moderate security risk. The squadron or mission
commander may consider additional security measures. If the cumulative score is greater than
90, commanders should consider deploying or contracting security personnel. The squadron or
mission commander is the final approval authority for aircraft security issues. Authority may be
delegated no lower than the PIC. Exception: During unscheduled or emergency landings, the
PIC is the final approval authority for aircraft security. The PIC should contact the US Embassy
or US Defense Attaché Office (USDAO) for security assistance. Note: Normally, additional
security for the aircraft is not required at military installations within a NATO country or US
civilian airfields approved by the FAA/Transportation Security Administration (TSA). (T-2)

   7.4.1. DOD Installations. Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
   times. Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the
   installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available. (T-2)
   7.4.2. Non-DOD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
   arrange for force protection. (T-2)
7.5. Arming of Crew Members. The squadron CC, DO, or MC may direct arming of crew
members as deemed necessary by mission threat analysis. Protect all weapons IAW AFI 31-117,
Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel and AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons
Handling Manual. (T-2)
   7.5.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain
   weapons, ammunition, lock, and key. Crew members must present a current AF Form 523,
   USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crew members will be
   reissued the same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crew
   member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew
   member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. (T-2)
   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels/facilities if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the
   weapon on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer. (T-2)
   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the
   identity of armed crew members. (T-2)
       7.5.3.1. Due to the sensitivity of weapons in foreign countries, crews will keep their
       weapons inside the aircraft and out of sight of foreign nationals, even if the FCG allows
       them to be carried outside the aircraft. If a destination requires weapons be carried
       outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior to
       deployment. (T-2)
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage. If required for anti hijacking purposes, crew members will be
   armed before beginning preflight or on load duties. When no passengers are on board and
   after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight. Crew
   members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded before being placed in
   the gun box. (T-2)
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available. If a
   weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country prohibits or restricts the entry of
   weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box. (T-2)
7.6. General Anti Hijacking Guidance. Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist
an aircraft hijacking attempt, resistance may vary from dissuasion, to direct physical
confrontation, including the use of deadly force IAW CJCSI 3121.01B, Standing Rules of
Engagement/Standing Rules for the Use of Force for US Forces, and all applicable ROE/RUF. It
is imperative that all crew members are familiar with the ground and in-flight resistance actions
and forced penetration of unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207, Preventing and
Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), and the FIH. In the event of a hijacking, crew members
must act immediately and resourcefully, without instruction, in order to counter the attacker
successfully. An aircraft is most vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                  51


for flight. Hijackers cannot be dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are mentally disturbed,
emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to
crime. Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property. Detection of
potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem. (T-2)
   7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting
   facility should conduct anti hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the
   aircraft commander is fully satisfied with these inspections. Exception: Passengers may be
   anti hijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew if no passenger processing facility exists.
   (T-2)
       7.6.1.1. Aeromedical Procedures. Military medical facility commanders are responsible
       for the anti-hijacking inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft
       by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure. (T-2)
   7.6.2. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers (including MEP) will not carry weapons and/or
   ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft. Exception:
   Special agents/guards of the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals
   specifically authorized to carry weapons in coordination with the PIC. In all cases, the crew
   will be aware of the location of weapons and ammunition. (T-2)
       7.6.2.1. If individuals must clear their weapons before boarding the aircraft, and access
       to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to: (T-2)
           7.6.2.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 ft from any aircraft, equipment, or
           personnel before unholstering/unslinging their weapons.
           7.6.2.1.2. Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.

   8.2.1. Normally all air freight, fleet service, and servicing personnel are authorized to
   perform assigned duties in all AFSOC aircraft when escorted by an authorized individual. (T-
   2)
   8.2.2. At locations with no air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities listed in Paragraph 11.2.1. (T-2)
8.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that emergency exits
are available as follows: (T-2)
   8.3.1. At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed.
   8.3.2. Seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered an obstruction.
   8.3.3. Access to the rear of the aircraft and entry into cargo or baggage areas, or emergency
   exits must be maintained without exception. No less than 30 inch by 14 inch space will be
   provided.
8.4. Air Cargo Restraint Criteria. Cargo will be restrained in accordance with the AOH. (T-2)
8.5. Preflight Duties. The loadmaster will normally report to the aircraft immediately after the
crew briefing or as directed by the aircraft commander to begin preflight and/or loading duties.
(T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                                53


   8.5.1. The loadmaster will sign off the AFE inventory Air Force Technical Order (AFTO)
   IMT Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, comm and mission equipment
   inventory forms prior to each flight. (T-2)
   8.5.2. After removing the landing gear pins, the loadmaster will show the pins to the aircraft
   commander prior to stowing the pins and also ensure a set of chocks and a grounding wire
   are stowed aboard the aircraft (T-2)
8.6. Passenger Handling. Loadmasters will ensure all passengers are manifested. Give one
copy to the PIC for filing and retain sufficient copies for border clearance. The loadmaster will
complete anti-hijacking requirements for personnel in accordance with this instruction. Ensure
all classified equipment is not visible prior to passenger boarding. The loadmaster is the key
figure concerning good passenger relations. Be aware of the concerns that may arise in the
minds of passengers and anticipate their questions and actions. (T-2)
   8.6.1. Passengers may move about the cargo compartment. Good judgment must be
   exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at one time. Encourage
   passengers to keep seat belts fastened when seated.
   8.6.2. Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage.
   (T-2)
   8.6.3. Ensure classified equipment remains covered during the entire mission when
   passengers are on board and ensure passengers are denied access to this equipment. (T-2)
   8.6.4. Floor loaded passengers. If available, any cushioning material may be used for
   seating, to prevent the passenger from having to sit on the cargo floor. Seat passengers face
   forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row of passengers, in a
   manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability. No more than 5 passengers
   should be in a row per strap. Pig tails with quick release are authorized as restraint for
   specific SOF operations. (T-2)
8.7. Troop Movements. Every effort should be made to advise troops of mission progress or
deviations. The troop commander should be identified prior to boarding.
   8.7.1. Determine if the troop commander has any special requirements prior to departure,
   and advise the aircraft commander of these requirements if appropriate.
   8.7.2. Determine if specific communications requirements exist and coordinate these
   requirements with the PIC.
   8.7.3. Determine if there is a need for the troops to perform any type of in-flight rigging.
   Ensure the aircraft is loaded to accommodate in-flight rigging if required. Inform the PIC
   prior to in-flight rigging. If turbulence is anticipated, the PIC should inform the passengers
   in advance if possible.
   8.7.4. Ensure troops do not have access to classified equipment during the mission. If troops
   require access to classified equipment, the requirement should be made known to the PIC
   prior to the mission. (T-2)
8.8. Border Clearance. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture require certain forms for
border clearance. The loadmaster will ensure that required forms are contained in the aircraft

                                           TRAINING

9.1. General. See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, and AFI 11-2C-146A, Vol 1, Aircrew
Training, for additional information.
9.2. Instructor/Flight Examiner Briefings. Before all training/evaluation missions, the PIC or
instructors/flight examiners will brief their crew on the training/evaluation requirements,
objectives, planned profiles, and seat changes. (T-2)
9.3. Debriefing. Review and assess overall training performed. Each student or crew member
should thoroughly understand what training has been accomplished. All required documentation
should be completed as expeditiously as possible.
9.4. Training Aircraft Not Capable of Flight. If an aircraft is not capable of departure within
4 hours after scheduled departure time, cancel the training mission unless waived by the PIC.
Departure consists of actual takeoffs for assigned or planned training missions and does not
include maintenance ops checks. (T-3)
9.5. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   9.5.1. The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting device is not authorized for any
   phase of flight. (T-2)
   9.5.2. Initiate practice instrument missed approaches no lower than the minimum altitude for
   the approach being flown. (T-2)
9.6. Confidence Maneuvers. All confidence maneuvers will be accomplished in VMC
conditions under VFR with a discernible horizon. Ensure the airspace around the aircraft is clear
of traffic by visually clearing the area prior to the maneuver. Do not exceed AOH limitations.
(T-2)
   9.6.1. Stall Series. Begin stall series at least 5,000 ft AGL or 5,000 ft above the clouds if
   operating “VFR on top”. For stall series training, recover from the stall at the first definite
   indication (e.g., stick shaker, actual stall of aircraft, decay of control effectiveness). An IP at
   a set of flight controls is required to perform this maneuver. (T-2)
       9.6.1.1. Simulated or actual engine-out stalls are prohibited. (T-2)
   9.6.2. Steep Turns. Accomplish steep turns at least 1,500 ft AGL, 1,500 ft above the clouds
   if operating “VFR on top”. Accomplish both 45 and 60 degree bank steep turns. Do not
   exceed 60 degrees of bank. (T-2)
   9.6.3. Slow Flight. Fly an airspeed 5 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) below VREF for
   aircraft configuration. Do not exceed 15 degrees of bank. Authorized in day VMC only at a
   minimum of 1,500 ft AGL or 1,500 ft above a clouds if operating “VFR on top”. (T-2)
9.7. Prohibited Maneuvers. The following maneuvers or procedures are prohibited in the
aircraft: (T-2)
   9.7.1. Spins.
   9.7.2. Full Stalls.

   9.7.3. Simulated runaway trim malfunctions.
9.8. Simulated Emergency Procedures.
   9.8.1. Practice simulated emergencies which require placing switches in other than their
   normal position or the aircraft in an abnormal configuration as specified in the AOH only
   during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is
   in one of the pilot seats. Preface all simulated emergencies with the word “simulated” and
   terminate simulated emergencies if an actual emergency arises. Note: For training, 0 Flap
   approaches and landings are not considered emergency procedures; however, if an actual
   condition exists that leads to a flapless landing, run appropriate emergency or abnormal
   checklists. (T-2)
   9.8.2. IP candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the direct supervision of a flight
   examiner pilot not in the seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures during upgrade
   evaluations to IP. (T2)
   9.8.3. Preface all simulated emergencies with the word “simulated” and terminate simulated
   emergencies when an actual emergency arises. (T-2)
   9.8.4. Use a realistic approach and do not compound emergencies. Limit simulated
   emergencies to noncritical phases of flight when possible. Notify the controlling agency if a
   nonstandard traffic pattern or maneuvering airspace is required. (T-2)
   9.8.5. Do not perform simulated emergencies when passengers or medical crew members
   (except flight surgeons performing required flight duties) are on board. (T-2)
   9.8.6. Simulated Engine Failure. Simulated engine failures will only be accomplished with
   an IP at a set of functional aircraft controls. Weather required during daylight (or when using
   NVGs) is circling minimums for the approach being flown. Weather required for nighttime
   conditions is 1,000 ft ceilings and 2 statute miles (sm) visibility or circling minimums,
   whichever is higher. (T-2)
      9.8.6.1. Initiate simulated engine failure no lower than 200 ft AGL or approach
      minimums if during an instrument approach. The IP will initiate the emergency. The IP
      will set the power lever or throttle to a setting equivalent to a feathered propeller once the
      flying pilot correctly executes/applies the proper critical action procedure. (T-2)
          9.8.6.1.1. Retard the appropriate throttle to approximately 10% torque to simulate
          zero thrust on the simulated failed engine. (T-2)
      9.8.6.2. Turns into the simulated failed engine should be minimized. Turns into the
      simulated failed engine are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with
      actual failed engines and must be smooth and coordinated. (T-2) WARNING: Improper
      application of rudder or power can lead to an immediate out-of-control situation where
      recovery might not be possible.
      9.8.6.3. No lower than 100’ AGL, the simulated inoperative engine will be available for
      use by the PF to accomplish a landing or go-around. (T-2)
          9.8.6.3.1. A go-around will be executed if a safe landing is not ensured. (T-2)
AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014                                                               57


      9.8.6.4. Simulated Engine Out Go-around or Missed Approach. Initiate simulated
      engine out goaround or missed approach no lower than 100 ft AGL or minimum altitude
      for the approach. (T-2)
   9.8.7. Aborted Takeoff. Authorized during day or night VMC, or with NVGs. Crosswind
   component must not exceed 15 KIAS. The runway must be dry, a minimum width of 44 ft,
   and long enough to meet normal takeoff distance requirements. (T-2)
   9.8.8. Actual Engine Shutdown and Air start. If required by a formal training syllabus, one
   engine may be shut down in day VMC only at a minimum of 5,000 ft above the ground or
   cloud deck, whichever is higher. Do not shut down the engine unless the aircraft can remain
   clear of clouds and recover and land under visual flight rules. (T-2)
9.9. Touch-and-go/Stop-and-go Operations.
   9.9.1. Conduct touch-and-go operations IAW the AOH. (T-2)
   9.9.2. The touch-and-go checklists may be used when performing multiple instrument
   approaches or VFR pattern practice at the same airport or transitioning to another airport

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

11.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms. For
assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, squadron, or local flight safety
officer.
11.2. AFSOC IMT Form 97, Aircraft Incident Worksheet. Refer to AFI 91-204, and the
AFSOC Sup. The Safety Office (HQ AFSOC/SE) will be notified of the following high interest
items: IFR incidents, dropped objects, or any other incident which, in the judgment of the Flight
Safety Officer (FSO), needs to be reported. Use the AFSOC IMT Form97, when reporting these
incidents to HQ AFSOC/SE. AFI 91-204, and the AFSOC Sup provide policy guidance that is
common to investigating and reporting all US Air Force mishaps and instructions for using
AFSOC IMT Form 97. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to
prevent future mishaps. Safety investigations take priority over any corresponding legal
investigations, except friendly fire mishaps. (T-2)
11.3. AF IMT Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force
Mishap Prevention Program. The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air
Force personnel to alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt
corrective action. A hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may
jeopardize the health and well-being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or
destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource. (T-2)
11.4. AF IMT Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). Refer to AFI 91-202.
   11.4.1. The Air Force HATR program provides a means for personnel to report all near
   midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. Use information in HATR
   reports only for mishap prevention. AFI 91-202 list reportable incidents. (T-2)
   11.4.2. Procedures:
       11.4.2.1. Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency
       (e.g., center, Flight Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station),
       and give the following information as appropriate:
           11.4.2.1.1. Identification or call sign.
           11.4.2.1.2. Time and place (radial/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), position

           11.4.2.1.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
           11.4.2.1.5. Include a verbal statement as soon as possible after occurrence that a
           written HATR report will be filed upon landing. Note: ATC agencies (e.g., FAA,
           etc.) must know if an official report is being filed.
       11.4.2.2. File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means
       of communication. Normally, it should be filed at the base operations office at the
       landing airport. If this is impractical and if communications permit, notify the safety
 60                                                      AFI11-2C-146AV3 29 AUGUST 2014


      office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home
      station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM. In any case, provide the safety office
      with all available information needed to prepare the AF IMT Form 651. Turn in a
      completed copy of the AF IMT Form 651 to the wing/group safety office. Note: HATR
      reports are not privileged information and may be released outside the USAF.
   11.4.3. Individuals submitting a HATR are granted immunity from disciplinary action
   provided:
      11.4.3.1. Their violation was not deliberate.

                          EQUAL TIME POINT CALCULATIONS

A2.1. Equal Time Point (ETP). The equal time point is an airborne decision point. It is the
point along the route of flight (usually over water) from which it takes the same amount of time
to return to the point of departure (or to the last suitable airfield) as it would to continue to the
destination (or the first suitable airfield). In no wind conditions, the ETP is simply the halfway
point between the two airfields. However, when flying into a headwind, the ETP moves closer
to the destination aerodrome. Conversely, when flying into a tailwind, the ETP moves closer to
the departure aerodrome. These calculations will also be impacted by the decision to fly at lower
altitudes due to loss of aircraft pressurization without supplemental oxygen. The distance and
time to the ETP from the departure aerodrome (or last suitable airfield) may be calculated using
the following formulas: (reference Figure A2.1 and A2.2)
