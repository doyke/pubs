This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 34-2, Managing
Nonappropriated Funds. It outlines procedures to provide a system of operating controls and
internal checks for 52d Force Support Squadron (52 FSS) Bazaars operated by a Private
Organization (PO), with the PO’s net proceeds raised from the bazaars used to satisfy a portion
of the charitable needs of Spangdahlem Air Base (SAB) and its geographically separated units
(GSU) communities. It applies to all personnel assigned to Spangdahlem and its GSUs. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command.

    1.1. The Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) of 52 FSS is authorized to engage in
    resale activities, to include bazaars. Bazaars are in the nature of a 52 FSS NAFI Category C
    or “revenue-generating activity” as defined in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 65-106,
    Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and
    Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs). The NAFI may contract with a PO to
    operate an occasional, short term, nonpermanent bazaar for the NAFI. When approved by
    the installation commander, the bazaars are base-wide special events and as a NAFI Category
    C activity qualifies for Air Force Appropriated Fund (APF) support in the same manner in
    which other NAFI Category C activities receive common support services.
    1.2. If operated by or for the NAFI, if sales are limited to United States (US) military
    members, US civilian employees and their authorized dependents, i.e., US military
    identification card holders, and if 100% of the net revenues after expenses go to the NAFI or
    to charitable activities, NAFI resale activities, to include bazaars, are free of German taxes to
    include Value Added Tax (VAT).
2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. 52d Fighter Wing Commander (52 FW/CC).
       2.1.1. 52 FW/CC approves the dates, times and locations of 52 FSS bazaars as base wide
       special events.
           2.1.1.1. Approval of the bazaar by 52 FW/CC constitutes authorization for APF
           support, in the form of common services and excess equipment, on a non-
           reimbursable basis to the extent authorized by AFI 65-106 for NAFI Category C
           activities. Paragraph 4 details the common service and excess equipment
           requirements for bazaars.
           2.1.1.2. If operated by a PO for 52 FSS, approval of the bazaar by 52 FW/CC
           authorizes the NAFI on a reimbursable basis to expend funds. The PO may elect to
           have the NAFI provide support, but the PO must reimburse 52 FSS 100% of all
           Nonappropriated Funds (NAF) costs.
    2.2. 52 FSS.
       2.2.1. Event Approval.
           2.2.1.1. 52 FSS will coordinate with the PO to establish a site, dates, and hours of
           operation for the bazaars. The site will be Hangars 1 and 2 on SAB.
           2.2.1.2. 52 FSS will obtain a coordinated approval from the 52d Mission Support
           Group commander, 52d Maintenance Group (52 MXG) commander, and the 52
           FW/CC. This approval will indicate whether 52 FW/CC has declared equipment
           items excess for the period of the bazaar, and also request common services to the
           extent allowed in AFI 65-106 (see paragraph 4).
       2.2.2. 52 FSS, with the assistance of the 52 FW Staff Judge Advocate and 52d
       Contracting Squadron (52 CONS), will develop standardized vendor contracts for
       bazaars. All contracts between 52 FSS and vendors must be signed prior to the start of
       the bazaar. The contracts will include the vendor’s agreement to participate in the bazaar,
       agreed upon space rental fees, and percentage of sales due to the NAFI.
SPANGDAHLEMABI34-201 1 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        3

     flyers, posters, marquees, newspaper articles, sandwich boards and other marketing
     support to include commercial sponsorship. If 52 FSS/FSK is to provide marketing and
     publicity for the bazaar, the contract between 52 FSS and the PO will detail what 52
     FSS/FSK will provide and what the cost will be.
     2.2.4. If agreed upon by 52 FSS and the PO, 52 FSS will provide tables and benches at
     an agreed upon price.
     2.2.5. 52 FSS may utilize commercial sponsorship for the event. Any benefit of
     commercial sponsorship must accrue to 52 FSS, not the PO. POs are not authorized to
     use commercial sponsorship.
     2.2.6. 52 FSS will ensure official POs and unofficial activities/organizations operating

        such as space fees may be disbursed prior to the bazaar to pay expenses. Monies and

      Maintenance Operations Squadron (52 MOS) (Hangar 1) and 52d Equipment

       the PO for reimbursement of these additional expenses.
       3.2.2. Alternatively, the PO can assume responsibility for all costs of the bazaar. If this
       is done and 52 FSS performs any services mutually agreed upon, 52 FSS shall account
       for its expenses and be reimbursed by the PO for 100% of the actual costs incurred.
    3.3. The PO will pay for all supply costs required to run the bazaar.
    3.4. The PO will pay all costs of replacing or repairing lost or damaged government

    paying a private contractor or paying reimbursable shop rates for APF 52d Civil Engineer
    Squadron (52 CES) personnel to set up and take down the electrical system for the bazaar,
    the PO may make arrangements with the 52 CES booster club to set up and take down the
    electrical system for the bazaar as long as the 52 CES booster club members are voluntarily
