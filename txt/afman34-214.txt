message, the Major Air Command (MAJCOM/SVF) and HQ AFSVA/SVF (in turn), 10100
Reunion Place, Suite 400, San Antonio TX 78216-4138, a minimum of 3 weeks in advance of
any Nonappropriated Fund instrumentality (NAFI) dissolution or merger. Include in the letter or
message the effective date, NAFI identification, location, and month in which the base expects to
complete the action. Cash in bank and the Cash Management and Investment Program (CMIP)
account must balance before the merger or dissolution.
1.2. Procedures for NAFI Dissolutions:
   1.2.1. Dispositions. For dissolutions, dispose of assets and liquidate liabilities as required
   by AFI 34-201 or AFJI 34-122, Civilian Nonappropriated Funds and Morale, Welfare, and
   Recreation Activities. While the activity or NAFI is operating, account for disposed assets
   according to Chapter 7. Once the base closes, dispose of the remaining assets according to
   paragraph 1.2.4 If the base is not closing (just disbanding an activity), continue to use
   Chapter 7 to dispose of assets instead of paragraph 1.2.4
   1.2.2. Transfers. Record property transferred from the dissolving NAFI to other Air Force
   NAFIs or the successor fund according to Chapter 7.
   1.2.3. Reporting. Prepare financial statements showing the end-of-month (EOM) results of
   operations after the NAFI has completed all dissolution actions.
   1.2.4. Write-off of NAF Assets. Write-off all NAF assets that Services (SV) does not
   physically transfer, sell, or turn into the Defense Reutilization and Marketing office
   (DRMO). These assets will still be on the base when it closes. Expense the remaining net
   book value for facilities, facility improvements, equipment or the remaining value of
   inventory. Use the appropriate discontinued operations general ledger account code
   (GLAC). Secretary of the Air Force, Financial Management, Cost and Economics, Business
   Management Division (SAF/FMCEB) approves, in writing, requests to use these GLACs.
   SV submits approval requests through the MAJCOM/SVF and HQ AFSVA/SVFA. Include
   supporting documentation (for example, annotated property list) with the approval request.
   The NAF Accounting Office (NAF AO) retains the approval and supporting documentation
   in the life-of-the-fund (LOF) file. Footnote the financial statement explaining the cause of
   the transaction and the month completed.
   1.2.5. Severance Expense. Refer to paragraph 6.23
   1.2.6. Physical Transfer of Balance Sheet Accounts. The NAFI transfers cash, other
   assets, and liabilities to the successor NAFI by letter according to previous agreements. In
   many cases, the successor fund is the MAJCOM.
   1.2.7. Financial Statement Transfer. To transfer final balance sheet accounts, the NAF
   AO prepares a journal voucher to close balance sheet GLACs (remaining residual assets) to
12                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     GLAC 287, Transferred Equity. Do not close GLACs 290 and 291. After the NAF AO posts
     the journal voucher (JV), the only GLACs that will have balances other than $0.00 will be
     GLACs 287, 290, and 291. The NAF AO closes income and expense GLACs. Send the
     financial statement to the successor NAFI and the RCS: HAF-SV(Q) 7407 report, as
     prescribed in AFI 34-209, to the MAJCOM/SVF.
     1.2.8. Final Documentation. The NAF AO forwards documentation for unpaid liabilities,
     uncollected receivables, etc., to the successor NAFI as well as the LOF file.
     1.2.9. Final Payroll Documentation. Forward current year and prior year payroll
     documentation according to AFI 37-139, Records Disposition-Schedule, to the successor
     NAFI.
     1.2.10. HQ AFSVA/SVF Procedures for NAFI Dissolutions: On notification from the
     MAJCOM, HQ AFSVA/SVF provides dissolution instructions for CMIP. After the
     dissolution date of a NAFI, HQ AFSVA/SVFB closes the NAFI's account after all
     outstanding checks have cleared the bank and they have completed a final deposit validation.
     1.2.11. Successor NAFI Procedures for NAFI Dissolutions. The closing base transfers
     NAFI residual assets to the successor NAFI. The successor NAFI records receipt of residual
     assets and liabilities, if any. The successor NAFI establishes the assets and liabilities in the
     appropriate balance sheet GLACs using GLAC 282 to record the net of assets and liabilities
     transferred. The base-level transfer-out amount should equal the amount transferred-in to the
     successor NAFI. The successor NAFI is responsible for any outstanding liabilities and
     reports not completed by the dissolving NAFI (refer to AFI 34-201).
1.3. Management Fee Agreements Management services provided in support of activities
(other than where the manager is assigned) must be based on the actual time spent in the activity.
The activity receiving management services processes a transfer of labor between the applicable
cost center codes (CCC).
     1.3.1. Each pay period, NAF activity managers document the actual hours spent providing
     management services to other activities. Provide this documentation to the serviced activities
     so they can prepare the labor transfer. Include the CCC where the manager is originally
     assigned, number or hours worked in other activities, and the receiving activity where the
     manager performed the work.
        1.3.1.1. As an alternative to tracking hours by pay period, the SV commander or director
        may establish a distribution formula based on actual time spent during a 30 day period.
        1.3.1.2. Activity managers must validate the distribution formula by tracking the actual
        time spent by the servicing manager for a 30 day period once every 6 months.
        1.3.1.3. Keep the documentation supporting the formula in the LOF file.
     1.3.2. The activity manager signs the supporting documents and sends them to the NAF AO
     after each payroll cycle. If using a distribution formula, the activity manager certifies the
     validity of the formula and sends the certification to the NAF AO not later than the first
     business day following the end of the month.
     1.3.3. The NAF AO posts the payroll transfer (wages plus benefits) in the actual payroll
     accounts (for example, GLAC 701 to 701; 703 to 703.). Attach the signed supporting
     documents to the transfer voucher.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                    13


   1.3.4. NAF activity managers may not normally transfer more than 40% of their total salary
   plus benefits to any individual activity in any month. The installation commander must
   approve distribution formulas that allot more than 40% to a single activity.
1.4. Management of Services Snack Bar Operations. When a snack bar is physically located
with a non-club activity (e.g., golf course, bowling center, community center, etc.), account for
and report it in the cost center code (CCC) for that activity’s snack bar operation. You may
operate a snack bar that is in a separate free standing facility as an annex to a club when it is a
natural extension of the club program and there are management efficiencies to be gained. When
operated as a club annex, report the entire operation on the parent club’s financial statements. If
the free-standing snack bar is not an extension of a parent club; report it in CCC T3, Snack Bars;
or T4, Fine Dining; as appropriate. Regardless of which CCC is used to record the income or
expense, clubs or any other activity may give management assistance to a snack bar according to
paragraph 1.3 above.
1.5. Assets. Assets are economic resources obtained or controlled by NAFIs as a result of past
transactions or events. The NAF AO classifies assets on financial statements as either current or
noncurrent items.
   1.5.1. Current Assets. Classify those items of cash and other assets or resources that the
   NAFI can reasonably expect to convert to cash or to consume during the normal operating
   cycle (12 months for Air Force NAFs) as current assets. These include cash and cash
   equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories, and prepaid expenses.
   1.5.2. Noncurrent Assets. Classify those assets that the NAFI will not convert to cash or
   consume during the next 12 months as noncurrent. These include land, buildings, leasehold
   improvements, furniture, equipment, bulk purchases of expendable equipment, long-term
   investments, long-term receivables, and long-term prepaid expenses.
1.6. Liabilities. Liabilities are obligations to transfer assets, provide services, or otherwise
expend assets to satisfy responsibilities resulting from past or current transactions. The NAF AO
classifies liabilities as either current or noncurrent.
   1.6.1. Current Liabilities. Classify those obligations whose liquidation the NAFI can
   reasonably expect to require the use of existing current assets or the creation of other current
   liabilities during the next 12 months. These include accounts payable, loans payable, and
   accrued liabilities.
   1.6.2. Noncurrent Liabilities. Classify those liabilities the NAFI does not expect to
   liquidate during the next 12 months as noncurrent. These include the long-term portion of
   loans payable and long-term accrued liabilities.
1.7. Fund Equity. Fund equity consists of capital invested in the NAFI plus the profit or minus
the loss resulting from operations since its inception. Refer to AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated
Fund Financial Management and Accounting, for authorized transactions into and out of fund
equity.
   1.7.1. When a new NAFI, with pre-existing capital, is authorized, record that capital as
   equity (for example, a private organization that becomes a membership organization). Equity
   is disestablished when a NAFI is dissolved.
14                                                               AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     1.7.2. Equity may be distributed by declaring dividends to other NAFIs. An example is
     dividends paid by base restaurants. Special grants for new construction and facility
     improvements are another method of distributing equity. Equity may be transferred in the
     form of cash or other assets.
     1.7.3. Refer to paragraph 1.8 for prior-period fund equity adjustments.
1.8. Prior-Period Fund Equity Adjustments. Prior-period fund equity adjustments are items
of profit or loss related to the correction of errors in the financial statements of a prior fiscal year
(FY), accounted for as adjustments to equity, and excluded from the determination of net income
for the current period. Errors in financial statements resulting from mathematical mistakes in the
application of accounting principles or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the
financial statements were prepared, qualify for prior-period fund equity adjustments. Record
those prior-year adjustments that do not qualify as prior-period fund equity adjustments as
current period miscellaneous income or expense.
     1.8.1. Submit requests to adjust prior-period fund equity to SAF/FMCEB, through your
     MAJCOM/SVF and HQ AFSVA/SVF, according to AFI 34-209. Carefully review the
     specific circumstances related to prior-period fund equity adjustments before requesting
     approval for the adjustments. When requesting approval, include a complete description and
     any related information pertaining to the request. The MAJCOM attaches their comments
     and recommendation to the request and forwards it to HQ AFSVA/SVF.
     1.8.2. Make no adjustments to accounting records until SAF/FMCEB provides written
     approval.
     1.8.3. The NAF AO records approved adjustments in GLAC 283, Prior Year Adjustments.
     Footnote the financial statements explaining the circumstances of the adjustment and the
     effect it has on the operations of the prior period.
     1.8.4. Adjust prior period statements when doing a comparative analysis. Maintain a copy
     of the fund equity approval letter in the LOF file.
     1.8.5. Do not treat the following corrections and adjustments as prior-period fund equity
     adjustments if they are:
        1.8.5.1. The result of the use of estimates in the accounting process.
        1.8.5.2. Changes in estimates resulting from new information.
        1.8.5.3. Subsequent developments and adjustments based on better insight or improved
        judgment.
     1.8.6. Examples of transactions that SAF/FMCEB generally will not consider as prior-period
     fund equity adjustments include, but are not limited to:
        1.8.6.1. Amounts considered immaterial in the determination of net income.
        1.8.6.2. Changes in the estimated lives of property or equipment that affect the computed
        amounts of depreciation.
        1.8.6.3. The undepreciated value of property or equipment no longer used due to facility
        renovation or replacement.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                  15


       1.8.6.4. Pay and severance benefit increases that apply to wages earned in a prior year if
       they could have been reasonably estimated in a prior year or the increase resulting from
       events occurring after the close of the affected prior FY.
       1.8.6.5. Gains or losses resulting from changes in foreign currency (FC) exchange rates.
1.9. Extraordinary Items. Extraordinary events and transactions are distinguished by their
infrequency and unusual nature and are segregated from the results of ordinary operations.
Submit requests to record a transaction as an extraordinary item to SAF/FMCEB, through your
MAJCOM/SVF and HQ AFSVA/SVF, according to AFI 34-209. Carefully review the specific
circumstances related to the extraordinary items before requesting the approval. When
requesting approval, include a complete description and any related information pertaining to the
transaction. The MAJCOM attaches their comments and recommendation to the request and
forwards it to HQ AFSVA/SVF.
1.10. LOF File. The NAF AO keeps the following ocuments in the LOF (not an all-inclusive

                                           Chapter 2

                                            NAF AO

2.1. NAF AO Standards. The NAF AO provides centralized professional accounting and
financial management services to all NAF activities established within the installation SV
organization. The RMFC supervises the NAF AO personnel. The NAF AO will follow certain
basic standards:
   2.1.1. Document financial transactions clearly.
   2.1.2. Properly classify and record transactions in the period of receipt.
   2.1.3. Ensure only persons acting within the scope of their delegated authority execute
   transactions. SV must 2.1.1 document the delegated authority.
   2.1.4. Assign key duties to maintain the segregation of duties. Examples of key duties are:
   authorizing, approving and recording transactions; issuing or receiving assets; vouchering
   and making payments; and auditing procedures.
   2.1.5. Provide qualified and continuous supervision to assure that NAF AO personnel follow
   established procedures. Ensure that areas of personal responsibility and accountability are
   clear.
   2.1.6. Limit access to resources to authorized personnel.
   2.1.7. When the RMFC delegates authority (for example, procurement authority), make
   periodic comparison of the transactions with the recorded accountability.
   2.1.8. Ensure that key personnel have high standards of personal and professional integrity,
   are educated, trained or experienced to accomplish their assigned duties.
   2.1.9. Ensure NAF AO costs do not exceed the benefits derived by the activities serviced
   within allowable accounting parameters.
2.2. NAF AO Relation to Other Type Funds. SV or higher headquarters may task a NAF AO
to provide professional accounting and financial management services (on a reimbursable basis)
to other type funds such as:
   2.2.1. In-flight steward funds, BRFs, and CWFs.
   2.2.2. NAFIs belonging to one MAJCOM but located on an installation of another
   MAJCOM.
   2.2.3. MAJCOM funds.
2.3. NAF AO Funding Support. The NAF AO uses a combination of NAF and APF resources.
Refer to AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation, and
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for authorized APF support. The NAF AO charges
service fees to NAFIs, other than the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund (MWRF), that
receive accounting and payroll support from the NAF AO. EXCEPTION: Charge fees to other
MWRFs for slot machine maintenance only where the host MWRF provides regional support.
   2.3.1. The RMFC works with representatives of NAFIs (other than its base MWRF) or other
   organizations receiving NAF AO support, to arrive at an equitable annual service fee.
18                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


        2.3.1.1. Service Fees for Other NAFIs. The RMFC computes the service fee according
        to paragraphs 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 Document the basis for each NAFI's service fee by using
        AF Form 1735, NAF Interfund Purchase Order. Record the annual fee on the AF
        Form 1735. The NAF AO uses an AF Form 1804, NAF Interfund Dollar Transfer, to
        post the monthly expense to the services NAFIs and to post the payment to the NAFI
        providing the service.
        2.3.1.2. Service Fees for Other Organizations. When the NAF AO provides a service
        to another organization that requires remitting funds to the organization, the NAF AO
        pays them by check. Service fees for the organizations (other than NAFIs) should
        consider benefits received from such organizations.
     2.3.2. The NAF AO posts expenses for the NAF AO, Human Resources Office (HRO),
     Servicing Contracting Office (SCO), marketing and publicity, value added tax personnel, and
     related expenses in the appropriate overhead group "A" CCC. Overhead administration costs
     apply to all MWRF activities. Do not prorate overhead costs to other MWRF activities.
     EXCEPTION: Prorate CCC A9 (refer to Attachment 5) and certain marketing expenses as
     defined in CCC A5 (refer to Attachment 5).
     2.3.3. The NAF AO arrives at an equitable annual service fee using a fee-for-services-
     rendered method of charging the NAFIs for NAF AO and HRO support. The RMFC
     calculates the service fee. Do the calculation twice annually (Feb and Aug). Make
     adjustments to the service fee at this time. Keep the results of each review (most current and
     prior semi-annual review) in the LOF file.
     2.3.4. Compute the Fees-for-Services-Rendered Method for the NAF AO as follows:
        2.3.4.1. Survey transactions processed for the month (Feb or Aug) for the NAFI to total
        transactions processed by the NAF AO in the accounting system. Determine the
        transaction count for each NAFI by checking the last reference code number for the
        period on the End-of-Day Posting Journals. Each journal listing will be numbered (for
        example, 05-0001, 05-0002) with the last number indicating total transactions for the
        period (for example, 05-7350 indicates 7,350 transactions processed for the NAFI during
        Feb).
        2.3.4.2. Based on the number of transactions processed, compute the NAF AO charges to
        each NAFI using the following formulas:
            2.3.4.2.1. Total cost of NAF AO accounting service less payroll service (payroll
            technician's salary plus benefits) divided by total transactions processed for all NAFIs
            for the period times the number of transactions processed for the specific NAFI.
            2.3.4.2.2. Total cost of payroll services divided by total NAF employees on payroll
            (as determined by NAF employee count) times the total number of NAF employees
            for the specific NAFI.
            2.3.4.2.3. The NAF AO service charge to a specific NAFI equals the sum of the
            accounting service fee and the payroll service fee.
     2.3.5. For allocating HRO charges in CCC A7 to each NAFI (or, Fees-for-Services-
     Rendered Method for the HRO), calculate the ratio of total NAF employees supported by the
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                 19


   HRO for each NAFI relative to the total NAF employees of all the NAFIs supported by the
   HRO. Multiply the ratio times the total cost of the HRO function to determine the allocation.
   2.3.6. The RMFC reviews the service fee charged to each NAFI receiving support from the
   NAF AO semi-annually and adjusts the service fee, if necessary, to cover inflation or
   changes in operational cost. Maintain the review in the LOF file for the MWRF.
2.4. NAF AO Organization. The RMFC organizes the NAF AO to ensure compliance with the
basic standards listed in paragraph 2.4.1
   2.4.1. Operate the NAF AO as economically as possible while maintaining effective control
   and integrity of accounting functions. The functions of the NAF AO include but are not
   limited to:
      2.4.1.1. Processing documentation received from the NAFIs serviced.
      2.4.1.2. Ensuring transactions are correctly classified.
      2.4.1.3. Providing individual tax payments and reports to local, state and federal
      agencies.
      2.4.1.4. Preparing financial statements, reports, and schedules for MAJCOM and higher
      headquarters.
      2.4.1.5. Disbursing all funds for purchase of goods and services, contractual payments,

                                             Chapter 3

                                            BUDGETING

3.1. When to Start the Budget Process. Because it is a continuing process, SV updates
budgets at least at the completion of each quarter. This includes a top-down review of goals and
performance, adjustments as required, and development of the budgets for three quarters out by
activity and financial managers. Refer to Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 for recommended NAF
budgeting schedules. Refer to AFI 34-209 for other budgeting instructions.
3.2. Training. The RMFC ensures that management receives budget training if needed. The
Nonappropriated Fund Financial Analyst (NAFFA) provides formal training, if requested.
3.3. Developing Financial Goals and Objectives. Activity managers develop financial
objectives and goals with their applicable flight chiefs and RMFC based on requirements of the
SV commander or director or higher headquarters.
     3.3.1. Activity managers develop budgets, with guidance from the NAFFA and the RMFC,
     to meet established goals.
     3.3.2. Make financial goals that are measurable in dollars for both the NAFI and the
     activities supported by the NAFI and make these goals attainable. This allows comparisons
     between budgeted and actual financial results. In setting goals, the activity manager
     considers such factors as:
        3.3.2.1. Net earnings objectives.
        3.3.2.2. Amount of APF support authorized.
        3.3.2.3. Desire for new or revised programs.
        3.3.2.4. Desired changes in inventory levels.
        3.3.2.5. Desired construction and facility alterations.
        3.3.2.6. Need for new equipment or repair of existing equipment.
        3.3.2.7. Higher headquarters financial goals where established.
        3.3.2.8. Mission changes that will affect base population operations.
3.4. How to Prepare the NAF Income and Expense (I&E) Budget. Activity Managers:
     3.4.1. Prepare realistic operating budgets for each CCC under their management using the
     accrual basis of preparation.
     3.4.2. Use the Air Force NAF Budget program to prepare their I&E budgets (refer to Air
     Force Services NAF Budget User’s Guide).
     3.4.3. Justify I&E budgets by explaining major changes in income or expense categories
     over the quarter just ended, seasonal variances, payroll computations, and departures from
     established standards or goals. Submit a copy of this documentation as part of the budget
     package. Keep the original in the activity with the budget. Make this information available
     to the NAFFA, if requested. This documentation aids the NAFFA in variance analyses. Do
     not make the documentation a part of the NAF's council review.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   21


   3.4.4. Ensure that when estimating supply expense, they include the current year portion
   from bulk purchases of high value supply items from the NAF Requirements budget (NRB)
   as supply expense in the operating budget.
3.5. How to Prepare the NRB.
   3.5.1. Activity Managers:
      3.5.1.1. Prepare NRBs for each activity before the beginning of the FY.
      3.5.1.2. Prepare NRBs for a minimum of five years.
          3.5.1.2.1. Describe, on the NRB, each requested asset, the asset’s priority, the
          funding source, the cost center that will use the asset, the estimated month and year of
          completion or purchase, and the estimated cost of the asset.
          3.5.1.2.2. The NRB includes NAF purchases of capital assets. Capital assets include
          fixed assets, facilities acquired or constructed, and improvements made on existing
          facilities from NAFs. Refer to Chapter 7 to determine if an item qualifies as a
          capital asset.
          3.5.1.2.3. The NRB also includes quantity expendable (bulk) assets. Include
          expendable equipment (like-items) that the activity purchases in bulk. Also include
          bulk purchases of high value supplies. Chapter 7 specifies the type and dollar
          amount to qualify as a bulk purchase.
          3.5.1.2.4. Annotate the budget if expected to receive higher headquarters funding for
          a specific asset.
      3.5.1.3. Justify the requirements on their NRBs. Justifications for NAF vehicle
      purchases are coordinated with the vehicle control officer. See paragraphs 3.12 and
      7.14 and AFI 34-204.
   3.5.2. Use the Air Force NAF Budget program to complete the NRB.
   3.5.3. The SV commander or director, or activity manager for BRFs and CWFs, makes
   recommendations to the installation commander on requests to higher headquarters for NAF
   funding support.
3.6. NAF Budget Review and Approval Process. All levels of management take part in the
review and approval process once the activity manager completes the budget.
   3.6.1. Activity Managers. Activity managers forward completed budgets to their flight
   chiefs for review, consolidation, and approval.
   3.6.2. Flight Chief Review. Flight chiefs review and consolidate the proposed budgets for
   activities under their flight. Provide changes to the activity manager. Once the flight chief
   concurs with the activity manager's budgets, send the budget files and copies of the budget
   supporting documentation to the RMFC.
   3.6.3. RMFC Responsibilities. The RMFC reviews, and consolidates (to NAFI level) all
   budgets to ensure the activity managers prepared them correctly. The RMFC provides the
   flight chiefs and activity managers with recommended budget changes. The RMFC:
22                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


        3.6.3.1. Works with the resource advisor or base budget officer to determine if APF
        support is available for SV requirements.
        3.6.3.2. Consolidates all activity NRBs into a single budget for each NAFI.
        3.6.3.3. Consolidates all I&E budgets by each NAFI.
        3.6.3.4. Prepares an annual cash flow budget, with quarterly breakouts, for each NAFI.
        3.6.3.5. Forwards all budgets, individual and consolidated, to the SV commander or
        director, or appropriate BRF/CWF manager, for review and to prioritize the NRB items.
     3.6.4. SV Commander or Director Responsibilities. The SV commander or director:
        3.6.4.1. Reviews I&E budgets, including BRF and CWF and recommends revisions or
        corrections to the applicable activity manager.
        3.6.4.2. Returns budgets not meeting financial goals to the activity manager, through the
        applicable flight chief, for evaluations and possible revision.
        3.6.4.3. Reviews NRB items and sets the budget priorities for the total NAFI. The SV
        commander or director requests the budget working committee to review and recommend
        a priority, if established.
        3.6.4.4. Ensures the activity completes appropriate needs assessments and justifications
        for NRB items as applicable (refer to AFI 32-1022, Planning and Programming of NAF
        Facility Construction Programs).
        3.6.4.5. Forwards budgets to the NAFFA for review and comparison to goals. The
        NAFFA performs a review and analysis of the budgets, including the BRF and CWF
        budgets, and recommends revisions to the SV commander or director.
        3.6.4.6. Budget Approval. Forwards completed budgets, except the CWF budgets,
        through the base NAFs council, then to the installation commander for approval.
        Forward completed CWF budgets through the CWF council, then to the installation
        commander for approval.
        3.6.4.7. Reserved
        3.6.4.8. Reviews and approves the annual NAF vehicle budget exhibit and submits it to
        the base NAFs council as part of the NRB budget submission.
     3.6.5. Installation Commander. The installation commander approves the completed
     budgets for all NAFIs.
3.7. NAF Cash Flow Budget Preparation. Refer to AFI 34-209. The RMFC:
     3.7.1. Includes anticipated cash inflows and cash outflows based on the operating budget, the
     NRB, and the balance sheet when developing the cash flow budget.
     3.7.2. Includes budgeted NRB items in the cash flow budget for the period in which the
     NAFI expects to pay for the item.
     3.7.3. Includes NRB items ordered in the prior FY not yet paid for.
     3.7.4. Uses the automated cash flow budget for ease of computation and update.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                  23


   3.7.5. Establishes an upper limit cash balance as the total cash needed to pay all operating
   expenses and budgeted NRB items due during the period while maintaining a healthy acid
   test ratio.
   3.7.6. Establishes a minimum cash balance (lower limit cash balance) necessary for each
   NAFI to cover normal operating costs and to maintain a minimum acid test ratio. Establish a
   minimum balance that ensures the acid test ratio will be above 1.25 to 1.
   3.7.7. Recommends revisions to financial goals or plans if projected cash flows do not show
   adequate cash to cover normal operations and capital requirements as budgeted.
3.8. APF Requirements Budget. Refer to AFI 34-209. The activity manager prepares a budget
that includes capital items to be received from APFs (both funded and unfunded items). Use the
Air Force NAF budget program to complete the budget by indicating a fund source of APFs for
both funded and unfunded APF capital assets.
3.9. Budget Working Committee. Refer to AFI 34-209. If established, the committee meets,
as necessary, to update or revise the current year NRBs. The SV commander or director
determines the make-up of the committee and may rotate it periodically.
3.10. Variable Budgeting. Activity managers may consider variable budgeting as an optional
way of developing more meaningful budgets. A variable budget is a series of I&E budgets for
different levels of sales or activity revenue.
3.11. Minimum Requirements for Financial Analysis. The NAFFA completes the statistical
and narrative portions of the financial analysis (working with activity managers) and sends it to
the SV commander or director for review and comment (refer to AFI 65-107, NAF Financial
Management Oversight Responsibilities, for details on the contents of the financial analysis).
     - After review, the SV commander or director returns the analysis and comments to the
NAFFA.
     - The NAFFA finalizes the analysis, including the comments received from the SV
commander or director.
       - The NAFFA obtains signatures of the SV commander or director and the FM on the
analysis and forwards it to the MAJCOM/SV and MAJCOM/FM.
       - The SV commander or director should make the activity manager responsible for
budgeted performances.
   3.11.1. When an analysis is performed for either the BRF or CWF, send one copy of AF
   Form 262, NAF Financial Analysis, or computer product (statistical analysis) and the
   narrative summary to AAFCWF as part of the financial statement package.
3.12. NAF Vehicle Budget Exhibit. Before the beginning of each fiscal year, the vehicle
control officer prepares a NAF Vehicle Budget Exhibit. This exhibit should be prepared in
conjunction with the normal actions and deadlines set by the RMFC for submitting budgetary
documents to the base NAFs’ council. The exhibit will be an information item in the base
NAFs’ council agenda when submitting activity NAF Requirements budgets for approval.
   3.12.1. The VCO obtains a list of all budgeted vehicles from the NAF AO. The data on this
   list should be for the next fiscal year. It should identify the activity, type of vehicle
   budgeted, estimated purchase price and estimated quarter of purchase. The VCO ensures all
24                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     vehicles budgeted by activity managers have been justified and approved by the Services
     commander or director using the guidance in AFI 34-204. If there is not an approved vehicle
     authorization, the VCO works with the applicable activity manager to prepare the needed
     justification documentation.
     3.12.2. The VCO uses the information received from the NAF AO to develop a NAF
     Vehicle Budget Exhibit. Refer to the sample at Figure 3.3 At a minimum the exhibit
     includes the following:
        3.12.2.1. Activities requesting NAF vehicles.
        3.12.2.2. Descriptions for vehicles requested.
        3.12.2.3. Quarter the vehicle is programmed for purchase.
        3.12.2.4. Estimated purchase price for each vehicle.
        3.12.2.5. Total dollar amounts for all budgeted vehicles (by quarter and annual total)
        3.12.2.6. The total proceeds received from sales of NAF vehicles during the past 12
        months. Use the 12 months prior to the date the report is prepared. Annotate which
        months were used for determining the proceeds from sales of vehicles. Refer to
        paragraph 7.14 for instructions on determining the dollar amount of proceeds from sales
        of NAF vehicles.
     3.12.3. The NAF vehicle budget exhibit is provided to the SV Commander or Director for
     review and approval and then submitted to the base NAFs Council as an integral part of all
     Services NAF budgets submitted to the installation commander for approval.

                  CHANGES IN CUSTODIAN OR ACTIVITY MANAGER

4.1. Changes of Custodian and Activity Managers - Timing. Make changes in NAFI or
activity managers, or custodian, at any time. However, when possible, schedule a change to

                                             Chapter 5

        COMMERCIAL CREDIT SYSTEMS AND MERCHANTS AGREEMENTS

5.1. Commercial Credit Systems. A commercial credit card contract replaces, in full or in
part, the current A/R and dues collection function for a NAFI or activity. HQ AFSVA/SVF and
the installation commander base the approval on clear evidence that the commercial system
offers a cost advantage over the current A/R system and/or provides improved service to the
membership. HQ AFSVA/SVF approval is contingent upon concurrence by SAF/FM after
consultation with the office of the Comptroller, Department of Defense (DoD) (refer to AFI 34-
209).
     5.1.1. In cases where a NAFI or an activity does not have A/R or where the current system
     lacks all the features of a commercial credit system (for example, no member billing),
     compare the increased cost of using a commercial system with the improved service to the
     membership. Use this as part of your basis for approving the commercial credit system.
     5.1.2. SV notifies the membership and customers of the intention to award a commercial
     credit contract and explains the basic features of the proposed system.
     5.1.3. The checklist at Attachment 6 provides the SV commander or director and the
     RMFC with a general outline of items to consider in establishing a commercial credit system.
     It also shows important contractual features that usually are included in all commercial credit
     contracts. Not all of the checklist items will pertain to every NAFI.
     5.1.4. AFMAN 64-302, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting, contains a sample commercial
     credit contract format. Use the sample contract as a first bargaining position. This format
     may require some modifications to meet local conditions because of varied operating
     procedures and different competitive situations. However, to be advantageous to the NAFI
     or activity, all commercial credit contracts must meet certain minimum requirements:
        5.1.4.1. The commercial agency has no recourse against the Air Force or its NAFIs for
        uncollectible bad debts unless the charge sale was made in violation of contract
        provisions (e.g., accepting a charge sale from a customer using an expired or revoked
        charge card).
        5.1.4.2. Base disapproval of credit for a member or customer on an individual credit
        check by the commercial agency and not on grade alone.
        5.1.4.3. Where the credit card involved also serves as a club membership card, do not
        deny membership if the individual does not qualify for a regular commercial credit card.
        Offer those members who do not qualify for a regular commercial credit card a
        proprietary commercial card which represents an extension of credit by the contracting
        NAFI that:
            5.1.4.3.1. Restricts the individual to monthly dues only, or
            5.1.4.3.2. Restricts the individual to monthly dues and charges at Services locations
            on the commercial credit card system. The NAFI that issues the member the credit
            card absorbs any bad debts charged on any such proprietary cards.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                     33


       5.1.4.4. Do not have commercial credit contracts and merchant agreements exceed time
       limitations established by AFI 64-301.
       5.1.4.5. Include the mandatory general provisions in AFI 64-301, NAF Contracting, in
       each credit contract.
       5.1.4.6. In addition to the required contract provisions, include other desirable provisions
       in the sample contract format. Include them, when possible, as part of the negotiated
       commercial credit contract.
   5.1.5. Write a commercial credit contract according to AFI 64-301. As a minimum, include
   the military banking facility in any solicitation for a commercial credit contract. Although
   the NAFI normally uses the bank on base as its primary banking facility, the NAFI is not
   precluded from processing its accounts receivable through another bank. The custodian
   negotiates a contract that has, as a minimum, the required provisions in paragraph 5.1.4 Do
   not solicit for such a contract without prior HQ AFSVA/SVF and the Secretary of the Air
   Force, Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FMPB) approval.
   5.1.6. The servicing staff judge advocate's office reviews the negotiated contract when a
   deviation from the approved format in AFI 64-301 occurs.
   5.1.7. After obtaining any required local approvals, the RMFC forwards the complete
   package through the MAJCOM/SVF to HQ AFSVA/SVF who in turn forwards the package
   to SAF/FMPB for approval. Once approved, HQ AFSVA/SVFB makes the necessary
   arrangements with the banking institution to assure that funds are moved to the concentration
   bank in an orderly manner.
   5.1.8. The base awards the contract after the receipt of approval from HQ AFSVA/SVF and
   SAF/FMPB.
   5.1.9. When administering a commercial credit system, these policies apply:
       5.1.9.1. Other than merchants agreements, usually HQ AFSVA/SVF approves only one
       commercial credit system per base.
       5.1.9.2. Consider developing a consolidated contract that provides for commercial credit
       in all activities that wish to have it available. A high volume contract usually results in a
       more favorable discount rate than several smaller volume contracts. However, when
       multiple contracts prove to be more cost effective for the overall installation, more than
       one contract may be approved.
       5.1.9.3. Do not allow cash refunds for credit card transactions.
   5.1.10. The contracts and agreements remain in the applicable NAFI's LOF file for the
   duration of the contract. Destroy expired contracts according to AFI 37-139.
5.2. Merchant Agreements. A merchant agreement is different from the commercial credit
card system in that a NAFI uses it when it wants to accept one or more nationally recognized
credit cards from its customers.
   5.2.1. Merchants agreements include the negotiated discount rate.
   5.2.2. Follow these procedures for merchants agreements in addition to requirements in
   AFMAN 64-302.
34                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     5.2.3. Attach the mandatory general provisions in AFMAN 64-302 as part of the merchant
     agreement.
     5.2.4. Do not have the merchant agreement exceed the time limitations established by
     AFMAN 64-302.
     5.2.5. Include the military banking facility in any solicitation for a merchant agreement.
     5.2.6. Obtain legal review by the staff judge advocate and approval by HQ AFSVA/SVF
     (through HQ AFSVA/SVFB) before awarding the merchant agreement.
     5.2.7. Once approved, HQ AFSVA/SVFB makes the necessary arrangements with the
     banking institution to move funds to the concentration bank in an orderly manner. HQ
     AFSVA/SVFB reviews all merchant agreement contracts prior to award of the contract to
     assure that the required field bank account is established (separate account for electronic data
     capture), the concentration bank is notified, and the credit card account will properly function
     in the CMIP system. HQ AFSVA/SVFB will assist in ensuring that the contract that is let
     provides the maximum service to the NAFIs, and operational ease for the employee and the
     NAF AO. Reporting instructions (including bank account information) and start-up date is
     furnished upon completion of the contract review.
     5.2.8. After receipt of approval from HQ AFSVA/SVF and after all parties sign the contract
     agreement, award the contract and then start accepting the approved credit card for sales.
     5.2.9. When administering merchants agreements, these policies apply:
        5.2.9.1. Consider developing a consolidated contract that provides for accepting credit
        cards in all activities that wish to have it available. A high volume contract usually
        results in a more favorable discount rate than several smaller volume contracts.
        However, when multiple contracts prove to be more cost effective for the overall
        installation, more than one contract may be approved.
        5.2.9.2. Do not allow cash refunds for credit card transactions.
        5.2.9.3. Do not issue locally drawn checks against a credit card account.
        5.2.9.4. The base NAFI pays all fees associated with those types of accounts, except for
        account maintenance and analysis.
     5.2.10. The contracts and agreements remain in the applicable NAFI's LOF file for the
     duration of the contract. Destroy expired contracts according to AFI 37-139.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   35


                                           Chapter 6

                                          PAYROLL

6.1. Nonappropriated Fund Management Information System (NAFMIS) Payroll. The
NAFMIS payroll system operates on DISA OKC level UNISYS 2200 series computer and
provides payroll support for United States Air Force (USAF) non-appropriated fund civilian
employees. Reference AFCSM (Air Force Computer Systems Manual) 34-378, NAFMIS
Payroll Users Manual, for detailed information.
   6.1.1. Time and Attendance (T&A) Report. Before pay is processed for an employee, an
   authenticated T&A report must be submitted to the Payroll Technician within the Resource
   Management Flight. One T&A report is required for each active employee whether or not
   the employee is in a pay status. The Activity Manager or authorized designee certifies each
   T&A report with his/her signature. Facsimile and electronic signatures are NOT authorized.
   T&A reports are completed using the Time and Attendance Report produced by the AF
   approved Labor Management System. A list of individuals authorized to sign T&A reports
   must be forwarded to the Resource Management Flight Office and updated on a continued
   basis, as necessary.
   6.1.2. Overtime Approval. Overtime payment is required for hours worked that are
   officially ordered or approved. Non-exempt employees must also be paid for overtime
   suffered or permitted. Generally, if management determines the need for overtime work, it
   must be approved, in writing, in advance. An exception to the prior approval rule are
   instances where overtime work is required on short notice and prior written authorization
   cannot be obtained. If management does not authorize overtime work, it must make sure that
   employees work only during their scheduled tour of duty. Authorizations for overtime work
   are handled at the activity/cost center and are NOT forwarded to the payroll processing
   office. Overtime payment is authorized by the employee’s supervisor or designee via an
   authenticated Time and Attendance (T&A) Report.
6.2. Circular E. The current edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Circular E contains
instructions for taxes and withholding amounts in addition to the instructions contained in AFM
176-378. Each January, the NAF AO orders and maintains a current Circular E on file to ensure
proper administration of the payroll.
6.3. Payroll Checks/EFT. NAF employees are federal employees and governed by federal law.
EFT for payment of wages is a condition of employment or a waiver must be on file in the
employee’s payroll folder. The NAF AO distributes the leave and earnings statement (LES) and
the payment of wages are available on the Friday following the end of the pay period. Bases
with a manual or contract payroll should ensure checks are dated the Friday following the end of
a pay period; pay dates in NAFMIS are handled programmatically. As an exception, pay dates
are the preceding day, Thursday, when Independence Day, Veterans’ Day, Christmas, or New
Year’s Day are observed on a payday.
6.4. Manual Pay Preparation. When manual preparation of pay is necessary due to unforeseen
circumstances (for example, as a result of input error, incorrect EFT data, or miscellaneous other
situations), the NAF AO will utilize the central cashier operation to make payment.
36                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     6.4.1. The payroll technician will prepare an AF Form 2539, NAF Disbursement Request.
     The technician will calculate the amount due to the employee and complete the request, as
     currently done attaching all supporting documentation. The technician will prepare an AF
     Form 2557, NAF Cash Receipt Voucher, pre-numbered, in triplicate. These pre-numbered
     forms should not have more than a maximum 5-digit numbering sequence.
     6.4.2. The disbursement request must be approved for payment by the RMFC or designee.
     6.4.3. The disbursement request will be vouchered through accounts payable and expensed
     to the employee’s cost center in GLAC 812.
     6.4.4. After all paperwork is completed and approved, contact the employee to report to the
     central cashier cage. Forward the paperwork to the central cashier. When the employee
     arrives, the central cashier will pay the employee the dollar amount written on the request
     and the AF Form 2557, verifying the two amounts are the same. The employee will sign the
     AF Form 2557 and receive the second copy of the form. The original signed AF Form 2557
     will be attached to the AF Form 2539 as verification that the disbursement was made and
     accepted by the employee. The third copy of the AF Form 2557 will remain with the central
     cashier as supporting documentation for the daily deposit.
     6.4.5. Accounts payable will process the payment to clear the voucher using the signed copy
     of the AF Form 2557 as proof of payment (similar to a check copy). Using the central
     vendor payment (CVPP) screen in the field accounting system (FAS) to clear the open item
     using the number from the AF Form 2557 as the check number. This process will make the
     appropriate general ledger entries. See the FAS users’ guide, Chapter 6, for detailed
     instructions of the CVPP process.
     6.4.6. Final Pay. NAF employees are federal employees and governed by federal law.
     There are no federal requirements to issue the final paycheck anytime prior to its normal
     issue date.
6.5. Loans to Employees. AFI 34-201 prohibits loans to employees (such as an advance
payment of wages).
6.6. Payroll Interface to the General Ledger (PRIGL). The PRIGL program operates on a
personal computer (PC) using information extracted from the automated payroll system. The PC
PRIGL program uses the NAFMIS produced AVAP2T file to compute workers compensation
and unemployment rates by CCC and to produce hard coded JVs and Cost Center Management
reports for the activity managers. It also creates a file for upload to the accounting system to
provide automatic posting of journal entries to the G/L. The G/L entries required (actual,
accrual, and reversal) for each pay period are automatically posted to expense payroll costs,
establish liabilities, show disbursements, and establish receivables for all NAF activities paid by
the base level NAF AO.
6.7. Adjustments to PRIGL. The RMFC approves any adjustment to the PRIGL accrual
amount. Allow adjustments to the automated payroll accrual entries only for clubs for the
December accrual when a significant over-accrual occurs due to the holiday schedule (more than
$5,000). The NAF AO provides the activity managers with a Cost Center Management report
(CCMR). The club manager uses the CCMR from the last pay period of December to verify the
projected accrual. The activity manager provides a worksheet to the NAFFA in the financial
management organization for independent certification.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                 37


   6.7.1. The RMFC reviews the information and authorizes the adjustment after assuring all
   taxes, insurance, leave, etc., is included in the request. The RMFC forwards the adjustment
   request, back-up worksheet, CCMR, and NAFFA certification to the NAF AO.
   6.7.2. The NAF AO attaches the CCMR, worksheet, NAFFA certification, and RMFC
   approval to the JV as backup to authorize reversing the PRIGL and to enter the adjusted
   projected payroll. As a reminder, reverse any adjusting entry in January to avoid
   understating the payroll cost for that month.
6.8. Unclaimed Payroll Checks. Activity managers make every attempt to ensure employees
receive their payroll checks. Immediately following payday, mail any unclaimed check to the
employee unless the employee has made arrangements to have the check held at his or her
workplace in a secure area or in the NAF AO. Forward checks that have been mailed and are
returned undeliverable, or left unclaimed, to the NAF AO for cancellation. After 120 days from
the date of issue, the NAF AO voids the check. Refer to the GLAC description for GLAC 225
for details.
6.9. Individual Pay Record (IPR). For bases not using the automated payroll system, the NAF
AO manually maintains a permanent master record of salary payments, deductions, adjustments,
and benefits affecting each employees pay on an individual pay record. Under the automated
NAFMIS pay system, the master pay record AVAP6L shows the master records for each
employee. Retain pay periods "Y" and "Z" or "Z" and "1" for the 56 year permanent file in
accordance withAFI 37-139, Table 34-14, and enclose a copy of the NAFI ID’s and CCCs with
each session to provide a cross reference tool for the St. Louis Federal Records Center (FRC).
   6.9.1. Protect the IPRs from loss or damage by storing the forms in files with locks or by
   locking the room in which these records are kept. While not mandatory, use fireproof
   equipment when possible.
   6.9.2. Maintain IPRs and related documents for audit. SV conducts an investigation if IPRs
   are lost or damaged beyond reconstruction. The investigation determines whether the
   supervisor caused the loss or damage due to negligence. Fully document all pertinent details,
   including the amount involved, circumstances surrounding the loss, and whether the NAF
   AO recommends reconstructing the records. Include reasons to justify the recommendation.
6.10. Basis for Entitlements. The following directives show the basis for entitlements for NAF
employees: AFI 34-301, NAF Personnel Management and Administration; AFI 34-302, NAF
Retirement Plan; AFI 34-305, NAF Group Health Plan; AFI 34-306, NAF Group Life Plan; AFI
34-307, NAF Flexible Benefits Plan; AFI 34-308, NAF Workers' Compensation; AFI 34-309,
NAF Unemployment Compensation; AFMAN 34-310, NAF Personnel Program Management
and Administration Procedures and DoD 1401.1-M, Personnel Policy Manual for NAFIs dated
December 1988 and Change 1 to DoD 1401-1M dated 27 July 1990.
6.11. Annual and Sick Leave. The NAF AO maintains annual and sick leave records.
6.12. Leave Balance Insufficient to Cover Leave Requested. Activity managers review leave
balances of their employees. Inform the employee if the leave accumulated does not cover the
leave requested. Document approvals of leave without pay, annual leave, or other types of leave
necessary to excuse the employees absence from duty not covered by accrued leave.
38                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     6.12.1. Individual Responsibility. When requesting leave, each individual ensures he or
     she has ample leave to cover the leave requested.
6.13. Advance Annual and Sick Leave. Refer to AFMAN 34-310 for application and approval
of advance annual and sick leave. Refer to AFI 34-202 for collection of advance annual and sick
leave when an employee who owes the NAFI advance leave separates from NAFI employment
for reasons other than death, disability, retirement or resignation for physical disability.
     6.13.1. Upon receipt of an approved application, the NAF AO advances leave. The payroll
     technician maintains a subsidiary record to account for all advanced leave. As the employee
     accrues leave, post the accrued hours as leave taken on the time and attendance (T&A)
     report. Annotate the report with "Advance Leave Adjustment" and update the subsidiary.
     6.13.2. After the NAFI recoups all authorized advance leave, discontinue adjustments and
     file a copy of the subsidiary and approval letter with the employees personnel folder in the
     NAF AO. If the employee separates for reasons other than those in paragraph 6.13 before
     the NAFI recoups advance leave, subtract the dollar amount from any accumulated leave or
     final wages earned. Refer to AFI 34-202 if funds are insufficient.
6.14. Transfer of Annual and Sick Leave. A regular employee who transfers to another NAFI
at the same or another base transfers all accrued sick and annual leave hours. Procedures for
transferring annual leave differ depending on whether the transfer was to a NAFI at the same or
another base. Refer to Attachment 1 in AFM 176-378, Atch 1, for guidance.
     6.14.1. The NAF AO completes SF 1150, Record of Leave Data, and annotates the balance
     of annual leave and sick leave hours with the associated annual leave dollar value. The
     losing NAFI pays the gaining NAFI the ending annual leave dollar value for the transferred
     leave balance. The losing NAF AO prepares the dollar transfer or check. The gaining NAFI
     absorbs the additional expense which results from a higher pay rate applied to the transferred
     employee's annual leave hours balance.
     6.14.2. Transferred sick leave does not involve dollar amounts or journal entries into the
     general ledger. In the gaining NAFI, the NAF AO records the transferred sick leave hours in
     the applicable employees master record. The payroll technician ensures the NAF AO
     receives all necessary documentation from HRO before processing this action.
6.15. Transfer of Annual Leave Under Portability. A regular employee who transfers from
APF to NAF or NAF to APF as contained in the Portability of Benefits for Nonappropriated
Fund Employees Act of 1990 must transfer all accrued annual and sick leave hours. When an
employee transfers under the Portability Act, the gaining and losing organizations do not
exchange funds.
     6.15.1. For NAF to APF transfers, the employee does not receive lump sum leave. The NAF
     AO adjusts the transferred employee's annual leave value to miscellaneous income for the
     activity.
     6.15.2. For APF to NAF transfers, the NAF AO adjusts the transferred employee's annual
     leave value to miscellaneous expense for the activity.
6.16. Annual and Sick Leave Timekeeping Responsibilities:
     6.16.1. Employees should request annual leave, and request or document sick leave, using
     SF Form 71, Application for Leave. When requesting leave, each individual ensures he or
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                    39


   she has ample leave to cover the leave requested by reviewing his or her leave balance as
   annotated on the prior pay period leave and earning statement. Since leave is not credited to
   employees' accounts until the end of the pay period, employees may not use current pay
   period earned leave until the next pay period.
   6.16.2. The supervisor or the supervisor's designee approves leave requests. These should
   be submitted to the supervisor on an SF Form 71. At the end of the pay period, the
   supervisor or the supervisor's designee verifies and certifies leave hours posted on the T&A
   form. Return approved T&A forms to the timekeeper.
   6.16.3. Timekeepers record leave, duty hours, etc. on the T&A, attach SF Form 71s, and
   forward to the supervisor. The activity retains SF Form 71s as the source document for
   employees' leave requests and to resolve any discrepancies. Forward signed and approved
   T&A forms to the payroll section.
   6.16.4. Payroll technicians process leave hours recorded on the T&A in the appropriate
   employee payroll record.
6.17. Military Leave. Refer to AFMAN 34-310 to determine eligibility and the amount of
military leave to grant an employee. Request for military leave must be supported by a copy of
the orders, which is forwarded to the payroll office with the time and attendance report on which
the absence is first reported. The employee must submit a certification by the appropriate
military officer as evidence that the active military duty was performed. The activity forwards
this certification to the payroll office with the time and attendance report on which the return to
duty is reported. The activity timekeeper annotates the days of military leave on the T&A report
in the pay period taken.
   6.17.1. Employees called to active duty to enforce the law may be granted additional
   military leave not to exceed 22 workdays in a FY. If an employee gets military orders related
   to upholding public law, then the employer (NAF AO) is entitled to reduce the employee’s
   NAF pay by the amount of military pay received during that 22 days. On receipt of a
   certificate from the activity stating the amount of military pay received by the employee with
   the T&A report, the NAF AO credits compensation received (other than travel,
   transportation, and per diem allowances) against the pay from the employees NAF position
   during the period of military service performed on a workday. Do not consider military pay
   received for nonworkdays.
6.18. Military Furlough. On receipt of an AF Form 2545 from HRO which places the
employee in a military furlough status, the NAF AO terminates the employee, pays the
employee for accrued annual leave, and notifies the HRO of the employees sick leave balance.
When the employee returns to duty, reinstate the employee based on the AF Form 2545 received
from HRO. The duration of military furlough counts as creditable service time for leave accrual
and for the retirement program. Adjust the employees leave record by posting a sick leave
balance equal to the balance available to the employee prior to being placed in a military
furlough status.
6.19. Court Leave. When reporting court leave, attach the summons, if available, to the T&A
report showing the first absence. Refer to AFMAN 34-310 to determine the amount of court
leave to grant an employee. Regular employees on court leave receive their regular pay for such
time off, or retain court fees received from the court, whichever is the greater amount. If court
40                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


fees are the lesser amount, the employee pays such fees to the NAFI. Transportation fees, when
separately identified, or identifiable, need not be turned in by the employee. Transportation costs
include parking fees. The NAF AO debits GLAC 101, Cash, and credits GLAC 812,
Miscellaneous Income, for the court fees turned in by the employee.
     6.19.1. The employee submits a statement showing the amount of court fees received and
     transportation costs incurred and the activity attaches it to the T&A report to provide a
     sufficient audit trail. When a state statute provides for reimbursement of expense or an
     expense allowance rather than a jury fee, employees receive regular pay and the money paid
     by the court.
6.20. Meals Furnished to Employees. Meals furnished to employees are provided only when
they are for the convenience of the NAFI and are considered noncompensatory and therefore not
taxable. Refer to AFIs 34-301 and AFMAN 34-128, Air Force Club Program.
     6.20.1. IRS tax law defines "meals furnished for the convenience of the employer" as when:
        6.20.1.1. The employer provides a meal on workdays and during working hours.
        6.20.1.2. The employer requires employees to be available for emergency calls during
        the meal period.
        6.20.1.3. The nature of the business requires employees to have a short meal period, i.e.
        30 to 45 minutes, and employees could not be expected to eat elsewhere in the allotted
        time.
        6.20.1.4. Employees cannot otherwise secure proper meals within a reasonable time in
        the vicinity of the employer.
     6.20.2. Refer to paragraph 8.14 for discounted employee meals.
6.21. Employee Awards. NAF employees' cash incentive awards include performance awards,
special act or service awards, and on-the-spot awards. The supervisor initiates the award using
AF Form 1001, Award Recommendation Transmittal. Forward the request to the appropriate
approval authority. The HRO processes all incentive awards (refer to AFMAN 34-310).
Forward completed and approved forms to the HRO for distribution. Regardless of the type, the
NAF AO processes all cash awards (including the cost of U.S. Savings Bonds) through the
NAFMIS payroll system. Awards are taxable and must be included in wages on the TD Form
W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. Refer to AFM 176-378 for further procedures on payroll
system processing.
6.22. Unemployment Compensation. The appropriate state employment agency administers
the unemployment insurance program for federal civilian employees. The state determines an
employee's entitlement to compensation after reviewing information provided by the employer.
AFI 34-309 contains procedures for processing unemployment compensation claims and records.
When the NAF AO receives the Form ES 931, Requests for Wage and Separation
Information, the NAF AO completes the portion pertaining to giving salary information. The
NAF AO forwards the form to the HRO so they can complete the reason for separation. The
NAF AO returns Form ES 931 to the state agency within the specified timeframe. Provide all
information on the form including applicable salary information, the location where the person
worked (i.e. lodging, CWF, Officers' Club, etc.), and the reason for separation. The AF Form
2545 may not contain the actual reason for separation for employees separated during their
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                       41


probation period and for those in a temporary status at the time of separation. Nevertheless, the
HRO indicates the actual reason for separation on Form ES 931 to satisfy all state requirements.
The NAF AO forwards one copy of the completed form to HQ AFSVA/SVXCC.
6.23. Severance Benefits. Severance benefits are payments to employees who are being
separated from employment through a business based action. This applies to either US citizens
or Foreign National (FN) employees. Severance benefits may also be referred to as "notice pay"
in some Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) for FN employees. The NAFI treats severance
benefits as a contingent liability. The NAFI does not accrue for contingent liabilities until the
liability can be estimated and it is probable that the contingent event will occur (i.e., the business
based action will occur). Do not confuse severance benefits with separation allowances which
are addressed in paragraph 6.24 NOTE: Severance and separation allowances are tracked and
accounted for separately.
   6.23.1. The RMFC, working with HRO, computes any estimated severance liability and
   establishes an accrual by debiting GLAC 711, Severance Benefits, or GLAC 964 (if you are
   a closing base) to recognize the estimated severance expense, and crediting either GLAC
   209, Severance Benefits Payable (if the amount is considered current) or GLAC 259 (if the
   amount is considered long-term) to recognize the severance liability. Ensure you record the
   expense in the CCC where the employee is assigned. In addition, shred the expense GLAC
   (711 and/or 964) between severance benefits accrued for FN employees and US employees.
   The NAF AO adjusts fluctuations in foreign currency ratio on a quarterly basis to coincide
   with financial statement reporting. Quarterly adjustments ensure the accuracy and validity of
   the severance liability accounts.
   6.23.2. MAJCOM/SVs determine the level of funding required for each NAFI, expressed as
   a percentage of the estimated total liability. Compute percentages by country, base, or NAFI.
   Do not establish funding levels at less than 25%. Revalidate funding levels at least annually.
   Increase funding to 100% when the severance is payable in one year (or less). For closing
   bases, increase the funding level to 100% when the base is placed on the definite closure list.
       6.23.2.1. The NAF AO sets aside funds to pay severance liabilities in the Severance
       Benefits Investment program. The NAF AO contacts HQ AFSVA/SVFB to establish a
       severance benefits investment account. The NAF AO shreds GLACs 108, Investment
       Severance Benefits/Separation Allowances (Current) and GLAC 195, Investment
       Severance Benefits/Separation Allowances (Non-Current), to record the amount of
       funding set aside for severance benefits. For example GLAC 1081 and GLAC 1951
       could account for the funding set aside to pay severance liabilities established in GLAC
       209 and GLAC 259.
   6.23.3. Severance benefits are paid to the employees on the normal pay day which pertains
   to their final pay period worked.
   6.23.4. If a business based action occurs and the affected employee worked less than one
   year in an activity of a NAFI after a transfer from another activity of the NAFI, the activity
   where the employee was employed initially bears the severance expense.
6.24. Separation Allowances. Separation allowances may be due FN employees in those
countries where the SOFA provides for such a benefit. These allowances, also referred to as
"end of employment pay", are due the FN employee regardless of the reason for terminating
42                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


NAF employment. A separation allowance is an estimable liability and is accrued, on a monthly
basis, over the period of the NAF employee's NAF employment. The RMFC reviews the SOFA
to determine the separation allowance provided to the FN employees in order to determine the
amount of liability to accrue. NOTE: The RMFC must ensure the separation allowance is
accounted for and tracked separately from severance benefits provided to FN employees (refer to
paragraph 6.23).
     6.24.1. The RMFC, working with HRO, computes the necessary separation allowance to
     accrue for each FN employee each month and establishes an accrual by debiting GLAC 707,
     FN Benefits, to recognize the separation allowance that the employee earned for the current
     month, and crediting GLAC 258, Separation Allowance Payable (Non-Current), to recognize
     the separation allowance liability. Shred GLAC 707 to separately recognize the FN benefits
     that are for separation allowances. Ensure you record the expense in the cost center code
     where the employee is assigned. The NAF AO adjusts fluctuations in foreign currency ratio
     on a quarterly basis to coincide with financial statement reporting. Quarterly adjustments
     ensure the accuracy and validity of the separation allowance liability accounts. When the
     separation allowance is payable within the next 12 months, transfer the applicable portion
     into GLAC 222, Separation Allowance (Current), from GLAC 258.
     6.24.2. MAJCOM/SVs determine the level of funding required for each NAFI, expressed as
     a percentage of the total liability. Compute percentages by country, base, or NAFI. Do not
     establish funding levels at less than 25%. Revalidate funding levels at least annually.
     Increase funding to 100% when the separation allowance is payable in one year (or less). For
     closing bases, increase the funding level to 100% when the base is placed on the final closure
     list.
        6.24.2.1. The NAF AO sets aside funds to pay separation allowances in the Severance
        Benefits Investment program. The NAF AO contacts HQ AFSVA/SVFB to establish a
        severance benefits investment account (Use the same SEV account established in
        paragraph 6.23.2.1 above). The NAF AO shreds GLAC 108, Investment Severance
        Benefits/Separation Allowances (Current) and GLAC 195, Investment Severance
        Benefits/Separation Allowances (Non-Current), to record the amount of funding set aside
        for separation benefits. For example, GLAC 1082 and GLAC 1952 could account for the
        funding set aside to pay severance liabilities established in GLAC 222 and GLAC 258.
6.25. Labor Transfers. The activity manager completes labor transfers and forwards them to
the NAF AO for update to the G/L. Include the individual's name on the transfer document. The
NAF AO processes labor transfers between activities by increasing or decreasing the respective
payroll accounts (i.e., 701, 703, etc.) for the activities involved. Transfer the amount of the
expense to cover the hourly rate of pay, differential, premium, overtime, Federal Insurance
Contributions Act (FICA), and applicable benefits expense.
6.26. Withholding Allowance Certificate: At the start of employment, an employee completes
TD Form W-4, Employees Withholding Allowances Certificate, and any other forms required
for withholding state or local tax. The number of allowances claimed and the employees marital
status provide the basis to compute federal income tax withholding (FITW). The TD Form W-4
serves as a source document for entry into the automated payroll system. Once filed, a TD Form
W-4 remains in effect until the employee furnishes an amended certificate. Once an employee
submits a new TD Form W-4, the change is effective the next pay period. Do not permit
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                    43


retroactive adjustments when an employee claims a TD Form W-4 on file is erroneous and
submits a corrected one. When an employee fails to provide the TD Form W-4, record the
employee as single with zero allowances.
   6.26.1. Allowances Claimed. Instructions for determining the number of allowances are
   found on the TD Form W-4.
   6.26.2. Exemption from FITW or 10 or More Exemptions. An employee may claim to be
   exempt from income tax withholding because he or she was not liable for income tax last
   year and does not expect to have a liability for the current year. The employee must file a
   TD Form W-4 each year to claim exemption from withholding. Each quarter, the NAF AO
   sends with the IRS Form 941 copies of any TD Form W-4s received during the quarter from
   employees claiming more than 10 withholding allowances or exemption from income tax
   withholding. The NAF AO must be able to show that TD Forms W4 are on file as
   supporting records. If questioned about a TD Form W-4 after authorized destruction, contact
   the General Services Administration, National Personnel Records Center (Civilian Personnel
   Records), 111 Winnebago St, St. Louis, MO 63118, and request a citation of the employees
   tax status as shown on the individual pay record.
   6.26.3. Additional Withholding. An employee who wants to increase the amount of tax
   withheld may reduce or eliminate the number of allowances to which he or she is entitled, or
   authorize an amount of additional tax to be withheld on TD Form W-4. Additionally, a
   married employee can request to withhold taxes at the single rate. Additional withholding
   remains in effect until the employee changes it. The NAF AO does not refund additional tax
   withheld.
   6.26.4. File of TD Forms W-4. Maintain a current file of TD Forms W-4. As forms are
   superseded or become obsolete, remove them from the active file and place them in an
   inactive file. Purge the inactive file at the end of the calendar year, and dispose of forms
   according to AFIs 37-133 V1 and 37-133 V2.
6.27. Advance Payment of Earned Income Credit (EIC). Employees eligible for the EIC
have the option of receiving the credit on their tax returns or as advance payments through
biweekly payroll processing. Those employees file TD Form W-5, Earned Income Payment
Certificate, with the NAF AO before the first pay period of the calendar year. Renew the TD
Form W-5 annually before the first pay period paid in the calendar year.
6.28. Tax Tables and Tax Periods. The payroll system computes and withholds taxes based on
processed pay data on a biweekly basis (refer to AFM 176-378).
6.29. Methods of Withholding. The Internal Revenue Code provides two methods of
withholding tax: the "percentage" method and the "wage-bracket" method. Graduated
withholding rates are prescribed so that withholding will approximate total tax liability. Separate
schedules are provided for filing married or single. TD Form W-4 gives special formulas for
computing additional exemptions required when filing as head of household, widow, or
widower. Compute FITW using the schedule applicable to the employees marital status as
shown on TD Form W-4. For manual tax computation use either of the following methods:
   6.29.1. Percentage Method. Under this method, compute as instructed in the current
   edition of Circular E using the biweekly tables for either single or married.
44                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     6.29.2. Wage-Bracket Tables. The IRS prescribes FITW Tables for employees paid on a
     monthly, semimonthly, biweekly, weekly, and daily basis. Withhold tax on the basis of the
     biweekly payroll period.
        6.29.2.1. For regular salary payments. compute tax by using method as stated in 6.29.1
        or 6.29.2 above.
        6.29.2.2. If an employee is paid for less than a full pay period, compute tax under the
        normal tax schedules used for the payroll period.
        6.29.2.3. If an employee receives regular salary covering two payroll periods, compute
        tax on each period separately. This allows the employee personal exemptions for each
        pay period.
     6.29.3. Supplemental Salary Payments. For tax purposes, the term includes such things as
     dismissal pay, retroactive wage increases or other status changes, overtime pay, cash awards,
     lump sum leave, severance pay, service charges paid out to employees, and similar payments.
     Pay supplemental salary payments with regular wages, or separately during a pay period.
     IRS issues tax computation rules that apply to supplemental wage payments either paid
     concurrently with regular wages, or separately from regular wages. The provided
     computation rules, however, apply only to supplemental wage payments made in the same
     calendar year in which regular wages were paid. A supplemental wage payment paid in a
     year when no wages were paid must be treated as a regular wage payment.
        6.29.3.1. If regular wages subject to withholding are combined with supplemental wages
        in a single payment, and the amount of each is indicated, a flat 28% rate of federal
        income tax may be withheld on the portion of the payment representing supplemental
        wages. The appropriate tax tables must be applied to amounts representing regular
        wages. The flat 28% rate must be applied without allowing for withholding exemptions
        claimed by the employee. The employees federal income tax liability will be the
        aggregate total of tax computed on regular wages plus tax computed on supplemental
        wages.
        6.29.3.2. If supplemental wages are combined with regular wages, and the amount of
        each is not specifically identified compute FITW on the total or gross amount of the
        combined payment by using the income tax tables included in Circular E.
        6.29.3.3. If a supplemental wage payment is made between pay periods, combine the
        payment with the employees earnings in the following pay period. As applicable, use tax
        withholding procedures in 6.16.1 or 6.16.2 above.
        6.29.3.4. If a supplemental wage payment was made between pay periods and the
        applicable employee does not have earned wages in the subsequent pay period, process
        the supplemental payment as regular wages. Use appropriate tax withholding procedures
        (refer to 6.16.2.1 above).
     6.29.4. Tax Forms. TD forms used in connection with reporting taxable income are
     obtained from your nearest IRS office. All TD forms may also be ordered using IRS's toll-
     free number 1-800-829-3676, if accessible. At a minimum, the NAF AO should order the
     following forms and publications annually:

          Columbia).
6.30. Adjustments to Withheld Income Taxes:
   6.30.1. Under Collection. If no FITW tax, or less than the correct amount of FITW tax is
   withheld because of a computation error, deduct the amount of the under deduction from the
   next salary payment. If the employee is separated, make no attempt to collect. Advise the
   employee that he or she may have to make an adjustment when filing his or her yearly
   income tax return.
   6.30.2. Over Collection:
       6.30.2.1. If more than the correct amount of tax is deducted because of computation
       error, refund the over collection to the employee within the same payroll year.
       6.30.2.2. If a TD Form W-2 was released, adjustments are not required since the over
       collection appears on the TD Form W-2 and is available for payment of income tax or
       refund by the IRS.
6.31. Tax Returns and Payments. Refer to Circular E, and AFI 34-201, for detailed
procedures.
6.32. TD Form W-2. This form is printed in multiple copies to provide employees a means of
reporting to Federal and other taxing authorities as required. The IRS requires employers to
distribute TD Form W-2s on or before 31 January. For Continental United States (CONUS) and
overseas bases using the automated payroll system, the Defense Finance and Accounting
Service, Denver, (DFAS-DE) prints and distributes the W-2s. Bases can request W2 self-mailer
forms through their Publication Distribution Office (PDO) to be used as a back-up to the DFAS-
DE W2 form. Self-mailers are subject to revision each year and must be ordered by September
through the base PDO.
46                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     6.32.1. The NAF AO manually prepares W-2s upon request by an employee, within 30 days
     after separation or transfer from the jurisdiction of the servicing payroll office during a
     payroll year.
     6.32.2. The NAF AO informs active employees of the necessity of providing current home
     addresses to the payroll office to ensure individual W-2s are received in a timely manner and
     of the importance of safeguarding these forms for their personal records. The NAF AO
     provides separating employees the payroll office point of contact, address, and phone number
     and advises employees to forward change of addresses no later than 1 December to ensure
     timely receipt of W2s. Employees should be informed that the NAF AO will accept a
     relative's address.
     6.32.3. The NAF AO retains returned TD Form W-2s which were sent to the last known
     address of a separated employee for 4 years according to AFIs 37-133 V1 and 37-133 V2.
     6.32.4. Amended or Duplicate Statements:
        6.32.4.1. If it is necessary to correct a TD Form W-2 after delivery to the employee,
        clearly mark the new TD Form W-2 "Corrected by Employer". Distribute copies as in
        6.32.1, 6.32.2, and 6.32.3 above.
        6.32.4.2. If the employee loses the copies of TD Form W-2, furnish substitute copies
        marked "Reissued by Employer."
        6.32.4.3. Obtain information concerning tax withholding matters of inactive bases or
        retired employees records from the FRC.
6.33. Withholding in Overseas Areas. NAFI employees who are US citizens in areas outside
the US are subject to all Federal taxes (FITW, FICA, and Medicare) the same as those employed
in the United States.
6.34. Withholding From Nonresident Aliens in the United States:
     6.34.1. Nonresidents and Noncitizens. IRS Publication 519, US Tax Guide for Aliens,
     prescribes the applicable tax rate for nonresident alien employees in the United States and its
     possessions.
     6.34.2. Determination of Status. Obtain written statements or other proof from the
     employees to determine their tax withholding status. File these documents separately using
     the same filing system as for the TD Form W-4 for other employees.
6.35. Withholding From Resident Aliens. Permanent resident aliens are subject to
withholding under the same rules that apply to United States citizens whether they perform their
services in the United States or outside the United States.
6.36. Local and State Government Reports. Follow local and state government directives.
Instead of reporting state and payroll taxes separately for each NAFI, the NAF AO files a single
tax return for all NAFIs.
6.37. Foreign Payroll Deductions:
     6.37.1. The NAF AO withholds taxes and deductions from the payroll of FNs (local
     indigenous or foreign aliens) as provided in international agreements or arrangements. Do
     not make foreign payroll deductions from the pay of United States citizens.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                 47


   6.37.2. Generally, the amounts withheld, remittance, and documentation are based on the
   requirements imposed upon employers by the foreign government.
6.38. Federal Payroll Taxes. The law requires employers to withhold FITW, FICA taxes, and
Medicare taxes from employees' pay. In addition, employers must contribute an amount equal to
employees' FICA and Medicare deductions. The NAF AO may use tax schedules published in
Circular E to compute these taxes.
   6.38.1. Withholding Agents. NAF AOs are designated agents to withhold FICA, Medicare,
   FITW, and approved state, territorial, and FN income tax from earnings of employees on
   their payrolls. All employees for whom an AO maintains pay records are considered under
   the same employer for federal payroll tax purposes.
   6.38.2. Employees Subject to Federal Payroll Taxes. All NAF employees are liable for
   federal taxes except nonresident aliens and third country nationals working outside the
   United States. Obtain the employees social security number from AF Form 2545 or TD
   Form W-4. Employees without a social security number should apply for one immediately.
   All new hires must furnish a signed, completed TD Form W-4 to their employer when they
   start work. Ensure you follow IRS rules when determining if an individual is a NAF
   employee versus a contractor.
   6.38.3. Compensation Subject to Federal Taxes. For employees covered under the Social
   Security Act, compensation subject to Federal income tax is subject to FICA and Medicare
   deductions.
       6.38.3.1. Federal and State Taxable Wage Base. The NAF AO advises employees of
       the various tax treatments on various pay and deduction amounts which could affect
       FITW and state income tax withholding (SITW). The FITW and SITW wage bases are
       equal to gross pay plus taxable tips less the sum of pretax health insurance, 401(k)
       deductions, charge tips, and nonforeign cost of living allowance (COLA) (if any).
       6.38.3.2. FICA and Medicare Taxable Wage Base. FICA and Medicare taxes are
       computed on gross pay plus taxable tips less the sum of pretax health insurance and
       charge tips.
       6.38.3.3. Tips. Tips are subject to all Federal payroll taxes and state taxes and the
       employee must report tips received to the employer each pay period. Refer to the current
       IRS Circular E for treatment of employee tips and other compensation. Reported tips are
       accumulated in the NAFMIS payroll system and recorded on the employee's W2 in the
       Social Security Tips box. Employers should inform tipped employees that the Social
       Security Administration (SSA) will use the tips they report when computing future social
       security benefits.
       6.38.3.4. Tax Withholding on Foreign Allowances and Differentials. In areas outside
       the United States, the gross amount on which federal payroll taxes are computed includes
       the Canal Zone tropical differential and foreign post differentials. As of 1991, FICA tax
       withholding is prohibited on foreign area allowances such as living quarters allowance,
       temporary lodging allowance, post allowance, supplemental post allowance, separate
       maintenance allowance, official residence expenses and nonforeign cost-of-living
       allowance payable to nonforeign areas including Alaska and Hawaii. The NAF AO must
       ensure foreign allowances are not processed as wages through the payroll.
48                                                          AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     6.38.4. FICA Wage Maximums. New legislation normally increases the FICA taxable
     wage base each year. Employee deductions and employer contributions are discontinued
     when the employee's cumulative FICA wage for the year exceeds the maximum amount.
     The new maximum is highlighted in the Circular E each year.
        6.38.4.1. FICA Refunds. Where an individual is employed by more than one employer
        during the calendar year and combined cumulative wages and taxes exceed the
        maximums established for that year, a refund of excess FICA and or Medicare tax can be
        claimed when filing IRS Form 1040. No refund is provided for an employer's
        contributions.
        6.38.4.2. FICA Adjustments. The NAF AO processes over or undercollection of
        employee(er) FICA and Medicare taxes through the automated pay system. Identify and
        correct errors during the same quarter the error occurred. Over or under collections
        processed in a subsequent quarter during the same calendar year are also adjusted on IRS
        Form 941. Do not process over or under collections from a prior calendar year through
        the automated pay system. Prepare a corrected TD Form W2-C and provide the
        employee their copy. Forward Copy A to your regional SSA office along with a TD
        Form W3-C for the total of all the TD Form W2-Cs. Be sure to reflect the adjustments
        on the NAF FICA Report (AVAP4Q) and IRS Form 941 for the 4th quarter, else file an
        IRS form 941-C. Refer to AFM 176-378 for specific guidance. When an employee's
        salary is included erroneously after maximum FICA wages have been reached, and the
        error is not discovered until after the IRS Form 941 has been submitted for the quarter,
        refund the amount of FICA overcollected from the employee. Include an adjustment on
        IRS Form 941 for the quarter in which the adjustment is made.
6.39. Quarterly and Annual Reports. Circular E provides the reporting requirements for
FICA tax and Federal income tax.
     6.39.1. Quarterly Reports. File IRS Form 941 by the 30th calendar day following the end
     of the quarter. Use the NAFMIS listing, NAF FICA Report (AVAP4J), to complete this
     form.
     6.39.2. Annual Reports. Bases with a manual payroll must file copy A of TD Form W-2s,
     supported by a TD Form W-3, Reconciliation of Income and Tax Withheld From Wages,
     by 28 February.
     6.39.3. Annual Magnetic Tape Reporting. For magnetic tape reporting of TD Form W-2
     information, follow established transmittal procedures in TIB-4a, Magnetic Tape Reporting,
     to submit wage and tax data to Federal and state agencies. Obtain the current TIB-4a from
     your regional SSA magnetic media coordinator. A revised publication is issued in August of
     each year.
        6.39.3.1. Federal Magnetic Tape Reporting. The NAFMIS payroll system produces
        the AVAS4T magnetic W2 tape at year end which complies with tape specifications
        outlined in TIB4-A. Enclose a completed IRS Form 6559, Transmitter Report and
        Summary of Magnetic Media, with SSA's magnetic media shipment. Do not file paper
        copy TD Form W2s when filing via magnetic media.
        6.39.3.2. State Magnetic Tape Reporting. Some states follow federal guidelines
        outlined in TIB-4 for reporting state wages and taxes on magnetic tape. In accordance
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                 49


       with TIB-4, the magnetic W2 tape produced by the NAFMIS payroll system includes a
       special "S" record for each employee with state wages and taxes. Contact your state for
       procedures on filing TD Form W2s via magnetic tape in lieu of paper copy or listing.
6.40. Annual Wage and Tax Reconciliations. Prior to filing IRS Form 941 for the 4th quarter,
reconcile quarterly totals from IRS Form 941s to annual totals reflected on the IRS Summary
Totals Listing, AVAP4Q and ensure cumulative wages and taxes are balanced. Refer to AFM
176-378 for specific guidance.
6.41. US Savings Bonds. The Air Force encourages purchase of US Savings Bonds through the
payroll savings plan. Personal advantages of the plan are publicized from time to time.
   6.41.1. Bond Documentation. Maintain a record of employees' bond deductions and
   purchases on the IPR. Do not use a subsidiary bond record.
   6.41.2. Employee Authorization for Bond Deduction. Employees must complete the
   appropriate standard forms to authorize payroll deductions; change a deduction, bond
   denomination, bond ownership, or address; or to discontinue a deduction. Employees
   complete a separate form for each bond.
   6.41.3. Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of Richmond Savings Bond Program. The FRB -
   Richmond offers a means of issuing savings bonds to employees if the local financial
   institution discontinues this service. Information can be obtained by calling commercial
   (804) 697-8378 and asking for the PC Diskette Program.
6.42. Other Authorized Deductions.
   6.42.1. Types. In addition to the deductions for which procedures have been previously
   prescribed, deductions are authorized for:
       6.42.1.1. Meals, quarters, and utility charges.
       6.42.1.2. Witness and jury fees.
       6.42.1.3. Federal tax levies (refer to the note in paragraph 6.42.1.13).
       6.42.1.4. Lump sum leave refunds.

       6.42.1.9. Allotments for alimony and child support as requested by other than variable
       schedule (VS) employees.
       6.42.1.10. Garnishment for child support or alimony or other indebtednesses (refer to
       AFI 34-202) (refer to the note in paragraph 6.42.1.13).
       6.42.1.11. Collection of indebtedness to NAFIs (refer to AFI 34-202) including:
          6.42.1.11.1. Travel advance refunds.
50                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


            6.42.1.11.2. Collection of hospital charges incurred in relation to employment.
            6.42.1.11.3. Miscellaneous authorized deductions, including indebtedness to the
            employing NAFI and indebtedness administratively determined under AFI 34-202.
        6.42.1.12. As ordered by a Federal bankruptcy court to pay all or any part of income due
        the employee to a trustee under PL 95-598 (11 U.S.C. 1101, and following) (refer to the
        note in paragraph 6.42.1.13).
        6.42.1.13. Judgments levied by United States Federal Court under Section 124 of PL 97-
        276. NOTE: Forward to HQ AFSVA/SVL, (Telephone 210-652-7051, DSN 487-7051).
        Service of process shall not be accomplished until HQ AFSVA/SVL has been properly
        served. For garnishments for child support or alimony or other indebtednesses, refer to
        AFI 34-202.
        6.42.1.14. Voluntary allotment by the employee to pay IRS back taxes.
     6.42.2. Priority of Deductions. When there is insufficient gross pay to deduct all
     authorized amounts, the automated pay system follows the order of withholding precedence
     for deductions as outlined in Title 6--Pay, Leave, and Allowances, of the GAO Policy and
     Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies.
6.43. Supporting Statement for Voluntary Deductions. When a voluntary payroll deduction
is taken, the employee must sign a statement authorizing the deduction. The NAF AO retains all
signed authorizations in the employee's payroll file.
6.44. Net Pay to Financial Institutions. When an employee requests deposit of net pay
directly in a financial institution, the NAF AO payroll technician establishes documentation as
required by the institution (for automated installations, refer to AFM 176-378). In all cases, be
certain that all requirements of the financial institution, pertaining to the acceptance of checks,
are satisfied before starting this program.
6.45. Tip Reporting and Allocation. Public Law 97-248 enacted the tip allocation as a means
of estimating tip income for tipped employees for tax purposes. Tip allocation requires large
employers (such as the Officers' Club, Enlisted Club, and Golf Course) located in one of the 50
states and the District of Columbia to allocate an amount to each employee equal to the
difference between reported tips and 8% of the individual's share of the gross food and beverage
sales. Review AFM 176-378 for detailed instructions.
     6.45.1. Tip Reporting. Within the Air Force, all tipped employees must record all tips
     (cash and charge) on a daily basis using IRS Form 4070A, Employees Daily Record of
     Tips, or a similar form as long as employees receive hard copies for their personal financial
     records. A tipped employee is one who customarily receives more than $9 tips each pay
     period. At the end of the pay period, employees consolidate cash and charge tips received, as
     documented on their copies of IRS Form 4070A, and complete IRS Form 4070, Employees
     Report of Tips to Employer. The employee signs IRS Form 4070 and turns in the
     completed form to the NAFI timekeeper at the end of the pay period. The activity requires
     negative reports from employees. Record nontip hours for time spent working a special
     function(s) or in a nontipped environment in applicable employees' timecards.
     6.45.2. Computing and Reporting Allocated Tips. The NAF AO maintains a list of all
     directly tipped employees by payday to include employee name, social security number,
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   51


   hours worked in a tipped environment, actual taxable tips reported, and any indirect tips paid
   out for the calendar year. Compute and report allocated tips to employees according to AFM
   176-378. Complete IRS Form 8027, Employees Annual Information Return of Tip
   Income and Allocated Tips, based on the tip allocation. Forward the 8027 to the IRS no
   later than 28 February annually.
   6.45.3. Reducing Tip Allocation. Employers and employees can apply to the IRS District
   Director of the district in which the employers food and beverage establishment is located to
   have the required 8% allocation of gross receipts reduced (not below 2%). The District
   Director determines the best estimate to be applied against gross receipts.
6.46. Service Charges. Service charges represent amounts shown on party contracts as the
additional fee a customer pays for services provided by club management and employees at a
special function. The membership flight chief prepares an operating instruction (OI) which
stipulates the service charges applied to party contracts. The OI establishes the amount of the
service charge (all, part, or none) that the activity distributes between the employees who worked
the party. Service charges paid to employees are not tips, and are treated as supplemental wage
payments and processed as earnings in the payroll system. Refer to AFM 176-378 for specific
guidance.
6.47. Group Health and Life Insurance. When an employee's pay is insufficient to cover
insurance contributions or the employee is in a leave without pay (LWOP) status, the NAFMIS
payroll system automatically charges the insufficient or unpaid employee amount to the
employing NAFI. It is the employing NAFI's responsibility to collect reimbursement from the
employee. Refer to AFM 176-378 for guidance. If the employee does not reimburse the NAFI
by the end of the pay period following the pay period in which the insufficiency occurred, it is
the responsibility of the NAF AO to contact the HRO for cancellation of the employee's
insurance coverage. Collect any unreimbursed employee contributions from the employee in
accordance with AFI 34-202. Make corrections to contributions through adjustments according
to AFM 176-378. Do not make manual adjustments to payments made to HQ AFSVA/SVXBI.
6.48. Workers' Compensation Program. Refer to AFI 34-308 for NAF AO responsibilities
with regard to workers' compensation matters.
   6.48.1. Benefits. Employees receiving workers' compensation benefits do not receive wages
   unless the workers' compensation benefit is for temporary partial disability or permanent
   partial disability.
   6.48.2. Withholding. Do not process workers' compensation benefits through the payroll
   since that benefit is not subject to withholding tax. Reverse wages and taxes from an
   employee's master record for any period in which leave was taken and, due to the duration or
   subsequent classification of the injury, the period was deemed covered and payable under the
   Workers' Compensation Program.
   6.48.3. Supplemental Leave. An injured employee entitled to workers' compensation
   benefits may choose to take supplemental leave while receiving workers' compensation
   benefits. Total combined compensation received cannot exceed average weekly wages (refer
   to AFI 34-308). The supplemental leave payment is subject to tax withholdings. While
   receiving workers' compensation, an employee is in a nonpay status and does not earn leave.
   Refer to AFM 176-378 for detailed instructions.
52                                                          AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


6.49. SF 1150. The NAF AO receives the SF 1150 from the HRO. The payroll office
completes this form for all terminating regular employees including those transferring to another
base, and those changed from regular to flexible. Record the balance of sick leave and annual
leave hours and annotate any lump sum leave paid and the hourly rate at which it was paid. In
addition, record any family medical leave taken in the past 12 month period. Retain a copy of
the SF 1150 in the payroll file. Return completed SF 1150 to the HRO.

                                          PROPERTY

7.1. When to Capitalize NAF Fixed Assets. When capitalizing NAF fixed assets, include all
related expenses such as freight, installation charges, and initial training costs, net of any
discounts.
   7.1.1. The cost and estimated useful life of furniture, equipment, and property determines
   whether the NAF AO posts the item in an asset or expense account (refer to Table 7.1).
   7.1.2. Where the activity manager and RMFC determine that the useful life may be shorter
   than listed in the table, due to type of use, etc., annotate the documentation. For expendable
   items refer to paragraph 7.16
   7.1.3. Other type assets used in the activity are recorded (for control purposes) with a zero
   dollar value (see AFI 34-204).
7.2. Construction-In-Progress. Construction-in-progress includes all costs attributable to an
ongoing construction project to include costs of new buildings, renovations of existing buildings,
and fixed assets purchased as part of the project.
   7.2.1. The NAF AO assigns a separate third digit shred to the Construction-in-Progress
   general ledger account (GLAC 185) for each ongoing project.
   7.2.2. The NAF AO maintains a separate subsidiary folder for each project. The subsidiary
   contains copies of all accounting related documents pertaining to the project (contract,
   modifications, budget approvals, copies of paid invoices, receiving reports, etc.). In addition
   to the detailed supporting documents, the subsidiary must contain a construction summary
   which lists the financial transactions relating to the project. As a minimum, the summary
   should list each payment, payment date, amount, and the purpose of the payment
   (construction, equipment, bulk purchases, supplies). The NAF AO must reconcile the
   subsidiary to the general ledger monthly. This summary and the back-up documents are used
   at the end of the project to remove items from the Construction-in-Progress account to the
   respective general ledger account codes
   7.2.3. When starting a new renovation, the NAF AO reviews the property list of the
   respective activity to identify previous renovations in the same activity. The RMFC,
   working with the activity manager, determines which previous renovations will be
   substantially changed by the new renovation. If the renovation description on the property
   list is unclear, the RMFC makes the final determination or changes the property description
   to include more descriptive information to better identify the renovation area. The RMFC
   writes-off the undepreciated value of a previous renovation when the new renovation
   substantially changes the previous one, The undepreciated value is written-off to the
   Gain/Loss on Disposal of Assets accounts in the benefiting activity (GLAC 913 or 813). See
   paragraph 7.14 for information on disposal documentation.
   7.2.4. During a construction or renovation project for NAF facilities or facility
   improvements, the NAF AO posts payments for the project to the applicable Construction-in-
   Progress account. This includes project payments for contract progress payments, design
   costs, needs assessments, purchases of equipment items which are part of the project, and
54                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     purchases of supplies which the activity will not use until the project is complete. The NAF
     AO posts amounts based on documentation supporting the contract completion. When
     contractors base progress payments on a percentage of completion clause, post the amount
     due, or paid, into construction-in-progress.
     7.2.5. When the base takes beneficial occupancy of the building, the project is considered
     complete and the amounts in the Construction-in-Progress account must be moved to the
     appropriate asset and expense accounts. The beneficial occupancy date is when the
     program/function for which the facility/project was intended is operating and/or open to
     customers. There may be some items that require additional work, but, unless these prevent
     the use of the facility, the project is considered 100 percent construction complete.
        7.2.5.1. The SV deputy notifies the NAF AO, in writing, as soon as a project reaches the
        beneficial occupancy date using the guidance in AFI 34-105, Programming for NAF
        Facility Requirements.
        7.2.5.2. Upon receipt of the memo, the NAF AO moves the project costs from the
        Construction-in-Progress account to the proper asset or expense accounts within 30 days
        of the beneficial occupancy date.
            7.2.5.2.1. If you are capturing equipment cost in construction-in-progress until the
            activity puts the equipment in use, record each equipment item, individually, in the
            fixed-asset equipment account if it qualifies to be capitalized.
            7.2.5.2.2. Post the total cost of the project, except for equipment, expendable items,
            and supply items, into the applicable Fixed-Asset--Facilities and Renovations GLAC.
            7.2.5.2.3. . The RMFC and civil engineers (CE) establish the facility depreciation
            periods according to Table 7.2 Submit completion report as required by AFI 34-201.
        7.2.5.3. The RMFC must certify that the project is correctly transferred out of the
        Construction-in-Progress account and recorded into the appropriate asset and expense
        accounts. The RMFC provides a certification memo and a copy of the general journal
        detail listing showing the transfer of the entries from the Construction-in-Progress
        account to the appropriate accounts to the Services deputy.
     7.2.6. The Services deputy also notifies the NAF AO, in writing, when a project is canceled
     or put on indefinite hold. Once notified that a project is canceled or put on indefinite hold,
     the NAF AO must remove any project costs from the Construction-in-Progress account
     within 30 days of the written notification. These costs are normally design costs or needs
     assessment costs. The amount is expensed directly to the Gain/Loss on Disposal of Assets
     account in the benefiting activity. The RMFC must follow the guidance in paragraph 7.2.5.3
     also.
     7.2.7. Many times when a project reaches the beneficial occupancy date, the NAF AO has
     not received all final bills. Do no delay removing the project from the Construction-in-
     Progress account because all bills have not been received. If the final invoice is received
     within three months of the initial set-up of the project (the time the project was moved to
     asset and expense accounts), delete the original asset from the financial reports and re-
     establish the asset with the new dollar value. If the final invoice is received after 3 months,
     record the transactions under the same asset number and assign a suffix to identify the new
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   55


   entry with the original property item. For example, if the original property number is 10010,
   assign 10010A, B, etc. for final invoices received after three months.
7.3. Fixed Assets-APF Titled. The activity manager, working with the logistics manager, may
transfer NAF procured property or facilities to APF for maintenance when allowed by AFIs 34-
201 and 65-106. The NAF AO posts these items in the NAF property records and general ledger
as Fixed Assets-APF titled (signifies government title). Depreciate them according to Table 7.2
Include the following footnote in the balance sheet: "The title of real property financed with
nonappropriated funds and reported hereon is vested in the United States Government. See AFI
34-204 to determine what assets are to be recorded on the Master Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL).
7.4. Live Stock. Value horses at their purchase price plus transportation and other incidental
costs of taking possession. The useful life guidelines recommended for all stallions, geldings,
and mares regardless of breed is 16 years (through the 15th year of age). Depreciate according to
Table 7.2 Record any foals produced by breeding as property. Accumulate all costs associated
with the pregnancy and birth of foals. If the aggregate cost of a successful birth reaches $1,000
or more, capitalize the foal and depreciate according to Table 7.2 If the aggregate cost of a
successful birth is under $1,000, expense to the applicable CCC. In this instance, record the foal
on the property records with a zero book value for accountability purposes. In the case of
unsuccessful births, expense all related costs.
7.5. Grants. When the base receives grant funds to acquire fixed assets, facilities, livestock,
etc., refer to paragraph 8.18
7.6. Donations. The receiving manager, working with the logistics manager, prepares AF Form
2534, NAF Property Disposal/Transfer Receipt, to accept a fixed asset donation. The NAF
AO depreciates donations of fixed assets according to Table 7.2 if the donation has a value of
$1,000 or more and a useful life of two or more years. Refer to AFI 34-201 for donation
approval levels.
7.7. Non-reimbursable Transfers. Record property items received from, or transferred to,
another Air Force NAFI as a transfer of equity. The NAF AO uses the fair market value of the
items transferred as the acquisition price of the transferred equity. Capitalize items transferred
with a value of $1,000 or more, including all transportation, training, or related charges. These
items must have a useful life of two years or more. Depreciate the asset according to Table 7.2
Expense those items valued at less than $1,000 to the applicable receiving activity and those
items with a useful life of less than two years. Refer to AFI 34-201 for additional guidance
concerning inter- and intra-NAFI transfers.
7.8. General Services Administration (GSA) Seized Property. The activity may incur NAF
costs to acquire GSA seized property, however the NAFI does not have title and control of this
property.
   7.8.1. If it meets the criteria in AFI 34-209 and Table 7.1, the NAF AO capitalizes the
   property as Fixed Assets-APF (GLAC 183).
       7.8.1.1. Depreciate it to the activity receiving the benefit of the property.
       7.8.1.2. Value the property at zero plus NAF costs to acquire the property (such as repair
       costs, transportation costs, storage fees, and so forth).
       7.8.1.3. Use Table 7.2 to determine the useful life.
56                                                              AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


NOTE: Reclassify GSA seized property recorded as fixed assets-NAF (GLAC 181) to fixed
assets-APF-(GLAC 183).
     7.8.2. The NAFI cannot sell or trade GSA seized property. Activity managers follow AFIs
     34-201 and 34-204 when the property becomes unserviceable or when they no longer need
     the property.
        7.8.2.1. HQ AFSVA/CC approves requests to turn in GSA seized property to DRMO.
        7.8.2.2. Once approved, the activity manager turns it into DRMO.
        7.8.2.3. The NAF AO uses the procedures in paragraph 7.14 to post the disposition.
7.9. DRMO Property. The activity may incur NAF costs to acquire DRMO property, however
the NAFI does not have title and control of this property.
     7.9.1. If it meets the criteria in AFI 34-209 and Table 7.1, the NAF AO capitalizes the
     property as Fixed Assets-APF (GLAC 183).
        7.9.1.1. Depreciate it to the activity receiving the benefit of the property.
        7.9.1.2. Value the property at zero plus NAF costs to acquire the property (such as repair
        costs, transportation costs, storage fees, and so forth).
        7.9.1.3. Use Table 7.2 to determine the useful life.
        7.9.1.4. If the acquisition does not meet the criteria in AFI 34-209, expense the
        acquisition costs to the applicable activity.
     7.9.2. The activity manager, working with the logistics manager, must mark all DRMO
     property to distinguish it from NAFI owned (titled) property. Refer to AFI 34-204 to account
     for DRMO property.
7.10. Leases:
     7.10.1. A capital lease is based on the concept that a lease transfers substantially all of the
     benefits and risk as to the ownership of equipment to the lessee. The lessee records a capital
     lease as an asset (GLAC 188). The lessee amortizes the leases in a manner similar to
     depreciating assets. The period of amortization may vary. Amortize a capital lease over the
     life of the asset if:
        7.10.1.1. The lease transfers ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term, or the
        lease contains a purchase option. A purchase option in the lease agreement allows the
        lessee to purchase the leased property at the end of the lease for a price that is
        predetermined by amount or method of calculation.
        7.10.1.2. The lease is $1,000 or more with a useful life of 2 years or more.
     7.10.2. Central NAF Capital Lease Program. The following policies apply.
        7.10.2.1. NAFIs will not obtain cash loans, deferred time payments, lines of credit, or
        capital leases from commercial or other non-Air Force sources without prior approval of
        HQ USAF/ILV.
        7.10.2.2. This program will be operated through the Air Force Financial Management
        Fund (AFFMF).
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                  57


     7.10.2.3. All leases under this program will be established with a lease payment of both
     principal and interest (interest factor subject to change quarterly – Oct, Jan, Apr, and Jul
     equal to the interest the AFFMF would have earned on invested monies).
     7.10.2.4. All leases will be for the estimated useful life of the leased property as the
     ownership of the asset will be transferred from the AFFMF to the applicable base NAFI
     once the asset is purchased.
     7.10.2.5. Leases from the AFFMF are solely for equipment items; all facility acquisitions
     must be processed through the Air Force Base Capital Improvement Fund (AFBCIF).
     7.10.2.6. HQ AFSVA/SVF will establish lease terms for repayment terms consistent with
     GAAP.
        7.10.2.6.1. If the base cannot meet the monthly payment, the MAJCOM successor
        fund will be responsible for payment. If neither can fund, ownership of the asset will
        revert to the AFFMF and the custodian will determine appropriate disposition.
     7.10.2.7. Monthly lease payments will be made through CMIP, Cash Transfer (CT).
     7.10.2.8. To obtain approval for a central NAF capital lease:
        7.10.2.8.1. The NAFI must budget for the lease of the capital asset to ensure cash
        flow will sustain the monthly payments. The installation NAFs Council and
        installation commander must approve the lease request. Budget of this expense is
        through the Income and Expense Budget.
        7.10.2.8.2. The installation commander receiving the lease request takes one of the
        following actions:
            7.10.2.8.2.1. Approves submission of the request if it is determined to be valid,
            forwards the request to the MAJCOM/SV to HQ AFSVA/SVF, and funds
            payments from available local NAFI resources.
            7.10.2.8.2.2. Disapproves submission of the request in whole or in part and
            returns it to the initiator through channels.
        7.10.2.8.3. The installation commander submits the request in writing with a
        description of the requirement, justification, funding source, indication of the NAF
        Council’s support, and any additional information that supports the request.
        7.10.2.8.4. The MAJCOM/SV will ensure support or non-support for the request
        from the MAJCOM/CC or designee, and will forward supported lease requests to HQ
        AFSVA/SVF and return those not supported to the requesting bases.
        7.10.2.8.5. HQ AFSVA/SVF will validate the request seeking input from Agency
        functional representatives. If valid, the request will be forwarded to HQ USAF/ILV
        for decision through AFSVA/CC.
        7.10.2.8.6. If approved by HQ USAF/ILV, the asset will be purchased by AFNAFPO
        for the AFFMF with delivery instructions to the requesting base.
        7.10.2.8.7. Once the base receives the asset, AFSVA will begin to withdraw payment
        of principal and interest through CMIP. Amounts collected will be deposited in the
        AFFMF.
58                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     7.10.3. An operating lease does not meet the criteria of a capital lease as listed above. The
     NAF AO posts the cost of an operating lease as rental expense (GLAC 793) using the
     appropriate cost center code when payment is made. Make payments in accordance with the
     rental agreement.
     7.10.4. Treat capital leases not covered in paragraph 7.10.2 as operating leases. Record
     rental expense (GLAC 793) to the applicable cost center over the life of the lease agreement.
7.11. Repair of Fixed Assets. The NAF AO expenses to the applicable cost center any repair
costs of fixed assets that do not meet the criteria for capitalization in AFI 34-209. The
procedures for capitalizing repairs of fixed assets contained in AFI 34-209 apply to repairs of
NAF-purchased fixed assets, seized equipment (for example, aircraft and boats), leased aircraft,
DRMO-obtained equipment, and APF equipment bought for Category C activities before 1 Oct
90 that is still in our facilities and is serviceable. Record repair costs of APF-titled equipment in
Category C activities (for the equipment that was bought before 1 Oct 90) as a new asset when it
meets the criteria in AFI 34-209.
7.12. Depreciation. Refer to the guidance in AFI 34-209. Depreciation accounting distributes
the cost or other basic value of tangible capital assets over the estimated useful life of such assets
in a systematic and rational manner. Accounting for depreciation as an expense is an integral
part of the accrual basis of accounting. Accordingly, all capitalized assets paid for with NAFs
are depreciated over the expected useful lives of such assets.
     7.12.1. The NAF AO computes depreciation by item on a straight-line basis beginning the
     first month after receipt and continuing through the month of disposal or month of 100%
     depreciation, unless a salvage value is established (refer to paragraph 7.12.3).
     7.12.2. The NAF AO computes depreciation based on the cost of assets. Charge
     depreciation expense to the CCC where the property is located. Assign periods of projected
     life based on minimum, midpoint, and maximum ranges in Table 7.2 Although the
     procedure for assignment of these periods is the same for both new, used, or repaired
     property, the life expectancy of used or repaired property shall not normally be greater than
     the midpoint shown in the table. Establish the periods based on the expected useful life as
     shown in the examples below. Do not change the periods of projected life during the
     accounting year. The number of periods may be changed at the beginning of a FY if enough
     evidence exists to show that the life expectancy has changed. Do not make these changes
     retroactively.
        7.12.2.1. Establish depreciation periods in increments of 12-month periods.
        7.12.2.2. Charge depreciation to the cost center where the property is actually located.
        7.12.2.3. In a lodging fund, distribute depreciation based on the designation of the
        facility where the property is located.
        7.12.2.4. Do not charge depreciation to a NAFI’s or activity’s administrative cost center
        code except when it meets the criteria in AFI 34-209.
     7.12.3. Except for aircraft, DRMO or Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office
     (AFNAFPO) (Directorate of NAF Purchasing, Purchasing and Management Support
     Division (HQ AFSVA/SVCK)) assesses salvage value. The NAF AO uses the salvage value,
     when established, to determine the depreciable value.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   59


       7.12.3.1. Aircraft. The aero club manager uses a current aircraft price guide to
       determine salvage value for aircraft. The Recreation and Business Branch (HQ
       AFSVA/SVPAR) determines the price guide that the aero club manager will use.
7.13. Trade-In of Assets. The SV commander or director approves trade-in of fixed assets. Do
not trade-in assets transferred to APF records. Refer to AFI 34-209 for additional guidance.
7.14. Disposition of Assets. The accounting procedures for disposing of NAF property
contained in AFI 34-209 apply to all assets including those acquired by transfer or donation
(unless there is an exception stated in this chapter). See AFI 34-204 for detailed instructions to
be followed when disposing of assets.
   7.14.1. Upon receipt of the AF Form 2534, the NAF AO posts the disposition in the property
   subsidiaries and general ledger records.
7.15. NAF Fixed Assets Inventory. As a minimum, activities must conduct a physical
inventory of NAF fixed assets at least once during each fiscal year. Personnel from activities,
other than the activity being inventoried, observe activity personnel as they take the impartial
physical inventory. See AFI 34-204 for fixed asset inventory requirements, procedures and
individual responsibilities.
7.16. Acquisition of Expendable Items: The activity marks expendable equipment items for
identification of ownership.
   7.16.1. High Value Items:
       7.16.1.1. Quantity Expendable (Bulk) Purchases. To qualify as quantity expendable
       (bulk) equipment items, the purchase must meet the following criteria:
               - Each equipment item in the bulk purchase must cost below $1,000.
               - Each equipment item in the bulk purchase must have a useful life of two years
                 or more.
               - The entire bulk purchase must have a collective value of $2,000 or more.
               - The bulk purchase is made up of like equipment items.
           7.16.1.1.1. The following types of equipment items qualify as quantity expendable
           (bulk) purchases of equipment (if they meet the criteria in 7.16.1.1):
               7.16.1.1.1.1. Televisions, microwaves.
               7.16.1.1.1.2. Tables, chairs, bar stools.
               7.16.1.1.1.3. Mattresses, box springs.
               7.16.1.1.1.4. Curtains, drapes, and carpets.
               7.16.1.1.1.5. Other similar expendable equipment items
           7.16.1.1.2. The NAF AO:
               7.16.1.1.2.1. Posts the full acquisition cost to Non-Current Assets-Quantity
               Expendable (Bulk) Equipment items (GLAC 171).
               7.16.1.1.2.2. Posts monthly amortization expense (GLAC 796, 797, 798, or 799)
60                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


               in the operating statement to the benefiting CCC.
               7.16.1.1.2.3. Amortizes these items according to Table 7.2 for small or light
               assets. EXCEPTION: If the activity manager determines that the useful life is
               lower than that table, use the lower useful life. NOTE: If the activity manager
               determines that the useful life is under two years then you record the bulk
               purchase as an expense (or in a prepaid asset account). Refer to paragraph 7.16.3.
               7.16.1.1.2.4. Begins amortizing these purchases in the month following receipt of
               the purchase.
               7.16.1.1.2.5. Bulk purchased items will remain on property subsidiary until
               disposed of.
        7.16.1.2. Volume Purchases of High Value Supplies. SV may treat certain types of bulk
        purchases as volume purchases of high value supply items. These items do not qualify
        for the procedures in paragraph 7.16.1.1 Each supply item in the bulk purchase must
        have a useful life of three months or more. The RMFC, working with the SV commander
        or division chief, sets a policy to determine the dollar value for high value supplies
        purchased in volume. (see AFI 34-204)
            7.16.1.2.1. The following supply-type items qualify as bulk purchases of high value
            supplies (if they meet the criteria in paragraph 7.16.1.2):
               7.16.1.2.1.1. Stainless steelware.
               7.16.1.2.1.2. Glassware.
               7.16.1.2.1.3. Linens.
               7.16.1.2.1.4. Glass coffee pots/servers.
               7.16.1.2.1.5. Irons and ironing boards.
               7.16.1.2.1.6. Bowling pins.
               7.16.1.2.1.7. Other similar supply-type items.
            7.16.1.2.2. The NAF AO:
               7.16.1.2.2.1. Posts the acquisition costs to short-term/long-term prepaid expenses
               (GLAC 130/194). Items may be prorated for a maximum of three years (one year
               short-term and two years long-term). Do not exceed the life of the items in the
               volume purchase.
               7.16.1.2.2.2. Posts monthly supply expense (GLAC 720) in the operating
               statement to the benefiting cost center (CCC).
               7.16.1.2.2.3. Establishes a minimum proration of $200 or above, but do not
               prorate over a period that is less than 3 months, or greater than the life of the item.
     7.16.2. Small Value Items. Other expendable items are defined as small purchases of
     towels, handcloths, linens, kitchen utensils, guest checks, accounts receivable statements,
     expendable equipment) etc.. The NAF AO posts the acquisition cost to short-term/long-term
     prepaid expenses (GLAC 130/194). You may prorate these for up to 2 years (1 year short-
     term and 1 year long-term). Do not exceed the life of the supply. Post monthly supply

   expense (GLAC 720) in the benefiting cost center. The RMFC, working with the SV
   commander or director, establishes a local policy on when an activity uses the prepaid asset
   account and when the activity directly expenses the purchase. When determining whether
   you should post an item in the prepaid expense account, consider such factors as the amount
   of revenue earned by the NAFI and the materiality of the purchase to the NAFI. Apply this
   policy consistently from one accounting period to the next. Do not base your decision on the
   current financial condition of the activity. To ensure only material purchases are treated as
   prepaid expenses, establish a minimum proration per month of $75 or above but do not
   prorate the expense over a period that is greater than the life of the item.
7.17. Reserved.
7.18. Aero Clubs. Do not set up accruals for major renovations or engine overhauls to be
performed in the future.
   7.18.1. Aircraft Capital Improvements. The NAF AO sets up capital improvements made to
   an aircraft in the fixed asset system as a repair. The repair should include adequate
   descriptions, serial numbers etc. to enable identification of the improvement. The fixed asset
   system will separately identify the addition to the original aircraft as part of that aircraft but
   will identify it separately.
7.19. NAF Labor Costs Incurred During Self-Help Renovation Projects:
   7.19.1. Capitalizing NAF labor as part of the total project cost for self-help renovation
   projects must meet the following criteria:
      7.19.1.1. The total NAF funds spent on the project (including NAF labor) must be
      $1,000 or more and the construction/renovation must have a useful life of 2 years or
      more. HQ AFSVA/SVXF approves, in writing, requests to complete self-help projects
      with a total cost of $200,000 or over. Include a break-out of all the estimated costs and a
      justification for the project.
      7.19.1.2. The base CEs must approve the self-help project (approved work order, AF
      Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, and other approvals as required by AFI
      32-1022).
      7.19.1.3. NAF labor costs must be material (i.e. significant) in relationship to the total
      project cost. The costs to capture the information accurately should not outweigh the
      benefits received.
      7.19.1.4. Capitalize only those NAF labor costs directly related to the project. For
      example, capitalize labor costs for carpenters, electricians, and laborers, but do not
      capitalize support staff such as accounting and administrative support as these costs were
      not direct costs in constructing the asset.
      7.19.1.5. Do not include fixed overhead costs unless they are increased because of the
      construction/renovation. Do not capitalize management salaries unless this expense
      increases because of the construction of the asset.
      7.19.1.6. Do not apply this policy to instances where APFs are authorized to complete
      the project. Follow guidance in AFI 32-1022 and AFI 65-106 to determine whether the
      project is authorized APF support or not.
62                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


        7.19.1.7. NAF employees allowed to work on construction/renovation projects must
        work within the scope of their authorized position guides/descriptions.
     7.19.2. Follow these procedures to control and account for self-help renovation projects:
        7.19.2.1. The activity manager includes the project (total cost including NAF labor) on
        the NRB according to Chapter 3. Total NAF labor cost includes hours worked times
        the rate of pay adjusted for any differentials, overtime, premiums, plus all applicable
        benefits (retirement, employer's share of FICA, insurance, workers compensation, and so
        on).
        7.19.2.2. The activity manager forwards a request to the RMFC before the project starts.
        Include any AF Form 9s, Request for Purchase, for materials, individual service
        contracts, and an estimate of the total NAF labor cost (include employees' names for
        accountability purposes). Attach the approved work order from the base CEs. Annotate
        the work order number on all documentation relating to this project.
        7.19.2.3. The RMFC establishes a project folder for each self-help project to track the
        obligation and expenditure of funds.
        7.19.2.4. The activity manager tracks and captures the NAF labor costs. At the end of
        each month, forward a labor transfer memorandum to the RMFC. The manager's
        signature on the labor memorandum is that manager's certification that the hours
        annotated were worked directly in support of the project involved.
        7.19.2.5. The NAF AO does not reduce the applicable personnel expense GLACs by the
        amount of the labor transfer. Instead, credit the Personnel Expense-Self Help Projects
        contra account (GLAC 680) for the amount of the labor transfer and debit construction-
        in-progress (GLAC 185). Use the cost center code of the activity where the employee is
        originally assigned. The credit to GLAC 680 offsets the personnel expense remaining in
        the personnel expense GLACs. If an employee works on a project for another NAFI,
        process a dollar transfer of funds.

                                             Chapter 8

                      REVENUE AND PROMOTIONAL PROCESSING

8.1. Daily Revenue Processing. Refer to AFI 34-209 for activity instructions for the AF Forms
1875, NAF Individual Cashier's Report (ICR), and 1876, NAF Consolidated Cost Center
Report. The activity manager forwards the completed AF Form 1876, charge tickets, A/R
payment receipts, special function forms, prorata sheets, cash refunds, redeemed coupons and
redeemed gift certificates to the NAF AO. The NAF AO uses this information to post revenue
transactions into the accounting systems. In this process, the NAF AO:
     8.1.1. Verifies and processes AF Forms 1876 or the cash reconciliation report (for lodging).
     8.1.2. Maintains A/R subsidiary records. Refer to Chapter 9 for A/R procedures.
     8.1.3. Maintains, controls, and reports delinquent accounts and returned checks.
     8.1.4. Prepares schedules to support the financial statement as required.
     8.1.5. Receives AF Form 1875 from activities for retention in accordance with AFIs 37-
     133V1 and 37-133 V2. Refer to paragraph 8.4
     8.1.6. Prepares a list, by employee, of charge tips from A/R charge tickets. Prepare this list
     by employee. Compare this amount with the amount reported on the AF Form 1876.
     Forward this list to the payroll technician at the end of each pay period. This lists supports
     the amount paid to the employee.
     8.1.7. Receives banquet, party, or special function forms.
8.2. Special Function Gratuities. The membership support flight chief writes a local OI on the
treatment of special function gratuities in SV NAF activities. In the OI, establish the percent of
the gratuity, if any, that the employee working the function receives. Ensure this percent is
consistent for all NAF activities. The NAF AO posts the gratuity as revenue (support service
fees). Extract gratuities by employee and maintain a manual ledger through the end of the pay
period. This ledger serves as a subsidiary for payments to employees for gratuities. Forward the
record to the payroll technician at the end of the pay period. The payroll technician compares
this information against T&A reports.
8.3. Accountability Using Point of Sale (POS) System:
     8.3.1. Activities using POS systems that provide individual cashier accountability do not
     have to use an AF Form 1875 except to maintain a daily log of change funds issued to
     cashiers and total funds turned in by each cashier. Cashiers sign the AF Form 1875 for
     change funds received and the manager or other authorized individual signs for all cash
     turned in at the end of each shift. Also, use the AF Form 1875 to record individual overages
     or shortages and to account for controlled forms.
     8.3.2. The manager or designee takes the register readings daily and determines each
     cashier's accountability.
8.4. AF Form 1875. The activity manager or designee accumulates ICRs and its supporting
documents. Send this documentation to the NAF AO for filing.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                        69


   8.4.1. The activity manager and the RMFC may agree that the activity may retain AF Forms
   1875 and its supporting documents for a given period (for example, 1 week, 1 month, or a 3
   month period). At the end of the designated period, the activity sends the documents to the
   NAF AO for filing. The RMFC documents this agreement. Both the activity and the NAF
   AO keep a copy of this agreement on file. The NAF AO keeps their copy in the LOF file.
8.5. Cash Refunds. The activity reports cash refunds made from receipts as a separate line item
in the accountability section of AF Forms 1875 and 1876. Post the refund as a decrease to the
appropriate income account and to cash-in-bank. Refer to AFI 34-202 for refund authority.
8.6. Petty Cash Purchases From Change Funds/Receipts. The activity reports purchases
made from change funds/receipts as a separate line item in the accountability section of AF
Forms 1875 and 1876. Post the purchase to the appropriate expense account and as a decrease to
the cash-in-bank. Refer to AFI 34-202 for procedures and authority.
8.7. Returned Checks. Refer to paragraph 9.18 for instructions on recording returned checks,
including NAF and bank service charges.
8.8. Telephone Charges. The NAF AO records revenue from customer telephone charges as
income to Support Service Fees (GLAC 507) using the administrative cost center code and to the
appropriate asset account. When the NAF AO pays the telephone company for these telephone
charges, record the payment as an expense to the telephone expense account (GLAC 787).
8.9. Promotions. When SV opens the entertainment or promotional event to the entire base, the
NAF AO posts the expense and revenue to a miscellaneous CCC (M3, M8 or M9, as applicable).
In a membership activity, when the activity opens the entertainment or promotional event to the
entire membership, the NAF AO posts the expense to the activity's administrative CCC unless
another CCC is specified to be used as stated in Attachment 3. The activity may transfer labor
expense that they specifically schedule and use in conjunction with the promotional event for a
particular activity to the administrative cost center for that activity. Examples are club
membership night and child development center open house. Use AF Form 2533, NAF
Transfer Between Cost Centers (TBCC), or automated order entry registers to document cost
of goods or services transferred. The NAF AO enters costs of individual items and computes
totals to update financial records.
8.10. Coupons. When an activity cashier accepts a coupon, the cashier rings up the entire sale
amount using the normal process and accepts the coupon as a cash substitute. Do not reduce the
amount rung-up for the sale by the amount of the coupon. The general change fund cashier
records all redeemed coupons as coupons redeemed on the AF Form 1876. When the NAF AO
posts the AF Form 1876, they post the revenue to the applicable accounts (sales or fees and
charges). The NAF AO posts the total value of redeemed coupons to coupon expense in the
activity where the customer redeemed the coupon. The NAF AO posts the cost of printing
coupons to supplies. Refer to AFI 34-202 for coupon (NAF and commercial) accountability
procedures.
8.11. Gift Certificates. Customers buy gift certificates for later redemption of goods or
services. Refer to AFI 34-202 for gift certificate issuance and control procedures.
   8.11.1. When a customer purchases a gift certificate:
       8.11.1.1. The activity cashier rings the purchase on the cash register for accountability.
70                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


        8.11.1.2. The general change fund cashier records the total dollar amount for purchased
        gift certificates on the AF Form 1876 in Unearned Income (GLAC 232).
        8.11.1.3. The NAF AO posts the AF Form 1876 including the credit to Unearned Income
        (GLAC 232) for the gift certificates purchased.
     8.11.2. When a customer redeems a gift certificate:
        8.11.2.1. The activity cashier treats the gift certificate as if it were cash and redeems the
        certificate for one purchase transaction.
        8.11.2.2. The activity cashier rings up the actual retail price of the sale on the cash
        register.
        8.11.2.3. The general change fund cashier records the total amount of the gift certificates
        redeemed on the AF Form 1876 as a decrease to the Unearned Income account (GLAC
        232) for the face value of the gift certificate.
        8.11.2.4. The NAF AO posts the AF Form 1876 including the debit to Unearned Income
        (GLAC 232) for the gift certificates redeemed.
        8.11.2.5. The activity manager determines whether customers can be given change when
        redeeming gift certificates. If the activity manager allows change to be given for sales
        that fall below the gift certificate value, then the activity manager should set this at a
        minimal amount.
8.12. Recycling Program. The installation commander determines the use of recycling funds in
Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities through the budgetary process. The NAF AO
maintains accountability for recycling funds generated from DRMO through the Quality
Recycling Program (QRP) separate from recycling funds generated from local NAF contractors.
     8.12.1. For funds received through the DRMO process:
        8.12.1.1. The installation commander instructs FSO to issue a check for the MWRF's
        share of the proceeds.
        8.12.1.2. When received, the NAF AO posts the entire amount as Cash-in-Bank-
        Checking (GLAC 101) and Resource, Recovery, and Recycling Program (RRRP) income
        (GLAC 820) to the recycling cost center code.
     8.12.2. For funds received from local NAF contracts where the SV commander or director
     has established a formal consolidated program:
        8.12.2.1. The NAF AO posts non-DRMO revenue (SV selling bottles/cans it receives to
        an outside contractor) in activity revenue (GLAC 501).
        8.12.2.2. The NAF AO posts expenses (payments made to individuals at redemption
        centers, for total poundage, for refunds per bottle/can, for other type purchases of items
        such as bottles and cans, and etc.) as miscellaneous operating expenses.
        8.12.2.3. The NAF AO posts other normal recurring expenses incurred in conjunction
        with recycling (such as personnel, supplies, and depreciation) in the appropriate GLAC.
        8.12.2.4. Do not record recycling revenue in sales and do not record recycling expenses
        in purchases.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                    71


   8.12.3. For funds received from local NAF contract when the SV commander or director has
   not established a formal consolidated program, the NAF AO posts income and expense to the
   individual activity generating the revenue. Post the revenue as miscellaneous income
   (GLAC 812), if the source of revenue is not material and recurring. Post the revenue as
   activity revenue (Fees and Charges, GLAC 501), if the source of revenue is material and
   recurring.
8.13. Token Accountability. Refer to AFIs 34-202 and 34-115, Air Force Club Program, for
token control and safeguard.
   8.13.1. The general change fund cashier in the activity records the total amount of tokens
   sold on the AF Form 1876 as an increase to Unearned Income (GLAC 232).
   8.13.2. When customers redeem tokens, the individual cashier rings up the entire sale and
   accepts the tokens instead of cash payment. The general change fund cashier in the activity
   records the total amount of tokens redeemed under the accountability section of the AF Form
   1876 as a decrease to Unearned Income (GLAC 232).
   8.13.3. Members may redeem unused tokens when they resign from the club. The general
   change fund cashier in the activity records the redemption in the AF Form 1876 as a decrease
   to Unearned Income (GLAC 232).
   8.13.4. When the activity changes a series of tokens, the general change fund cashier records
   the unredeemed tokens from the old series as a decrease to Unearned Income (GLAC 232)
   and an increase to Miscellaneous Income (GLAC 812), using the activity's administrative
   cost center on the AF Form 1876. The NAF AO verifies this to the subsidiary record for
   Unearned Income (GLAC 232) and posts the transaction to the general ledger. If a shortages
   occurs, post this amount to Miscellaneous Expense (GLAC 912).
8.14. Discounted Revenue. When an activity gives reduced prices to customers, the activity
treats this as discounted revenue. Examples of discounted sales are reduced price beverages in a
bar, a percent discount allowed to club members in the dining room, an aero club member's
purchase of block time at reduced rates, and sale prices of merchandise in pro-shops. The
activity cashier rings up the sale at the discounted price. The activity absorbs the expense of the
discounted sale in the cost of goods or as a reduction to fees and charges sold by the activity
providing the discount. Account for discounted employee meals according to this paragraph.
8.15. Cash Overages and Shortages. Account for cash overages and shortages in the
appropriate cost center that had the overage or shortage. The activity manager reports overages
and shortages according to AFI 34-202.
8.16. Allocations. HQ AFSVA/SVF calculates the Army and Air Force Exchange Service
(AAFES) simplified dividend as a percentage of AAFES revenues generated on each base. In
addition, MAJCOMs receive an allocation computed on the basis of a percentage of the
distributions their bases receive. HQ AFSVA distributes the amounts for the month, based on
the AAFES revenues of two months prior. Therefore, the NAF AO will not normally need to
accrue current month distributions if they also receive the distribution in the current month. The
Air Force MWRF distributes the simplified dividend monthly through CMIP. The NAF AO
posts the distribution as an allocation.
8.17. Foreign Currency. There are two types of foreign currency translations that occur:
72                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     8.17.1. Accommodation Sales. When NAF activities sell foreign currency, activity
     personnel:
        8.17.1.1. Compute the gain or loss on foreign currency on hand at the beginning of each
        business day based on changes between the prior and current day's wholesale rates.
        8.17.1.2. Purchase enough foreign currency for resale to support the immediate needs
        and not for speculation.
        8.17.1.3. Sell the foreign currency at a rate that is no more favorable to the customer than
        the military banking facility (MBF) accommodation rate. Profit on the sale is the
        difference between the purchase (wholesale) rate and the selling (accommodation) rate.
        8.17.1.4. Prepare and submit AF Forms 1876 and 2539, NAF Disbursement Request,
        on the above transactions as applicable to NAF AO.
     8.17.2. Outstanding Accounts Payable. The NAF AO posts accounts payable adjustments
     for changes in foreign currency exchange rates as payments are made. The adjustment is the
     change in the US dollar value of foreign currencies whose rates have fluctuated or been
     officially revalued since the time of purchase or accrual. The NAF AO posts gains or loss on
     foreign currency in the administrative cost center of each NAFI (for example; cost center A1
     in NAFI 51 and cost center 31 in NAFI 70).
8.18. Grants, Transfers, and Subsidies:
     8.18.1. Operating Grants. If a higher headquarters (HQ) provides cash to a base to offset
     operating expenses of a specific program (sports competitions, talent contests, marketing
     initiatives, etc.), record the grant as an operating grant (GLAC 833) to offset the costs of the
     program. The higher HQ records the grant in Special Grants-Operating (GLAC 904).
     8.18.2. Nonoperating Grants. If a higher HQ provides funds to a base for capital
     investment, both the base and the higher HQ post the grant as a nonoperating grant (GLAC
     281). Examples are Air Force Base Capital Improvement Fund grants (including transfers of
     cash for expendable equipment), and a MAJCOM giving cash to bases for the purpose of
     getting ready to compete for an award (for example, fixing up the building, buying
     equipment and supplies).
     8.18.3. Transfers. Record all cash transfers to provide working capital for normal
     operations or to "level cash" within the MAJCOM as Transferred Equity (GLAC 287). An
     example is providing start-up cash to a base after a disaster has occurred. In addition, all
     funds provided by or to the Command Lodging Funds (CLF) are transfers of equity (for
     example, CLF grants).
     8.18.4. Subsidies. If the base receives funds from a foreign government to offset local
     national payroll or other expenses, the base records it to Operating Subsidies (GLAC 855) to
     offset the costs incurred for hiring local nationals or complying with the foreign government
     desires.
     8.18.5. Purchases Made with Grant Funds. Regardless of the type of grant your base
     receives, always record the expense in the applicable GLAC. For example, if you buy a
     fixed asset, record it in an asset account (GLAC 17X or 18X, as applicable) and depreciate it
     over the useful life. If you buy supplies, record it as supply expense (GLAC 720).
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                    73


8.19. Private Animal Care User Fee or Surcharge. Record the total amount of the user fee
and surcharges collected by debiting Cash (GLAC 101) and crediting Other Payables account
(GLAC 249) for the surcharge, and crediting Fees and Charges account (GLAC 501) for the user
fee.
        - The NAF AO makes monthly payments to the US Treasury for the total amount of user
fees or surcharges collected during the prior month.
        - Make payment by the 15th calendar day of the month. Send the check (mail or hand
carry) to the local FSO, attached to a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, using fund cite
573210.9999. Coordinate with your local FSO for additional information required when
preparing the DD Form 1131.
   8.19.1. For the purpose of the surcharge, a transaction is defined as each time monies are
   collected from an authorized customer, whether for animal care service, sale of medication,
   or miscellaneous pet supplies. Consider all charges during one visit as one transaction. The
   surcharge applies to all authorized customers and is collectible for all sales and services.
8.20. Commercial Sponsorship Program. Record the sponsorship donation received to the
activity identified by the vendor in that activity's administrative cost center. If a specific MWRF
activity is not identified by the vendor, record the sponsorship donation in the fund

                                          Chapter 9

                        ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROCESSING

9.1. A/R Processing. The amounts recorded in A/R result from credit (charge) sales of
merchandise and services, and dues to be charged for which an activity anticipates payment at a
later date. The NAF AO classifies amounts they expect to collect during the next 12 months as
current assets. The NAF AO classifies amounts they do not expect to collect during the next 12
months as long-term assets. This chapter deals only with current A/R.
9.2. AF Form 408, NAF Accounts Receivable Batch Control. The NAF AO uses the AF
Form 408 as the basis for entering and reconciling charge documents and payment receipts to
subsidiary records.
9.3. Due Dates. The NAF AO makes account balances due and payable on the first day after
the statement date of the month in which the activity extended credit. The NAF AO treats
current month dues the same as current month charge sales. They become payable the first day
after the statement date.
9.4. Scope of Credit. Activities are not authorized to extend credit or maintain in-house
accounts receivable without HQ AFSVA/SVF written approval. Refer to AFI 34-209,
Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting.
9.5. Advance Green Fees. Advance green fees are the one-time upfront purchase of future
months’ green fees, with payment rendered in by cash, check, or credit card. Refer to AFI 34-
209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting.
9.6. DELETED. For service fee or merchandise purchase payment options, refer to AFI 34-
209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting.
9.7. Late Payment Charge. Refer to AFI 34-209 for the approval authority and the amount
authorized for late payment charges. SV must base the late payment charge for all NAFIs for
individual delinquent accounts upon the actual cost of collection. MAJCOM/SVF approves late
payment charge amounts. MAJCOM/SVF ensures SV bases the charge upon justifiable and
documented actual costs of recoupment.
     9.7.1. The NAF AO forwards documentation showing computations used to arrive at the late
     payment charge amount to the MAJCOM/SVF for review and approval.
     9.7.2. The NAF AO does not levy a late payment charge on an account that has a military
     pay order (MPO) action pending.
     9.7.3. The NAF AO does not assess late payment charges on an account the month after the
     NAF AO has processed an MPO.
     9.7.4. Record late fees to the NAF AO cost center (for NAFIs other than the MWRF, use the
     applicable NAFI’s administrative CCC.)
9.8. Billing Receivables. Refer to AFI 34-209 for billing requirements.
9.9. Accounting for Advance Dues. The NAF AO posts advance dues or fees received as
unearned income (GLAC 232). Prepare a journal voucher (JV) each accounting period to
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                     75


transfer the amount earned to the appropriate revenue account (for example, GLAC 502) from
the unearned income account (GLAC 232).
9.10. MPO Accounts. At the end of each month, capture the dollar value of delinquent
accounts currently in MPO status.
   9.10.1. The A/R technician should identify MPO accounts by giving them a unique A/R type
   code in the A/R subsidiary. The A/R technician identifies all delinquent accounts that have
   current MPO actions processed by running an A/R listing selecting only the unique MPO
   type code. Prepare a journal voucher to record the total amount of delinquent accounts with
   MPO actions into GLAC 121, Customer Account Receivable--MPO Actions Processed.
   Debit GLAC 121 and credit GLAC 111 for the dollar amount on the listing. Attach the
   account listing to the JV as supporting documentation. Make sure you reverse this entry at
   the beginning of the next month.
9.11. A/R Aging and Reporting. Refer to paragraph           13.3.4.1.1 for A/R aging reporting
requirements.
9.12. Collections Before Reassignment or Separation. Personnel who fail to properly clear
SV activities when reassigned or separating, cost SV in terms of delinquent account write-offs
and results in time consuming collection actions. According to AFI 36-2102, Preparation of
Personnel Selected for Relocation-Base Level Procedures, Military Personnel Flight (MPF) use a
numbered machine list, daily bulletin notice, or other locally devised system to inform base
agencies of impending personnel relocation as a result of assignment, separation, or TDY, no
later than 30 days before the scheduled departure date, or as soon as short notice relocations are
known. Numbered notices from the local MPF permit the NAF AO to track or screen departures.
The SV commander or director coordinates with the MPF to establish local procedures in
advising departing personnel of the requirement to settle all accounts with SV NAFIs or cost
centers during the duty day. The NAF AO must implement these procedures:
   9.12.1. Ensure you are on the automatic distribution for and receive all MPF published
   numbered departure notices.
   9.12.2. Review departure notices, identify departing personnel, and use the departure date to
   establish a predeparture bill collection suspense date. Do not set the suspense date less than
   2 days before the departure date.
   9.12.3. Forward deluxe delinquent lists by organizations to unit commanders who assist in
   collection actions.
9.13. Follow-up Actions for Delinquent Accounts. The office which maintains the accounts'
subsidiary records follows-up on delinquent accounts. SV must use the following actions as the
minimum required.
        - 30 days delinquent: Notify the individual, through statement notice. If statement
notice isn't possible, then generate a separate notification. Request immediate payment of the
amount owed.
        - 60 days delinquent: Notify the individual in writing. Tell the individual that SV will
suspend charge privileges until they receive payment. Tell the individual that SV has posted a
late payment charge to the account. The NAF AO (or Lodging, if applicable) initiates an MPO
and/or debt collection action if SV does not receive payment within 30 days.
76                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


        - 90 days delinquent: The SV commander or director notifies the individual, in writing,
that SV has terminated membership and participation privileges. Tell the individual that SV has
posted a late payment charge to the account and that the NAF AO (or Lodging, if applicable) has
started MPO and debt collection actions. The individual must turn in all membership cards to
the activity manager or the NAF AO.
     9.13.1. Send over 30 and over 60 day delinquent lists to the unit commander or supervisor of
     civilian employees.
     9.13.2. Upon receipt of the over 30 and over 60 day delinquent lists, the unit commander or
     supervisor counsels the listed individuals on their financial responsibilities and advises them
     that unless payment is made by the end of the month, membership and participation
     privileges will be terminated (applies to accounts 60 days delinquent).
     9.13.3. Follow the collection procedures contained in AFI 34-202.
9.14. Reinstatement of Membership Privileges. The SV commander or director prepares
letters to advise members on whether their requests for reinstatement were approved or
disapproved. Send an information copy to the NAF AO.
     9.14.1. The SV commander or director approves reinstatements on an individual basis.
     9.14.2. Each individual must pay the total outstanding balance due the activity before the
     NAF AO reinstates the account. This balance would include dues owed at the date of
     termination. As an option, the SV commander or director may require the collection of dues
     from the date of termination through the date of reinstatement.
     9.14.3. The SV commander or director provides a copy of the approved reinstatement to the
     NAF AO to file in the individual's file.
9.15. Bad Debt Write-Off Procedures. When approved for write-off according to AFI 34-202,
the NAF AO removes the amount from the member's account and the general ledger. Use the
NAF AO cost center to record the bad debt write off for the MWRF (for other NAFIs, use the
applicable NAFI’s administrative CCC). This is done through an accrual process using an
allowance for bad debt account (GLAC 120) according to AFI 34-209. Base the allowance for
bad debt account accrual on realistic expectations of bad debt write offs. If the NAF AO collects
on an account previously written off as uncollectible:
     9.15.1. If the collection is in the current year, reverse the entry made when written off and
     post the payment received to clear the account.
     9.15.2. If the collection is made after year end closing, record as cash received (GLAC 101)
     and miscellaneous income (GLAC 812) in the applicable NAFI.
9.16. Reversal of Dues Incorrectly Charged. Refer to instructions in AFI 34-209.
9.17. Lodging Accounts Receivable. The lodging fund administers their own accounts
receivable collections (for accounts delinquent 30 and 60 days) unless local policy is different.
Prompt collection of outstanding accounts is important to the financial health of the lodging
operation. Lodging is expected to send statements to temporary duty (TDY) personnel on the
last day of the month if the individual has been a guest for at least fifteen days. Permanent party
personnel using optional maid or housekeeping services are billed in advance on the first day of
the month.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   77


   9.17.1. On the first of the month, give statements for that month to personnel who occupy
   unaccompanied officers' quarters (UOQ) or unaccompanied noncommissioned officers'
   quarters (UNCOQ) and who elect to, or are required to, pay service charges for maid or
   housekeeping services according to AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing.
       9.17.1.1. For example, bill January maid service on 1 January. The bill is 30 days
       delinquent at close of business 31 January.
   9.17.2. Report amounts not paid by the end of the accounting period as A/R in the financial
   statement for the lodging fund. The lodging fund manager ensures that lodging personnel
   review individual accounts at the close of the accounting period and that accurate reports of
   accounts receivable subsidiary balances are sent to the NAF AO for inclusion in the financial
   statement.
   9.17.3. Follow the guidance in AFI 34-209 and paragraph 9.7 for assessing late payment
   charges.
   9.17.4. Complete follow-up actions on delinquent accounts according to the time-frame
   specified in paragraph 9.13 The lodging manager is responsible for collection actions of
   accounts that are 30 and 60 days delinquent. The RMFC ensures the lodging manager
   performs collection actions in a timely manner. Once accounts become 90 days delinquent,
   the RMFC assumes responsibility for all additional collection actions. These procedures
   apply to both accounts due from both individuals and units/organizations.
   9.17.5. Refer to paragraph 13.3.4.1.1 for aged A/R reporting requirements.
9.18. Returned Checks. Refer to AFI 34-202 for policy, follow-up, and collection procedures
on returned checks.
   9.18.1. When the bank returns the check to the NAF AO, the NAF AO:
       9.18.1.1. Posts the amount of returned checks plus all service charges (bank and NAF) as
       an increase to Returned Checks Receivable (GLAC 112) in the applicable NAFI. This
       entry anticipates collection from the maker or endorser of the face value of the check plus
       the NAF service charge and the bank service charge.
       9.18.1.2. Posts the NAF service charge to non-operating revenue (GLAC 808, Returned
       Check Charge) in the NAF AO cost center (for NAFIs other than the MWRF, use the
       applicable NAFI’s administrative cost center code).
       9.18.1.3. Posts the reduction to the bank account (GLAC 101) for the face value of the
       returned check plus the bank service charge.
   9.18.2. If a returned check is deemed no fault of the maker based on a letter from the bank,
   the NAF AO accepts payment for only the face value of the returned check. Reverse the
   original entry. The RMFC uses local discretion when handling bank service fees as long as
   the policy is consistently applied.
   9.18.3. If a returned check is considered uncollectible, write-off the total amount recorded in
   Returned Checks Receivable (GLAC 112) by writing-off of the face value of the check, plus
   the bank service fee and the NAF service fee, to the NAF AO cost center (for NAFIs other
   than the MWRF, use the applicable NAFI’s administration cost center code).
78                                                         AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     9.18.4. Refer to AFI 34-209 to determine if you should establish an allowance for bad debt
     account (GLAC 120) for returned checks. If you establish GLAC 120, follow the guidance
     in paragraph 9.15 and AFI 34-209. Base the allowance for bad debt account accrual on
     realistic expectations of bad debt write offs.
9.19. Commercial Debt Collection Contracts. The NAF AO submits all accounts that qualify
to be sent to the commercial debt collection contractor (based on the contract) to HQ
AFSVA/SVFA. Include all of the documentation for the account. HQ AFSVA/SVFA forwards
to the commercial debt collection contract. Refer to AFI 34-209.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                 79


                                          Chapter 10

                    PURCHASE AND CONTROL OF MERCHANDISE

10.1. Purchase of Merchandise With NAFs. The RMFC is responsible for NAFI contracting
as prescribed in AFI 64-301. Refer to AFI 34-209 for further instructions on purchase and
control of merchandise. The RMFC or designee reviews purchase requests to ensure the use of
the proper fund source. To assist in determining the proper fund source, work with the Logistics
Support section and use AFIs 34-201, 34-204, 65-106, and other AFIs as applicable. For NAF
purchases, the NAF AO:
   10.1.1. Prepares AF Form 9 or provides guidance on their preparation.
   10.1.2. Maintains AF Forms 1409, NAF Purchase Order/Contract/PR Register, (unless
   automated) as a log for tracking AF Forms 9 and AF Forms 2209, Nonappropriated Fund
   Order for Supplies or Services. When purchasing authority is delegated outside the NAF
   AO, the operational level to which purchasing authority is delegated maintains AF Forms
   1409. File one copy of AF Form 2209 and AF Form 9 in numeric sequence as backup for AF
   Form 1409.
   10.1.3. Maintains files for outstanding AF Form 9s and 2209s.
   10.1.4. Routes all contracting actions involving capital expenditures through the RMFC for
   validation against the approved NRB and to determine cash flow requirements.
   10.1.5. Processes prepayment requirements.
   10.1.6. Date-stamps all completed receiving reports, invoices and delivery tickets when
   received. This is necessary to comply with requirements of the Prompt Payment Act. The
   vendor must mail invoices to the NAF AO. EXCEPTION: Refer to paragraph 10.2 for
   invoices applicable to vendors in the Central Vendor Payment Program (CVPP). The NAF
   AO date-stamps all invoices at the time of receipt. The NAF AO updates general ledger and
   subsidiary ledgers as applicable.
   10.1.7. Processes receiving reports and updates all inventory lists.
   10.1.8. Receives proof of shipment from vendor if ownership changes at point of shipment.
   Since the activity has not received the goods yet, the NAF AO uses the invoice and proof of
   shipment to establish the accounts payable and to pay the vendor. Suspense the PO to ensure
   receipt of a valid receiving report from the activity when the vendor delivers the goods.
   10.1.9. Assigns stock numbers.
   10.1.10. Processes transfer between cost centers (TBCCs) and interfund purchase orders
   (IPOs).
   10.1.11. Processes storeroom transactions.
   10.1.12. Prepares inventory lists.
   10.1.13. Prices and extends inventory lists and compares with established inventory levels.
   10.1.14. Helps to establish stock levels and reorder points.
80                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     10.1.15. Establishes inventory control procedures for merchandise received on consignment
     (refer to paragraph 10.10).
     10.1.16. Utilizes the government preferred method of payment, i.e., Government Purchase
     Card (GPC) or Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) for all purchases.
10.2. CVPP. CVPP is designed to achieve a greater vendor discount by making centralized
payment for items purchased against NAF purchase agreements (NPA), blanket purchase
agreements (BPAs), and open market purchases from participating vendors. Vendors forward all
invoices, proofs of shipment, and copies of orders to HQ AFSVA/SVFA (the CVPP office) for
payment. When HQ AFSVA pays the vendor, they reduce the bases' CMIP accounts by
deducting the invoice amount plus any shipping or freight charges. The CVPP office is the
central point of contact and handles discrepancies such as missing or damaged items. HQ
AFSVA refunds discounts to the base as a separate line item on the bases' CMIP message. The
NAF AO:
     10.2.1. Uses GLAC 165, Central Vendor Payments, for merchandise in transit. Use this
     GLAC when CVPP makes the payment to the vendor and deducts it from your CMIP
     account although the activity hasn't received the merchandise.
     10.2.2. Uses GLAC 810, Air Force Central Vendor Discounts, to record the discounts
     refunded by HQ AFSVA. The NAF AO purchasing agent tracks the dollar amount
     purchased by each activity and prorates the earned discount amount to each activity.
10.3. Advance Payment Conditions and Authority. When SV cannot avoid making an
advance or prepayment, the purchase must meet the following conditions before the RMFC or
designee authorizes the advance or prepayment:
       - The products or services must be available only from a sole source and alternative
products or services must not be readily available at comparable or more favorable prices.
       - The NAF AO receives written evidence that the source will not provide the goods or
services until the NAF AO makes full or partial payment.
     10.3.1. Do not allow advances or prepayments of NAFs for customer special ordered items
     (the activity cannot sell the item(s) to other customers) unless the customer makes a deposit
     of at least 25% of the sales price before the activity places the order.
     10.3.2. Once the RMFC or designee approves the advance or prepayment for a purchase:
        10.3.2.1. The NAF AO prepares an AF Form 2539. The RMFC or designee approves
        the AF Form 2539. The RMFC or designee ensures there is an appropriate contractual
        document to include all agreements such as method of shipment, whether substitutes or
        backorders are authorized, date merchandise is due, etc. Annotate all copies of the
        contractual document with an advance or prepayment authorization clause, to include the
        RMF’s or designee's name, check number of the advance or prepayment, and date of
        check. The NAF AO makes normal distribution of the contractual documents. File one
        copy with the AF Form 2539. Mail the original contractual document with the check.
        10.3.2.2. When establishing the payable, the NAF AO debits Prepaid Expense (GLAC
        130). Maintain a subsidiary ledger with date required as the suspense date. Once the
        activity receives the merchandise, credit Prepaid Expense and debit the appropriate
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                  81


       expense or asset account. The NAF AO files the receiving report with the original
       prepayment.
       10.3.2.3. Document the contract file as required by AFI 64-301.
10.4. Stock Numbers and Standard Units of Measure. The stock number may be from 5 to
13 numeric digits. 8 characters is the recommended length. Refer to the Services NAF Standard
Accounting User's Guide for standard category headers recommended for use in the first four
digits of the stock number. The remaining portion of the stock number is locally assigned.
10.5. Central Storeroom Processing. Account for central storerooms using the central
storeroom cost center (unless authorized in other NAFIs by MAJCOM).
10.6. TBCC. The using activity numbers AF Forms 2533 sequentially as the activity uses them.
On the last day of each accounting period the using activity informs the NAF AO of the last
TBCC number used.
   10.6.1. The activity issuing the merchandise prepares the AF Form 2533 or order entry
   register. The activity annotates applicable stock numbers, descriptions, and quantities on the
   AF Forms 2533.
   10.6.2. On actual transfer, employees of the issuing and receiving cost centers sign the
   appropriate blocks of the form.
   10.6.3. Send AF Form 2533 to the manager or designated representative for signature and
   verification. Forward the original to the NAF AO. The NAF AO returns the first copy to the
   requester and the second copy to the receiver of the goods.
   10.6.4. The NAF AO verifies the transfer for accuracy and updates the general ledger with
   the transfer.
10.7. NAF IPO. An activity may order inventory items using order entry forms when the NAF
AO establishes the selling NAFI as a vendor and the purchasing NAFI has an inventory
warehouse established in the NAF standard accounting inventory system.
   10.7.1. The ordering manager initiates the AF Form 1735, assigns an accountable IPO
   number, and forwards to the RMFC for signature unless purchase authority has been
   delegated to the ordering manager. The activity forwards the signed AF Form 1735 original,
   and two copies, to the selling NAFI. The ordering activity suspenses copy number 3.
   10.7.2. The selling NAFI receives the AF Form 1735 and completes the requested order.
   10.7.3. When the ordering activity receives the service or merchandise, they sign and date
   the IPO receiving report (original AF Form 1735) to complete the transaction. The ordering
   activity forwards the receiving report to the NAF AO.
   10.7.4. The NAF AO receives copy 4 of AF Form 1735 to establish the A/R (GLAC 113)
   and credit cost of goods (GLAC 401) or revenue (GLAC 801, as applicable) for the selling
   NAFI. Post the transactions to the A/R subsidiary. When the NAF AO processes the dollar
   transfer for payment, they clear the A/R subsidiary for the selling NAFI. The NAF AO:
       10.7.4.1. Receives the original AF Form 1735 as the receiving report for both the
       ordering and purchasing NAFI.
       10.7.4.2. Establishes applicable expense and accounts payable.
82                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


        10.7.4.3. Processes the payment, through dollar transfer, not later than the following
        month. The receiving copy of the AF Form 1735 supports the dollar transfer.
        10.7.4.4. Verifies with managers, before preparing the financial statement, that all AF
        Forms 1735 issued have been processed. If an order is made and not complete, the dollar
        amount is considered an outstanding purchase order (PO).
10.8. Spoilage, Breakage, and Out-Dated Material. Report losses of items carried on resale
or storeroom inventories according to AFI 34-202. In addition, the NAF AO must receive:
        - A certification by the Military Public Health Office, or designee, attesting to the loss of
the reported items for spoilage of food and beverage costing $100 or more.
        - The manager's written and signed notice to the RMFC on the loss. Include the date of
spoilage or breakage, or the date material becomes obsolete, the cause, dollar amount,
description (name) of item, quantity of items, how the activity will dispose of the items, and
identify the CCC.
     10.8.1. The activity absorbs spoilage, breakage, out-dated material, customer complaint, or
     reject items that cost less than $100 in cost of goods.
     10.8.2. The NAF AO posts all losses $100 and above as Spoilage and Breakage expense
     (GLAC 727) in the applicable CCC.
     10.8.3. Losses incurred through spoilage, breakage, and obsolete material in a central
     storeroom are normal storeroom expenses shared by the using NAFIs based on the
     percentage of the total value of issues for that month. Prepare and process documents for
     adjustments to the central storeroom account as Spoilage and Breakage using the central
     storeroom CCC.
10.9. Decentralized Storeroom (Slots Operation and Aero Club):
     10.9.1. Maintain items identified as sensitive, and spare parts costing $50 or more,
     purchased for slot machine operations in a decentralized storeroom. Refer to AFMAN 34-
     129.
     10.9.2. Maintain petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL), and spare parts costing $50 or more,
     purchased for the aero club in a decentralized storeroom.
        10.9.2.1. Aero clubs are not required to inventory spare parts costing less than $50
        (bench stock). However for reorder purposes, we advise the aero club maintain bin cards
        or other stock records. Bench stock also includes low-cost hardware items (such as nuts,
        bolts, screws, gaskets, hoses, etc.) When purchased, the NAF AO posts the expense for
        purchases of aircraft parts and bench stock items costing less than $50 per item to each
        applicable aero club aircraft based on anticipated actual usage.
        10.9.2.2. The NAF AO posts an expense to the applicable aero club aircraft for aviation
        fuel and aircraft engine oil in the decentralized storeroom as the aircraft uses the fuel or
        oil. The aero club manager or designee meters fuel usage. When purchased, the NAF
        AO posts an expense to each applicable aero club activity for lubricants such as wheel
        bearing grease, hydraulic fluid, and miscellaneous lubricating oils based on anticipated
        actual usage.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   83


10.10. Consigned Merchandise. Title of goods received on consignment remains with the
consignor. The activity, as consignee, does not own such goods; therefore, the NAF AO makes
no entry to record the receipt of, or obligation for, goods received on consignment. The activity
accounts for consigned goods through the use of memorandum control records until sold or
returned to the consignor.
   10.10.1. The activity establishes either an automated or manual memorandum control. The
   activity may request that the NAF AO maintain the record on the NAF Standard Accounting
   System Inventory Module in a separate consignment warehouse. This consignment
   inventory is for accountability tracking only and not for input into the general ledger. The
   NAF AO does not record general ledger entries until the end of the month, or contract
   expiration date, whichever comes first.
   10.10.2. The activity uses procedures in AFI 34-202 and AFMAN 34-212 for the physical
   aspects of controlling resale merchandise.
   10.10.3. The NAF AO records the sale of consigned goods into the general ledger based on
   the activity's AF Form 1876.
   10.10.4. The NAF AO posts the cost of sales at the end of each accounting period or when
   the activity returns the unsold consigned goods to the consignor, whichever, is first. Cost of
   sales for consigned inventory is the difference between goods received, or on hand at the
   beginning of an accounting period, and those on hand at the end of the period or after return
   to the consignor.
   10.10.5. The NAF AO and activity personnel work together to resolve any discrepancies
   between actual count and the memorandum control record.
10.11. Receiving Reports. The RMFC establishes internal controls to ensure the same
individuals authorized to place calls against BPAs or place orders by other contracting means do
not inspect and accept goods received. Refer to AFI 64-301 for receiving report requirements.
For small activities, the RMFC prepares an operating instruction to ensure the internal control of
purchasing.
   10.11.1. When vendors provide free items as bonuses or a purchase discount, note the free
   items on the receiving report. Record free items on the inventory. Determine the unit cost
   by dividing the amount due the vendor by the total quantity received (including the free
   items).
   10.11.2. If an activity receives free items for special occasions and gives them away, the
   activity accounts for these items without processing them through the inventory and cost of
   goods sold. Use AFI 34-201 for the criteria in accepting donations. The activity makes a
   memo no-charge entry on stock records or other locally devised forms and footnotes the
   cashier's report when issued. The RMFC or designee personally examines all transactions
   involving free items to ensure that the activity accounts for items received.
10.12. Commodities:
   10.12.1. Free Food. The activity maintains United States Department of Agriculture
   (USDA) inventory on a locally devised form, computerized list, or the inventory sheets
   provided by some states when goods are ordered. For computerized lists, pick up each item
   at zero value.
84                                                          AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     10.12.2. Reduced Price Food. The activity forwards all invoices for receipt of commodities
     at reduced prices to the NAF AO. The NAF AO establishes the accounts payable using the
     applicable cost center code. The activity maintains the inventory on a locally devised form
     using the reduced price. Do not combine the USDA commodities inventory with the NAF-
     purchased in-use inventory. For computerized lists, the NAF AO may establish a separate
     warehouse in the inventory system. Use current assigned stock numbers and pick up each
     item at the reduced price, using the applicable CCC. The NAF AO uses these transactions
     only to update the month-end count sheets and physical inventory.
     10.12.3. Free Food Freight Paid. The activity maintains inventory as stated in paragraphs
     10.12.1 and 10.12.2 above. The vendor sends the freight bill to the NAF AO for payment.
     The NAF AO uses the assigned cost of goods shred account for freight (GLAC 4012) and
     processes the accounts payable.
     10.12.4. USDA Commodities Inventory. At the end of each accounting period, the activity
     takes the physical inventory according to local or MAJCOM policy. Take the inventory
     monthly. The activity maintains two inventories (one for NAF-purchased goods and one for
     the USDA commodity goods). The activity manager uses the computerized count sheets or
     inventory sheets provided by the state. The activity forwards the USDA commodity physical
     inventory to the NAF AO for control purposes.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   85


                                          Chapter 11

                                      A/P PROCESSING

11.1. Establishment of Accounts Payable. The amounts recorded as accounts payable are for
liabilities incurred for the receipt of goods or services. Orders or agreements must be in writing
and supported by a receiving report or proof of shipment before a liability may be recorded.
   11.1.1. Maintain a suspense file for all payables. This file should be set up to ensure timely
   payments and facilitate end of month reconciliation. Documents remaining unpaid at the end
   of month should equal the outstanding items on the invoice register. The invoice register, in
   turn, should equal the balance in GLAC 201.
11.2. Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). The NAF AO is required by Congressional mandate to
use EFT to pay U.S. vendors. Authorized EFT exemptions that require no further approval and
for which checks or petty cash would be used for the disbursements are as follows:
   11.2.1. SM&W expenditures are to be made by EFT to the vendor when a purchase order is
   required and through the central cashier to reimburse for approved expenditures. No advance
   of funds is authorized.
   11.2.2. Entertainment contracts.
   11.2.3. Customer refunds (use the Change Fund/Daily Activity Receipts, where possible).
   11.2.4. Change Fund establishment or replenishment.
   11.2.5. Prize/Bingo winners (use Change Fund/Daily Activity Receipts, where possible).
   11.2.6. Other Federal Agencies (i.e., DFAS or DAO). For DAOs, funds will be disbursed
   via EFT or through the central cashier.
   11.2.7. State entities not accepting EFT.
   11.2.8. Isolated Unit Funds. Funds will be disbursed via EFT or through the central cashier.
   11.2.9. Bowling League accounting done by NAF AO.
   11.2.10. The RMFC may approve exemptions for persons on Individual Service Contracts
   who are not expected to be paid more than one time during the current fiscal year. These
   individuals will continue to be paid by check.
   11.2.11. Base-level units receiving MWR support for unit activities should make payment
   using the GPC (government purchase card) or prepare an AF Form 1401, NAF Petty
   Cash/Refund Voucher, to obtain funds from the central cashier. The base-level unit fund
   representative may be accompanied by a Services representative with a NAF GPC to make
   the needed purchases.
   11.2.12. If a vendor returns your EFT payment (i.e., because they are not on-line with their
   bank to receive the EFT information), do not calculate prompt payment penalties. The
   vendor was considered paid when the EFT payment was sent to their bank account. Prepare
   and mail a check to pay the vendor.
86                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


11.3. Proof of Shipment. Sometimes it is necessary to pay a vendor on proof of shipment
rather than on receipt of goods. Although this is more common for overseas orders, review
contract terms to determine if the vendor requires payment on shipment.
     11.3.1. Match the proof of shipment and vendor invoice to the suspense copy of the
     Purchase Order. Establish the account payable using the invoice with proof of shipment as
     the supporting documentation and enter into the general ledger as Inventory in Transit
     (GLAC 163).
     11.3.2. Suspense the paid voucher pending receipt of the receiving report from the activity.
     When the order is received, process a journal voucher to credit GLAC 163 to clear the
     original entry and debit the appropriate expense account.
11.4. Documentation Required for Payment. Three documents are usually required to process
payment to a vendor. They are a purchase order or a delivery order written against an NPA,
EPP, or BPA, a receiving report and a valid invoice. For OCONUS bases an additional
document would be the proof of shipment (see 11.3 above). Payment to the vendor should be
made in accordance with the contract terms. Contracts are not required to process payments for
registration or entry fees, NAF official travel, workers’ compensation payments, Government
Purchase Card (GPC), or commercial telephone service. Use an AF Form 2539, NAF
Disbursement Voucher, for these type payments and attach all supporting documentation.
     11.4.1. If the NAF AO overpays a vendor, make an adjustment on the next payment to the
     vendor. Take a credit for the overpayment. Reference the credit taken to the contract or the
     PO number and to the vendor’s invoice number. If the overpayment was made to a vendor
     that is not regularly used, the NAF AO contacts the vendor and requests a refund. Reverse
     the overpayment from the appropriate expense account, and establish it as an account
     receivable, using GLAC 115, Outside Agency Receivables.
     11.4.2. Do not delay payment of bills because of minor errors. When the NAF AO receives
     an invoice containing minor errors and the contracting officer confirms that prices on the PO
     or contract are correct, make one of the following adjustments:
        11.4.2.1. When the price stated on the invoice is higher than the price stated in the PO,
        pay the price stated in the PO for the quantity actually received.
        11.4.2.2. When the price stated on the invoice is less than the price stated on the PO, pay
        the invoice price for the quantity received.
     11.4.3. In certain cases, such as payments for entertainers, the RMFC may authorize advance
     preparation of disbursement requests. Payment may be made by electronic funds transfer
     (EFT) or check. In either instance the activity manager or designee certifies completion of
     the performance and forwards the certification to the NAF AO on the first business day
     following completion of service.
     11.4.4. Do not process any payments before obtaining required approval signature.
11.5. Distribution of EFTs/Checks/Paid Documents. For payments made by EFT, print
remittance advices and obtain the signature of an authorized check signer. Mail or fax one copy
of the remittance advice to the vendor and attach the other copy to the paid voucher. If a check
has been issued, the NAF AO mails the original check to the vendor. Mark spoiled checks as
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                87


void, deface the signature block, and forward to the CMIP technician for update to the cash
control summary.
   11.5.1. Maintain a check number control log to record checks issued. This can be
   accomplished by running the check register from the field accounting system (FAS)
   whenever checks are printed. Suspense these copies until end of month when a Monthly
   Check Register can be printed.
   11.5.2. Stamp all invoices as ―paid‖ and file the original disbursement voucher with
   supporting documentation in alphabetical order by vendor, with a secondary breakout in
   chronological order.
11.6. BPA. In view of the requirements of the Prompt Payment Act (paragraph 11.10), the
NAF AO can pay for purchases monthly as long as the guidelines in paragraph 11.10.4 are
followed. The NAF AO does not need to make this at the end of month. The NAF Contracting
Officer can work with vendors to establish mid-month due dates and lighten the end-of-month
workload. A monthly payment allows the accumulation of documents relating to a single vendor
to be processed as one payment. In some cases, payment will be made before the regular
payment cycle to take advantage of discounts or to fulfill partial pre-payment provisions in a
contract.
11.7. Centralized Payment of Consolidated Purchases. HQ AFSVA/SVT normally makes
payment based on constructive delivery (receipt of proof of shipment) of the items. On the day
of payment, the applicable base's CMIP message will reflect the withdrawal from the CMIP
account. If the activity has already received the merchandise and recorded the transaction in
accounts payable, process the CMIP transaction by selecting Accounts Payable in the Check
Processing Menu. If an Accounts Payable has not been established, prepare a JV to record the
CMIP withdrawal as a debit to GLAC 163,Inventory In Transit. Keep a copy of the CMIP
message to support this entry, and reverse as soon as merchandise is received, credit GLAC 163,
and debit the correct expense account. All CVPP discounts are posted to GLAC 810 XX. When
CVPP merchandise is received before the CMIP transaction has been processed, record the
receipt of goods in Accounts Payable and debit the appropriate expense account. Refer to
paragraph 10.2 for CVPP.
11.8. Payments to Family Child Care Home Providers. Individuals wishing to provide child
care services in their homes complete an application and sponsor agreement provided by the
Family Child Care Coordinator (FCC). The provider records the number of breakfasts, lunches,
snacks, and dinners on a USDA form provided by the FCC. The family child care provider
submits this form to the Family Child Care Coordinator at the end of each month. The
coordinator computes the amount of reimbursement due each provider and the amount of
sponsorship fee, if any, due the Family Child Care Program, and forwards the disbursement
voucher to the NAF AO. The NAF AO:
   11.8.1. Assigns the family child care provider a vendor code in the accounts payable system.
   Do not generate an IRS Form 1099. USDA Child Care Food Program disbursements are
   "grants-in-aid" and aren't taxable since the IRS considers the payments to be reimbursements
   for running a non-profit food service program based upon pre-set meal rates or actual costs.
88                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     11.8.2. Sets up an accounts payable voucher in the standard NAF accounting system each
     month and records the amount due to be reimbursed by USDA in GLAC 115, Outside
     Agency Receivables.
11.9. Payments For Government Travel Card and Government Purchase Card
Accounts. HQ AFSVA/SVF establishes Government Travel Cards (GTC) for the RMFC at each
base and for each MAJCOM. HQ AFSVA/SVF centrally administers account activation and
deactivation. The RMFC administers the account locally. Official Travel may not be charged to
the GPC account and must be charged to the GTC. Accounts payable should be set up as soon as
tickets or other travel expenses are charged to the GTC account. The accounts payable
transactions are cleared when payment is processed upon receipt and verification of the bank
statement.
     11.9.1. Cardholders enter Government Purchase Card (GPC) purchases into the bank online
     transaction log. The cardholder reconciles GPC purchases posted to the cardholder's account
     by the bank against the transaction log, and either approves or disputes transactions. When
     the cycle closes for the month, or the last business day prior to the end of the cycle, the
     cardholder approves the monthly cardholder statement online. The billing official reviews
     cardholder transactions for propriety and certifies the invoice for payment online after all
     cardholders have approved their monthly statements. GPC invoices are transmitted to the
     base by EDI and electronically interface into the NAF accounting system. Payment method
     is Confirm and Pay, which requires billing official invoice certification before the invoice
     will transmit to the base. The payment voucher is created at the time of interface and should
     be paid in full. The NAF AO manually vouchers any interface rejects and includes the
     amount in the payment to the bank. It is not necessary for the NAF AO to wait to receive all
     EDI invoices before making payment. Payment against each voucher should be made as
     soon as possible in order to maximize the refund offered by the bank. Cardholders should
     follow-up on any disputed charges with the vendor and bank. The NAF AO should track any
     credits due from the bank to ensure they are received.
11.10. Prompt Payment Act (Public Law 97-177) Requirements. The Prompt Payment Act
applies to contracts awarded (including purchase and delivery orders), calls placed against
blanket purchase agreements, and blanket delivery orders on or after 1 Apr 1989. The Act also
applies to contracts awarded by contracting officers located outside the United States, when
performance of the services or delivery of the supplies will occur outside the United States.
     11.10.1. The Act requires federal agencies to pay their bills on time. The NAF AO takes
     discounts when payments are made by the discount date and pays interest penalties on late
     payments. HQ AFSVA/SVF publishes the applicable rate, as required by the Secretary of the
     Treasury. The NAF AO must pay interest penalties when due, regardless of whether the
     vendor concerned requests their payment. Interest calculation is based on a 360-day year.
     11.10.2. Under the provisions of the Act and this AFMAN, consider the vendor paid on the
     settlement date for an EFT payment, or on the date the NAF AO issues the check. Mail
     checks the same day they are dated (issued). The Act requires that:
        11.10.2.1. When the payment includes a penalty, the NAF AO must include a notice to
        tell the vendor:
            11.10.2.1.1. The amount of the interest penalty included in the payment.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                  89


         11.10.2.1.2. The rate used to compute the penalty.
         11.10.2.1.3. The number of days used to compute the penalty.
  11.10.3. Except for GPC card payments, do not make payments earlier than 7 days before
  the due date. However, if the day a payment is due (basic period ending with the due date)
  falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, the NAF AO may make payment the following
  workday without an interest penalty. Unavoidable late payments are subject to the interest
  penalties discussed in this paragraph, and will cover the period from the day after the due
  date through the payment date.
     11.10.3.1. Interest penalty amounts, which remain unpaid at the end of each 30-day
     period, are added to the original principal amount. The interest then accrues on the new
     principal amount for the next 30 days. The process repeats until the NAF AO makes
     payment for the total amount. Do not accrue interest in excess of one year.
     11.10.3.2. Interest penalties are not due until the payment due date has passed, the NAFI
     has accepted delivery (paragraph 11.10.9), and the NAFI has received a proper invoice
     (paragraph 11.10.7). If an EFT payment is rejected due to incorrect bank account
     information supplied by the vendor, interest under this regulation will not accrue until
     seven days after correct information is received (provided vendor has been notified of
     incorrect bank information within seven days of payment being rejected by AFSVA).
     11.10.3.3. The Act does not require interest penalties when the NAF AO delays payment
     because of a disagreement over the amount of the payment or other issues concerning
     compliance with the terms of the contract, for financing payments such as advance
     payments, or for the period when amounts are withheld temporarily according to the
     contract. Interest payment is not required when an EFT payment is not credited to the
     vendor’s account because of a failure on the part of the Federal Reserve or the vendor’s
     own financial institution. The NAF AO need not pay interest penalties of less than $1.00.
     Interest penalties do not continue to accrue for more than one year or after a claim for
     such penalties is filed under the Contract Dispute Act of 1978.
     11.10.3.4. The rate used to figure the interest penalty is the rate in effect at the time of
     the payment due date, not at the time the payment is made.
     11.10.3.5. The Act requires an additional penalty, 100% of the original unpaid interest,
     when a late payment interest penalty is owed and is not paid within 10 days of making
     the late payment and the contractor makes a written request. To be valid, the contractor
     must postmark the request by the 40th day after payment was made. If there is no
     postmark, the request is still valid if the NAF AO personnel receive the request and
     annotate it with the date of receipt by the 40th day.
         11.10.3.5.1. The additional penalty does not apply to payment of utility bills.
         11.10.3.5.2. The additional penalty will be no less than $25.00 and no more than
         $5,000.00.
         11.10.3.5.3. The additional penalty on unpaid interest will accrue until it is paid (per
         paragraph 11.10.3.1).
  11.10.4. If the contract states a specific due date, the NAF AO must pay interest if the NAF
  AO does not make payment on or before the due date. The following are payment due dates,
90                                                             AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


     unless otherwise specified by the contract (except paragraph         11.10.4.1 below; in this
     instance the contract cannot specify any other payment due date).
        11.10.4.1. In the case of meat or meat food products, poultry or poultry food products,
        egg or egg products, seven days after delivery.
        11.10.4.2. In the case of perishable agricultural commodities, 10 days after delivery.
        11.10.4.3. In the case of dairy products and edible oils and fats, the 10th day after receipt
        of a proper invoice.
        11.10.4.4. In the case of construction contract progress payments, 14 days after the
        billing office receives a payment request from the contractor or such longer period as the
        contract may specify (does not include the final payment on a construction contract or a
        construction contract paid in one lump sum, which is covered in paragraph 11.10.4.5
        below).
        11.10.4.5. In all other cases, 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice or acceptance,
        whichever is later.
        11.10.4.6. In the case of mixed invoices that contain items with different payment
        periods, the NAF AO:
            11.10.4.6.1. Makes payments as stated in the contractual payment provisions.
            11.10.4.6.2. Must pay interest if payment is made so that some items are paid after
            their due dates.
            11.10.4.6.3. May split payments for each category.
            11.10.4.6.4. May encourage but not require contractors to submit multiple invoices
            for payment of individual orders.
            11.10.4.6.5. May encourage but not require contractors to submit separate invoices
            for categories of products with different payment periods.
NOTE:          For overseas shipments, the periods prescribed in this subparagraph start on
receipt of a proper invoice and proof of shipment document or a proper invoice and receiving
report, whichever is received earlier.
     11.10.5. The interest penalty provisions in paragraphs 11.10.1, 11.10.2, and 11.10.3 above
     and due date requirements prescribed in paragraph 11.10.4 above also apply to contracts for
     goods or service that do not prohibit periodic payments and partial delivery payments for
     completed phases of construction projects, as distinguished from contract financing
     authorized by the contract.
     11.10.6. If an invoice contains any defects or improprieties, the vendor must be notified, in
     writing, of the defects or improprieties within three days for meat or meat food products, five
     days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products and edible fats and oils, and
     seven days in all other cases after receipt. The effective date of the notice is the day the
     notice is transmitted (mailed, faxed, or e-mailed). If this notice is not given within the
     appropriate time period, the due date requirements apply and the number of days allowed for
     payment on receipt of a proper (corrected) invoice is reduced by the number of days the
     notice was forwarded after the end of the applicable notice period.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                91


  11.10.7. A proper invoice must include the name of the vendor; invoice date; contract
  number; the description, price, and quantity of the goods or services delivered; shipping and
  payment terms; name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of
  individual to whom payment is to be made; and any other information required by the
  contract.
  11.10.8. When a time discount is available and taken, payment will be made as close as
  possible to but not later than the discount date. The discount date is the date by which, if
  payment is made, a specified discount can be taken. The discount period starts with the date
  of the invoice. Example: merchandise is received on 15 May and the invoice is dated 10
  May, the date used to figure the discount period is 10 May. When a discount is improperly
  taken because payment was not made within the discount period, interest will be paid on the
  discount taken beginning with the day after the discount period ended until full payment is
  made.
  11.10.9. Forward receiving reports to the NAF AO not later than the first business day after
  receipt and acceptance of the goods or services involved. The paying office must date stamp
  all invoices, receiving reports, and proof of shipment documents with the actual date
  received. If the paying office (NAF AO) fails to date stamp an invoice when received,
  consider the date of the invoice as the date of receipt by the paying office. An invoice is
  considered received on the later of:

                                           Chapter 12

                               INVENTORY MAINTENANCE

12.1. Resale Inventory. Designate goods held for sale in the normal course of a business as
resale inventory items. Assign a value to these goods to determine profit for the accounting
period as shown on the income statement, and to properly report assets on the balance sheet.
Value all NAFIs inventories using the same method and apply consistently from one accounting
period to another. The NAF AO must fully disclose the valuation method used for reporting in
the financial statements. Make this disclosure as a footnote to the financial statement. An
example of the footnote on the financial statement is: "Resale inventories are valued by
weighted average."
12.2. Inventory Maintenance. The NAF AO maintains inventory records when SV uses the
inventory module of the standard NAF accounting system. When another inventory system is
used such as Rec Trac!, FoodTrak, SIMS, etc. then the activity manager maintains inventory
records on the alternate inventory system instead of the inventory module under the standard
NAF accounting system. When transitioning from the NAF standard accounting system
inventory module to an alternate inventory system, run dual systems until both the RMFC and
activity manager feel the variance between the two systems is not excessive (for example, a 90
day test that has a variance of no more than $200 or a non-material dollar amount).
12.3. Inventory Values. The NAF AO values inventories at cost plus freight where material.
12.4. Consigned Merchandise. The consignor inventories consigned merchandise. The
activity maintains a separate memorandum perpetual inventory (Automated Inventory System,
AF Form 2045, Bingo Perpetual Inventory, or locally devised form), for each consignor, of
merchandise held on consignment, including bingo prizes, tickets for ticket and tour operation.
Inventory of consigned merchandise is for accountability purposes only.
12.5. Establishing Inventory Dollar Levels:
     12.5.1. In-Use. In establishing the maximum dollar value of in-use inventories, consider the
     cost of merchandise stocked (high value vs low value), availability through central NAF
     storerooms, direct delivery time, frequency of delivery, adequacy of storage space, exposure
     to spoilage and pilferage, etc. The maximum level (dollar value) established must be
     realistic.
     12.5.2. Storerooms. In establishing dollar levels of storeroom inventories consider the
     frequency of delivery, adequacy of space, exposure to spoilage and pilferage, etc.
12.6. Inventory Frequency. Refer to AFI 34-209 for inventory frequencies. Do not increase
the frequency of inventories for all SV activities or other NAFIs unless they all have a common
problem. This does not prohibit a daily or weekly inventory of high value items when used for
internal control.
12.7. Annual Impartial Inventory. The NAFFA maintains a schedule for annual physical
inventories of fixed assets, storerooms and salable merchandise. Use the guidance in AFI 65-
107. The NAFFA should have the team use the formats at Figure 12.1 and Figure 12.2 to
report on the inventories.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                  95


12.8. Aero Club Inventory of Spare Parts. Aero clubs are not required to inventory spare
parts costing less than $50.00. These are considered bench stock. On acquisition, the NAF AO
posts purchases of aircraft parts and bench stock items costing less than $50.00 per item as a
direct expense to each applicable aircraft base on anticipated actual usage.
12.9. Change of Managers. To comply with the requirements in AFI 34-209, the incoming
manager may use the financial statements to check the correctness of the decentralized storeroom
and in-use inventories. Inventories, when conducted, may replace the next regularly scheduled
or annual inventory, saleable or consumable merchandise inventory, or property and equipment
inventory. In order to replace the annual impartial inventory, independent people must observe
the inventory (at the time of the change of managers) according to AFI 65-107.
12.10. NAF AO Inventory Procedures. The NAF AO:
   12.10.1. Prepares inventory count sheets at the end of each month or quarter, as applicable
   (refer to AFI 34-209), for all inventory outlets (in use, consigned, special order and events,
   and storeroom). Send these count sheets to the activity personnel to record the quantity on
   hand.
   12.10.2. Provides, annually, lists of fixed assets to the NAFFA for the observation inventory
   team to use. Also furnish a fixed asset list when managers change.
   12.10.3. Receives completed inventories, enters inventory counts and values into the
   accounting system.

                                           Chapter 13

                                           REPORTS

13.1. Reporting Requirements. This chapter describes the accounting reports and frequency of
these reports required by HQ USAF for all NAFIs covered by this manual.
13.2. Consolidated Nonappropriated Banking Report, RCS: HAF-MWR(D)7505. Refer to
AFMAN 34-215, Procedures for the Cash Management and Investment Program, and AFI 34-
209 for reporting requirements.
     13.2.1. Balancing the CMIP Account. The NAF AO reconciles the CMIP account
     according to the procedures in AFMAN 34-215 and AFI 34-209. The NAF AO maintains a
     cash control summary to balance the CMIP account with the G/L control account (GLAC
     101) and CMIP (refer to Figure 13.1).
13.3. Nonappropriated Fund Financial Statement, RCS: HAF-SV(Q) 7407. Refer to AFI
34-209 for reporting requirements and additional instructions. This reporting system is designed
to provide increased surveillance and to improve the integrity and control of NAF activities at all
levels of command. For the system to be effective, it is essential that source data be completely
accurate, and distributed on a timely basis. The report provides a timely and effective analysis to
ensure sustained progress toward the operational objective. The formats of the financial
statements are the same for all funds. Prepare financial statements monthly and make the cut-off
date as of the last day of the month. The MAJCOM generates the quarterly report from the
monthly Command Financial Analysis System (CFAS) extracts submitted by their bases. When
preparing hard-copy financial statements, use examples of financial statements in Figure 13.2
and Figure 13.3. The financial statements consist of four basic elements:
     13.3.1. Balance Sheet. Use Figure 13.2 for the balance sheet format.
     13.3.2. I&E Statement. Use Figure 13.3 for the I&E statement format. Refer to AFI 34-
     209 for additional instructions. The I&E statement includes pertinent ratios and comparisons
     of expenses to income. Report the amount of APF received by the NAFI as a footnote to the
     quarterly consolidated statement for each NAFI. When preparing the I&E, the NAF AO
     ensures:
        13.3.2.1. The balance in GLAC 291 and the current year-to-date net income/loss on the
        consolidated I&E statement agree.
        13.3.2.2. The balance in GLAC 162 and the total of the individual CCCs' reports ending
        inventory agree.
        13.3.2.3. The year to date beginning inventory for each CCC report equals the 1 Oct
        beginning inventory.
     13.3.3. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF). Use Figure 13.4 for the SCF format. NAFs use
     the indirect method of preparing the statement of cash flows. The indirect method is based
     on reconciliation and evaluation of net income and balance sheet accounts (refer to Figure
     13.5) to arrive at cash generated from operations, financing, and investing activities. In
     addition, the indirect method reconciles the net change in cash and cash equivalents with the
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                99


  beginning and ending balance of the applicable general ledger accounts. Quarterly, the NAF
  AO sends the SCF to the MAJCOM/SVF for review.
  13.3.4. Supporting Schedules. HQ AFSVA/SVF requires the following minimum
  supporting schedules.
     13.3.4.1. Schedule of Aged Accounts Receivable, RCS: HAF-SV(Q)0206.
         13.3.4.1.1. Accounts Receivable. Report aged accounts receivable (A/R) information
         for Base MWR Funds, Isolated Unit Funds (IUF), and Base Lodging Funds to HQ
         AFSVA/SVFA as of the end of each quarter. Include GLACs 111, 113, 114, 115,
         121, 122, and recoursed accounts written off for the quarter. Report for each NAFI
         the amount of A/R that is current, 30 days delinquent, 60 days delinquent, 90 days
         delinquent, and 120+ days delinquent. For the Lodging Fund, include the same
         information as for the MWRF and IUF, but break out separately the aging for the
         individual guests and for agency accounts (i.e., Air Force Reserves, Air National
         Guard units).
         13.3.4.1.2. The MAJCOM will consolidate the report for the command and forward
         the report electronically to HQ AFSVA/SVFA NLT the 20th of the month following
         the end of the quarter.
         13.3.4.1.3. Other Aged A/R Report. The MAJCOM may require additional or other
         types of aging reports. Follow MAJCOM guidance to prepare these reports, but do
         not deviate from HQ AFSVA/SVFA’s reporting requirement.
     13.3.4.2. AF Form 1736, NAF Cash Management and Investment Program Account
     Verification. This schedule supports the quarterly financial statement. The NAF AO
     prepares this report. Show all reconciling items as an attachment to the AF Form 1736.
     Identify each reconciling item by the amount, document number, date, cause, and the
     method and date of correction. The RMFC certifies this schedule according to AFI 34-
     209. MAJCOMs review and forward the quarterly CMIP verification and applicable
     attachments to HQ AFSVA/SVFA according to AFI 34-209.
  13.3.5. Other Supporting Documentation to the Financial Statement. The NAF AO
  prepares the Special Morale and Welfare Expenditure Report for each quarter according to
  AFI 34-201 and AFI 34-209. Use Expenditures for SM&W Purposes, RCS: HAF-MWR(Q)
  8401 Report. Refer to AFI 34-201 for the reporting requirements.
  13.3.6. Special Instructions, Frequency, and Distribution:
     13.3.6.1. Unless otherwise stated, all NAF AOs transmit reports and supporting
     schedules according to AFI 34-209. Make base distribution as required. NAF AOs
     transmit reports of prepared financial statements according to the Services NAF
     Accounting System Users' Guide. MAJCOMs do not require hard copy submissions of
     the financial statement. Transmit financial statements electronically. EXCEPTION:
     Certain schedules (for example, aged A/R, CMIP verifications) and the SCF may not be
     automated by your command. Submit hard copies of these schedules and reports to your
     MAJCOM.
         13.3.6.1.1. Unit funds authorized to perform accounting send two copies of financial
         statements after the end of each reporting period to the servicing NAF AO. If the unit
100                                                        AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


          fund has no servicing NAF AO, send these statements directly to the host MAJCOM.
          Make other distributions as required locally.
          13.3.6.1.2. Subordinate commands, MAJCOM funds, and Air Force funds use
          accounting and reporting procedures prescribed for installation level funds. Make
          other distributions as required locally.
          13.3.6.1.3. Base restaurants prepare and date the report (covers fund operations for
          each reporting period) as of the last day of each period. The restaurant officer signs
          the original report and, except as provided in AFJI 34-122, submits it directly to the
          Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund, to arrive NLT the
          20th day of the month after the quarter reported, with an information copy to the
          MAJCOM. The report is forwarded through the MAJCOM at the major commander's
          discretion. AFJI 34-122 contains additional reporting requirements. Include a
          statement on the computation of dividends available according to AFJI 34-122.
          MAJCOMs send consolidated statements to HQ USAF/SVA according to the time-
          frame in AFI 34-209. Use the same time schedule established for all other NAFIs in
          AFI 34-209. Make MAJCOM consolidations as required.
          13.3.6.1.4. Prepare reports for each reporting period for CWFs the same as for
          MWRFs except that consolidation by cost center group is not required. Send reports
          to MAJCOM and HQ USAF/SVA according to the time-frame in AFI 34-209. Use
          the same time schedule established for all other NAFIs in AFI 34-209. AFJI 34-122
          contain reporting requirements for the civilian welfare fund. Use the financial
          statement formats in this chapter. The CWF custodian signs the report and, except as
          provided in AFJI 34-122, submits it directly to the BOD, AAFCWF to arrive not later
          than the 20th day of the month after the end of the reporting period with an
          information copy to the MAJCOM. The report is forwarded through the MAJCOM at
          the MAJCOM/CC’s discretion.
       13.3.6.2. MAJCOMs review financial statements received from lower echelons and the
       MAJCOM funds and transmit the 7407 report to HQ AFSVA/SVFA according to AFI

IV. DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNTING POLICY

For purposes of this statement of cash flows GLACs 108, Investments-Severance Benefits; 109, Interest Bearing
Deposit; 110, Cash In Bank-Savings; are considered cash equivalents.

NOTES:
1. Net income is adjusted to remove the effects of noncash, investing, and financing transactions. Net income is
adjusted by the net change of individual current asset and liability accounts, less the effect of investing and financing
transactions.

Use the following guidelines to arrive at cash flows from operations:
Current Assets: net increase reduces net income; Net decrease increases net income
Current Liabilities: net increase increases net income; net decreases reduces net income

      GENERAL LEDGER FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE ANDEXTERNAL FUND
                          TRANSACTIONS

14.1. Adjusting Entries to Interim Financial Statements. Refer to AFI 34-209 for the
requirements of interim financial statements. Adjusting entries include, but are not limited to:
       - Amortization of prepaid expenses.
       - Inventory adjustments.
       - Proration of unearned income.
   14.1.1. Automated Adjusting Entries. Some entries such as depreciation expense and
   inventory reversals have automated processing capability. The NAF AO must ensure that
   they perform the automated process for adjusting entries before closeout.
14.2. Trial Balance. Refer to AFI 34-209 for instructions on finalizing the financial statement
to include preparing the trial balance. Provide a copy of the preliminary trial balance to activity
managers and the NAFFA for their review before finalizing the financial statements. Activity
managers and the NAFFA make their review of the trial balance a priority in order to not delay
the financial reporting process.
14.3. Year-End Closeout. The NAF AO prepares a year-end financial statement at the end of
each FY (30 September). As of 1 October each year, close all income and expense accounts to
Fund Equity-Prior Years. Do not manually post this entry as the automated G/L End-of-Year
process performs this function. Refer to detailed information in the Services NAF Accounting
Users' Guide. The NAF AO must follow certain unique adjustments or procedures to properly
close out the old fiscal year and before beginning the new FY. They are:
   14.3.1. Adjust GLACs 273, 274, and 275 to reflect the value of all outstanding purchase
   orders, BPA calls, and requests for purchase, including those sent to the SCO (refer to
   Attachment 5 for each referenced GLAC).
   14.3.2. Close any unexpended portion of the current year NRB remaining in GLAC 277,
   278, 279, and 280 to GLAC 290 and reestablish amounts equal to the NRB budgeted for the
   next fiscal year (refer to Attachment 5 for each referenced GLAC).
   14.3.3. Prepare the usual trial balances and financial statements and submit the NAF
   Financial Statement Report (RCS: HAF-SV(Q) 7407) to your MAJCOM.
   14.3.4. The general ledger end-of-year processing automatically establishes beginning
   inventory amounts. The NAF AO does not manually post these amounts.

   records depreciation expense for any assets acquired, including the facility.
   14.5.2. The NAF AO prepares a check issue and requests cash transfer (CT) reimbursement
   through CMIP on the same day payment is made. Establish a payable and receivable
   (MAJCOM/AF Receivable, GLAC 114) for the amount the NAF AO will pay. The NAF AO
   credits cash when they make the payment. When HQ AFSVA makes the reimbursement,
   debit Cash and credit A/R (GLAC 114). Refer to AFMAN 34-215 for CMIP transactions.
14.6. Slot Machine Income and Expenses:
   14.6.1. The NAF AO posts slot machine income as activity revenue to the applicable CCC.
      14.6.1.1. Coins placed into or removed from the hopper and coins paid out for
      malfunctions result in a credit or debit to income.
      14.6.1.2. As the activity reimburses the change fund, the NAF AO posts amounts shown
      on documents for coins turned in for unauthorized jackpot wins, spontaneous payouts and
      coins removed from the hopper as a credit to income and coins placed into the hopper or
      paid out as malfunctions as a debit to income.
   14.6.2. The NAF AO prorates expenses for slot machine mechanics, Independent Observers
   (IO), and other related expenses from cost center A9 to slot machine cost centers G5, W5,
   X5, Y5, and Z5 based on MAJCOM criteria (unless delegated to base level). The MAJCOM
   may base the proration on income and/or number of machines used, however, any
   reasonable, consistent and documented method is acceptable. Use GLAC 729, Slot Machine
   Maintenance Expense, in the cost center receiving the benefit and use GLAC 801,
   Reimbursements from Other Activities/NAFIs, in CCC A9.
   14.6.3. The NAF AO posts all other income and expense according to the current automated
   system.
14.7. Aero Club Liability Insurance Expense:
   14.7.1. At the end of each month, the NAF AO obtains the flying hours from the aero club.
   The aero club should base the flying hours on the Hobbs meter and round them to the nearest
   whole hour. If the aircraft does not have a Hobbs meter installed, or the meter is inoperative,
   the aero club multiplies tachometer time by the factor of 1.2 and reports this to the NAF AO
   as flying hours.
   14.7.2. The NAF AO multiplies the hours flown in each aircraft by the specified rate to
   compute the liability premium for the month. Record insurance expense (GLAC 790) to
   each aircraft's CCC and accounts payable account.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                 119


   14.7.3. At the end of each quarter, HQ AFSVA/SVFF withdraws funds for the premium
   based on the flying hours report on the AF Form 270, Status of Aero Club Aircraft and
   Operations, each month. Record the cash remittance as a debit to accounts payable and
   credit to cash in bank.
   14.7.4. The NAF AO reconciles the premiums established as a liability to the amount pulled
   by HQ AFSVA/SVFF as the premium. If there is a variance, determine the reason and make
   necessary adjustments to Insurance expense (GLAC 790) for the applicable aircraft and
   Accounts Payable. Contact HQ AFSVA/SVFF, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 400, San
   Antonio, TX 78216-4138, to determine if corrections are needed to the funds previously
   withdrawn.
14.8. Aero Club Hull Insurance:
   14.8.1. Based on the declared value from the prior quarter, the NAF AO multiplies the
   declared value by the specified rate per aircraft. Record one-third of the total as a debit to
   hull insurance expense (GLAC 790) and a credit to other payables (GLAC 249) for each
   month of the current quarter to the applicable aircraft CCC. If the aero club has a grounded
   aircraft due to a major project, HQ AFSVA charges a reduced rate. Refer to AFI 34-208 for
   details.
   14.8.2. At the end of each quarter, HQ AFSVA withdraws funds through CMIP. The NAF
   AO posts it as a debit to other payables account (GLAC 249) and a credit to Cash (GLAC
   101). If a variance exists, determine the reason and make necessary adjustments. Refer to
   AFMAN 34-215 for CMIP transactions.
14.9. Workers' Compensation. HQ AFSVA/SVFF uses the RCS: HAF-SV(Q) 7407 Report
quarterly data and processes a cash remittance for the biweekly premiums approximately 45
days after the end of the quarter through CMIP based on dollar figures in the workers'
compensation liability GLAC. The NAF AO does not make CT payments for the workers'
compensation program premiums.

7407 Report quarterly data and processes a cash remittance for the biweekly premiums
approximately 45 days after the end of the quarter through CMIP based on dollar figures in the
UC liability GLAC. The NAF AO does not make CT payments for the UC program premiums.
14.11. Asset and Liability Insurance. Refer to AFI 34-209. Compute premium payments as
follows:
   14.11.1. Compute asset premium payments based on the book value of assessable assets.
   Assessable assets are defined as GLACs 101 through 110, 161 through 164, and 181, 182,
   and 185. Multiply the net total by the specified rate and record the expense.
   14.11.2. Compute liability premium payments based on assessable income GLACs less
   GLAC 905. Assessable income GLACs are GLACs 3XX, 5XX, and 8XX, less GLACs 502,
   809, 833, and 855. Multiply the net total of assessable income GLACs (less GLAC 905) by

                                          Chapter 16

                                TRAVEL AND PCS MOVES

16.1. Travel Coordinator. The SV commander or director appoints a travel coordinator to
administer the NAF employee travel program.
   16.1.1. Travel Orders. The SV commander or director, if designated by the installation
   commander, approves NAF official travel orders. The RMFC authenticates NAF official
   travel. The NAF AO accounts for NAF official travel. The travel coordinator prepares the
   travel orders.
   16.1.2. Reimbursable Travel. When the MAJCOM, HQ AFSVA/SVF, or other entity
   reimburses the travel, the RMFC or SV commander or director sends a letter and supporting
   documentation to the applicable echelon within 30 days after the date that the employee
   completes the travel.
   16.1.3. Reimbursement from HQ AFSVA/SVF. If HQ AFSVA/SVF does not receive
   requests for reimbursements and supporting documentation within 30 days after completion
   of the travel, they will not provide reimbursement until they receive written justification from
   the base. HQ AFSVA/SVF reimburses the base through the CMIP system or by check for
   non-CMIP locations. For travel that included Air Mobility Command (AMC) transportation,
   the NAF AO forwards the request for reimbursement not later that 120 days after the date the
   employee completed the travel.
16.2. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Moves of NAF Career Program Selectees and
Business Management Trainee Selectees. In 1989 the Air Force MWR Advisory Board
approved a program in which certain PCS moves of NAF Career Program selectees are centrally
funded by HQ AFSVA/SVF. The NAF AO can find detailed instructions in the most current
program training aid on PCS moves of NAF Career Program Selectee and Business Management
Trainees.
   16.2.1. The losing NAF AO provides support for the following:
       16.2.1.1. PCS Advance. If requested, the NAF AO at the losing base provides the
       employee with advance travel funds for the PCS moves in the amount approved
       according to AFI 34-201 and authorized by the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR). The NAF
       AO processes the payment to the employee as a debit to MAJCOM/AF Receivable
       (GLAC 114) and a credit to cash-in-bank (GLAC 101). The losing base requests
       reimbursement from HQ AFSVA/SVFF, Attn: Accounts Payable, 10100 Reunion Place,
       Suite 400, San Antonio, TX 78216-4138. In the reimbursement request to HQ
       AFSVA/SVFF include the name of the selectee, copies of DD Form 1614, Request and
       Authorization for DoD Civilian Permanent Duty Travel, the computer DD Form
       1351, Travel Voucher, and the check issued showing the check number, date and
       amount. Upon receipt of the reimbursement, debit cash-in-bank (GLAC 101) and credit
       accounts receivable (GLAC 114).
       16.2.1.2. Payment of Advance Wages. If HRO approves an advance payment of wages
       (refer to AFI 34-201 for employees making a PCS move to or from a foreign area), then:
128                                                      AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


          16.2.1.2.1. The losing NAF AO manually computes the wages for the approved
          period(s) and pays the net amount with a general check. The gaining NAF AO
          reports the taxes.
          16.2.1.2.2. Establish an A/R due from another NAFI (GLAC 113) and mail all the
          documentation to the gaining NAF AO. Reverse the receivable (GLAC 113) once the
          losing NAF AO receives payment from the gaining NAF AO.
      16.2.1.3. Annual/Sick Leave. Transfer annual and sick leave according to paragraph
      6.14 Pay the leave value to the gaining NAF AO by either a dollar transfer or a general
      check.
   16.2.2. The gaining NAF AO provides support for the following:
      16.2.2.1. Additional Travel Reimbursement. Pay additional expenses incurred by the
      employee as authorized by the JTR. Request reimbursement from HQ AFSVA/SVFF for
      the moving expenses according to paragraph 16.1.3 Request reimbursement for the
      gross amount paid. Establish a MAJCOM/AF Receivable (GLAC 114). When the
      reimbursement is received, reverse the MAJCOM/AF receivable (GLAC 114).
      16.2.2.2. IRS Reporting. The gaining NAF AO reports to the IRS the income paid to
      the employee, deposits applicable taxes withheld, and issues the TD Form W-2 at year-
      end. The FSO should compute the amount of taxes to be withheld.
      16.2.2.3. Employee Repayment of Advance Wages Provided in a PCS Move. The
      gaining NAF AO establishes an accounts payable to the losing NAF AO to reimburse for
      any advanced wages and sets up an A/R (Outside Agency, GLAC 115) that is due from
      the employee. Recoup wages from the employee by:
          16.2.2.3.1. Divide the net amount advanced by the number of pay periods specified
          as the pay back period. Process this amount as "other deductions" on the T&A record
          each pay period until the debt is paid.
          16.2.2.3.2. After each payroll is processed, make a journal entry to debit
          miscellaneous income (GLAC 812) and credit Outside Agency A/R (GLAC 115).
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   129

Terms
Accounting Period— An accounting period is from the first day of a given month through the
last day of the same month.
136                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


Accounting System— The NAF accounting system is based on commercial accounting
practices modified to meet the needs of the Air Force. The principles underlying this system are
based on experience, the needs within the Air Force NAFI environment, and generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP).
Accounting Year— The accounting year is from 1 October of a given year through 30
September of the following year. EXCEPTION: The USAFAAA accounting year is 1 July
through 30 June.
Activity— This term describes operational organizations within the SV structure, such as
bowling center, officers' club. An activity is made up of several subactivities. These
subactivities refer to the specific functions within each operational organization, or activity, such
as, lanes operation, snack bar, bar, dining room, slot machines, ticket operations, etc. Do not
confuse the operational functions of the "activity" with the accounting term "cost center" which
determines the level of accountability for financial transactions."
Assets— Economic resources obtained or controlled by NAFIs as a result of past transaction or
events. They are classified as either current or noncurrent items.
Balance Sheet— The balance sheet shows the financial position of a NAFI at a point in time. It
lists the assets and claims against the NAFI. The balance sheet lists separate columns for current
period (FY) and prior period data. This report also includes current and acid test ratios.
Budget Working Committee— Individuals selected by the Services Commander or Director to
review and prioritize items on NAF requirements budgets.
Cash Flow Budget— A formal financial plan which shows the beginning cash balance, the cash
inflows and outflows, and the ending cash balance expected for a period of time. The purpose of
the cash flow budget is to anticipate changes in the level of cash. A cash flow budget is prepared
for each NAFI.
Cost Center— Term used to identify the accounting subdivision of a NAFI. This term is used
for accounting purposes and should not be confused with the operational term "activity." A
standard 2-digit identity code is assigned by Air Force for each cost center.
Current Assets— Cash and other assets that should be turned into cash (accounts receivable and
inventory) during the next 12 months.
Current Liabilities— Debts that should be paid within the next 12 months; includes accounts
payable, accrued payroll, taxes, and current portion of loans payable.
Custodian— The Resource Management Flight Chief (RMFC) is the primary custodian for all
NAFIs supporting a base with the exception of the base restaurant and civilian welfare funds,
exchanges, and in some instances NAFIs at remote or isolated units.
Depreciation— The method used to expense the acquisition cost of a fixed asset over the life
expectancy of that asset.
Financial Analysis— Analysis is a continuing review and evaluation process throughout the
normal course of operations, with the manager as the focal point. The objective is to spot
potential problems, identify root causes, and obtain solutions.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                137


Fixed Assets— Tangible items with an individual cost of $1,000 or more, and with a life
expectancy of 2 years or more, which do not lose their identity through use. Includes items such
as, furniture, equipment, tools, machinery, facilities, major repairs and improvements, etc..
Fund Equity— Fund equity consists of capital invested in the NAFI plus the profit or minus the
loss resulting from operations since inception.
General Ledger— The core of the NAF accounting system and provides details of all
accounting entries for the current period. The system consists of control accounts for assets,
liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.
Host MWRF— Provides financial management and accounting services required by NAFIs at
other locations. The host MWRF custodian is responsible for financial management assistance
and accounting support, and serves as the focal point for fiduciary accountability.
Income and Expense (Operating) Budget— A formal financial plan which reflects monthly
and quarterly projected income and expenses for a fiscal year. It reflects the expected outcome
of management's plans and decisions in financial terms. It shows the revenue and associated
expenses an activity expects to generate over a given period. This budget gives the activity
manager an estimate of the profit to be realized from the operation. (For this reason, the I&E
budget is sometimes referred to as the "operating" budget.)
Liabilities— Obligations to transfer assets, provide services, or otherwise expense assets to
satisfy responsibilities resulting from past or current transactions. They are classified on the
financial statements as either current or noncurrent liabilities.
Minimum Cash Balance— The minimum amount of cash that should be kept in cash-in-bank
for efficient operations and sound cash management.
NAF Requirements Budget— A formal 5 year financial plan which shows the estimated cost
and time for buying new equipment, furnishings, renovating facilities, replacing and repairing
fixed assets, buying bulk purchases of expendable equipment and buying bulk purchases of high
cost supply items.
Small Operations— Those with limited programs and gross revenues of less than $36,500 per
year. Small operations may not require all of the detailed accounting records and procedures
outlined for NAFIs at bases or stations.
Statement of Cash Flows— The Statement of Cash Flows is a formal statement of cash
received and cash paid out for the period being reported. It shows the uses and sources of cash.
It is prepared by NAFI.
Unprogrammed NAF Expenditures— Expenditures for costly capital assets (equipment and
facilities) which are not included in the NRB of the NAFI (called "unprogrammed"). These can
cause serious cash flow problems.
In-Use Inventory— In-use inventory consists of merchandise maintained by operating activities
for resale or consumption in sales outlets such as bars, pro shops, restaurants, and snack bars.

workshops, etc.) use GLAC 504 to report income from instructor, lab and registration fees. Use GLAC 715 for all

          cost centers where the machines are located, i.e., C1, J1, W1, X1, and Z1. Exception: Use G2 for
          resale/revenue operations in the Community Center. The criteria for prorating the costs will be based
          on a combination of the number of machines in the benefiting cost center and the amusement machine
          income generated by the machines. Divide the number of machines in each cost center by the total
          number of machines in the installation program. Divide the amusement machine revenue in each cost
          center by the combined amusement machine revenue for all participating activities. Add the
          corresponding percentages for each activity and divide by two. Use the resulting percentage to prorate
          the expenses. Do not post amusement machine revenues to this cost center. All amusement machine
          revenues will be recorded in the administrative CCC where the machines are physically located.

 YES   NO   A - OPERATING MANAGER (Step 1)

            Did the flight chief or activity manager, with the help of the NAFFA, prepare a cost analysis to
            determine the discount rate required to make a commercial system an attractive alternative to
            the present system? (Refer to Part II.)

            Will the present inhouse accounts receivable system be eliminated by the proposed credit
            charge system?

            Did the flight chief or manager brief the advisory committee or governing body and
            installation commander and obtain approval before presenting credit system proposal to
            members?

            Did the activity manager inform customers that a new credit charge system was under
            consideration and explain the basic features of the new system?

            Were members informed that they will be permitted to select a club membership card that
            restricts charges and (or) monthly dues billing to the NAFI? (Refer to article I, paragraph D, of
            sample contract.)

            Has the requirement been prepared on an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, and is the
            statement of work detailed enough to be sensible, clear, and concise so the RMFC can start
            procurement action?

            If two or more NAFIs or activities want the commercial credit system, have the requirements
            been submitted as a package to procurement so that a consolidated contract can be negotiated?

            Have all approvals been attached to the purchase request?

 YES   NO   B - CONTRACTING OFFICER (Step 2)

            Has the RMFC been given enough time to negotiate and complete the contract before the
            desired starting date?

            Has the sample contract format in AFMAN 64-302 been used as the first bargaining position?

            Were all area banks invited to submit proposals?

            If two or more NAFIs or activities want the credit charge system, has a consolidated contract
            been negotiated as well as separate contracts to determine the most costeffective approach?

            Does the membership association contract provide for a charge card limited to dues and
            purchases at the membership association for members who want such a card?

            Does the contract permit credit to all members or customers regardless of grade or type of
            membership?

            Does the contract provide for a period of notification to the NAFI if the contractor elects to
            revoke a member's or customer's charge privileges?

      Does the contract contain a provision that permits both the contracting officer and the
      contractor to end the contract for convenience at no cost, if notice is given in writing?

      Has the date the credit charge system is implemented been set no earlier than 4 weeks from the
      date of approval?

      Does the contract contain the following clause under article III, if a standard merchant
      agreement is incorporated into the contract as Attachment 1? "The provisions set forth in
      Attachment 1 are incorporated herein. If there is conflict between the provisions of the basic
      contract (the schedule and the general provision) and the provisions in Attachment 1, the
      provisions in the basic contract control."

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This change incorporates interim change (IC) 98-1 which provides guidance for Air Force
Services vehicle management. Paragraph 3.5.1.3. added the requirement to justify NAF
Requirements Budgets (NRB) and to coordinate vehicle purchases with the vehicle control
officer (VCO). Paragraph 3.6.4. added a bullet which requires the SV commander or division
chief to review and approve the annual NAF vehicle budget exhibit. Paragraph 3.12. was added
to explain the requirements of the annual NAF vehicle budget exhibit. Figure 3.3. was added as
a format to follow for the annual NAF vehicle budget exhibit. Paragraph 7.14.1. was added to
require the AF Form 2534 be annotated with the sales price when NAF vehicles are sold.
Paragraph 7.14.2 was renumbered from 7.14.1. and clarified to include information that the
NAF Accounting Office (NAF AO) should receive the completed AF Form 2534.


3.5.1.3. Justify the requirements on their NRBs. Justifications for NAF vehicle purchases are
coordinated with the vehicle control officer. See paragraphs 3.12. and 7.14. and AFI 34-204.
Paragraph 3.6.4 added:
   •          Reviews and approves the annual NAF vehicle budget exhibit and submits it to
       the base NAFs council as part of the NRB budget submission.
3.12. NAF Vehicle Budget Exhibit. Before the beginning of each fiscal year, the vehicle
control officer prepares a NAF Vehicle Budget Exhibit. This exhibit should be prepared in
conjunction with the normal actions and deadlines set by the RMFC for submitting budgetary
documents to the base NAFs’ council. The exhibit will be an information item in the base
NAFs’ council agenda when submitting activity NAF Requirements budgets for approval.
3.12.1. The VCO obtains a list of all budgeted vehicles from the NAF AO. The data on this list
should be for the next fiscal year. It should identify the activity, type of vehicle budgeted,
estimated purchase price and estimated quarter of purchase. The VCO ensures all vehicles
budgeted by activity managers have been justified and approved by the Services commander or
director using the guidance in AFI 34-204. If there is not an approved vehicle authorization, the
VCO works with the applicable activity manager to prepare the needed justification
documentation.
3.12.2. The VCO uses the information received from the NAF AO to develop a NAF Vehicle
Budget Exhibit. Refer to the sample at Figure 3.3. At a minimum the exhibit includes the
following:
   •           Activities requesting NAF vehicles.
   •           Descriptions for vehicles requested.
   •           Quarter the vehicle is programmed for purchase.
   •           Estimated purchase price for each vehicle.

   •              Total dollar amounts for all budgeted vehicles (by quarter and annual total)
   •            The total proceeds received from sales of NAF vehicles during the past 12
         months. Use the 12 months prior to the date the report is prepared. Annotate which
         months were used for determining the proceeds from sales of vehicles. Refer to
         paragraph 7.14. for instructions on determining the dollar amount of proceeds from sales
         of NAF vehicles.
3.12.3. The NAF vehicle budget exhibit is provided to the SV Commander or Director for
review and approval and then submitted to the base NAFs Council as an integral part of all
Services NAF budgets submitted to the installation commander for approval.
Paragraph 7.14. added: For NAF Vehicles, the VCO annotates the AF Form 2534 with the sales
price for NAF vehicles sold. The VCO should ensure this information is available for use when
preparing the annual NAF vehicle budget exhibit (see paragraph 3.12.)

4 OCTOBER 1999


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This change incorporates interim change (IC) 99-1 which provides guidance for maintaining
Construction in Progress (CIP) accounts and closing out CIP projects. Paragraph 7.2. was
replaced and provides a general description of what types of items the CIP account should
contain. Paragraph 7.2.1. was added to require the use of a separate third digit shred to the CIP
account for each project. Paragraph 7.2.2. was added to provide details on documents to
maintain in the project subsidiary folder. Paragraph 7.2.3. was added to provide procedures on
removing old renovations from the general ledger when a new project substantially replaces the
old project. Paragraph 7.2.4. was added to give procedures for posting to the CIP account.
Paragraph 7.2.5. was added to define beneficial occupancy and states that it is the date to use for
transferring project costs out of the CIP account. Paragraphs 7.2.5.1. through 7.2.5.3. were
added to give procedures for the NAF AO to move the project costs and the
notification/certification required to be given to the Services deputy. Paragraph 7.2.6. was
added to explain who notifies the NAF AO of canceled projects or projects put on hold and the
accounting guidance. Paragraph 7.2.7. was added to explain the procedures when the final bills
are received after the project has been transferred out of the CIP account. A bar () indicates
revision from previous edition.


7.2. Construction-In-Progress. . Construction-in-progress includes all costs attributable to an
ongoing construction project to include costs of new buildings, renovations of existing buildings,
and fixed assets purchased as part of the project.


7.2.1. The NAF AO assigns a separate third digit shred to the Construction-in-Progress general
ledger account (GLAC 185) for each ongoing project.


7.2.2. The NAF AO maintains a separate subsidiary folder for each project. The subsidiary
contains copies of all accounting related documents pertaining to the project (contract,
modifications, budget approvals, copies of paid invoices, receiving reports, etc.). In addition to
the detailed supporting documents, the subsidiary must contain a construction summary which
lists the financial transactions relating to the project. As a minimum, the summary should list
each payment, payment date, amount, and the purpose of the payment (construction, equipment,
bulk purchases, supplies). The NAF AO must reconcile the subsidiary to the general ledger
monthly. This summary and the back-up documents are used at the end of the project to remove
items from the Construction-in-Progress account to the respective general ledger account codes.
332                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006



7.2.3. When starting a new renovation, the NAF AO reviews the property list of the respective
activity to identify previous renovations in the same activity. The RMFC, working with the
activity manager, determines which previous renovations will be substantially changed by the
new renovation. If the renovation description on the property list is unclear, the RMFC makes
the final determination or changes the property description to include more descriptive
information to better identify the renovation area. The RMFC writes-off the undepreciated value
of a previous renovation when the new renovation substantially changes the previous one. The
undepreciated value is written-off to the Gain/Loss on Disposal of Assets account in the
benefiting activity (GLAC 913). See paragraph 7.14. for information on disposal
documentation.


7.2.4. During a construction or renovation project for NAF facilities or facility improvements,
the NAF AO posts payments for the project to the applicable Construction-in-Progress account.
This includes project payments for contract progress payments, design costs, needs assessments,
purchases of equipment items which are part of the project, and purchases of supplies which the
activity will not use until the project is complete. The NAF AO posts amounts based on
documentation supporting the contract completion. When contractors base progress payments on
a percentage of completion clause, post the amount due, or paid, into construction-in-progress.


7.2.5. When the base takes beneficial occupancy of the building, the project is considered
complete and the amounts in the Construction-in-Progress account must be moved to the
appropriate asset and expense accounts. The beneficial occupancy date is when the
program/function for which the facility/project was intended is operating and/or open to
customers. There may be some items that require additional work, but, unless these prevent the
use of the facility, the project is considered 100 percent construction complete.


7.2.5.1. The SV deputy notifies the NAF AO, in writing, as soon as a project reaches the
beneficial occupancy date using the guidance in AFI 34-105, Programming for NAF Facility
Requirements.


7.2.5.2. Upon receipt of the memo, the NAF AO moves the project costs from the Construction-
in-Progress account to the proper asset or expense accounts within 30 days of the beneficial
occupancy date.


7.2.5.2.1. If you are capturing equipment cost in construction-in-progress until the activity puts
the equipment in use, record each equipment item, individually, in the fixed-asset equipment
account if it qualifies to be capitalized.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                    333


7.2.5.2.2. Post the total cost of the project, except for equipment, expendable items, and supply
items, into the applicable Fixed-Asset--Facilities and Renovations GLAC.


7.2.5.2.3. The RMFC and civil engineers (CE) establish the facility depreciation periods
according to Table 7.2. Submit completion report as required by AFI 34-201.


7.2.5.3. The RMFC must certify that the project is correctly transferred out of the Construction-
in-Progress account and recorded into the appropriate asset and expense accounts. The RMFC
provides a certification memo and a copy of the general journal detail listing showing the
transfer of the entries from the Construction-in-Progress account to the appropriate accounts to
the Services deputy.


7.2.6. The Services deputy also notifies the NAF AO, in writing, when a project is canceled or
put on indefinite hold. Once notified that a project is canceled or put on indefinite hold, the NAF
AO must remove any project costs from the Construction-in-Progress account within 30 days of
the written notification. These costs are normally design costs or needs assessment costs. The
amount is expensed directly to the Gain/Loss on Disposal of Assets account in the benefiting
activity. The RMFC must follow the guidance in paragraph 7.2.5.3. also.


7.2.7. Many times when a project reaches the beneficial occupancy date, the NAF AO has not
received all final bills. Do no delay removing the project from the Construction-in-Progress
account because all bills have not been received. If the final invoice is received within three
months of the initial set-up of the project (the time the project was moved to asset and expense
accounts), delete the original asset from the financial reports and re-establish the asset with the
new dollar value. If the final invoice is received after 3 months, record the transactions under the
same asset number and assign a suffix to identify the new entry with the original property item.
For example, if the original property number is 10010, assign 10010A, B, etc. for final invoices
received after three months.

                FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING

8 AUGUST 2002


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS 


This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2002-1, which provides guidance for the centrally
funded capital lease program. This program is being established for ILV approved programs to
fill a void in the process for obtaining certain high-ticket capital assets. Paragraphs 7.10.2. –
7.10.2.8.7. are added to establish the new procedures.


7.10.2. Central NAF Capital Lease Program. The following policies apply. 


7.10.2.1. NAFIs will not obtain cash loans, deferred time payments, lines of credit, or capital
leases from commercial or other non-Air Force sources without prior approval of HQ
USAF/ILV. 


7.10.2.2. This program will be operated through the Air Force Financial Management Fund
(AFFMF). 


7.10.2.3. All leases under this program will be established with a lease payment of both
principal and interest (interest factor subject to change quarterly – Oct, Jan, Apr, and Jul equal to
the interest the AFFMF would have earned on invested monies). 


7.10.2.4. All leases will be for the estimated useful life of the leased property as the ownership
of the asset will be transferred from the AFFMF to the applicable base NAFI once the asset is
purchased. 


7.10.2.5. Leases from the AFFMF are solely for equipment items; all facility acquisitions must
be processed through the Air Force Base Capital Improvement Fund (AFBCIF). 


7.10.2.6. HQ AFSVA/SVF will establish lease terms for repayment terms consistent with
GAAP. 
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                     335


7.10.2.6.1. If the base cannot meet the monthly payment, the MAJCOM successor fund will be
responsible for payment. If neither can fund, ownership of the asset will revert to the AFFMF
and the custodian will determine appropriate disposition. 


7.10.2.7. Monthly lease payments will be made through CMIP, Cash Transfer (CT). 


7.10.2.8. To obtain approval for a central NAF capital lease: 


7.10.2.8.1. The NAFI must budget for the lease of the capital asset to ensure cash flow will
sustain the monthly payments. The installation NAFs Council and installation commander must
approve the lease request. Budget of this expense is through the Income and Expense Budget. 




7.10.2.8.2. The installation commander receiving the lease request takes one of the following
actions: 


7.10.2.8.2.1. Approves submission of the request if it is determined to be valid, forwards the
request to the MAJCOM/SV to HQ AFSVA/SVF, and funds payments from available local
NAFI resources. 


7.10.2.8.2.2. Disapproves submission of the request in whole or in part and returns it to the
initiator through channels. 


7.10.2.8.3. The installation commander submits the request in writing with a description of the
requirement, justification, funding source, indication of the NAF Council’s support, and any
additional information that supports the request. 


7.10.2.8.4. The MAJCOM/SV will ensure support or non-support for the request from the
MAJCOM/CC or designee, and will forward supported lease requests to HQ AFSVA/SVF and
return those not supported to the requesting bases. 


7.10.2.8.5. HQ AFSVA/SVF will validate the request seeking input from Agency functional
representatives. If valid, the request will be forwarded to HQ USAF/ILV for decision through
AFSVA/CC. 


7.10.2.8.6. If approved by HQ USAF/ILV, the asset will be purchased by AFNAFPO for the
AFFMF with delivery instructions to the requesting base. 
336                                                                   AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006



7.10.2.8.7. Once the base receives the asset, AFSVA will begin to withdraw payment of
principal and interest through CMIP. Amounts collected will be deposited in the AFFMF. 


7.10.3. An operating lease does not meet the criteria of a capital lease as listed above. The NAF
AO posts the cost of an operating lease as rental expense (GLAC 793) using the appropriate cost
center code when payment is made. Make payments in accordance with the rental agreement. 


7.10.4. Treat capital leases not covered in paragraph 7.10.2. as operating leases. Record rental
expense (GLAC 793) to the applicable cost center over the life of the lease agreement.
Attachment 5.

IC 2006-01 to AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management
and Accounting

14 February 2006
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2006-01. This change incorporates changes which
update payroll and accounts payable information to include electronic funds transfer, off-line
payroll processing, changes in the fixed and bulk assets, and redefines the aged accounts
receivable schedule. Attachment 2- Attachment 5 have been updated to include all cost center
codes and general ledger account codes that have been added/changed. A bar () indicates
revisions from the previous edition. The NAF AO and SSC are interchangeable where the
accounting system is at the SSC.
1.16. Program Training Aids (PTAs). Additional guidelines can be found in the Services
Program Training Aids located on the Air Force Services web site, www-r.afsv.af.mil. A
complete index of the PTAs can be found for various subjects.
3.6.4.6. Budget Approval. Forwards completed budgets, except the CWF budgets, through the
base NAFs council, then to the installation commander for approval. Forward completed CWF
budgets through the CWF council, then to the installation commander for approval.
3.6.4.7. Reserved
6.1. Nonappropriated Fund Management Information System (NAFMIS) Payroll. The
NAFMIS payroll system operates on DISA OKC level UNISYS 2200 series computer and
provides payroll support for United States Air Force (USAF) non-appropriated fund civilian
employees. Reference AFCSM (Air Force Computer Systems Manual) 34-378, NAFMIS
Payroll Users Manual, for detailed information.
6.1.1. Time and Attendance (T&A) Report. Before pay is processed for an employee, an
authenticated T&A report must be submitted to the Payroll Technician within the Resource
Management Flight. One T&A report is required for each active employee whether or not the
employee is in a pay status. The Activity Manager or authorized designee certifies each T&A
report with his/her signature. Facsimile and electronic signatures are NOT authorized. T&A
reports are completed using the Time and Attendance Report produced by the AF approved
Labor Management System. A list of individuals authorized to sign T&A reports must be
forwarded to the Resource Management Flight Office and updated on a continued basis, as
necessary.
6.1.2. Overtime Approval. Overtime payment is required for hours worked that are officially
ordered or approved. Non-exempt employees must also be paid for overtime suffered or
permitted. Generally, if management determines the need for overtime work, it must be
approved, in writing, in advance. An exception to the prior approval rule are instances where
overtime work is required on short notice and prior written authorization cannot be obtained. If
management does not authorize overtime work, it must make sure that employees work only
during their scheduled tour of duty. Authorizations for overtime work are handled at the
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                     341


activity/cost center and are NOT forwarded to the payroll processing office. Overtime payment
is authorized by the employee’s supervisor or designee via an authenticated Time and
Attendance (T&A) Report.
6.3. Payroll Checks/EFT. NAF employees are federal employees and governed by federal law.
EFT for payment of wages is a condition of employment or a waiver must be on file in the
employee’s payroll folder. The NAF AO distributes the leave and earnings statement (LES) and
the payment of wages are available on the Friday following the end of the pay period. Bases
with a manual or contract payroll should ensure checks are dated the Friday following the end of
a pay period; pay dates in NAFMIS are handled programmatically. As an exception, pay dates
are the preceding day, Thursday, when Independence Day, Veterans’ Day, Christmas, or New
Year’s Day are observed on a payday.
6.4. Manual Pay Preparation. When manual preparation of pay is necessary due to unforeseen
circumstances (for example, as a result of input error, incorrect EFT data, or miscellaneous other
situations), the NAF AO will utilize the central cashier operation to make payment.
6.4.1. The payroll technician will prepare an AF Form 2539, NAF Disbursement Request. The
technician will calculate the amount due to the employee and complete the request, as currently
done attaching all supporting documentation. The technician will prepare an AF Form 2557,
NAF Cash Receipt Voucher, pre-numbered, in triplicate. These pre-numbered forms should not
have more than a maximum 5-digit numbering sequence.
6.4.2. The disbursement request must be approved for payment by the RMFC or designee.
6.4.3. The disbursement request will be vouchered through accounts payable and expensed to the
employee’s cost center in GLAC 812.
6.4.4. After all paperwork is completed and approved, contact the employee to report to the
central cashier cage. Forward the paperwork to the central cashier. When the employee arrives,
the central cashier will pay the employee the dollar amount written on the request and the AF
Form 2557, verifying the two amounts are the same. The employee will sign the AF Form 2557
and receive the second copy of the form. The original signed AF Form 2557 will be attached to
the AF Form 2539 as verification that the disbursement was made and accepted by the employee.
The third copy of the AF Form 2557 will remain with the central cashier as supporting
documentation for the daily deposit.
6.4.5. Accounts payable will process the payment to clear the voucher using the signed copy of
the AF Form 2557 as proof of payment (similar to a check copy). Using the central vendor
payment (CVPP) screen in the field accounting system (FAS) to clear the open item using the
number from the AF Form 2557 as the check number. This process will make the appropriate
general ledger entries. See the FAS users’ guide, Chapter 6, for detailed instructions of the
CVPP process.
6.4.6. Final Pay. NAF employees are federal employees and governed by federal law. There are
no federal requirements to issue the final paycheck anytime prior to its normal issue date.
7.1.3. Other type assets used in the activity are recorded (for control purposes) with a zero dollar
value (see AFI 34-204).
342                                                           AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


7.2.3. When starting a new renovation, the NAF AO reviews the property list of the respective
activity to identify previous renovations in the same activity. The RMFC, working with the
activity manager, determines which previous renovations will be substantially changed by the
new renovation. If the renovation description on the property list is unclear, the RMFC makes
the final determination or changes the property description to include more descriptive
information to better identify the renovation area. The RMFC writes-off the undepreciated value
of a previous renovation when the new renovation substantially changes the previous one, The
undepreciated value is written-off to the Gain/Loss on Disposal of Assets accounts in the
benefiting activity (GLAC 913 or 813). See paragraph 7.14. for information on disposal
documentation.
7.3. Fixed Assets-APF Titled. The activity manager, working with the logistics manager, may
transfer NAF procured property or facilities to APF for maintenance when allowed by AFIs 34-
201 and 65-106. The NAF AO posts these items in the NAF property records and general ledger
as Fixed Assets-APF titled (signifies government title). Depreciate them according to Table
7.2. Include the following footnote in the balance sheet: "The title of real property financed
with nonappropriated funds and reported hereon is vested in the United States Government. See
AFI 34-204 to determine what assets are to be recorded on the Master Fixed Asset Listing
(MFAL).
7.7. Non-reimbursable Transfers. Record property items received from, or transferred to,
another Air Force NAFI as a transfer of equity. The NAF AO uses the fair market value of the
items transferred as the acquisition price of the transferred equity. Capitalize items transferred
with a value of $1,000 or more, including all transportation, training, or related charges. These
items must have a useful life of two years or more. Depreciate the asset according to Table 7.2.
Expense those items valued at less than $1,000 to the applicable receiving activity and those
items with a useful life of less than two years. Refer to AFI 34-201 for additional guidance
concerning inter- and intra-NAFI transfers.
7.12.2.4. Do not charge depreciation to a NAFI’s or activity’s administrative cost center code
except when it meets the criteria in AFI 34-209.
7.14. Disposition of Assets. The accounting procedures for disposing of NAF property
contained in AFI 34-209 apply to all assets including those acquired by transfer or donation
(unless there is an exception stated in this chapter). See AFI 34-204 for detailed instructions to
be followed when disposing of assets.
7.15. NAF Fixed Assets Inventory. As a minimum, activities must conduct a physical inventory
of NAF fixed assets at least once during each fiscal year. Personnel from activities, other than
the activity being inventoried, observe activity personnel as they take the impartial physical
inventory. See AFI 34-204 for fixed asset inventory requirements, procedures and individual
responsibilities.

7.16.1.2. Volume Purchases of High Value Supplies. SV may treat certain types of bulk
purchases as volume purchases of high value supply items. These items do not qualify for the
procedures in paragraph 7.16.1.1. Each supply item in the bulk purchase must have a useful life
of three months or more. The RMFC, working with the SV commander or division chief, sets a
policy to determine the dollar value for high value supplies purchased in volume. (see AFI 34-
204)

that is less than 3 months, or greater than the life of the item.
7.17. Reserved.
7.18. Aero Clubs. Do not set up accruals for major renovations or engine overhauls to be
performed in the future.
7.18.1. Aircraft Capital Improvements. The NAF AO sets up capital improvements made to an
aircraft in the fixed asset system as a repair. The repair should include adequate descriptions,
serial numbers etc. to enable identification of the improvement. The fixed asset system will
separately identify the addition to the original aircraft as part of that aircraft but will identify it
separately.

(GPC) or Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) for all purchases.
11.1. Establishment of Accounts Payable. The amounts recorded as accounts payable are for
liabilities incurred for the receipt of goods or services. Orders or agreements must be in writing
and supported by a receiving report or proof of shipment before a liability may be recorded.
11.1.1. Maintain a suspense file for all payables. This file should be set up to ensure timely
payments and facilitate end of month reconciliation. Documents remaining unpaid at the end of
month should equal the outstanding items on the invoice register. The invoice register, in turn,
should equal the balance in GLAC 201.

11.2. Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). The NAF AO is required by Congressional mandate to
use EFT to pay U.S. vendors. Authorized EFT exemptions that require no further approval and
for which checks or petty cash would be used for the disbursements are as follows:
11.2.1. SM&W expenditures are to be made by EFT to the vendor when a purchase order is
required and through the central cashier to reimburse for approved expenditures. No advance of
funds is authorized.
11.2.2. Entertainment contracts.
11.2.3. Customer refunds (use the Change Fund/Daily Activity Receipts, where possible).
11.2.4. Change Fund establishment or replenishment.
11.2.5. Prize/Bingo winners (use Change Fund/Daily Activity Receipts, where possible).
11.2.6. Other Federal Agencies (i.e., DFAS or DAO). For DAOs, funds will be disbursed via
EFT or through the central cashier.
11.2.7. State entities not accepting EFT.
11.2.8. Isolated Unit Funds. Funds will be disbursed via EFT or through the central cashier.
11.2.9. Bowling League accounting done by NAF AO.
11.2.10. The RMFC may approve exemptions for persons on Individual Service Contracts who
are not expected to be paid more than one time during the current fiscal year. These individuals
will continue to be paid by check.
11.2.11. Base-level units receiving MWR support for unit activities should make payment using
the GPC (government purchase card) or prepare an AF Form 1401, NAF Petty Cash/Refund
Voucher, to obtain funds from the central cashier. The base-level unit fund representative may
be accompanied by a Services representative with a NAF GPC to make the needed purchases.
11.2.12. If a vendor returns your EFT payment (i.e., because they are not on-line with their bank
to receive the EFT information), do not calculate prompt payment penalties. The vendor was
considered paid when the EFT payment was sent to their bank account. Prepare and mail a
check to pay the vendor.
11.3. Proof of Shipment. Sometimes it is necessary to pay a vendor on proof of shipment rather
than on receipt of goods. Although this is more common for overseas orders, review contract
terms to determine if the vendor requires payment on shipment.
11.3.1. Match the proof of shipment and vendor invoice to the suspense copy of the Purchase
Order. Establish the account payable using the invoice with proof of shipment as the supporting
documentation and enter into the general ledger as Inventory in Transit (GLAC 163).
11.3.2. Suspense the paid voucher pending receipt of the receiving report from the activity.
When the order is received, process a journal voucher to credit GLAC 163 to clear the original
entry and debit the appropriate expense account.
11.4. Documentation Required for Payment. Three documents are usually required to process
payment to a vendor. They are a purchase order or a delivery order written against an NPA,
EPP, or BPA, a receiving report and a valid invoice. For OCONUS bases an additional
document would be the proof of shipment (see 11.3. above). Payment to the vendor should be
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                      345


made in accordance with the contract terms. Contracts are not required to process payments for
registration or entry fees, NAF official travel, workers’ compensation payments, Government
Purchase Card (GPC), or commercial telephone service. Use an AF Form 2539, NAF
Disbursement Voucher, for these type payments and attach all supporting documentation.
11.4.1. If the NAF AO overpays a vendor, make an adjustment on the next payment to the
vendor. Take a credit for the overpayment. Reference the credit taken to the contract or the PO
number and to the vendor’s invoice number. If the overpayment was made to a vendor that is
not regularly used, the NAF AO contacts the vendor and requests a refund. Reverse the
overpayment from the appropriate expense account, and establish it as an account receivable,
using GLAC 115, Outside Agency Receivables.
11.4.2. Do not delay payment of bills because of minor errors. When the NAF AO receives an
invoice containing minor errors and the contracting officer confirms that prices on the PO or
contract are correct, make one of the following adjustments:
11.4.2.1. When the price stated on the invoice is higher than the price stated in the PO, pay the
price stated in the PO for the quantity actually received.
11.4.2.2. When the price stated on the invoice is less than the price stated on the PO, pay the
invoice price for the quantity received.
11.4.3. In certain cases, such as payments for entertainers, the RMFC may authorize advance
preparation of disbursement requests. Payment may be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)
or check. In either instance the activity manager or designee certifies completion of the
performance and forwards the certification to the NAF AO on the first business day following
completion of service.
11.4.4. Do not process any payments before obtaining required approval signature.
11.5. Distribution of EFTs/Checks/Paid Documents. For payments made by EFT, print
remittance advices and obtain the signature of an authorized check signer. Mail or fax one copy
of the remittance advice to the vendor and attach the other copy to the paid voucher. If a check
has been issued, the NAF AO mails the original check to the vendor. Mark spoiled checks as
void, deface the signature block, and forward to the CMIP technician for update to the cash
control summary.
11.5.1. Maintain a check number control log to record checks issued. This can be accomplished
by running the check register from the field accounting system (FAS) whenever checks are
printed. Suspense these copies until end of month when a Monthly Check Register can be
printed.
11.5.2. Stamp all invoices as ―paid‖ and file the original disbursement voucher with supporting
documentation in alphabetical order by vendor, with a secondary breakout in chronological
order.
11.6. BPA. In view of the requirements of the Prompt Payment Act (paragraph 11.10.), the NAF
AO can pay for purchases monthly as long as the guidelines in paragraph 11.10.4. are followed.
The NAF AO does not need to make this at the end of month. The NAF Contracting Officer can
work with vendors to establish mid-month due dates and lighten the end-of-month workload. A
monthly payment allows the accumulation of documents relating to a single vendor to be

processed as one payment. In some cases, payment will be made before the regular payment
cycle to take advantage of discounts or to fulfill partial pre-payment provisions in a contract.
11.7. Centralized Payment of Consolidated Purchases. HQ AFSVA/SVT normally makes
payment based on constructive delivery (receipt of proof of shipment) of the items. On the day
of payment, the applicable base's CMIP message will reflect the withdrawal from the CMIP
account. If the activity has already received the merchandise and recorded the transaction in
accounts payable, process the CMIP transaction by selecting Accounts Payable in the Check
Processing Menu. If an Accounts Payable has not been established, prepare a JV to record the
CMIP withdrawal as a debit to GLAC 163,Inventory In Transit. Keep a copy of the CMIP
message to support this entry, and reverse as soon as merchandise is received, credit GLAC 163,
and debit the correct expense account. All CVPP discounts are posted to GLAC 810 XX. When
CVPP merchandise is received before the CMIP transaction has been processed, record the
receipt of goods in Accounts Payable and debit the appropriate expense account. Refer to
paragraph 10.2. for CVPP.
11.8. Payments to Family Child Care Home Providers. Individuals wishing to provide child
care services in their homes complete an application and sponsor agreement provided by the
Family Child Care Coordinator (FCC). The provider records the number of breakfasts, lunches,
snacks, and dinners on a USDA form provided by the FCC. The family child care provider
submits this form to the Family Child Care Coordinator at the end of each month. The
coordinator computes the amount of reimbursement due each provider and the amount of
sponsorship fee, if any, due the Family Child Care Program, and forwards the disbursement
voucher to the NAF AO. The NAF AO:
11.8.1. Assigns the family child care provider a vendor code in the accounts payable system. Do
not generate an IRS Form 1099. USDA Child Care Food Program disbursements are "grants-in-
aid" and aren't taxable since the IRS considers the payments to be reimbursements for running a
non-profit food service program based upon pre-set meal rates or actual costs.
11.8.2. Sets up an accounts payable voucher in the standard NAF accounting system each month
and records the amount due to be reimbursed by USDA in GLAC 115, Outside Agency
Receivables.
11.9. Payments For Government Travel Card and Government Purchase Card Accounts.
HQ AFSVA/SVF establishes Government Travel Cards (GTC) for the RMFC at each base and
for each MAJCOM. HQ AFSVA/SVF centrally administers account activation and deactivation.
The RMFC administers the account locally. Official Travel may not be charged to the GPC
account and must be charged to the GTC. Accounts payable should be set up as soon as tickets
or other travel expenses are charged to the GTC account. The accounts payable transactions are
cleared when payment is processed upon receipt and verification of the bank statement.
11.9.1. Cardholders enter Government Purchase Card (GPC) purchases into the bank online
transaction log. The cardholder reconciles GPC purchases posted to the cardholder's account by
the bank against the transaction log, and either approves or disputes transactions. When the
cycle closes for the month, or the last business day prior to the end of the cycle, the cardholder
approves the monthly cardholder statement online. The billing official reviews cardholder
transactions for propriety and certifies the invoice for payment online after all cardholders have
approved their monthly statements. GPC invoices are transmitted to the base by EDI and
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                   347


electronically interface into the NAF accounting system. Payment method is Confirm and Pay,
which requires billing official invoice certification before the invoice will transmit to the base.
The payment voucher is created at the time of interface and should be paid in full. The NAF AO
manually vouchers any interface rejects and includes the amount in the payment to the bank. It
is not necessary for the NAF AO to wait to receive all EDI invoices before making payment.
Payment against each voucher should be made as soon as possible in order to maximize the
refund offered by the bank. Cardholders should follow-up on any disputed charges with the
vendor and bank. The NAF AO should track any credits due from the bank to ensure they are
received.
11.10. Prompt Payment Act (Public Law 97-177) Requirements. The Prompt Payment Act
applies to contracts awarded (including purchase and delivery orders), calls placed against
blanket purchase agreements, and blanket delivery orders on or after 1 Apr 1989. The Act also
applies to contracts awarded by contracting officers located outside the United States, when
performance of the services or delivery of the supplies will occur outside the United States.
11.10.1. The Act requires federal agencies to pay their bills on time. The NAF AO takes
discounts when payments are made by the discount date and pays interest penalties on late
payments. HQ AFSVA/SVF publishes the applicable rate, as required by the Secretary of the
Treasury. The NAF AO must pay interest penalties when due, regardless of whether the vendor
concerned requests their payment. Interest calculation is based on a 360-day year.
11.10.2. Under the provisions of the Act and this AFMAN, consider the vendor paid on the
settlement date for an EFT payment, or on the date the NAF AO issues the check. Mail checks
the same day they are dated (issued). The Act requires that:
11.10.2.1. When the payment includes a penalty, the NAF AO must include a notice to tell the
vendor:
11.10.2.1.1. The amount of the interest penalty included in the payment.
11.10.2.1.2. The rate used to compute the penalty.
11.10.2.1.3. The number of days used to compute the penalty.
11.10.3. Except for GPC card payments, do not make payments earlier than 7 days before the
due date. However, if the day a payment is due (basic period ending with the due date) falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, the NAF AO may make payment the following workday without
an interest penalty. Unavoidable late payments are subject to the interest penalties discussed in
this paragraph, and will cover the period from the day after the due date through the payment
date.
11.10.3.1. Interest penalty amounts, which remain unpaid at the end of each 30-day period, are
added to the original principal amount. The interest then accrues on the new principal amount
for the next 30 days. The process repeats until the NAF AO makes payment for the total amount.
Do not accrue interest in excess of one year.
11.10.3.2. Interest penalties are not due until the payment due date has passed, the NAFI has
accepted delivery (paragraph 11.10.9.), and the NAFI has received a proper invoice (paragraph
11.10.7.). If an EFT payment is rejected due to incorrect bank account information supplied by
the vendor, interest under this regulation will not accrue until seven days after correct
348                                                              AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


information is received (provided vendor has been notified of incorrect bank information within
seven days of payment being rejected by AFSVA).
11.10.3.3. The Act does not require interest penalties when the NAF AO delays payment because
of a disagreement over the amount of the payment or other issues concerning compliance with
the terms of the contract, for financing payments such as advance payments, or for the period
when amounts are withheld temporarily according to the contract. Interest payment is not
required when an EFT payment is not credited to the vendor’s account because of a failure on the
part of the Federal Reserve or the vendor’s own financial institution. The NAF AO need not pay
interest penalties of less than $1.00. Interest penalties do not continue to accrue for more than
one year or after a claim for such penalties is filed under the Contract Dispute Act of 1978.
11.10.3.4. The rate used to figure the interest penalty is the rate in effect at the time of the
payment due date, not at the time the payment is made.
11.10.3.5. The Act requires an additional penalty, 100% of the original unpaid interest, when a
late payment interest penalty is owed and is not paid within 10 days of making the late payment
and the contractor makes a written request. To be valid, the contractor must postmark the
request by the 40th day after payment was made. If there is no postmark, the request is still valid
if the NAF AO personnel receive the request and annotate it with the date of receipt by the 40th
day.
11.10.3.5.1. The additional penalty does not apply to payment of utility bills.
11.10.3.5.2. The additional penalty will be no less than $25.00 and no more than $5,000.00.
11.10.3.5.3. The additional penalty on unpaid interest will accrue until it is paid (per paragraph
11.10.3.1.).
11.10.4. If the contract states a specific due date, the NAF AO must pay interest if the NAF AO
does not make payment on or before the due date. The following are payment due dates, unless
otherwise specified by the contract (except paragraph 11.10.4.1. below; in this instance the
contract cannot specify any other payment due date).
11.10.4.1. In the case of meat or meat food products, poultry or poultry food products, egg or egg
products, seven days after delivery.
11.10.4.2. In the case of perishable agricultural commodities, 10 days after delivery.
11.10.4.3. In the case of dairy products and edible oils and fats, the 10th day after receipt of a
proper invoice.
11.10.4.4. In the case of construction contract progress payments, 14 days after the billing office
receives a payment request from the contractor or such longer period as the contract may specify
(does not include the final payment on a construction contract or a construction contract paid in
one lump sum, which is covered in paragraph 11.10.4.5. below).
11.10.4.5. In all other cases, 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice or acceptance, whichever is
later.
11.10.4.6. In the case of mixed invoices that contain items with different payment periods, the
NAF AO:
11.10.4.6.1. Makes payments as stated in the contractual payment provisions.
AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006                                                                    349


11.10.4.6.2. Must pay interest if payment is made so that some items are paid after their due
dates.
11.10.4.6.3. May split payments for each category.
11.10.4.6.4. May encourage but not require contractors to submit multiple invoices for payment
of individual orders.
11.10.4.6.5. May encourage but not require contractors to submit separate invoices for categories
of products with different payment periods.
NOTE: For overseas shipments, the periods prescribed in this subparagraph start on receipt of a
proper invoice and proof of shipment document or a proper invoice and receiving report,
whichever is received earlier.
11.10.5. The interest penalty provisions in paragraphs 11.10.1., 11.10.2., and 11.10.3. above
and due date requirements prescribed in paragraph 11.10.4. above also apply to contracts for
goods or service that do not prohibit periodic payments and partial delivery payments for
completed phases of construction projects, as distinguished from contract financing authorized
by the contract.
11.10.6. If an invoice contains any defects or improprieties, the vendor must be notified, in
writing, of the defects or improprieties within three days for meat or meat food products, five
days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products and edible fats and oils, and seven
days in all other cases after receipt. The effective date of the notice is the day the notice is
transmitted (mailed, faxed, or e-mailed). If this notice is not given within the appropriate time
period, the due date requirements apply and the number of days allowed for payment on receipt
of a proper (corrected) invoice is reduced by the number of days the notice was forwarded after
the end of the applicable notice period.
11.10.7. A proper invoice must include the name of the vendor; invoice date; contract number;
the description, price, and quantity of the goods or services delivered; shipping and payment
terms; name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of individual to whom
payment is to be made; and any other information required by the contract.
11.10.8. When a time discount is available and taken, payment will be made as close as possible
to but not later than the discount date. The discount date is the date by which, if payment is
made, a specified discount can be taken. The discount period starts with the date of the invoice.
Example: merchandise is received on 15 May and the invoice is dated 10 May, the date used to
figure the discount period is 10 May. When a discount is improperly taken because payment was
not made within the discount period, interest will be paid on the discount taken beginning with
the day after the discount period ended until full payment is made.
11.10.9. Forward receiving reports to the NAF AO not later than the first business day after
receipt and acceptance of the goods or services involved. The paying office must date stamp all
invoices, receiving reports, and proof of shipment documents with the actual date received. If
the paying office (NAF AO) fails to date stamp an invoice when received, consider the date of
the invoice as the date of receipt by the paying office. An invoice is considered received on the
later of:
350                                                            AFMAN34-214 14 February 2006


11.10.9.1. The date a proper invoice is received by the designated billing office (NAF AO) and
the invoice is stamped with the date of receipt at the time of receipt; or
11.10.9.2. The date on which the agency accepts the property or services; or
11.10.9.3. The fifth workday following delivery of the property or performance of services if
acceptance is not specified in the contract; or
11.10.9.4. The date placed on a proper invoice by the contractor when the NAF AO fails to date-
stamp the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt.
11.10.10. For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions apply:
11.10.10.1. Billing office. Refer to the definition for paying office.
11.10.10.2. Contract financing payments. Authorized disbursement of monies prior to
acceptance of supplies or services including advance payments, progress payments based on
cost, progress payments (other than under construction contracts or architect engineer contracts)
based on a percentage or stage of completion, and interim payments on cost-type contracts.
Contract financing payments do not include invoice payments or payments for partial deliveries.
11.10.10.3. Dairy products and edible fats or oils. All dairy products, as a minimum liquid milk,
cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, and ice cream; edible fats or oils and
food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as a minimum, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and
other similar products.
11.10.10.4. Day. Calendar day, including weekends and holidays, unless otherwise indicated.
11.10.10.5. Meat and food products. All perishable (fresh, chilled, or frozen) meats, including
processed meats such as edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, perishable poultry meat food

character, including those frozen, packed in ice, or packed in brine, dairy products, edible fats
and oils.
11.10.10.8. Paying office. The office responsible for scheduling invoices for payment. For
purposes of meeting the requirements of the Act, the NAF AO is designated the official paying
office for Air Force NAFIs. NAF AO is also the designated billing office. The Act requires the
billing office to be designated in contracts to receive invoices from contractors.
11.11. Ratification. If an individual makes an unauthorized purchase, a ratification package is
prepared. This consists of Employee’s Statement of Facts, Supervisor’s Certification, Invoice,
and funded Purchase Request. The NAF contracting officer will review and prepare necessary
contractual documents for forwarding to the servicing legal office. After legal review the
package is forwarded to the appropriate ratifying authority for consideration. Refer to AFMAN
