                         BASIC RAM SHIPPING PROCEDURES

A3.1. Each receiving or shipping agency must have a separate, marked, and locked enclosure for
the receipt, handling, or shipment of radioactive packages. This separate area is to ensure
personnel not familiar with the proper RAM handling are not accidentally exposed to ionizing
radiation. This location must be coordinated with the 509 BW RSO.
A3.2. All RAM that are covered by a license or permit must be accounted for by a RAM transfer
receipt, which is separate from any contractual, security, or other receipt documents. Contract
shipping and receiving agencies should obtain transfer receipts when items are dispensed
to the 509 BW organizations.
A3.3. When RAM is received at, or is to be shipped from, the 509 BW, the 509 BW RSO must
be contacted by the receiving or shipping agency. The 509 BW RSO or designated
representative will monitor the container. Contractors must notify in advance the 509 BW
RSO of any shipping, receiving and/or movement of any RAM at Whiteman AFB.
Contractors must perform all labeling, packaging, and monitoring requirements outlined
in the federal law for their RAM. Note: In accordance with 10 CFR 20.1906, all packages
labeled with a Radioactive White I, Yellow II, or Yellow III, as specified DOT regulations (49
CFR 172.403 and 172.436-440), must be monitored as soon as possible but not later than 3 hours
after the package is received. If the package is received after normal duty hours, the package
must be surveyed not later than 3 hours from the beginning of the next workday.
   A3.3.1. If the RAM received is a sealed source, the most recent leak test results must
   accompany the package, and a copy of these results must be sent to the 509 BW RSO. If this
   test does not accompany the sealed source, an individual approved by the 509 BW RSO
   performs the leak test before the item is placed into use. Current leak test results must
   accompany sealed sources shipped from the 509 BW.
   A3.3.2. Once the package has been monitored and cleared by the 509 BW RSO, contact the
   user or custodian and transport the material directly to the user or custodian. If the user or
   custodian cannot be located, store the RAM until the user or custodian accepts receipt. Note:
   Only authorized personnel will open or package containers of RAM or RAM-containing
   items.
A3.4. If the RAM is to be transported from the 509 BW, prepare for shipment and packaging per
applicable NRC and Department of Transportation regulations. Contact the 509 BW RSO for
assistance and shipping surveys.
