                                          Chapter 2

                            COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

2.1. General. The AFSOC Command and Control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism
which keeps the AFSOC Commander (CC) informed of the current status of AFSOC forces
while enabling the Wing or Group Commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations.
   2.1.1. Waiver request will be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control
   of the mission. All waivers will be coordinated through Stan/Eval channels.
2.2. Command and Control. AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for United States
Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)-assigned Air Force SOF aircraft, while Theater
Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) have OPCON of theater-based assets. In practice,
responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the Wing or
Group Commander. The Wing or Group Commander, in turn, exercises control of non-close-
hold missions through the command post supporting the wing or group. In the event that
assigned forces undergo a Change in Operational Control (CHOP), responsibility for mission
monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command. Changeover will
be accomplished IAW the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational Order, or deployment or
execution order.
2.3. Air Force Special Operations Command Forces OPCON. The 23 AF/CC exercises
directive authority of all AFSOC units under Title 10 when transiting between Continental
United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) destinations or
supporting CONUS missions tasked by headquarters Above Wing Level (AWL). The C2 agency
responsible for 23 AF/CC execution authorities is the 623d Air Operations Center (AOC).
   2.3.1. 23 AF/CC will exercise directive authority of CONUS, OCONUS, and ARC forces
   when:
       2.3.1.1. CONUS forces depart home station for above wing-level tasked missions
       including:
          2.3.1.1.1. Deployments.
          2.3.1.1.2. Air Apportionment Allocation Conference taskings.
          2.3.1.1.3. Joint Air Apportionment Allocation Conference (JAAAC) taskings.
          2.3.1.1.4. Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET)/Counter Narcotics Training
          missions.
          2.3.1.1.5. Other specified missions as tasked via the SOF Air Tasking Order (ATO)
          in SOFAPPS.
       2.3.1.2. CONUS and OCONUS forces depart a TSOC/Joint Special Operations Air
       Component (JSOAC) Area of Responsibility (AOR) en route to United States Northern
       Command (NORTHCOM) AOR.
       2.3.1.3. ARC forces (under Title 10).
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                              11


          2.3.1.3.1. Depart      home         station        for       AFSOC           directed
          contingencies/deployments/exercises (under Title 10).
          2.3.1.3.2. Depart a TSOC/JSOAC AOR en route to NORTHCOM AOR.
          2.3.1.3.3. Other specified missions as tasked via the SOF ATO (SOFAPPS).
   2.3.2. 23 AF/CC directive authority terminates when forces arrive home station or enter a
   TSOC/JSOAC AOR. 623 AOC will continue to track, monitor, and support all AFSOC
   forces.
2.4. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions and AWL taskings, the
AFSOC Command Center monitors all AFSOC aircraft to, from, or between off-station
locations. The Command Center tracks off-station aircraft via the Air Mobility Command
(AMC) C2 system and direct reporting from aircrew and command post personnel. Key
components of the AMC C2 system are the Airlift Implementation and Monitoring System
(AIMS), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and the various AMC C2 facilities at
theater and wing locations. Information on scheduled activity comes from the wings which input
AIMS data for all upcoming missions except local missions not scheduled to land outside the
local flying area or close-hold missions that cannot be accommodated by classified AIMS setups.
When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the C2 agency with OPCON
obtains additional information from situation reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status Reports
(DSR). The following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not
close-hold in nature and have not been chopped to another C2 agency:
   2.4.1. Wing (or equivalent) Command Posts track wing level movements of their aircraft and
   directly input mission information into GDSS. Above wing level movements are tracked by
   the 623 AOC.
   2.4.2. Data on CONUS movements of theater-based aircraft are collected by the AFSOC
   Command Center via GDSS updates. These are based on information received from AMC
   Command Posts and direct reporting from aircrews who take off or land at non-AMC
   locations.
   2.4.3. Information on OCONUS movements of AFSOC aircraft (CONUS or theater-based)
   comes to the AFSOC Command Center via GDSS or telephone notification from the
   overseas host group command posts. The host unit command posts receive their data from
   the aircrews directly or via the Special Operations Command and Control Squadron or
   Element.
   2.4.4. Aircraft commander or mission commander flight reporting duties:
       2.4.4.1. Unclassified missions at bases with an AMC C2 Facility. Mission commanders
       will ensure that the following information is relayed to the AMC C2 facility at least 30
       minutes prior to landing: call signs, mission numbers, Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA),
       maintenance status, and additional service requirements. After landing, the mission
       commander will contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements and departure
       information. In addition, CONUS based crews operating within the CONUS must keep
       their home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times,
       projected takeoff times, and other related information.
 12                                                  AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


       2.4.4.2. Unclassified missions at bases without an AMC C2 Facility. Mission
       commanders will report, as soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times,
       maintenance status, projected takeoff times, and other pertinent data to the host wing
       command post, special operations control center, or AFSOC Command Center. Methods
       of communicating this information include fax, DSN, and commercial telephone.
       CONUS based crews operating within the CONUS must also ensure that their home
       station command posts receive real-time reports on aircraft movements.
       2.4.4.3. AIMS Missions.        When operating on classified missions, the mission
       commander will pass movement reports to the appropriate C2 facility. If necessary, the
       mission commander can call on an unclassified line and report. For example, ―Loaded
       and ready to go at ―location‖ estimated time of departure (ETD) is 1400Z.‖
       2.4.4.4. Close-hold or Sensitive Missions. These missions may operate without AIMS
       setups.

2.5. Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT). SARSAT is an international
satellite system for Search and Rescue (SAR). This system provides distress alert and location
information to appropriate rescue authorities anywhere in the world for users in distress. The
SARSAT satellites detect beacons broadcasting on 406.025 Megahertz (MHz). SARSAT
coverage on 406 MHz is worldwide.
2.6. Designation of a COMAFSOF. The Commander, USSOCOM, or TSOC Commander may
designate a COMAFSOF. This should be done in writing, and the designation letter will include
the individual by name, and the geographic area of authority. In the absence of a designated
COMAFSOF, AFSOC/A3 may grant COMAFSOF waiver authority to an individual in writing.
Update the designation letter to reflect personnel changes due to prolonged deployments.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   13


2.7. Aircraft Commander Responsibility and Authority. A PIC is designated for all flights
on the MAJCOM-approved flight authorization. In addition to AFI 11-203V3, PICs are:
   2.7.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.7.2. Responsible for the welfare of their crew and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.7.3. The final authority for accepting a waiver affecting the crew, mission, or aircraft.
   2.7.4. Charged with keeping the applicable commander informed of mission progress and
   difficulties.
   2.7.5. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a mission
   commander.
2.8. Mission Commander. A Mission Commander will be designated when more than one
aircraft or crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercise, or other operations.
The Mission Commander will be rated, and should be a field grade officer. The Mission
Commander may be a primary crew member for exercises when the unit commander so
designates. Mission Commander duties include, but are not limited to:
   2.8.1. Briefing crews on local operating procedures.
   2.8.2. Coordinating with ATC, Combat Control Teams (CCT), Special Tactics Teams (STS),
   range control, users, and other agencies that may have an impact on the mission.
   2.8.3. Ensuring that Drop Zones (DZ), Forward Area Refueling (FARP) sites, or Landing
   Zones (LZ) have current surveys (when necessary).
   2.8.4. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, eating, and transportation
   arrangements.
   2.8.5. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.
   2.8.6. Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements.
2.9. Air Mission Commander (AMC). The individual responsible for the overall employment
of air assets. Designated by the mission approving official; mission complexity dictates. The
AMC should not be a primary crew member but should have access to crew communications
(ICS).
   2.9.1. Deputy Mission Commander (DMC). Required on all missions employing a
   dedicated AMC. The DMC assumes command if conditions prevent the AMC from
   controlling the mission. The DMC may be a primary crew member, and is usually the
   Formation Commander. The DMC will not be on the same aircraft as the AMC.
2.10. Flight Lead. A qualified flight lead will be designated for flights in support of
multilateral operations with ground forces and is responsible for proper mission execution and
other immediate action events during a formation flight. Flight lead is responsible for delegating
duties as necessary to accomplish the mission. The flight lead will normally perform duties from
the formation lead position.
   2.10.1. The designated flight lead will be the pilot ultimately accountable for mission
   accomplishment. Hence, the flight lead will be the sole crew member responsible for
   interaction and coordination with outside agencies. All crew member brief/debrief inputs,
 14                                                   AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


   requests for information, and after action submissions will be channeled through individual
   Aircraft Commanders for relay to the flight lead.
   2.10.2. Formation commander. Any Aircraft Commander may be designated to act as
   formation commander for any formation that does not fall under the provisions of paragraph
   2.11.
2.11. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either
by the commander with directive authority or the aircraft commander when, in the opinion of
either, conditions are not safe to start or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe
conduct of the mission rests with aircraft commander. If the aircraft commander refuses a
mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or improved so that the
mission can operate safely. Another aircraft commander and aircrew will not be designated to
take the same mission under the same conditions for purposes of circumventing this restriction.
   2.11.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the directive authority, except
   in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather conditions or facilities. In
   the event of an emergency or weather-related divert or reroute, the Mission Commander or
   aircraft commander must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
       2.11.1.1. The controlling agency directing the diversion or rerouting is responsible for
       ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew.
       2.11.1.2. The aircraft commander will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or
       aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
       2.11.1.3. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will
       ensure the aircraft commander is provided existing and forecasted weather for the
       alternate.
2.12. Civilian Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the extent practicable. Refer to AFPD 10-8,
Homeland Defense and Civil Support for USAF responsibilities for assistance to civil authorities.

                      CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Each person assigned as a primary crew member must be qualified
or in training for qualification in that crew position and mission.
   3.1.1. Basic proficiency crew members may perform primary crew duties on any non-
   mission sortie and on mission sorties (including unilateral training, joint training, and
   exercises) when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations under the supervision
   of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position.
   3.1.2. Mission capable crew members may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral
   training mission. For other missions, the unit commander must determine the readiness of
   each mission capable crew member to perform primary duties.
   3.1.3. Noncurrent (NC) or Unqualified (UNQ) pilots may perform crew duties only on
   designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor or
   flight examiner pilot. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless exempt by AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management.
       3.1.3.1. An IP will be in a pilot’s seat:
          3.1.3.1.1. When an individual who is not fully qualified in the specific type aircraft,
          mission, and/or maneuvers being flown occupies a pilot seat.
          3.1.3.1.2. When required by applicable operational instructions or at the discretion of
          the instructor pilot.
   3.1.4. NC or UNQ flight engineers may perform duties in their primary crew position on any
   mission when under the direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their
   respective crew position or IAW AFI 11-2CV-22V1 chapter 4. When a NC or UNQ
   occupies a primary crew position, the crew member and the instructor or flight examiner
   fulfills the requirement for one primary position as specified in Table 3.1
   3.1.5. For the purposes of aircraft/mission familiarization, the Group Commander, or
   COMAFSOF may authorize unqualified personnel to perform duties in non-pilot crew
   positions during flight under direct instructor/flight examiner supervision. For crew
   members, the purpose of this familiarization training is to enhance crew camaraderie and to
   enable the individual to gain a better understanding of the crew concept and responsibilities.
   This training will only be conducted in permissive environments, and only when mission
   accomplishment is not impacted. Comply with AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
3.2. Crew Complement. The crew complement for operations is specified in the flight manual
and Table 3.1. The Group Commander or COMAFSOF may waive the crew complement
specified in Table 3.1 down to the flight manual minimum crew requirement.
   3.2.1. Additional Crew members (ACM). An ACM is one assigned in addition to the normal
   aircrew complement required for a mission. Air Education Training Command (AETC)
   crews will refer to AFI 11-401, Aviation Management/AETC Supplement 1 for ACM
   guidance.

 Notes:
 1
   Minimum crew is either 1 Pilot and 1 Flight Engineer or 2 Pilots.
 2
   Crew members non-current in mission events may still conduct Functional Check Flights
 (FCFs).
 3
   This mission category includes all basic non-tactical operations to and from
 improved/approved areas (airfields, helipads, etc.) day and night. Qualified crews may use
 night vision goggles (NVGs) as appropriate to improve general flight safety.
 4
   At the discretion of the squadron Sq/CC, crew complement may be 2 pilots and 1 Flight
 Engineer (FE). Crew complement will not be reduced if actual Low Visibility Approaches
 (LVAs) are anticipated.
 5
   Only one FE is required while operating at a location with sufficient ground crew to perform
 hot refueling duties.
 6
   A minimum of two Pilots and one Flight Engineer are required to taxi the aircraft.
3.3. Interfly. Group CC or COMAFSOF is the approval authority for interfly of Air Force crew
members on CV-22 aircraft under their control; otherwise, AFSOC/A3 is the approval authority.
AFSOC/ Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Memorandum of Agreement governs
58th Special Operations Wing (SOW) interfly requirements. AFSOC/Air Combat Command
(ACC) Memorandum of Agreement governs ACC Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) personnel.
     3.3.1. AETC and AFSOC will provide interfly for AFSOC crew members to fly on training
     aircraft and devices and for AETC crew members to fly on AFSOC aircraft and devices. The
     purpose of interfly is to ensure AFSOC aircrews are familiar with current AETC training
     methods, procedures and courseware; to ensure AETC aircrews are familiar with the latest
     AFSOC missions, tactics and needs, for augmentation, continuation training and for other
     purposes mutually agreed upon by the AETC/A3 and the AFSOC/A3.
     3.3.2. Approval authority for aircrew interfly is the requesting and supporting operations
     group commander. OG/CCs may approve basic aircrew interfly and interfly of instructors
     for FTU and upgrade training. Commanders will provide courtesy copy of their request and
     approval to AETC/A3F and A3R through 19 AF/DOR and to AFSOC/A3T. The aircrew,
     and flight authorization will be IAW AFI 11-401.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                17


3.4. Intrafly. Intrafly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members from separate
units under the same MAJCOM to accomplish flying missions. Normally, intrafly should be
used only to relieve qualified manpower shortfalls.
   3.4.1. The Group Commander possessing the aircraft or COMAFSOF is approval authority
   for intrafly between units.
3.5. Scheduling Restrictions. Reference AFI 11-202 Vol. 3, General Flight Rules, and
appropriate MAJCOM supplement for scheduling restrictions.
3.6. Maximum Flight Duty Period (FDP). In addition to AFI 11-202 V3 and AFSOC sup, the
following restrictions apply:
   3.6.1. The basic FDP is 16 hours providing no mission events (including air refueling),
   proficiency training, or Functional Check Flights (FCF) (including maintenance ground runs)
   are accomplished after 12 hours. If the autopilot (coupled modes) is not fully operational for
   the required mission profile, or its use is denied for more than 4 hours, the FDP will be 12
   hours. A fully operational autopilot is defined as a system which is capable of coupling
   course (ENAV or INAV), speed, and altitude. For the purposes of this paragraph, NVG
   terminal operations to a prepared surface are not considered mission events.
   3.6.2. 12 hours for training flights and functional check flights (FCFs) (including
   maintenance ground runs).
   3.6.3. FDP waiver approval authority is the Group CC or COMAFSOF.            NOTE: Use of
   NVGs is authorized throughout the flight duty period.
3.7. Crew Rest. In addition to the restrictions in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, Chapter 9, General
Flight Rules, comply with the following:
   3.7.1. Crew members departing on missions scheduled to recover away from home station
   should be notified 24 hours before reporting for the mission. The first 12 hours are designed
   to allow crew members to resolve personal affairs. During these first 12 hours, a crew
   member may perform limited non-flying duties. The second 12-hour period is inviolate.
   3.7.2. Post-mission crew rest applies to all flying temporary duties (TDY) and begins upon
   the final return of an individual to home station and runs continuously until completed. Post-
   mission crew rest must be completed before starting pre-departure crew rest for a subsequent
   mission. Do not require a crew member to get immunizations, engage in ground training,
   perform standby or squadron duties, or perform any other activity that would violate crew
   rest.
       3.7.2.1. Waiver authority for post-mission crew rest is the Group CC, or COMAFSOF.
       Waiver requests for post-mission crew rest are considered on a case-by-case basis and
       only with the concurrence of the individual crew member.
       3.7.2.2. Compute post-TDY crew rest at the rate of 1 hour off for every 3 hours of TDY
       not to exceed 72 hours.
3.8. Standby Duty. A period of time during which a crew may be required to launch on an
anticipated mission for which a firm departure time cannot be established.
   3.8.1. Aircrew members will be provided a 12-hour inviolate crew rest period preceding the
   start of standby duty.
 18                                                    AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


   3.8.2. Aircrew not dispatched on a mission following standby duty which occurred away
   from home station will receive post-mission crew rest IAW paragraph. 3.7.3
3.9. Alert Duty. Refer to AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and appropriate MAJCOM Supplement.
3.10. Alert Procedures.
   3.10.1. Reference AFI 11-202 Vol. 3, MAJCOM Sup for FDP guidance.
3.10.2. Alert Aircraft. Complete a normal preflight and configuration check. At the discretion
of the Pilot in Command, accomplish system checks (Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), suite of
integrated radio frequency countermeasures (SIRFC), etc.), fly the aircraft and accomplish a
transition to airplane mode as well as an airborne Power Assurance Check prior to shutdown.
After 72 hours on alert, give maintenance access to inspect the aircraft and re-accomplish the
alert acceptance procedure. EXCEPTION: Maintenance is authorized to service fluid levels
and minor maintenance at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
       3.10.2.1. Parking. Park the alert aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite
       taxi and takeoff.
       3.10.2.2. Climatic Protective Facilities. During periods of extreme cold or severe
       weather, every effort should be made to shelter alert aircraft and essential equipment in a
       hangar to ensure operational readiness in the event of a mission.
   3.10.3. Flying Alert Aircraft. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual
   alert missions provided the following conditions are complied with:
       3.10.3.1. Alert requirements can be met with sufficient fuel to meet mission
       requirements.
       3.10.3.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agencies.
       3.10.3.3. A qualified (for the alert mission) crew is on board.
       3.10.3.4. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local
       area.
       3.10.3.5. If maintenance actions are not required, the aircraft can be placed on alert once
       the thru-flight inspections are completed. Limited maintenance actions can be performed
       at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
   3.10.4. Give alert crews a general briefing at the beginning of each alert period. Update the
   briefing every 24 hours to include weather, local Notices to Airman (NOTAMs), latest flight
   crew information file (FCIF) information, special instructions, and any other appropriate
   items.
   3.10.5. A DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, will be prepared for the
   alert aircraft. Canned DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, is
   authorized providing the aircraft configuration for the alert period does not change. Alert
   crews are authorized to prepare a takeoff and landing data (TOLD) card using the worst
   weather conditions expected for the alert period. Use this TOLD for alert scrambles. If the
   alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use TOLD computed for the existing weather
   conditions.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                19


  3.10.6. When an alert crew change occurs and the aircraft remains unchanged, the oncoming
  alert crew will complete an aircraft preflight, and as a minimum, apply power to the aircraft
  and check applicable items listed below.
     3.10.6.1. AFTO IMT 781, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Data Record.
     3.10.6.2. Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment.
     3.10.6.3. Fuel quantity.
     3.10.6.4. Survival and emergency equipment.
     3.10.6.5. Navigation and communication equipment.
     3.10.6.6. Hydraulic reservoirs.
     3.10.6.7. Publications.
  3.10.7. Should an aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, -6 and -1 pre-flights are
  required.
  3.10.8. Once the aircraft is accepted for alert, the aircraft commander will ensure an entry is
  made in the AFTO IMT 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and Maintenance
  Document, stating as a minimum, the local date and time the aircraft dash 1 preflight was
  completed.
  3.10.9. Alert aircraft are off limits to all personnel except alert crew members. No
  maintenance may be performed on the aircraft without the approval of the unit/mission
  commander. Upon receiving orders to launch, the crew is required to check any area in
  which maintenance was performed prior to flight.
  3.10.10. Waiver authority for alert duty period is per AFI 11-202V3. Unless specifically
  mentioned above, all other alert waivers rest with group commander or COMAFSOF.

                                            Chapter 4

                          COMMAND OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for operations with certain degraded equipment.
If the aircraft commander elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems,
coordinate mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance
requirements, etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not
adversely impact follow-on missions.
4.2. Responsibility. The final responsibility regarding required equipment for a mission rests
with the aircraft commander. If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to conduct a mission
or mission segment with a degraded or inoperative item or system, this acceptance does not
commit that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent operations
with the same item or system inoperative. When the aircraft commander considers an item
essential, designate the component mission essential (ME) on the AFTO IMT 781A,
Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to
departure.
   4.2.1. If a land as soon as practical, possible or immediately condition exists while the
   aircraft is on the ground, a takeoff should not be attempted unless conditions warrant (threat,
   remote location, etc).
   4.2.2. The radar altimeter will be operational for night, low-level tactical events (including
   LVA) and night low-level operations over open water.
4.3. Avionics Cooling and Environmental Control System.
   4.3.1. Avionics Cooling. Avionics cooling will be operational prior to departure. However,
   should avionics cooling malfunction after departure, flight may be continued IAW T.O. 1V-
   22(C)B-1.
   4.3.2. Environmental Control System (ECS). If environmental conditions permit, the
   aircraft may be flown without ECS. Crew comfort, type of mission, and length of mission
   should be considered when deciding whether or not to proceed.
4.4. Electrical Systems. If a variable frequency generator (VFG) fails at an en route stop, the
mission may continue to a destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are
authorized. Loss of a single VFG and/or converter with no other system failures will not
adversely impact the electrical system and flight may be continued at the discretion of the
aircraft commander. Caution should be exercised when flying in icing conditions due to lack of
spinner anti-ice and asymmetrical proprotor de-icing.
4.5. Fuel Systems. Degraded operation is permissible; however, flight crews must consider
potentially trapped fuel (center of gravity (CG) limits) and decreased range should further
degradation occur.
   4.5.1. Fuel Pumps. All suction lift pumps and boost pumps will be operational prior to
   departure.
   4.5.2. Operations will not be conducted with any malfunction in the fuel system that affects
   the fuel quantity warning system, except on life or death missions.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 21


4.6. Landing Gear. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only a full stop landing will
be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight. EXCEPTION: If repair
capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that further flight can be
accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where
repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position.
Required en route stops are authorized. Takeoffs and landings should be minimized and made
from a hover.
4.7. Navigation Systems. The aircraft will not be flown with more than one inertial navigation
system (INS) failure as this would remove any redundancy in the aircraft attitude indicating
system and flight control system.
   4.7.1. GPS. Without an operating GPS, (INS only) navigation in all environments is
   severely degraded and requires constant vigilant monitoring and frequent updates to ensure
   the INS solution is within operating limits. Without a functioning GPS, precision events
   such as LVA, night water hoist etc., should not be attempted. When GPS operation is in
   question, an enhanced interrupted alignment should be accomplished.
4.8. Cockpit Displays. If the standby attitude indicator or standby flight instrument (SFI) is
inoperative, the aircraft may only be flown in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
Flight in night VMC is permitted if night vision goggles (NVGs) are used. If any of the standby
pitot-static instruments are inoperative, the aircraft will not be flown. The aircraft will not be
flown with degraded performance or damage to pitot-static probes 1, 2, or 4 as standby
instrumentation will be affected.
   4.8.1. As a minimum, one operating multi-function display (MFD) is required for each
   pilot's position with both DEUs operational. With only one DEU operational, the side
   corresponding to the operating DEU must have both MFDs operational and at least one on
   the non-operational side.

                                             Chapter 5

                                     AIRCRAFT SECURITY

5.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and combating the unlawful
seizure (hijacking) of a CV-22 aircraft. Aircrew will actively resist all attempts to hijack aircraft.
Aircrews will not release information concerning attempts or identify armed aircrew members to
the public.
5.2. Security. CV-22 aircraft are priority C resources when they are not configured for special
missions that require higher security priority. This security priority designation applies to
operational aircraft worldwide. Some aircraft contain equipment and documents which require
protection per DoD 5200.1, DoD Information Security Program/AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management. Requirements for protection of the aircraft in a transient status
at US and foreign bases are found in DoD 5200.1 and AFI 31-401.
5.3. Procedures. Pre-mission planning should ensure that adequate en route security is
available. The amount of protection required will vary, depending on the location and ground
time. The aircraft commander will receive a threat assessment and security capability evaluation
briefing at home station and can receive updates at en route command posts. During scheduled
and unscheduled landings at non-USAF installations, the aircraft commander will assess the
situation and take the following actions, if necessary:
   5.3.1. Area Patrol. Obtain area patrol coverage from local security forces to include backup
   response. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF IMT 15, USAF
   Invoice. If unable to obtain local security forces, direct armed crew members to remain with
   the aircraft to maintain surveillance over aircraft entrances and activities in the vicinity of the
   aircraft. Acquire a means to report suspicious or hostile activity to security forces (e.g., land
   mobile radio).
   5.3.2. Departure which extends FDP or without crew rest. If local security forces are
   unacceptable/unavailable and the crew is not augmented with security forces, the OG/CC or
   COMAFSOF may extend maximum FDP up to 2 hours provided the mission requirements
   justify the risk. If unable to depart the location due to a system malfunction, coordinate
   through home base channels to acquire security support.
5.4. Arming of Crew members. Unit commanders may direct arming of crew members as
deemed necessary by mission threat analysis. During all operations where weapons are on
board, arm a weapon qualified aircrew member. Protect these weapons and others installed IAW
AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel and AFMAN 31-229, USAF
Weapons Handling Manual.
   5.4.1. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels, if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
   5.4.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in holsters. If possible, conceal weapons to
   protect the identity of armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except
   to and from operations, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities (e.g.,
   base operations, passenger terminals, flight line cafeteria, etc.). When an aircraft is located
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  23


   outside the United States in a foreign country, do not carry any weapon off the aircraft unless
   the pertinent Air Force MAJCOM or combatant commander authorized the bearing of
   firearms.
   5.4.3. Weapons Storage In-flight. Arm crew members before beginning preflight or on-load
   duties. When no passengers are aboard, weapons may be stored in a gun box in flight. Re-
   arm before landing. Do not unload weapons when placing them in a gun box.
   5.4.4. Weapons Storage at Deployed Location. During crew rest, store weapons in the most
   secure facility available, normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is
   unavailable or the country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and
   ammunition in the gun box.
   5.4.5. Aircraft Without a Secure Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain
   overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the
   nearest acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US and allied military services
   armories, US Reserve and National Guard armories, and US civil law enforcement armories.
   If none of these are available, or the aircraft commander believes security of weapons may be
   compromised, secure the weapons in quarters, but one armed crew member must remain with
   the weapons.
   5.4.6. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand carried
   baggage aboard the aircraft except combat personnel during operational missions, special
   agents, guards of the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals specifically
   authorized to carry a weapon.
       5.4.6.1. If any of the above personnel need to clear their weapons, direct them to use the
       following procedures:
           5.4.6.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, and
           personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging any weapon.
           5.4.6.1.2. Clear weapons IAW standard safety procedures.
5.5. General Hijacking Guidance. (Ref. IAW AFI 13-207).
5.6. Aircraft Force Protection Risk Assessment Matrix. The aircraft commander may use
Table 5.1 to help assess the risk to parked aircraft unattended by crew when located at overseas
civilian airfields. A cumulative score of less than 55 suggests that normal unmanned aircraft
security measures may be adequate. A score of 55 to 80 suggests that adequate security could be
provided by deployed US ground personnel working 24-hour operations. If the cumulative score
is greater than 80, commanders should consider deploying or using contractor security personnel.
Consideration of Table 5.1 is not intended to preclude consideration of other possible factors or
supplant the discretion of the aircraft commander’s judgment and discretion in meeting his
responsibility to ensure adequate aircraft security measures will be accomplished. During
unscheduled or emergency landings, the aircraft commander should contact the US Embassy or
United States Defense Attaché Office (USDAO) for security assistance.

                                 MISSION PREPARATION

6.1. Flight Planning Systems. The primary flight/mission planning system is the Special
Operations Forces Planning and Rehearsal System (SOFPARS). SOFPARS is a subset of the
Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) that includes the Portable Flight Planning Software
(PFPS) and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The core mission planning software
(PFPS or JMPS) in conjunction with V-22-specific modules and hardware interfaces is known as
the V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS). Upgraded or new versions of SOFPARS and
VMPS will be released and authorized by the AFSOC/A3 for use after applicable testing has
been completed (OPR:       Air Force Special Operations Forces/Air Operations Center
(AFSOF/AOC)). NOTE: Charts are defined as FLIP products, maps are printed from mission
planning.
   6.1.1. Electronic Data Transfer. Aircrews will not use unapproved versions of any system to
   load aircraft avionics without AFSOF/AOC approval. AFSOF/AOC will periodically
   publish a listing of approved systems.
6.2. Coordinates. The following procedures will be used:     NOTE: Aircrew will confirm a
common datum with their supported personnel during the mission planning process. Failure to
plan navigation/landing zones (LZs) using a common datum may result in errors of up to several
miles. Computer-based mission planning systems and aircraft navigation systems generally use
WGS84 as reference datum. Attempt to comply with CJCSI 3900.01C, 30 June 2007 whenever
possible to minimize confusion. WGS84 is the official DoD positional reference system.
   6.2.1. When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from maps, charts, or
   related cartographic products, a complete reference to the source of the coordinates will be
   provided. This reference will include the datum map or chart producer, series, sheet number,
   edition, and date.
   6.2.2. When reporting or receiving positions using coordinates derived from non-
   cartographic sources such as global positioning system (GPS) receivers, Analytical
   Photogrammetric Positioning Systems (APPS), or related systems, a complete reference to
   the source of the coordinates will be provided. This reference will include the datum,
   method used to derive the coordinates, agency producing the coordinates, and accuracy of the
   coordinates.
6.3. Flight Logs. Prepare a MAJCOM approved flight log form for each mission and include
the following as a minimum: turn points, headings, distances, estimated time en route (ETEs),
minimum safe altitudes (MSAs), and fuel computations. A flight log is not required if the above
information is included on the map.
6.4. Mission Kits.
   6.4.1. The following items will be on-board the aircraft for all missions. Publications,
   excluding navigation charts and flight information publication (FLIP) or FLIP equivalent,
   may be in electronic form as long as suitable equipment is on board and easily accessible.
   Local area functional check flights require only an aircraft flight manual on-board.

      6.4.3.16. DoD FLIP Instrument Approach Procedures (two sets for area of operation).
      6.4.3.17. Maps and Charts (including VFR sectional aeronautical charts as required).
6.5. Weather Planning.
   6.5.1. Operations Group Commanders may establish minimum weather criteria (ceiling or
   visibility) less than day minimums for flights during which only hovering maneuvers will be
   performed (e.g., hover checks, OCF, FCF).
   6.5.2. Weather Minimums:
      6.5.2.1. VFR Minimums. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, helicopter weather minimums
      unless local or theater specific-weather minimums are more restrictive. In the absence of
      more restrictive criteria, the following minimum weather criteria (ceiling/visibility) apply
      during all VFR operations:
          6.5.2.1.1. Day/NVG
              6.5.2.1.1.1. 0-60 KGS: 1SM and clear of clouds.
              6.5.2.1.1.2. 61-140 KGS: 500/2SM.
              6.5.2.1.1.3. 141 KGS-VNE: 1,000/3SM.
          6.5.2.1.2. Night (Unaided): 1,500/3SM
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                27


       6.5.2.2. IFR Minimums. Use category A approach minimums and comply with AFI 11-
       202V3, helicopter weather minimums and procedures unless local or theater specific-
       weather minimums are more restrictive. Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) TF
       flight may be accomplished on published IFR Military Training Routes (IR) or other
       approved, surveyed training routes.
6.6. Wind Limits.
   6.6.1. Comply with limitations in T.O. 1V-22(C)B-1.
6.7. Illumination and NVG Requirements. WARNING: Lack of sufficient illumination may
prevent NVG contour operations in otherwise VMC conditions.          WARNING: NVGs worn in
black hole conditions can lead to induced motion illusions and spatial disorientation.
   6.7.1. NVG low-level operations require sufficient illumination to safely identify terrain and
   hazards commensurate with aircraft speed and altitude.
   6.7.2. The decision on whether sufficient illumination exists to complete the mission rests
   with the aircraft commander.
   6.7.3. Any training or operational low-level flight, as defined by paragraph 7.1, planned
   when the effective illumination (regardless of methodology or measurement) is forecast to be
   less than 10 percent, incur greater risk; during these periods of low illumination, these
   missions require:
       6.7.3.1. An additional level of Operational Risk Management (ORM).
       6.7.3.2. For training flights: an operational TF radar, or an operational FLIR, and
       moving map with DTED loaded are required.
          6.7.3.2.1. For operational flights: flight may be conducted with all systems listed in
          6.7.3.2 degraded or inoperative, if, on a case-by-case basis, it can be determined that
          the increased mission risk is still commensurate with mission benefit.
       6.7.3.3. Crossing MSL altitudes based upon lowest altimeter setting will be calculated
       and annotated for climbs greater than 500’.
6.8. Adverse Weather Planning. Flight in the vicinity of thunderstorms will be conducted
IAW AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate MAJCOM supplement’s fixed wing procedures.
   6.8.1. Planned flight in the vicinity of thunderstorms requires an operable WX radar.
6.9. Fuel Planning. The following fuel planning figures are intended to meet the requirements
of AFI 11-202V3.
   6.9.1. For all flights VFR or IFR, plan to land at destination in accordance with AFI 11-
   202V3, or 1,500 pounds, whichever is greater.
   6.9.2. For flight planning purposes, fuel requirements for descent, approach, and missed-
   approach will be no less than 1,200 pounds.
   6.9.3. Aircraft Commanders will declare "Minimum Fuel" when fuel calculations indicate a
   landing at the intended destination below 1,500 lbs. "Emergency Fuel" will be declared
   when fuel calculations indicate a landing at the intended destination below 1,200 lbs.
 28                                                    AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


6.10. En Route Planning. Crews should fly tactical missions at the highest altitude
commensurate with the threat environment.        WARNING: Failure to maintain an accurate
altimeter setting during flight may cause lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with
terrain when using the computed emergency safe altitude (ESA)/MSA.
   6.10.1. Emergency Safe Altitude. ESA is an altitude that will provide positive terrain
   clearance in IMC during situations that require the exiting of the low-level environment. To
   compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the highest obstacle or
   terrain feature within 10 NM of route centerline or intended flight path, rounded to the next
   100-foot increment. Use of area ESAs is recommended whenever possible; however, a
   single ESA is sufficient when there are no significant changes in topography.
   6.10.2. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA provides terrain clearance and limited threat
   avoidance during situations that require the interruption of low-level operations. To compute
   MSA for each leg or leg segment, add 500 feet (or the planned set clearance for TF
   operations) to the elevation of the highest terrain or obstacle within 3 NM of route centerline
   or the planned flight path, and round up to the next 100-foot increment.
       6.10.2.1. To compute MSA during aerial refueling, add 1,000 feet to the elevation of the
       highest terrain or obstacle within 5 NM of route centerline or the planned flight path, and
       round up to the next 100-foot increment.
   6.10.3. Minimum En-route Altitudes and Visibility. During training operations, higher
   weather or altitude minimums may be dictated by FLIP, international civil aviation
   organization (ICAO) procedures, or training considerations.       NOTE: Mountainous areas
   are defined as having a 500 foot change in surface altitude over ½ NM.
6.11. Aeronautical Chart Preparation.
   6.11.1. Map Selection. Maps with a scale of 1:500,000 or greater detail are required for low-
   level operations. Maps with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater are highly desired. AFSOCH 11-
   222 (will convert to AFTTP 3-3 Volume 10), CV-22 Combat Aircraft Fundamentals contains
   specific map symbology and route requirements.
   6.11.2. Pilots will carry a properly prepared map on all flights and ensure all maps used for
   flight have the most current hazards posted. Pilots will not rely solely on the digital map for
   navigation when digital map hazard information does not match printed maps. A properly
   chummed map for avoidance of all man-made obstacles will be in the aircraft for all tactical
   flights. Aircrew will also ensure appropriate civil airspace is annotated along their route of
   flight.
   6.11.3. IAW AFI 11-202V3, the following required items will be available throughout the
   flight: appropriate FLIP en route supplement, en route charts, Flight Information Handbook,
   appropriate arrival, approach, and departure procedures.
6.12. Pre-mission Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Use the applicable briefing guides in AFI 11-2CV-22V3 CL-1 for briefings. The
   aircraft commander will ensure their crews receive a briefing prior to each mission, covering
   all specific areas to be accomplished. Units may convert AFI 11-2CV-22V3 CL-1 briefing
   items to electronic briefing formats if desired or as defined in unit Standard Operating
   Procedures (SOP).
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  29


   6.12.2. If critical pre-mission duties conflict with the briefing, the aircraft commander may
   excuse crew members. Prior to engine start the aircraft commander will give a mission brief
   to any excused crew members detailing all areas pertinent to their duties.
   6.12.3. The aircraft commander will brief, if known, the following factors anytime a landing
   in a remote landing zone is anticipated:
      6.12.3.1. Weather. Determine recent weather and its effect on the landing area. Wind
      will be evaluated by the aircrew for its effect.
      6.12.3.2. TOLD. Compute and brief applicable TOLD and power requirements for the
      landing zone (LZ).
      6.12.3.3. Approach and Departure. Brief the planned approach and departure routes as
      well as significant terrain features. The aircraft commander will determine and brief the
      type of approach to be used. Departure power considerations will be covered as well.
      6.12.3.4. Surface Conditions. Brief expected surface slope and features and conditions
      (tall grass, plowed field, sand, etc.). Conditions conducive to low visibility approaches
      must be briefed.
      6.12.3.5. Abort Routes. Determine null areas and escape routes. Brief abort
      considerations including the point at which the aircraft is committed to landing (if
      applicable) and formation procedures.
      6.12.3.6. Personnel and Vehicles. Known personnel and equipment locations will be
      briefed. If vehicles or personnel are operating in the landing area, attempt to determine
      their effect on the LZ.
      6.12.3.7. Other Hazards. Brief any other special considerations such as the hazards
      created by downwash during landing and takeoff.
   6.12.4. Passenger Briefings.
      6.12.4.1. Prior to each flight, the aircraft commander will ensure that all passengers are
      briefed. When more than one flight is accomplished by the same crew and passengers,
      subsequent briefings are not required, except to brief route information, mission changes,
      etc. When additional passengers are added, brief them completely.
      6.12.4.2. In addition to the minimum briefing items contained in AFI 11-202V3, the
      briefing will include demonstration of seat belt and egress systems. All overwater flights
      will include a briefing on personal and aircraft life support equipment; i.e., life preserver
      use and life rafts.
6.13. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). In addition to requirements listed in AFI 11-
202V2, the following applies:
   6.13.1. Review FCIF Part B before departure on all missions and comply with MAJCOM
   directives. Aircraft Commanders will ensure all crew members have read and signed off all
   FCIF/FCIS, operations notes, or mission specific read files. This does not relieve individuals
   from ensuring that required sign-offs are completed.
   6.13.2. If electronic FCIF record is not used, i.e., PEX, then update FCIF Currency Record
   (or MAJCOM equivalent form) and squadron read file manually, if new material has been
 30                                                      AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


   added to the FCIF since the last review. Legibly enter the last FCIF item number, the current
   date, and initial the FCIF Currency Record. Initialing the FCIF Currency Record certifies
   review of all items.
   6.13.3. The aircraft commander will ensure any crew members joining a mission en route
   receive an FCIF update. Instructor pilots who fly with senior officers are responsible for
   briefing FCIF items.
   6.13.4. Crew members not assigned or attached to that unit will certify FCIF review by
   entering the last FCIF number and their initials behind their name on the file copy of the
   flight authorization or their additional crew member (ACM) orders.
6.14. Flight Plans. MAJCOM approved forms are authorized for use in lieu of DD Form 175,
Military Flight Plan, or DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan for local area flights that
end at either the base of departure or at an installation under the operational control of the base of
departure.
   6.14.1. Annotate aircraft type on all flight plans as V22.
6.15. International Procedures. The aircraft commander will review the USAF Foreign
Clearance Guide and brief crew members on applicable items before flights outside the CONUS.
Comply with customs, immigration, agriculture, immunization, and quarantine requirements.
The unit dispatching the mission is responsible for border clearance and other special clearances
when required. Entry into foreign countries by personnel and equipment is directed by military
agreements, diplomatic agreements, and directives of the operational control commander, ICAO
standards, and the Foreign Clearance Guide.
   6.15.1. For all OCONUS or operational missions use appropriate call sign assigned via
   USAF Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL). Tactical call signs assigned via the applicable Joint
   Communications Electronics Operating Instruction (JCEOI) will be utilized when
   communicating with mission agencies. Tactical call signs will be used on all tactical nets,
   regardless of that net’s security.
6.16. Transoceanic/Remote area Procedures. The following procedures will be used during
ocean transits and in areas where divert locations are not immediately available.
   6.16.1. Equal Time Points. An equal time point (ETP) is the point beyond which an aircraft
   in an emergency situation necessitating a divert would continue to the destination rather than
   return to the departure point. An ETP will be calculated for all flights in which flight time is
   greater than 2 hours between suitable landing areas using forecast winds. ETPs will be
   updated every hour until reached using observed and forecast winds during flight.
   6.16.2. Remote or Island Destinations. Remote or island destinations are defined as intended
   landing areas that do not have suitable alternate destinations within 30 minutes of flight time
   at 10,000 ft MSL or en route altitude (whichever is lower) and max range airspeed.
       6.16.2.1. If holding in lieu of an alternate for a remote or island destination per AFI 11-
       202V3 AFSOC Sup, use an additional 1,500 lbs (APLN mode) as the holding fuel in
       addition to all other fuel reserve/minimum fuel requirements.

above ground level (AGL) in airplane (APLN) mode and 500 feet AGL in conversion (CONV)
mode (≥ 60 nacelle). Low-level operations are inherently dangerous and therefore require
specific planning and ORM measures to ensure safety of flight is maintained throughout the
mission. This section outlines the requirements that must be met in order to fly low-level
missions.
   7.1.1. Geographical areas, such as range complexes, may be designated as exercise or low-
   level navigation areas.
       7.1.1.1. Surveys. Prior to any low-level operations in non-surveyed areas, accomplish a
       survey of the route or area as follows:
       7.1.1.2. Conduct an extensive map study of the selected routes and areas. Annotate all
       man-made obstacles over 50 feet AGL (or the lowest altitude to be flown), except when
       below the tree line. Additionally, annotate any published low-level routes, avoid areas or
       other hazards within the boundaries. Use the Chart Updating Manual (CHUM) or host
       nation procedures to ensure current obstacles are depicted on maps.
       7.1.1.3. A highly experienced pilot selected by the unit commander or mission
       commander will fly the route survey during the day. The pilot will conduct a visual
       search of the proposed route or area at the lowest applicable altitude down to a minimum
       altitude of 50 feet AGL in CONV mode or 100 feet AGL in APLN mode IAW 7.20.2.
       Check the obstacle location against map location and any additional obstacles charted.
       7.1.1.4. Flight surveys are not required provided the area is within a designated training
       complex and the host provides suitable information.
       7.1.1.5. Route or area surveys conducted by other participating aircraft may be used
       provided the survey information is available and flight operations are conducted no lower
       than the survey altitude.
       7.1.1.6. If a route or area has been inactive or flight operations have not been conducted
       at survey minimums for 12 months, re-accomplish the survey or restrict operations to or
       above the lowest level flown during the 12-month period.
7.2. Master Low-level Hazards Map. Each unit must have a master low-level hazards map (or
suitable digital substitute) depicting hazards to low-flying aircraft for the local area and areas of
frequent operation. Plot them on a suitable chart and display them in the crew briefing area or
maintain the master hazards files on all unit computer-aided mission planning systems. Make
changes as received and bring them to the attention of all crew members. Review the chart/files
monthly. Update master maps monthly using the chart-updating manual (CHUM) supplement
(or host nation equivalent) or applicable digital updates. Annotate the date of the update on the
master map (if used). When uncharted obstacles are found, record appropriate information
(location, approximate height AGL, and mean sea level (MSL)). The aircraft commander will
ensure this information is incorporated in the squadron planning area immediately.

7.3. Landing Zones/Helicopter Landing Zone Survey Requirements. Refer to AFI 13-
217/MAJCOM supplements including applicable waivers, and AFSOCH 11-222 (3-3.CV-22B)
for requirements and procedures.
7.4. Life Support Requirements. Upon reporting to the aircraft, the aircraft commander or
designated representative will ensure sufficient quantities of appropriate serviceable life support,
survival equipment, and protective clothing for the entire mission are aboard the aircraft. Verify
AFTO IMT 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment (reflects actual equipment on board),
prior to departing home station. Life support equipment and medical kits below 200 lbs may be
secured with seat belts.
   7.4.1. Aircrew members will wear life preservers and underwater breathing devices on over-
   water flights when route of flight is beyond gliding distance of the shore. Passengers will
   have life preservers available and will be worn at the discretion of the Pilot in Command.
   Life rafts will be available to cover all personnel on board. Life rafts, life preservers, and
   helicopter emergency egress device (HEED)/Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device (HABD)
   are not required when overwater flight occurs within glide distance of land, takeoff,
   approach, and before landing.
   7.4.2. Survival vests will be onboard the aircraft and available to the crew for all flights and
   may be worn at the discretion of the aircraft commander. Individuals will wear properly
   equipped survival vests on all combat and contingency missions.
   7.4.3. Crew members occupying a primary crew position will have an oxygen
   mask/regulator connected and readily available for use before engine start through engine
   shutdown. Prior to flight, crew members will accomplish a preflight of their helmet and
   oxygen mask, to include communications check. Upon completion of helmet and oxygen
   mask preflight, cabin crew members may disconnect from aircraft oxygen system, but
   oxygen mask/regulator must remain readily available.
   7.4.4. CV-22 crews will use rotary wing requirements for overwater flight when altitude will
   be below 500 ft AWL at any time. In all other cases, fixed wing requirements will be used.
   See AFI 11-301, MAJCOM Sup 1, for further guidance.
   7.4.5. Anti-exposure suits are worn IAW AFI 11-301 V1 and applicable MAJCOM
   supplements.
   7.4.6. Helmets must be worn during all tactical training, combat and contingency sorties. At
   the discretion of the PIC, crew members may wear headsets in lieu of helmets on all other
   sorties. If headsets are worn, helmets, oxygen masks and regulators properly attached to the
   aircraft oxygen system, must be within arm’s reach of cockpit crew members and attached
   and readily accessible to cabin crew members.
7.5. Flying Clothing/Safety Equipment.
   7.5.1. All crew members will wear the aircrew uniform and other flying clothing/equipment
   in accordance with AFI 11-301V1, Life Support Program, and AFI 36-2903, MAJCOM Sup
   1, unless forbidden by Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) or host nation rules.
   7.5.2. Eye Protection.
       7.5.2.1. Use protective goggles, plastic/shatter resistant lens glasses/sunglasses, or the
       helmet visor for eye protection if duties require personnel to be in close proximity of the
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  33


       aircraft when the proprotors are turning. Wear goggles whenever dust, sand, dirt, etc.,
       constitute a hazard.
       7.5.2.2. During all live firing of weapons from the aircraft, ensure that all personnel
       involved in the firing of weapons wear eye protection to include one of the following:
       helmet visors, shatter resistant glasses/eye protection, safety goggles, or aircrew gas
       mask. Glass lens eyeglasses alone do not satisfy the requirement.
7.6. Weight and Balance. If the basic weight/moment of the aircraft is changed, a new DD
Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport, will be computed. A new or
corrected DD Form 365-4 need not be recomputed provided the initial takeoff gross weight (item
16) is not changed by more than 500 lbs. If the change is more than 500 lbs, the crew will
modify the weight and balance using the cockpit management system (CMS). The crew will
ensure CG and weight limits are not exceeded. These computations will be briefed during the
crew brief or during flight if required.
7.7. AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   7.7.1. Review the AFTO IMT 781 before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft
   systems.
   7.7.2. Ensure that the USAF fuel card and/or other authorized method of payment are aboard
   the aircraft.
   7.7.3. The exceptional release must be signed before flight. An approved individual
   (maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian) will normally sign
   the exceptional release. If one of these individuals is not available, the aircraft commander
   will sign the exceptional release. See T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
   Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures for additional guidance.
7.8. Preflight Inspections.
   7.8.1. Preflight inspection should normally be accomplished by the flight engineer(s) for the
   assigned mission; however, pilots may perform or participate in the preflight.
   7.8.2. Face-to-face turnovers between crew members are acceptable during a ―hot turn‖ or
   when the sortie is not debriefed to maintenance.
   7.8.3. During higher headquarters-directed exercises and contingency operations, any
   qualified aircrew may accomplish the preflight inspection and brief the oncoming crew.
7.9. Tool Kits. (This program will be instituted when units have received appropriate training).
   7.9.1. Flight engineers will ensure a tool kit is on board for all flights.
   7.9.2. Individual units will establish requirements for tools to be included in the kits.
       7.9.2.1. Tool kits will be sealed and have an inventory list for accountability.
       7.9.2.2. If the tool kit seal is broken, the aircraft commander or designated representative
       will inventory the kit, sign the inventory, and re-seal the tool kit.
7.10. Checklist.
   7.10.1. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline using the challenge and response
   method as required.
 34                                                     AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


   7.10.2. Notes amplifying checklist procedures and limitations may be added by the crew
   member. Currency of notes is the crew member's responsibility.
7.11. Flight Briefings and Procedures. The following briefings and procedures are the
responsibility of the aircraft commander and must be completed in addition to other briefing
requirements.
   7.11.1. Departure. Before initial takeoff, brief the crew on the procedures to be followed
   during takeoff and departure, performance data and intentions in case of an emergency.
   7.11.2. In flight. Conduct in-flight briefings, as necessary, to cover any unusual
   circumstances and when flight safety or other conditions require the nonstandard
   accomplishment of any maneuver.
   7.11.3. Approach and Landing. Before starting each approach, the pilot flying the aircraft
   will brief the procedures to be followed during approach, landing, and go-around/missed
   approach intentions. Performance data will be reviewed. This briefing may be accomplished
   in conjunction with the Before Landing Checklist.
7.12. Controls. A qualified pilot will be at a set of flight controls with harness fastened at all
times when proprotors are turning.
7.13. Crew Duties and Responsibilities.
   7.13.1. Change of Aircraft Control. Use a statement which includes the crew position such
   as, ―Pilot/Copilot has controls‖ to transfer control. The other aircrew member will
   acknowledge using the crew position also such as, ―Pilot/Copilot has controls.‖ Any crew
   member who is in doubt as to which pilot is controlling the aircraft should immediately query
   the pilots.
   7.13.2. Boldface. The aircraft commander normally calls for boldface procedure execution.
   The pilot not flying is the primary crew member responsible for executing BOLDFACE and
   other emergency checklist procedures that involve cockpit switches while the pilot flying
   maintains aircraft control and reacts appropriately. The flight engineer, if in the cockpit, will
   confirm any switches prior to being actuated and will reference the checklist for guidance
   during the emergency. The second flight engineer, if on board, should review the flight
   manual and Portable Electronic Display Device (PEDD) as appropriate.
7.14. Communications Policy.
   7.14.1. Interphone Communications.
       7.14.1.1. Limit intraplane transmissions to those essential for crew coordination.
       7.14.1.2. Do not discuss classified information over intercommunications system (ICS)
       during radio transmissions.
       7.14.1.3. Non-aircrew members may monitor interphone or radio transmissions only
       when specifically approved by the aircraft commander. The aircraft commander will
       brief communications policy to these personnel prior to flight. The aircraft commander
       must ensure no one monitors classified information for which they are not cleared or
       transmits classified information over the radios.
       7.14.1.4. Clearance is required from the aircraft commander prior to going off ICS.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     35


   7.14.2. Command Radios.
       7.14.2.1. The pilot operating command radios will brief the crew on which radio is
       primary. All crew members will monitor the primary command radio unless specifically
       directed to do otherwise by the aircraft commander.
       7.14.2.2. Regardless of the primary command radio, monitor Ultrahigh Frequency (UHF)
       GUARD (243.0).
       7.14.2.3. Record and read back all ATC clearances except when ATC instructions
       require immediate execution and read back would interfere with the timely performance
       of aircrew duties.
7.15. Aircraft Lighting. Operate aircraft lighting IAW AFI 11-202V3, MAJCOM
supplements, and the following, except where operational mission requirements dictate
otherwise.
   7.15.1. Anti-collision lights. All anti-collision lights will be operational for day or night
   operations.
       7.15.1.1. When flying in formation, only the trail aircraft is required to have a visible
       anti-collision light on.
       7.15.1.2. In the event of failure of any light or all lights of the anti-collision light system
       after takeoff, flight may be continued.
   7.15.2. An operable IR spotlight should be available for NVG operations.
7.16. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria. All aircrews will abide by taxi distances
and restrictions per AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and will not
taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers unless exempted or waived.
   7.16.1. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker. If wing walkers are unavailable
   or if provided and doubt still exists as to proper clearance, deplane a crew member to ensure
   obstruction clearance.
7.17. Taxiway and Runway Width Requirements. Minimum taxiway width is 20’; minimum
runway width for rolling takeoff, STO, or run on landing is 30’. Minimum width for 180 degree
turn is 35’.
7.18. Arresting Cables. Taxiing over arresting cables should be done at the slowest speed
possible to preclude damage to the bottom of the aircraft.
7.19. Proprotor Turning Off-load and Onload Procedures. Employ the following
procedures when engines are running: WARNING: Personnel will have weapons pointed down
and radio antennas collapsed prior to approaching the aircraft. Do not approach the aircraft until
cleared by the crew. NOTE: Place one engine control lever (ECL) in START, when practical,
to reduce the proprotor downwash whenever personnel are present near the aircraft.
   7.19.1. Personnel and equipment should approach to and depart between the 4 and 8 o’clock
   position during engine running ground operations. When using the crew door, approach to
   and depart from the nose of the aircraft as much as possible to stay in the pilot’s field of view
   until clear of the aircraft. Avoid the regions directly outboard of the nacelles (3 and 9
   o’clock) due to the engine exhaust deflected by the coanda system.

7.20. Altitude Restrictions.
   7.20.1. Conduct all APLN mode operations at or above 500 feet AGL and CONV/VTOL
   mode operations above 300 feet AGL, except when lower altitudes are required for takeoff,
   landing, operational missions, training flights in approved surveyed areas or routes, approved
   exercise missions, or while conducting a route survey under day VMC.
   7.20.2. Conduct low-level sorties in mountainous terrain no lower than 300 ft modified
   contour or 200 ft set clearance plane (SCP) in airplane mode, 100 ft in CONV mode. In non-
   mountainous flat to rolling terrain or overwater where there is a valid mission requirement,
   crews may descend to no lower than 100 feet AGL in APLN and 50 ft in CONV. Limit the
   time at minimum altitudes to the duration required for mission accomplishment. NOTE:
   Mountainous terrain is defined as having a 500 foot change in surface elevation over ½ NM.
   7.20.3. Unaided (no NVG and no TF system). Minimum en route altitude for night
   navigation, both operationally and for training, is 500 feet above the highest obstacle within 3
   NM (MSA).
   7.20.4. Aided. NVGs and/or TF systems are the only approved methods for conducting
   night operations below 500 feet AGL. Comply with the following restrictions:
       7.20.4.1. Time spent at the minimum altitude should be the minimum required to defeat
       the threat or complete tactical proficiency training or night water operations.
7.21. Oxygen Requirements.
   7.21.1. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, for unpressurized aircraft.
   7.21.2. Aircrew must attend altitude chamber training that fulfills the requirements specified
   in AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program.
7.22. IFF/SIF. Aircraft will not depart with an inoperative IFF/SIF (if required for the mission
or airspace) without the approval of ATC and the aircraft commander. Exception: Formations
must have at least one operational IFF/SIF per element.
   7.22.1. IFF modes 1, 2, 3A, and S codes are not classified and may be left set in the
   transponder. IFF Mode 4 codes must be zeroized before leaving the aircraft in an unsecured
   location. Use the IFF/SIF in accordance with Table 7.1.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  37

    4     Keyed and On when required
   7.22.2. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV prior to departure if the
   aircraft will transit an area where safe passage procedures are implemented or when required
   for mission accomplishment.
        7.22.2.1. If Mode IV fails in-flight, crews may continue to their intended destination if
        use is no longer required. If use is required, the aircraft will land and repairs will be
        accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance personnel
        are available.
        7.22.2.2. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode IV, when conducted, are a mandatory
        maintenance debrief item. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation
        of the Mode IV on AFTO Form 781A.
7.23. Traffic Collision Avoidance System TCAS Operations. TCAS use is required when
installed and operational. Operate the TCAS IAW flight clearance directives and appropriate
technical orders. NOTE: This system was not designed for use in the low-level environment,
but provides valuable awareness of other aircraft. Use the above/below/normal settings as
appropriate for the phase of flight.
7.24. Electronic Devices. The use of electronic devices is specified in AFI 11-202V3. For
electronic devices not listed, the user will provide the aircrew a letter from the Aeronautical
Systems Division, Deputy for Engineering (ASC/ENAE), 2530 Loop Road West, Wright
Patterson AFB (WPAFB) OH 45433-7101, DSN 785-8928 or (937) 785-8928 certifying the
device is approved for airborne use. If the aircrew detects any interference from an electronic
device used aboard the aircraft, discontinue the use of this device for the duration of the flight.
7.25. Jamming and Interference. All aircrews and other radio users must be familiar with the
procedures for reporting incidents of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference (MIJI) or
Spectrum Interference (SI). Info AFSOC/A3TW on all MIJI/SI reports.
7.26. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   7.26.1. Conduct hot refueling IAW AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP)
   Operations, T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding,
   and appropriate flight manuals. The guidance in this section supplements the procedures
 38                                                    AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


   outlined in T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding,
   appropriate flight manuals, and checklist. A comprehensive mission briefing and strict
   compliance with procedures will ensure an expeditious safe refueling operation.
   7.26.2. Rearming may be conducted in conjunction with hot refueling.
   7.26.3. Use the following guidance for aircraft marshaling during forward arming and
   refueling point (FARP) operations:
       7.26.3.1. Hose deployment personnel will not be used to marshal aircraft. When
       CCT/Special Tactics Squadron (STS) are responsible for primary ATC of an airfield, or
       are responsible for ATC operations at the FARP site, they will marshal and control all
       aircraft movement into and out of the FARP site. If CCT/STS are not available, units are
       responsible for self-marshaling into and out of the FARP site.
       7.26.3.2. Land just prior to the FARP site and deplane a crew member to marshal the
       aircraft to the designated refueling point when able.
       7.26.3.3. If terrain features do not allow for landing just prior to the FARP site, aircraft
       will hover taxi to the designated refueling point. Be aware of proprotor downwash
       effects on personnel and equipment in the area.
       7.26.3.4. The aircraft commander will ensure marshaling procedures outlined in the
       above paragraphs are briefed between the tanker and receiver aircraft prior to aircraft-to-
       aircraft refueling operations. These procedures must be strictly adhered to at all times,
       ensuring all safety requirements are met.
   7.26.4. Transmissions on other than line of sight (LOS) and SATCOM radios are prohibited.
   7.26.5. Aircrews will not wear Gortex garments within 50 feet of the aircraft when refueling
   with low flashpoint fuels i.e., JP-4, Jet B, AVGAS etc. Refer to T.O. 00-20-172 for further
   information.
   7.26.6. In the absence of qualified maintenance personnel, aircrew may service aircraft
   hydraulic and oil systems IAW the PEDD.
   7.26.7. Personnel not directly involved in refueling operations will remain clear outside the
   Fuel Servicing Safety Zone.
7.27. Forced or Precautionary Landings. If the crew becomes doubtful of the aircraft’s
airworthiness or encounters hazardous weather conditions preventing further flight, they should
execute a precautionary landing, provided the landing conditions are not more hazardous than the
in-flight situation.    Aircraft security and accessibility for maintenance are secondary
considerations to aircrew safety. Report all precautionary landings through the appropriate chain
of command as soon as communications are established.
   7.27.1. When the forced or precautionary landing occurs at an Air Force base and the cause
   has been investigated, corrected, and inspected by qualified maintenance personnel and the
   aircraft commander has determined that no significant operating hazards exist at the
   departure base or en route, the aircraft commander may continue flight.
       7.27.1.1. The operational squadron commander’s approval is required prior to further
       flight where qualified USAF maintenance is not available. At the squadron commander’s
       discretion, this approval authority may be delegated to the aircraft commander.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     39


      7.27.1.2. In the event a forced or precautionary landing occurs at a location where
      communications are not available, the following procedures apply:
          7.27.1.2.1. Remain at the landing site and await assistance if the aircraft commander
          determines the aircraft is not safe for flight.
          7.27.1.2.2. If a greater hazard exists to the crew or aircraft at the landing site, then
          continue to the nearest safe landing area. The decision to resume flight under these
          circumstances should be based on a thorough evaluation of all the hazards and risks
          involved.
   7.27.2. Precautionary Landings Due to Weather.
      7.27.2.1. If deteriorating weather is encountered during VFR operations, consider
      reversing course, continuing under an IFR clearance or as a last resort executing a
      precautionary landing.
      7.27.2.2. Further flight may be authorized by the aircraft commander after a
      precautionary landing for weather. Make a reasonable effort to notify appropriate
      agencies of the precautionary landing and to determine additional weather information.
7.28. En route Navigation and Instrument Approach Minimums.
   7.28.1. The aircraft navigation system is cleared for RNAV PTP (point to point) in CONUS
   (RNP 4) and BRNAV procedures in European airspace (RNP 5). In order to fly RNAV PTP
   outside the NAVAID navigation criteria listed in FLIP, the GPS update function must be
   operational and confirmation that the INSs are accepting the GPS update. Flying or filing
   RNAV or GPS approaches, RNAV SIDS or RNAV STARS is not approved. Additionally,
   PTP navigation is not allowed to any point after the IAF on instrument approaches.
      7.28.1.1. Filing /I for the suffix of the TD code on the DD Form 175 in item 3 provides
      maximum flexibility in the ATC structure. When filing the DD Form 1801, in item 10,
      Equipment – in addition to identifying all available and serviceable communication,
      navigation, approach aid and surveillance equipment, inserting the character ―Z‖ is
      equivalent to /I on the DD Form 175. In item 18, Other Information – insert ―RMK/PTP‖
      and ―NAV/RNVE99‖.
      7.28.1.2. Without an operating GPS or GPS update function, ―/I‖ may still be filed IAW
      GP; however, INS only navigation in all environments is severely degraded and requires
      constant vigilant monitoring and frequent updates to ensure the INS solution is within
      operating limits. An EIA should be accomplished in this situation and ENAV procedures
      should be the primary method of navigation.
   7.28.2. With a GPS Monitor Fault posted, the GPS lateral limit associated with the current
   mode of flight has been exceeded and therefore RNAV procedures will revert to the ENAV
   capabilities of the aircraft (VOR/DME, TACAN). Refer to T.O. 1V-22(C)B-1 for
   information on procedures. When NAVAIDs are not used as the primary method of RNAV,
   crews must monitor satellite and GPS status while operating under RNAV and BRNAV
   procedures. NOTE: As the aircraft is not equipped with a database, extreme vigilance must
   be taken when entering in coordinates for a point that is not within NAVAID reception. It is
   also possible to be cleared to a point not filed as part of the flight plan. In this case if unable

   to locate the point, request clarification, request a different routing, or request a heading until
   you are able to locate the point.
   7.28.3. Ceiling Below Minimums. If the reported ceiling is below the minimum for the
   approach, but the visibility value is at or above the authorized minimums before initiating an
   en route descent and approach, ensure fuel remaining is sufficient to accomplish the en route
   descent and approach, missed approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate reserves.
7.29. Radar Altimeter Procedures.
   7.29.1. During low-level operations, set the radar altimeter to no lower than 80 percent of
   intended low-level altitude.
   7.29.2. For instrument approaches, set the radar altimeter low altitude warning to the
   appropriate height above touchdown (HAT) or height above aerodrome (HAA) prior to the
   final approach fix (FAF).
7.30. Radar Advisories. Participate to the maximum extent possible while operating in VFR or
simulated IFR conditions.
7.31. Advisory Calls. The nonflying pilot will make advisory calls to the flying pilot as
follows:
   7.31.1. Descent:
       7.31.1.1. Transition level.
       7.31.1.2. One thousand feet above assigned altitude.
       7.31.1.3. One thousand feet above initial approach fix or holding altitude.
   7.31.2. Non-precision Approaches:
       7.31.2.1. One hundred feet above procedure turn and final approach fix altitude.
       7.31.2.2. One hundred feet above minimum descent altitude (MDA).
       7.31.2.3. "Minimums" at MDA.
       7.31.2.4. "Runway in sight." Called when sufficient visual reference with the runway
       environment is established and the aircraft is in a safe position to land.
       7.31.2.5. "Go around." Called at the missed approach point when visual reference with
       the runway environment is insufficient to continue the approach or any time the approach
       becomes unsafe.
   7.31.3. Precision Approaches:
       7.31.3.1. One hundred feet above decision height (DH).
       7.31.3.2. "Continue." Call at DH if only the approach light system is in sight and a
       determination cannot yet be made that the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing. If an
       approach is continued below DH based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach
       to visibility minimums), "go-around" must be called by 100 feet if a determination to
       land cannot be made.
       7.31.3.3. "Land." Call at DH or later if runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is
       in a position for a normal landing.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 41


       7.31.3.4. "Go around." Call at DH or later if the runway environment is not in sight or if
       the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing. If an approach is continued below DH
       based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach to visibility minimums), "go-
       around" must be called by 100 feet if a determination to land cannot be made.
   7.31.4. Climb out:
       7.31.4.1. Transition altitude.
       7.31.4.2. One thousand feet below assigned altitude.
   7.31.5. Any crew member observing unannounced heading deviations greater than 10
   degrees, airspeed deviations of 10 knots, altitude deviations of 100 feet during approach or
   200 feet while en route, or potential terrain or obstruction problems will immediately advise
   the pilot flying. Also, announce deviations from briefed procedures for the approach being
   flown.
7.32. Power Checks.
   7.32.1. Aircrew will reconfirm power requirements using either the cockpit management
   system (CMS) or performance charts when power required is within ten (10) percent of
   power available.
       7.32.1.1. Takeoff and landing will be executed utilizing interim power at the pilot’s
       discretion. For tactical approaches and departures at remote sites and HLZs, crews will
       select the Nr setting (normal or interim power) that affords the greatest power margin.
7.33. Passenger Policy. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria for
passenger movement on DoD aircraft. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 35-101,
Public Affairs Policies and Procedure, provide further guidance on orientation and public affairs
travel. Refer to these publications directly. When available, passengers will be manifested on a
DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest. If the DD Form 2131 is not available, annotate the
passengers by any means and leave with a responsible person at the point of departure.
   7.33.1. In addition to the restrictions in AFI 11-410, during spouse orientation flights, air
   refueling and threat reaction maneuvers are prohibited.
   7.33.2. For other orientation categories, passengers will be seated with belts fastened during
   threat maneuvers.
   7.33.3. Space-required. DoD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers who are
   authorized official travel on Department of Defense (DoD) aircraft. Group CC or
   COMAFSOF determine and approve eligibility for all space required categories with the
   following exceptions:
       7.33.3.1. Supported forces (Mission forces). A sub-category of space required passenger
       defined by this AFI as US and foreign military personnel who are an integral part of the
       mission being performed, functioning with the aircrew to execute this mission. This may
       include, but is not limited to, mission specialists and special operations forces. Approval
       is assumed by the mission tasking. Manifest on DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest,
       according to mission.
           7.33.3.1.1. Restrictions. There are no restrictions on mission events. Passengers will
           be restrained by the safest means possible within mission constraints. Reference

          paragraph 7.35., Personnel Restraints, and Fig 7.2., Passenger Classification/Restraint
          Policy. The aircraft commander will ensure that supported forces are briefed on the
          mission profile and mission events before flight.
       7.33.3.2. Supporting forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this
       AFI as US and foreign military, DoD civilians, and US civilian employees under contract
       to the DoD, who directly support the mission or a deployment of an AFSOC unit. This
       may include, but is not limited to; maintenance, communications, intelligence, logistics,
       fuels, flight test personnel, unit-supporting chaplains and public affairs personnel, civilian
       contractors required for in-flight checks or deployment support, FAA representatives,
       STS, fire support officers, and other military personnel who are on board to
       communicate/coordinate with ground forces. Off-station travel requires travel orders.
       Local flights will be documented by letter of authorization from the Group CC or
       COMAFSOF. (EXCEPTION: Squadron Commanders/Mission Commanders may
       approve squadron assigned personnel. Squadron/Mission Commanders may also approve
       maintenance personnel required for mission accomplishment). Planners and Mission
       Commanders should coordinate supporting forces authorizations with the OG/CC prior to
       exercises whenever possible. 18 FLTS/CC is the approval authority for supporting forces
       in conjunction with test missions. When frequent local flights are necessary,
       commanders may issue annual authorizations by name or Automatic Flight Control
       System (AFSC). When using this option, the aircraft commander will ensure that all
       restrictions in the following paragraph are complied with for each individual mission.
       Manifest all supporting forces on DD Form 2131.
          7.33.3.2.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI
          11-401, paragraph 1.12 (Requirements for Pilots in Dual-Controlled Aircraft).
          Simulated emergencies are prohibited. EXCEPTION: Degraded systems required
          for the purposes of a functional check flight are authorized. In this context, personnel
          on board are required for mission accomplishment. Limit personnel to absolute
          minimum required). Other mission events are authorized. Passengers will be seated
          with belts fastened during threat maneuvers. The aircraft commander will ensure that
          supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile and mission events before flight.
7.34. Passengers Occupying Crew Positions.
   7.34.1. The aircraft commander may authorize passengers to sit in the center seat.
   7.34.2. AFI 11-401 governs approval for passengers to occupy a crew position with a set of
   flight controls.
   7.34.3. Any passenger occupying a crew position must be on ICS.
7.35. Personnel Restraints. (See Table 7.2).
   7.35.1. Aircrew. All personnel must be restrained by the safest means possible for the type
   mission being flown. Seats will be available for all passengers not covered in paragraph.
   7.34.2; passengers will be seated with seatbelts fastened for takeoff and landing and will not
   be unrestrained when any door is opened in-flight. Additional crew members will also be
   seated as stated above or restrained with a restraint harness (i.e., gunner’s belt) during takeoff
   and landing or operating near an open door. At least one pilot will have seat belt and
   shoulder harness fastened when engines are running. Crew members may perform duties that
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 43


  require them to be unrestrained for short periods of time, provided they are not in close
  proximity to an open door.
     7.35.1.1. The preferred method of unsecured personnel movement in the cargo
     compartment for all phases of flight is with the ramp closed. If the ramp must be open
     for mission requirements, i.e., ramp weapon employment, terminal area operations, all
     passengers and crew members not required to be unsecured for the mission event (i.e.,
     AIE) will remain restrained by either a seat belt, personal restraint device, or properly
     adjusted gunner's belt to prohibit inadvertent departure from the aircraft at all times with
     the ramp open.
  7.35.2. Combat equipped troops. When carrying troops/teams and seats/seat belts are not
  installed/used due to mission or aircraft load, alternate restraints will be used by those
  personnel. These restraints may not protect occupants in a crash sequence as well as a seat
  belt, but must be of such design to keep occupants from falling out of open doors. Each
  individual will have a restraint to secure him to the aircraft.
  7.35.3. Alternate loading methods used should allow seats and equipment not required for
  the mission to be removed. Define the cabin floor itself as the seat and either a seat belt,
  snap link device, tie-down strap, or similar restraining device to restrain all occupants. Brief
  all users on the type of restraining device installed. NOTE: Additional aircrew may be
  secured with alternate restraints.
     7.35.3.1. Alternate restraints will be IAW USSOCOM Manual 350-6. When early
     release is authorized IAW USSOCOM Manual 350-6, restraints will not be removed until
     as late as practical prior to the landing/assault (no earlier than the 1-minute call).
     7.35.3.2. Accomplish troop security by one of the following methods in descending
     order of preference:
         7.35.3.2.1. Seatbelts or snap links attached to tie-down rings on the cabin floor.
         7.35.3.2.2. Static Line Kit.
         7.35.3.2.3. Five thousand (5,000) pound tie-down straps.
         7.35.3.2.4. Woven nylon rope attached to the wall rings with carabineers.
  7.35.4. Except for primary and additional aircrew and special operations forces (SOF) team
  members, all cabin occupants must be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, initial
  takeoff, and initial approach and landing. Passengers authorized flight on tactical missions
  may be secured by alternate methods for subsequent takeoffs and landings provided they do
  not interfere with primary crew members’ duties.

7.36. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections.
   7.36.1. Obtain customs, agriculture, and public health clearance, as required, prior to
   opening any doors other than the crew door or enplaning and deplaning personnel.
   7.36.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to customs, immigration, or agricultural inspection
   for processing at those stations where federal or local inspections are required. The flight
   engineer or the aircraft commander completes the necessary forms before reporting to
   inspectors.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   45


  7.36.3. After clearing with border clearance agencies, the pilot or flight engineer will return
  to the aircraft for off-loading and other post-flight procedures.
  7.36.4. A US military aircraft is a sovereign instrument. When cleared to overfly or land in
  foreign territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges
  and immunities which customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities
  include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
  immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections);
  or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or
  cargo on board. USAF aircraft commanders will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or
  similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction
  of USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
  7.36.5. The aircraft commander will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of
  any foreign government. If requested to do so, the aircraft commander and crew will deny
  access and seek aid from the senior AFSOC representative or US Embassy or consulate
  within the host nation. Inform customs or other officials of the above policy and request that
  they confirm their request through their own government and with US Department of State
  representatives. If necessary, the aircrew will seal the aircraft and enter into crew rest, and
  relay departure intentions, until resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Use
  communications by the fastest means available to inform command and control facilities
  should this situation occur.
  7.36.6. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
  consider the following procedures:
     7.36.6.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of the aircraft
     commander to the foreign officials that the aircraft is a sovereign instrument not subject
     to search without consent of USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned.
     This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities
     that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
     7.36.6.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the aircraft commander
     must negotiate to delay the search until contact is made with USAF (through MAJCOM
     C2) or the appropriate embassy. The aircraft commander should unequivocally state, the
     aircrew has no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the foreign
     request to these agencies for decision. The aircraft commander should then notify these
     agencies of the foreign request by the most expeditious means available. Thereafter, the
     aircraft commander should follow instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and
     USAF.
     7.36.6.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the aircraft
     commander should indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided
     fuel and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do
     so.
     7.36.6.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way
     on board an aircraft, the aircraft commander should state that he protests the course of
     action being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF and the appropriate
     American Embassy of the foreign action. The aircraft commander should then allow the
 46                                                     AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


       foreign agents on board the aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the
       incident to USAF and appropriate embassy as soon as possible.
   7.36.7. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or
   equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the
   foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.
7.37. Utilization of Civilian Law Enforcement or Medical Personnel. Generally, before
transporting civilian law enforcement officials or civilian medical personnel, obtain proper
authorization through installation commander, MAJCOM, or United States Special Operations
Command (USSOCOM). Civilian law enforcement or medical personnel may be required to
perform duties at an accident site. These duties may include death determination or human
remains removal. Local and international laws may affect mission prosecution and should be
reviewed prior to deployment or pickup of civilian personnel. The primary method of deploying
or recovering civilian law enforcement or medical personnel is by landing. Civilian law
enforcement or medical personnel may be deployed and recovered by hoist provided all other
transport resources have been examined and determined to be inadequate and approval is
obtained from the Group CC or COMAFSOF. Prior to hoist deployment, brief civilian law
enforcement or medical personnel on all applicable procedures and safety and emergency
considerations involved. If unable to contact the controlling agency for approval, the aircraft
commander may approve the carrying of civilian personnel on life or death missions when it is
determined that these passengers are essential for the successful completion of the mission.
Commanders will not transport civilian law enforcement personnel into areas of imminent
danger or where confrontation with civilian criminal targets is likely, and will not direct the
action of civilian authorities in enforcing the law or making arrests.
7.38. Crew Debriefing.
   7.38.1. Training Missions. The aircraft commander will conduct the debriefing and
   complete the appropriate documentation.
   7.38.2. Operations Under Combat Conditions. Each aircrew participating in operations
   under actual combat conditions will participate in an intelligence debriefing.
   7.38.3. Commanders will ensure that all aircrews are debriefed immediately following a
   combat or combat support mission during which any tactics or procedures were observed that
   may affect other operations.
   7.38.4. The aircraft commander encountering hostile fire will submit an immediate airborne
   report to their controlling agency followed by a hostile fire incident report to intelligence
   immediately after landing.
   7.38.5. Other Missions. The aircraft commander has the responsibility of affording to each
   crew member the opportunity to discuss unusual aspects of the mission. Debriefings may be
   formal or informal, as the situation requires.
7.39. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term ―hazardous material‖ includes any material,
which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life or property.
Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.1, 1.2,
or 1.3 explosives, Department of Transportation (DOT) Class A and B poisons, etiological or
biological research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                47


Also included are DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.4 explosives, oxidizers, compressed gases,
flammable solids and liquids, and corrosive liquids listed in AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing
Hazardous Material for Military Air Shipment.
   7.39.1. Hazmat Briefing. Reference AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Material for
   Military Air Shipment.
   7.39.2. Cargo Documentation.        Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes
   transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper’s
   Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
   7.39.3. Flight Planning. The aircraft commander (unless specifically briefed otherwise):
      7.39.3.1. Enters ―Hazardous Cargo‖ and the mission number in the appropriate section of
      the flight plan. Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, information
      section of DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, or ICAO Flight Plan Form.
      7.39.3.2. Plans the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or otherwise critical
      areas.
      7.39.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message
      should include the following:
          7.39.3.3.1. DOT class and DoD hazard class or division, if applicable, of hazardous
          material on board (Include net weight of DOT Class A or B poisons and net explosive
          weight of Class A or B explosives).
          7.39.3.3.2. Request for special support (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical
          escort teams, etc.).
          7.39.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
      7.39.3.4. If ETE is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude timely receipt at
      destination, notify base operations at the first intended landing, by priority telephone.
   7.39.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency
   parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify that the fire-fighting agency has
   the hazardous materials information. If not, request the following be relayed to the fire-
   fighting agency:
      7.39.4.1. DOT class of hazardous material on board and the DoD hazard class or division
      for explosive material on board.
      7.39.4.2. Net Explosive Weight.
      7.39.4.3. Request for isolated parking (if necessary).
      7.39.4.4. Estimated time of departure.
   7.39.5. En Route. Normal procedures apply. Avoid flying over metropolitan or otherwise
   critical areas.
   7.39.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the
   theater commander or FLIP planning:
 48                                                     AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


      7.39.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or
      other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before
      estimated time of arrival (ETA) to announce that hazardous materials are on board and to
      verify that the appropriate base support agencies have received the departure message. If
      not, transmit the mission number, ETA, and information.
      7.39.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the previous
      information to the nearest FAA flight service station.
      7.39.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil
      airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support activities.
   7.39.7. Parking:
      7.39.7.1. DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
      explosives, DoT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked
      in areas isolated from personnel. PICs are responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly
      identified to the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated
      area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control. When identification is
      acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host
      procedures be questionable, submit trip reports, as appropriate, to document such
      occurrences.
      7.39.7.2. The military host is responsible for ensuring aircraft are properly placarded.
      For non-military installations, the briefing to the aircraft commander will include placard
      requirements and, if required, placards will be furnished at the on load base. The shipper
      must make prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous
      materials requiring placards. The shipper is responsible for cargo identification, fire-
      fighting procedures, and isolated parking requirements.
   7.39.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to in-flight emergency (IFE).             Transmit unclassified
   information to the appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
      7.39.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
      7.39.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
      7.39.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
      7.39.8.4. Fuel on board.
      7.39.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable
      information.
      7.39.8.6. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the AFSOC Command Center or theater
      command and control center (CCC) by telephone, high frequency (HF) radio, or message,
      giving arrival notice, hazardous materials information, and other pertinent information as
      required.
7.40. Hazardous Medical Equipment:
   7.40.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use AFSOC air
   evacuation services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment
   are of major concern:
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                            49


     7.40.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference (EMI)
     which is commonly beyond the limits specified by MIL STD 461A and 462, and
     therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
     7.40.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
     A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
     regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
  7.40.2. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
     7.40.2.1. Pararescue personnel must inform the aircraft commander when nonstandard
     electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
     7.40.2.2. The aircraft commander must be informed of the anticipated period of use of
     the equipment during the mission.
     7.40.2.3. The aircraft commander must be alert for any interference with aircraft
     communications or navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
     7.40.2.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
     the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
     additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
     navigational equipment.
  7.40.3. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
     7.40.3.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
     manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
     and lateral axes.
     7.40.3.2. Pararescue personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment
     to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.

   plane. Shipboard operations to marked spot cleared for V-22 may be conducted with less
   clearance.
   8.6.2. The aircraft commander has the ultimate responsibility for obstacle clearance and
   ensuring that all crew members are thoroughly briefed and aware of their duties and
   responsibilities involving obstacle clearance.
8.7. Live-Hoist Training. WARNING: Personnel trained in hoist operations will assist a
survivor who is not familiar with rescue hoist procedures.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  51


   8.7.1. Restrict live-hoist training to the minimum necessary to accomplish initial
   qualification, re-qualification, and proficiency training. Do not conduct live hoist training
   with the hoist operator’s intercom inoperative.
   8.7.2. Hover altitude will be the minimum required to accomplish the mission. When over
   water or over vessels, hover at the minimum altitude necessary to avoid salt spray. Hoist
   training over trees should be conducted at sites adjacent to suitable emergency landing areas.
   8.7.3. Hoist operations with or without a tag line is permissible for all devices except
   SKEDKO litters. SKEDKO litters require the use of tag lines to ensure safety during hoist
   operations. SKEDKO litters are to be used over land only.
   8.7.4. Squadron CC determines eligibility of personnel to ride the hoist during training.
   Personnel may ride the hoist IAW the following:
       8.7.4.1. Aircrew/Qualified Supported Forces. No safety observer is required.
       8.7.4.2. Other Personnel. There will be a qualified safety observer on the ground
       available to ensure the survivor properly uses the rescue device.
8.8. Air Combat Maneuver Training.
   8.8.1. Initiate evasive maneuvers in APLN mode no lower than 200 feet Above Highest
   Obstacle (AHO) and maintain a minimum of 200 feet AHO throughout the evasive
   maneuvering. The minimum altitude for evasive maneuvering in CONV mode (≥ 60 nacelle)
   is 100 feet AHO.
   8.8.2. Pilots will make advisory calls to the crew prior to beginning the evasive maneuver.
   Crew members will clear the aircraft of obstacles throughout the maneuvering.
8.9. Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Training Policy. All ECM software is operational
software. For training, ECM software can only be used in the CONUS, and only after the signal
collection risk is evaluated. Evaluate the signal collection risk through coordination with
squadron intelligence personnel. Crew members will provide geographical coordinates of the
intended operating area, the time period of concern, and the frequency range of ECM operations.
After analyzing the signal collection risk, operational ECM software may be used during
scheduled airborne intercept training and against ground and sea-based threats. Use of
operational software against Multiple Threat Emitter System (MUTES) is prohibited at all times.
Accomplishing system built in test (BIT) in accordance with aircraft checklist with operational
software is approved. In all other training situations within the CONUS and in all training
situations overseas only use ECM software versions specifically designated for training.
8.10. Flare and Chaff Policy.
   8.10.1. Dispense flares IAW controlling agency procedures and restrictions. When over
   water, dispense flares at least 3 NM from any surface vessel, platform, or landmass.
   8.10.2. If a hung flare is detected, follow appropriate local procedures. If no local procedures
   are developed use the following:
       8.10.2.1. Upon next landing and prior to entering a congested area, deplane a crew
       member to visually inspect dispensers to ensure that there are no hung flares. If a hung
       flare is observed, contact appropriate agency, (tower, ground, command post etc.) and
       follow their instructions.
 52                                                     AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


8.11. Simulated Instrument Flight. The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting
device is not authorized for any phase of flight.
8.12. Instructor Pilot Requirement. An IP will be in a pilot’s seat when an individual who is
not qualified in the aircraft, mission, and/or maneuvers being flown occupies a pilot seat; at other
times required by applicable operational instructions or at the discretion of the instructor pilot.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                53


                                          Chapter 9

                                 MISSION EMPLOYMENT

9.1. Formation Flying.
   9.1.1. Spacing.
      9.1.1.1. During formation flight, minimum spacing is in accordance with flight manual
      restrictions. Base rotor disk separation on the largest rotor span/rotor disk diameter when
      engaged in dissimilar formation operations. Establish complete lateral separation (no
      overlap) prior to any conversion or transition in close formation.
      9.1.1.2. Maintain a minimum of 100 feet spacing during ground taxi.
   9.1.2. Dissimilar Formation. Formation flights are authorized when participating crew
   members are briefed and thoroughly familiar with the other aircraft’s performance and
   tactics.
   9.1.3. Communication.
      9.1.3.1. Prior to formation flight, conduct a communications check of all aircraft in the
      formation.
      9.1.3.2. Do not initiate formation flight without positive interplane radio
      communications. EXCEPTION: communications out procedures. Whenever possible,
      dedicate one of the four primary radios to an interplane communications frequency.
   9.1.4. TF/TA Operations During Combat or Contingency. TF/TA procedures during combat
   or contingency operations are allowed when weather minimums are less than stated in
   6.5.2.1. with COMASFOF or equivalent approval.
9.2. Terminal Operations.
   9.2.1. Takeoff Procedures: Compute performance data prior to departure if personnel,
   equipment, or fuel have been onloaded or if environmental conditions have changed in the
   landing zone.
   9.2.2. For the first approach into any unprepared landing zone, both pilots will display hover
   symbology automatically on the MFD prior to commencing a descent into the LZ.
   9.2.3. If any degradation in on-board systems is discovered which could result in loss of
   situational awareness during approach/hover, the aircraft commander will inform the crew.
   The decision to proceed rests with the aircraft commander.
   9.2.4. When LVA conditions are expected, both pilots will have hover symbols set to
   automatically engage prior to commencing final approach into the LZ. At least one pilot will
   have the hover page on the inboard MFD.
   9.2.5. Go-Around Calls. If any crew member calls ―go-around‖ and the aircraft is able to
   safely transition to forward flight, the pilot flying shall immediately apply power and set
   nacelles as required to establish a climb that clears all obstacles.
9.3. Alternate Insertion/Extraction. See AFSOCH 11-222, for additional information.
WARNING: The aft VTOL cg limit on the aircraft’s flight envelope can be exceeded by as
 54                                                      AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


much as ten inches if proper care is not exerted during deployments/recovery operations from the
ramp. In high winds, this aft CG condition can approach the absolute control limit of the aircraft.
It is extremely important to ensure that the troops deplane in the proper order, and that troops
remain in/near their seats until it is time for them to exit the aircraft. The aft-most troops must be
the first to exit the aircraft. Only those troops and the scanner may proceed to the rear of the
aircraft. Following the release of the first fast rope stick, the next aft most troops may proceed to
the ramp. Team members will ensure 24-27 inch spacing between each member due to CG
limits. Only three personnel at a time are allowed past the ramp hinge due to CG limits.
   9.3.1. A cutting device will be readily available to cut ropes or alternate insertion extraction
   (AIE) devices in case of emergencies or rope entanglement.
   9.3.2. Equipment that is certified as ―training use only‖ will not be used for live personnel.
   9.3.3. Aircrew will ensure all operations off the ramp will not exceed aircraft CG limits.
   9.3.4. Mission Briefing. Prior to deployment or pickup, the aircraft commander will ensure
   the appropriate briefing for the planned alternate insertion and extraction operations is
   completed. Aircrew and team briefings will emphasize proper hand signals, time calls, and
   emergency procedures.
   9.3.5. The crew member at the deploying station will ensure the departing team members
   have removed any potential restraints (ICS connections, personnel restraints, etc.) prior to
   deploying.
   9.3.6. Hoist.
       9.3.6.1. Inspect the entire length of the hoist cable any time a live-hoist is anticipated.
       9.3.6.2. Ground the hoist to discharge static electricity to prevent personnel on the
       ground or water from sustaining a shock. Do not ground the hoist near spilled fuel.
       9.3.6.3. The hoist operator will wear a heavy, work-type glove or equivalent on the hand
       used to guide the hoist cable and have eye protection in place.
       9.3.6.4. Complete the hoist operator’s checklist prior to final approach.
       9.3.6.5. If the survivor is attached to a parachute, hover at an adequate distance to
       prevent the rotor wash from billowing the parachute and dragging the survivor.
       9.3.6.6. Hoist Equipment.
           9.3.6.6.1. Forest Penetrator.
               9.3.6.6.1.1. Do not use the hoist to relay messages except when all other possible
               means of communications (i.e., radio, message streamer, tag line) have been
               exhausted.
               9.3.6.6.1.2. All crew members must be vigilant for shock loads to the cable. If
               shock loading is observed, cease live hoist operations. Inspect hoist, and if
               necessary, replace the cable prior to the next mission.
               9.3.6.6.1.3. While conducting live hoist operations during training, if the cable
               contacts the aircraft, operations will cease until a visual check of the cable is
               complete and no defects are noted. During contingencies the decision to continue
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  55


            operations rests with the hoist operator and the pilot in command. NOTE:
            During water operations, the dynamic action of waves increases the potential for
            shock loading. Additionally, the increased drag of the stokes litter/personnel in
            the water increases the total force applied to the cable.
            9.3.6.6.1.4. The description and maintenance instructions for the forest penetrator
            are contained in T.O. 14S6-3-1, Forest Penetration, Rescue Seat Assembly, PN
            K26-1000-5,-9 (Kaman) and T.O. 00-25-245, Operations Instructions Testing and
            Inspection Procedures for Personnel Safety and Rescue Equipment, Section IV.
            9.3.6.6.1.5. The forest penetrator can be used to recover unresponsive or injured
            personnel safely with the exception of those with back injuries.
            9.3.6.6.1.6. It is possible to recover three people at once with the penetrator.
            However, this should only be done when time is critical since it may exceed the
            hoist load limit of 600 lbs.
        9.3.6.6.2. Stokes Litter.
            9.3.6.6.2.1. The description and maintenance instructions for the stokes litter are
            contained in T.O. 00-75-5. The stokes litter is designed to hold a survivor
            immobile in a horizontal position. The sides of the litter protect the survivor from
            bumping against obstructions or the side of the aircraft during retrieval.
            Configure the stokes litter with the sling, flotation devices, three restraining belts,
            and tag line when stowed on the aircraft.
        9.3.6.6.3. Horse Collar (Rescue Strop).
            9.3.6.6.3.1. The horse collar can be used for single occupant recoveries from land
            or water. The horse collar can only be used to recover ambulatory personnel.
        9.3.6.6.4. Tag Line.
            9.3.6.6.4.1. Tag Line. The tag line reduces the time spent in a hover and prevents
            pendulum or spinning motion during hoisting. It should be used to guide the
            recovery device to or from confined areas, such as ship rigging, trees, etc. It may
            also be used to pass messages or transfer small items to or from the aircraft.
        9.3.6.6.5. Rescue Net.
            9.3.6.6.5.1. The rescue net is constructed of a stainless steel tube frame and 5/16-
            inch polypropylene netting. The net weighs approximately 20 pounds. A sea
            anchor drogue is provided to position and stabilize the net and allow for flight
            path corrections. The sea anchor drogue may be replaced by a 10-foot line with a
            3- to 5-pound bag of shot for stability. The rescue net is particularly useful for
            recovery of personnel not familiar with the forest penetrator and/or rescue strop.
            Because entry is easier and more rapid for a survivor than a forest penetrator, it is
            perhaps the best device for recovery of survivors from frigid waters. The
            disadvantage is the size of the device.
     9.3.6.7. During training missions, terminate live hoisting immediately at the first
     indication of equipment malfunction. If possible, return the individual to the surface as
     soon as possible by lowering the device or reducing hover height. For actual search and
56                                                    AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


     rescue (SAR) missions, existing circumstances must dictate actions to be taken. The
     hoist operator will advise the pilot, check hoist power sources and hoist controls.
     9.3.6.8. During a water hoist pickup it may be advantageous to extend the cable and
     displace the aircraft such that the survivor is not in an area of extreme downwash while
     preparing to be lifted. Once the survivor is ready for hoisting, establish the hover over
     the rescue device and lift the survivor(s) straight up out of the water.
     9.3.6.9. Unconscious Survivor Recovery. If it is determined that the victim is
     unresponsive or unable to employ the rescue device, lower someone trained in hoist
     operations to aid the injured or unresponsive survivor. The deployed crew member will
     secure the survivor for hoisting and give a ―thumbs up‖ visual signal to indicate that the
     survivor is ready for pickup.
  9.3.7. Rappelling. WARNING: The crew member at the deploying station will ensure that
  the ropes reach the ground prior to final positioning of rappellers for deployment. The crew
  member at the deploying station will coordinate with the pilot to ensure the aircraft maintains
  a hover altitude that will keep the ropes in contact with the ground. WARNING: When an
  unsafe condition is encountered, stop any additional team members deploying from the
  aircraft. Make no attempt to physically stop a person in the act of deploying as this may
  cause the person to lose grip of the rope and increase the probability of injury to the team
  member.
     9.3.7.1. Maximum rappelling altitude for training is 100 feet.
     9.3.7.2. Do not deploy ropes until the aircraft is in a stable hover over the intended
     deployment area.
  9.3.8. Fast Rope. WARNING: The aircraft commander is responsible for ensuring that all
  crew members are aware of the length of the ropes. Failure to do so may result in serious
  injury to deploying personnel or damage to the aircraft. IAW USSOCOM Manual 350-6, at
  least 30’ of rope will be on the ground prior to deploying personnel. WARNING: When
  using ropes with heavy attachment hardware (such as a metal sleeve and ring), ensure all
  personnel are clear below the aircraft before releasing the rope.  WARNING: Fast rope
  must be coiled toe to head.
     9.3.8.1. The aircrew will install ropes and inspect attaching points.
     9.3.8.2. Configure handrails down the sides of the cabin as described in T.O. 1V-
     22(C)B-9, Cargo Handling Manual V-22 Tiltrotor.
     9.3.8.3. Water Fast Rope Operations. Deploy the fast rope upon entering the insertion
     zone. A 2-4 knot forward drift will assist in deployment of teams and prevent them from
     landing on each other and possible injuries. Once personnel are deployed, slowly climb
     and accelerate to allow recovery of the rope prior to high speed flight (if not released).
  9.3.9. Special Patrol Insertion and Extraction (SPIE) Operations.
     9.3.9.1. During SPIE operations do not exceed 70 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) (50
     KIAS in cold weather).
     9.3.9.2. A minimum of 200 feet of clearance will be maintained between the bottom of
     the SPIE assembly and any ground obstacles, tactical situation permitting.

     9.3.9.3. The aircraft will have an operable radar altimeter.
     9.3.9.4. Maximum flight time with personnel on the rope is 15 minutes. WARNING:
     Extreme care must be taken while making an approach to a high hover with a very slow
     rate of descent during the insertion to avoid the possibility of encountering power
     settling.
  9.3.10. Helocast Operations. Utilize the BEFORE LANDING checklist with gear up to
  prepare the aircraft for a water approach.
     9.3.10.1. Safety Requirements.
        9.3.10.1.1. All night water helocast approaches as well as all live deployments (day
        and night) require a safety boat or a hoist equipped (or extra life raft) rotary wing or
        tilt rotor cover ship with 30 min of loiter fuel, in radio contact, and within visual
        range of the operation to be present.
        9.3.10.1.2. The preferred coverage is with a safety boat present in the water
        operations area. The safety boat should be clearly marked (such as an IR strobe) and
        in communication prior to helocast operations. Safety boat location and
        communications plan must be coordinated prior to conducting the first low and slow.
        Positive communication with the cover ship and/or safety boat is required.
            9.3.10.1.2.1. Aircraft will call ―ON THE APPROACH‖ and ―OUT OF THE
            SPRAY‖ on interplane and safety boat frequencies.
        9.3.10.1.3. If a safety boat is not available, a cover ship with an operable hoist or
        extra raft will suffice. The cover ship crew must be qualified to deploy the raft or
        conduct hoist operations, have 1 hour of loiter time, and maintain radio contact with
        the helocast aircraft.
     9.3.10.2. Helocast deployments will be conducted at a maximum of 10 feet above water
     level (AWL) and 10 KGS. Personnel will exit the aircraft from the ramp. The aircraft
     will have an operable radar altimeter and hover symbology prior to helocast operations.
     9.3.10.3. Prepare the rescue hoist for extraction to the max extent possible prior to
     personnel deployment in the event an injury occurs to the departing team.
     9.3.10.4. Boat Deployment. WARNING: Combat rubber raiding craft (CRRC) center
     of gravity limitations will be discussed during both team and aircrew briefings. Failure to
     ensure adequate distribution of the team’s equipment may result in an aft CG causing the
     craft to become near vertical during deployment. Equipment and gear must be securely
     attached inside the boat.
        9.3.10.4.1. Reference USSOCOM MAN 350-6, Special Operations Forces
        Infiltration/ Exfiltration Techniques, chapter 9/10, for maritime operations and
        USSOCOM MAN 350-4, V2, Combat Rubber Raiding Craft Operations, for
        approved boats.
        9.3.10.4.2. Army or Navy personnel/boat deployment limit is Sea State 4 (17-21
        knots/3.8-5.0 average wave height). Reference USSOCOM MAN 350-4, V2, Sea
        State Chart, Appendix D.

          9.3.10.4.3. Boat/Raft configuration. The crafts may be laced to plywood or suitable
          material that will roll easily on the aircraft rollers. Many boat types must be partially
          deflated and strapped to fit within the cabin width. Compressed air may be
          configured to completely inflate the boat after deployment.
              9.3.10.4.3.1. The boat may be loaded bow or stern first. Secure with at least two
              cargo tie-down straps per boat, with a short bow or stern line attached to the
              aircraft.
              9.3.10.4.3.2. During the approach, after completing conversion, team members
              and crew members will prepare the boat for drop by removing the primary cargo
              tie-down straps. The bow or stern line will remain attached until pilot flying
              indicates the aircraft is within parameters for deployment.
   9.3.11. Belay Operations.
       9.3.11.1. All loose rope will be in a weighted bag.
       9.3.11.2. The belaying person will maintain control of the rope at all times.
       9.3.11.3. All participating personnel will be secured to the aircraft.
       9.3.11.4. Do not deploy the belay equipment until established in a stable hover over the
       deployment area.
       9.3.11.5. Fast rope and belaying operations will not occur simultaneously off the ramp.
       WARNING: When belaying equipment between 400 and 1,000 pounds from the ramp,
       consideration should be given to a possible rapid shift in aircraft CG. CG shift could
       become more profound if equipment becomes entangled and team members crowd on the
       ramp area.
9.4. Aerial Delivery.
   9.4.1. Personnel Parachute Delivery. Personnel will exit the aircraft on the command of a
   qualified jumpmaster after clearance is received from the aircraft commander. Reference
   USSOCOM Manual 350-3, Airborne Operations (Parachuting). Airdrop procedures are
   contained in AFSOCH 11-222 Combat Aircraft Fundamentals.
9.5. Vehicles, Motorcycles, and All Terrain Vehicles (ATVs). The T.O. 1V-22(C)B-9
(Cargo Handling Manual V-22 Tiltrotor) will be referred to when loading any vehicle. When
loading and unloading vehicles, use marshalling signals IAW AFI 11-218 and AFI 11-2CV-
22V3 CL 1.
9.6. Weapons Employment.
   9.6.1. In accordance with applicable rules of engagement, test fire aircraft weapons prior to
   any potential engagement. Avoid inhabited areas. When in formation, flight lead will brief
   and coordinate test firing procedures.
9.7. Peacetime SAR On-Scene Procedures.
   9.7.1. Human Remains. AFSOC and AETC crews do not remove human remains from
   crash or incident sites except as provided in the subparagraph below. Do not commit
   resources to body removal until the mission approving or releasing authority has been
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  59


  informed of the request and the attendant circumstances, and has authorized the removal of
  the remains.
     9.7.1.1. Military Personnel. If the crash or incident site is on a military reservation or
     within military jurisdiction, the remains of military personnel shall be removed only with
     the approval of a medical officer. In the absence of a medical officer at the crash or
     incident site, approval must be obtained from the proper military medical authority prior
     to removal of remains. If the crash or incident site is not within military control,
     jurisdiction over the remains rests with the civil authorities. In such cases, do not remove
     remains unless authorized by the appropriate civil official (usually the local coroner or
     medical examiner).
     9.7.1.2. Civilian Personnel. The remains of civilian personnel employed by the military
     are recovered as stated above. Remains of other civilians may be removed IAW
     applicable laws of the jurisdiction, after authority has been obtained.
     9.7.1.3. Exceptional Cases. Within the United States and in extreme situations where
     time is critical and communications are impossible, the aircraft commander may, with the
     approval of the appropriate civil official, remove remains and deliver them to the proper
     civil authorities. This procedure is authorized only if conditions already make it
     impossible to obtain timely approval from the mission approving or releasing authority.
     Whenever this procedure is employed, the aircraft commander should comply with any
     state or local laws or regulations affecting the transport of human remains.
  9.7.2. Civil Appointments. AFSOC personnel will not, at any time, accept appointments as
  deputy coroner.
  9.7.3. International Aspects. A mission requiring the removal of human remains, military or
  civilian, across international borders, will involve national as well as local law. Prior to such
  operations, consult the United States diplomatic officials to the concerned countries to obtain
  necessary clearances for the operation.
  9.7.4. Safeguarding Aircraft Wreckage. Reference AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
  Reports. If first on the scene, establish security until properly relieved. Guard classified
  matter until competent authority assumes control. Do not disturb personal effects on
  survivors or deceased. Inventory and store personal effects found in the crash area. Obtain
  receipts from personnel who assume custody, and retain them with inventories in the unit.
  9.7.5. Permission to Enter Private Property within the United States. Obtain written
  permission from the owner or person in control prior to entering private property. However,
  trespass by SAR personnel is justifiable when it is necessary to save life or limb.
  9.7.6. Marking Aircraft Wreckage. Obliterating or marking abandoned USAF aircraft
  wreckage is the responsibility of base commanders (reference AFI 91-204). However, this
  function may be delegated to an AFSOC unit. Use the following procedures:
     9.7.6.1. USAF Aircraft. Mark wreckage with a yellow cross as large as the condition of
     the wreckage permits. When condition of wreckage prevents a marking easily visible
     from the air, appropriately mark logs, rocks, and other material in the immediate area.
 60                                                   AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011


      9.7.6.2. Non-USAF Wreckage. Do not mark or obliterate non-USAF aircraft to guard
      against possible damage claims against USAF. Paint a yellow cross on material other
      than aircraft parts.
      9.7.6.3. Recording Data on Wreckage. To assist aircraft accident investigations, the
      recovery team will prepare a written description of the aircraft remnants and their
      location; the location, attire, and appearance of victims and survivors; evidence of
      accident cause, including instrument readings, control settings, condition and attitudes of
      control surfaces and landing gear; and such other data that may assist in analyzing the
      accident. Make every effort to preserve all aircraft papers, including flight records,
      charts, maintenance forms, radio logs, etc.
   9.7.7. IFF. CV-22 aircraft are authorized to use Mode 3, Code 1277, and call sign, (―AF
   Rescue XXX {tail number}‖), when operating under VFR in domestic airspace and:
      9.7.7.1. On an official SAR mission.
      9.7.7.2. En route to or from or within a designated search area.
9.8. Non-tactical Shipboard Operations.
   9.8.1. Aircrews will abide by the procedures outlined in the following: Joint Publication 3-
   04.1 Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Shipboard Helicopter Operations
   (Electronically or updated CD version), and AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
   on the Ground.

Repair Record. Refer to AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFI 91-204, (as
supplemented) 1. AFSOC/SE will be notified of the following high interest items: off drop zone
(DZ) drops, insertion injuries, IFR/AR incidents, dropped objects, or any other incident which, in
the judgment of the flight safety officer (FSO), needs to be reported. Use the AFSOC IMT 97
when reporting these incidents to AFSOC/SE. AFI 91-204 (as supplemented) to this AFI
provide policy guidance that is common to investigating and reporting all US Air Force mishaps
and provide instruction for using AFSOC IMT 97. Safety investigations and reports are
conducted and written solely to prevent future mishaps. Safety investigations take priority over
any corresponding legal investigations, except in the case of Friendly Fire mishaps or criminal
investigations.
12.3. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, The USAF Mishap Prevention
Program. The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force personnel to alert
supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt corrective action. A
hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may jeopardize the health and
well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or destruction of any weapons
system, equipment, facility, or material resource.

                    FLIGHT ENGINEER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

13.1. General. In addition to the duties listed in the flight manual, other applicable technical
orders, and this AFI, the aircraft commander may assign other duties to the flight engineer, as
necessary. Except for ferry flights and hostile environment repair these items need not be briefed
and will be performed as normal procedures. Training requirement will be IAW AFI 11-2CV-
22V1 CV-22 Training.
13.2. Unscheduled Maintenance. Flight engineers are not normally required to perform
unscheduled maintenance actions. However, in the absence of qualified maintenance personnel
the flight engineer may obtain authorization to perform the following actions (in coordination
with MX personnel when available) utilizing PEDD guidance:
   13.2.1. Chip detector removal, replacement and inspection.
   13.2.2. Filter removal and replacement.
   13.2.3. Basic line replacement unit (LRU) removal and replacement.
   13.2.4. Batteries.
   13.2.5. Clearing of yellow and red Blade Fold Wing Stow (BFWS) halts.
   13.2.6. Miscellaneous maintenance action.
13.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. At en route stations, flight engineers are authorized to clear
Red X symbols for intake and exhaust inspections, dust covers and plugs installed, and aircraft
panels removed and installed to facilitate other maintenance. In other situations where the
aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are unavailable, the flight engineer
may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the maintenance group commander, operations
group commander (or designated representative), or chief of maintenance, in accordance with
T.O. 00-20-1. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X.
13.4. In-process Inspections. All flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to
perform in-process inspections when clearing Red X symbols. During the assembly or
reassembly of an item at those stages where further assembly will prevent the required inspection
of the item, an in-process inspection will be performed. Document the in-process inspection.
(Refer to T.O. 00-20-1.) Additionally, flight engineers may be required to complete the
following inspections:
   13.4.1. Flapping Critical Inspection.
   13.4.2. -6 Inspections.
13.5. Refueling/Defueling. Flight engineers are normally not required to refuel, defuel, or
service the aircraft; however, the flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these
duties when maintenance personnel are not available. Servicing may include hydraulic systems,
oils systems, and nitrogen systems. Use the appropriate checklist during all refueling and
defueling operations. If ground support personnel are not available, the aircraft commander will
designate other crew members to assist the flight engineer.
AFI11-2CV-22V3 9 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   69


13.6. Forms Management. In addition to the procedures in T.O. 00-20-1 and AFI 11-401, the
flight engineer will assist the aircraft commander in maintaining the AFTO IMT 781. Verify the
exceptional release is signed before starting engines and resigned, if necessary, at en route stops.
After each flight, ensure the number of discrepancies (if any), landings, and flight duration
time(s), etc., are entered on the AFTO IMT 781H. Review all AFTO IMT 781A discrepancies
and ensure clear, detailed entries are made, symbols, date discovered, and when discovered
codes are entered for each discrepancy and the discovered blocks are signed. IAW DESC-I-31,
all off-station fuel purchases (to include FARP and in-flight refueling) will be logged on AF IMT
664, Aircraft Fuels/Ground Servicing Documentation Log.

                               OPORD BRIEFING FORMAT

A3.1. Purpose. This appendix provides procedures to standardize preparation and presentation
of operation orders.
A3.2. Scope. These procedures apply to all CV-22 units assigned or attached to conduct
joint/combined operations.
A3.3. General.
   A3.3.1. Conduct OPORD briefings to allow adequate preparation of individual maps and
   time for necessary crew coordination.
   A3.3.2. Conduct update briefs prior to departure to relay changes/additions to mission,
   weather, or to verify time hack, etc.
   A3.3.3. Each unit will conduct detailed flight briefings and verify crew understanding (brief-
   backs) of all aspects of the mission.
   A3.3.4. Designate planning cells; exempt members from unnecessary duties during the
   planning phase. Clearly delineate duties to cell members.
   A3.3.5. When possible, the Commander's representative (Flight Lead [FL]) will prepare and
   conduct the mission briefing. All phases of the operation will be briefed in detail.
   A3.3.6. Portions of the OPORD that do not apply to a given mission need not be briefed.
   Ground Force Commanders or their representatives should be present to field related
   questions, monitor changes, and validate plans.
   A3.3.7. Augment briefings with appropriate diagrams and charts. Construct diagrams as
   accurately as possible. Charts or diagrams not depicted to scale should be labeled as such.
   Additional guidance on the preparation of charts and diagrams can be found in Annex C.

   A3.3.8. Briefing Media. The standard for presentation of a deliberate mission briefing is
   prioritized as follows: (This may not be possible during Crisis Action Planning due to time
   constraints.)
      A3.3.8.1. Computer generated slide presentation augmented by required maps and
      charts. Always back up the computer slide show with sufficient charts. The Air Mission
      Commander (AMC) and mission briefer should determine the minimum requirement for
      backup media.
      A3.3.8.2. Opaque projector (Elmo) to project packet material.
      A3.3.8.3. Overhead slides supplemented with maps and charts.
      A3.3.8.4. Posters developed with poster maker from kneeboard handouts.
      A3.3.8.5. For in extremis type briefings, use of kneeboard items is acceptable.
A3.4. OPORD/Mission Briefing Format.
   A3.4.1. The Navy Time Clock number is DSN 762-1401.
   A3.4.2. TIME HACK. The time hack will be given prior to beginning the OPORD. This
   gains the attention of the crews and stops all activity among them. The time hack will be the
   same one given by the supported units (usually the ground commander). The time hack
   should be given in the following format:
   A3.4.2.1. "IN 1 MINUTE IT WILL BE 1900 ZULU/LOCAL…HACK." "TURN ALL
   PAGERS AND CELL PHONES OFF/SILENT."
      A3.4.2.2. "IN 30 SECONDS IT WILL BE 1900 ZULU/LOCAL. ..HACK."
      A3.4.2.3. "IN 10 SECONDS IT WILL BE 1900 ZULU/LOCAL. ..HACK."
      A3.4.2.4. "5, 4, 3, 2, 1, HACK, 1900 ZULU/LOCAL. "
   A3.4.3. ROLL CALL.
   A3.4.4. CLASSIFICATION.
   A3.4.5. OPORD NUMBER/NAME.
   A3.4.6. REFERENCES. Maps (update Military Grid Reference System [MGRS]/Datum),

      VI.    Purpose. This is authorized in lieu of impractical situations for
             preparation/conduct of the full OPORD. Typical situations include:
             training/deployments for single ship or unilateral operations, crew coordination
             control when selected individuals have valid preclusion from full OPORD
             attendance, or as implied by ―In-extremis‖ situations. It is imperative for all crew
             members to have complete understanding of the mission.
