                                           Chapter 2

            GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING AIRFIELD FACILITIES

2.1. Runways (RWYs) and Taxiways (TWYs):
     2.1.1. The primary RWY for all operations (including instrument) is RWY 14L/32R (East).
     RWY 14L/32R is 8351ft long by 200ft wide, and has 200ftx1000ft paved overruns. The
     RWY magnetic heading is 145.03/325.03 degrees and it is constructed of reinforced
     concrete. The Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE) for RWY 14L is 742ft and the TDZE for
     RWY 32R is 734ft.
     2.1.2. RWY 14R/32L (West) may only be used on an as needed basis for other than T-6 and
     depot MX aircraft operations consistent with the provisions of the SAT/RND Letter of
     Agreement (LOA). RWY 14R/32L is 8352ft long by 200ft wide, and has 200ftx1000ft paved
     overruns. The RWY magnetic heading is 145.03/325.03 degrees. The northern 1000ft of the
     RWY is constructed of reinforced concrete, the southern 2500ft of the RWY is constructed of
     reinforced concrete, and the middle 4852ft is constructed of asphalt. The TDZE for RWY
     14R is 761ft and the TDZE for RWY 32L is 734ft.
     2.1.3. RWY Intersection Distance Remaining (See Table 2.1).

Table 2.1. RWY Inter Remaining:




     2.1.4. The parallel RWYs are separated by 6300ft. Both RWYs are marked as precision
     RWYs. RWY 14L/32R (East) Pavement Classification Number (PCN) is 62 R/B/W/T; for
     RWY 14R/32L (West), the PCN number is 31 R/B/W/T.
     2.1.5. TWYs are all 75 wide with the exception of TWYs , A4, A5, G4, and G5 that are
     100ft wide. Warm-up pads adjacent to TWYs A1, A6, G1, and G6 increase the overall width
     of those TWYs. See Attachment 3 for taxiway restrictions when the warm-up pad is in use.
     2.1.6. Randolph‘s field elevation is 761ft MSL.
     2.1.7. Airfield Diagram: (see Attachment 2).
2.2. RWY Selection/Barrier Change Procedures: SOFs determine the RWY in use. If a SOF
is not present then ATC determines RWY in use. SOFs will coordinate with ATC and the
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                        9


opposite facility SOF, if needed, to select an optimum time for RWY change (weather
conditions, rapid wind change, wet RWY, etc. should dictate a shorter coordination time). The
optimum times for RWY changes are prior to wing flying, or between T-6 goes. If preferred
times cannot be met serious consideration should be made to complete the runway change with
the least amount of T-38s with ETAs within 30 minutes of Randolph. If operationally feasible,
preference should be made to align RND and SAT traffic flows to preclude likely delays and
pattern restrictions. NOTE: RND is only manned with enough barrier maintenance personnel to
change the barrier configuration for one RWY at a time.
   2.2.1. Barrier Change Sequence: RND will coordinate with HNG, SAT, Fire Dept, and
   Airfield Management (AM) with as much advance notice as possible prior to a runway
   change (including the expected runway change time).
       2.2.1.1. To expedite the change, the following procedure will be used to disconnect/re-
       connect the barriers: At 30 minutes prior to the RWY change time (RCT), the barrier
       change crew will meet at the departure end of the West RWY or the departure end of the
       East RWY as directed by the SOF/ATC. The departure end of the first RWY will be
       disconnected prior to connecting the approach end to prevent both barriers from being
       connected at the same time. If traffic permits, ATC will direct restricted low approaches
       to accelerate the completion of this procedure.
       2.2.1.2. Weekend/Holiday/Out of Hour Operations: When ATC notifies AM of the RWY
       in use, AM will coordinate with and direct Fire and Emergency Services to disconnect/re-
       connect the barriers to be configured to the RWY in use. ATC will resume normal
       operations when notified by AM the barriers are configured correctly. The RWY in use
       will be completely configured prior to proceeding to the other RWY.
   2.2.2. AM will:
       2.2.2.1. Notify Barrier Maintenance/Fire and Emergency Services of proposed RWY
       change time. AM will notify Barrier Maintenance when the RWY change will occur
       between 0600-1445L Monday- Friday (except holidays) and Fire and Emergency
       Services all other times.
       2.2.2.2. Complete an arresting system inspection for proper configuration and report the
       status to ATC. If necessary and if time permits conduct an airfield check and report
       status/RWY condition prior to resuming operations.
   2.2.3. ATC Shall:
       2.2.3.1. Notify AM as soon as possible of proposed RWY change. To the maximum
       extent possible provide 30 and 15 minutes prior to RWY change: Transmit
       (RND/Hangover RWY change at (time), time now (time)) on Local Control (LC) and
       Ground Control (GC) frequencies. 15 minutes prior instruct all aircraft on the ground to
       remain in parking until ground traffic flow allows unrestricted taxiing to the new RWY.
       Instruct all aircraft in the VFR pattern traffic to either depart the pattern, climb to high
       pattern (exceptions may be made based on number of aircraft in the pattern), or to full
       stop. Disapprove Racetrack/Rerun requests until aircraft commence taxiing to the new
       RWY in use.
 10                                                           12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


       2.2.3.2. At 10 minutes prior to RWY change: Transmit (RND/Hangover RWY change at
       (time), time now (time)) on LC and GC frequencies. Begin directing airborne aircraft to
       re-enter via VFR entry for the new RWY (based on traffic, ATC may direct aircraft to
       other points in the pattern in lieu of VFR entry). When the RWY change is complete and
       AM has completed an arresting system inspection and RWY check if necessary RND will
       notify SAT TRACON, AM, Fire Dept and WX of the RWY change completion time and
       transmit (RND/Hangover RWY (RWY number) in use) on tower and ground frequencies.
       2.2.3.3. Do not release departures to Seguin until RWY change is complete.
   2.2.4. The SOF shall notify 12 OG/CC and Seguin RWY Control Structure (RCS) of the
   proposed RWY change start time and completion time. The Seguin RCS controller will
   notify the SOF when RWY change is complete.
   2.2.5. Seguin Procedures: The assigned Senior Fire Official (SFO) is responsible for
   completing all airfield checks and must be trained IAW AFI 13-204V3. Prior to the start of
   flying activities Foreign Object Damage (FOD), Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazards
   BASH, Habitat Control, Ponding, and RWY Surface Condition (RSC), etc, checks must be
   completed. The SFO will document checks on a checklist designed for use at Seguin. Seguin
   personnel are responsible to use any available means to contact RND ATC or SOF of any
   unusual occurrences requiring immediate attention.
       2.2.5.1. The RCS controller will advise the SOF of any status changes or discrepancies
       affecting operations.
       2.2.5.2. RCS and/or SOF will report airfield discrepancies to AM for reporting to the
       appropriate agency.
       2.2.5.3. Maintenance of the RCS facilities is the responsibility of the RCS facility
       manager. The RCS controller will inform the facility manager of all discrepancies and
       coordinate with the appropriate agencies for repair.
       2.2.5.4. Normally, Seguin will align their RWY with RND. When conditions (winds,
       barrier condition, etc.) prohibit alignment with RND, the RCS controller will coordinate
       with the SOF and 560 FTS duty desk for opposite direction operations.
2.3. Controlled Movement Area (CMA): The CMA includes the RWYs, overruns, and the
areas within 100 ft of either RWY or overrun and all portions of TWYs on the RWY side of the
VFR hold lines.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                       11


Figure 2.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA):




2.4. Airfield Lighting Systems:
   2.4.1. RWY 14L (East) has nonstandard ALSF-1 (2,100ft) Approach Lighting System
   (ALS), High Intensity RWY Lights (HIRL), Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPI), and
   Sequenced Flashing Lights (SFL).
   2.4.2. RWY 32R (East) has ALSF-1 standard approach lights, (HIRL), (PAPI), and (SFL).
   2.4.3. RWY 14R/32L (West) has (HIRL), and (PAPI). The RWY has no ALS. Precision
   instrument approaches are authorized by Permanent Waiver RA 107-2. To enhance early
   acquisition of the RWY environment by aircrews, available lighting prior to the threshold is
   used. In addition to threshold lights, red pre-threshold bar lights are available 100ft from the
   threshold and red and white terminating bar lights are available 200ft from the threshold. The
   overrun is outlined with red edge lights. All approaches are designed to no light minimums
   with approved waivers.
   2.4.4. All TWYs are equipped with standard three-step lighting.
   2.4.5. ATC shall operate airfield lighting IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control
   Handbook, AFI 13-204,V3 and local directives. ATC will report any lighting malfunctions
   immediately to AM. AM will immediately notify 902 CE/CEOFE at 652-7616 or EMCS
   652-3151 for standby personnel, of any airfield lighting malfunction. AM will issue
   appropriate NOTAM for airfield light outages.
   2.4.6. During periods when the towers are closed, 902 CES/CEOFE is responsible for
   operating the airfield lighting. After-hours requests will be passed through the CE EMCS at
   652-3151 for technician notification/response.
 12                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


   2.4.7. Airfield Lighting Checks: 902 CES/CEOFE will complete a daily lighting check prior
   to the first take-off (Mon-Fri) and immediately report any deficiencies that cannot be
   corrected on the spot to Airfield Management Operations (AMOPs). The lighting check is an
   operational check of all lighting systems to include intensity level (steps 1-5) and repairs of
   any lighting outages. Exterior Electric will contact AMOPs each morning by radio, when
   accessing and departing the airfield environment and report the airfield lighting status. AM is
   still responsible to conduct a retro-reflective markings check every Friday and other times the
   airfield is open during times of darkness or during IFR conditions.
   2.4.8. RND ATC is responsible for operating the rotating beacon unless RND is closed and
   HNG is open then HNG will operate it. The beacon is located on top of building 100 and will
   only be operated during open hours as required by the FAAO 7110.65.
2.5. Aircraft Arresting Systems:
   2.5.1. All RWYs have one BAK-15 arresting system located 250ft into each departure end
   overrun. The BAK-15 is between 12.5ft and 14ft high in the middle, and 23ft high on each
   side. Remote control systems are located in each tower for their respective RWY.
   2.5.2. Coordination Procedures: ATC will raise the BAK-15 IAW FAAO 7110.65 when
   requested by aircrew, when directed by the SOF, Flight Safety, and when a No Radio
   (NORDO) T-38 aircraft is approaching to land. Average reset time for the BAK-15 is four
   hours after an engagement.
       2.5.2.1. ATC will notify AM of barrier malfunctions. AM will notify Barrier
       Maintenance between the hours of 0600 and 1445 M-F (except holidays). Such
       notification will be made by AM through Barrier Maintenance or EMCS Service Desk at
       652-3151 or 3143.
       2.5.2.2. BAK-15 barriers will be configured, activated and inspected prior to the start of
       flying. NOTE: ATC shall notify AM before releasing arresting systems to barrier
       maintenance for maintenance or configuration changes.
       2.5.2.3. CE-Barrier Maintenance is responsible for instructing ATC on the location and
       capabilities of the arresting systems.
   2.5.3. Barrier Maintenance and ATC shall use easy to understand descriptions such as:
   operational, not operational and in-service, out-of-service, raised, and lowered when
   reporting system status.
2.6. Parking Plan/Restrictions: Wing assigned aircraft are assigned parking areas designed for
specific aircraft to allow reduced parking spacing and fixed support equipment. Transient aircraft
are assigned parking in areas designed for general aircraft operations. Transient aircraft should
not transit the south crossover and will normally be parked on the south ramp, unless otherwise
directed by AM. See Table 2.2 for parking area assignments. Airfield restrictions establishing
limitations on the number or type of aircraft using JBSA-RND will be coordinated with HQ
AETC, 12 FTW/CC, 12 OG/CC, AOF/CC and Command Post (CP) a minimum of 96 hours
prior.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                     13


Table 2.2. Assigned Parking Areas:




   2.6.1. Special activity parking: Static display, Air Show, Open House, and other special
   activity parking are determined by the requirements of the event. Normally, a POC is
   assigned to activities requiring aircraft parking plans. The POC coordinates a parking plan
   with AM, Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), Transient Alert and Security Forces
   Squadron (SFS).
2.7. Air Traffic Control Facilities:
   2.7.1. JBSA-RND has two operational control towers, Randolph ATC (RND) and Hangover
   ATC (HNG). RND is a VFR tower and is located at the intersection of TWY A, TWY A4,
   and TWY B on the east side of the airfield. HNG is a VFR tower and is located at the
   intersection of TWY G, G4 and TWY E on the west side of the airfield.
   2.7.2. Published Operating Hours: Randolph Airfield and RND ATC will operate from
   0700L to 1800L, Monday through Friday, and will be closed Saturday, Sunday, and federal
   holidays.
   2.7.3. HNG will normally operate during periods of local T-6 flying; Monday through
   Friday 0700L to 1800L or until flying is terminated. Additional operations may be conducted
   if coordinated with and directed by 12 OSS/OSA. Scheduled HNG ATC operations during
   RWY 14L/32R (East RWY) closures will not exceed 16 hours per day, 6 days per week.
   2.7.4. Out of Hours Operations (OHOPs): Units requiring OHOPs shall immediately notify
   12 OSS/DO (or 12 OSS/OSA if unavailable) who in turn will notify 12 OSS/OSA, ATC,
   AM, Transient Alert (TA), WX, MOC, Command Post, and Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants
   (POL) of the requirement. Approval authorities for extending the published airfield
   hours/OHOPS are the 12 OG/CC, 12 OSS/CC, 12 OSS/DO and AOF/CC. The airfield will
   open 30 minutes prior to distinguished visitor (DV) arrivals and close 30 minutes after DV
   departures unless otherwise coordinated with the aircraft commander and the AOF/CC.
   NOTE: Times are reduced to 15 minutes when the arrival/departure is not a DV.
2.8. Designated Airspace: RND (East) ATC airspace is that Class D airspace 4.4 NM radius
from the center of the airfield, North and East of Randolph, from the surface up to and including
3100ft MSL. HNG (West) ATC airspace is that Class D airspace 4.4 NM radius from the center
of the airfield, West and South of Randolph, from the surface up to and including 2800ft MSL.
SAT TRACON airspace is that airspace which extends from 2000ft MSL to 4800ft MSL
 14                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


overlying a portion of the HNG airspace. The RND/SAT TRACON LOA establishes guidance
for HNG ATC aircraft operations on the West side within the SAT TRACON Class C airspace
up to and including 2800ft MSL without routine requests for individual approval. This provision
does not preclude SAT TRACON from denying JBSA-RND ATC operations within that
airspace.
2.9. Visual Blind Spots: The visual blind spots for RND ATC are the east ramp (aircraft
shelters), portions of TWY A and the western half of the South Ramp, portions of the South
Ramp obscured by bldg 38 (parachute hangar) and including Taxilane D, and the entire West
Ramp to include all TWYs and the west RWY. The visual blind spots for HNG ATC are the
northern portion of the West Ramp (aircraft shelters), the eastern half of the South Ramp,
including TWY D, and the entire East Ramp to include all TWYs and the east RWY (See
Attachment 2). Due to the visual limitations caused by the shelters, aircrews should add their
parking location to any calls to the Tower or Ground controllers if expecting an eyes-on, or
location specific response, e.g. Randolph Ground, Cheetah 01, there is a fuel leak in shelter # 9-
2 appears to be streaming from T-1 tail number 0333. See Attachment 2.
2.10. Local Frequencies: ATC will use the phrase local channel (number) when issuing local
channelization (see Table 2.3) with Wing assigned aircraft. See Table 2.4. for local area manual
frequencies.

Table 2.3. Local Aircraft Channelization:
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                 15

   2.11.3. NAVAID Monitoring: RND ATC is the designated NAVAID monitoring facility.
   When open, RND ATC will continuously monitor the active ILS(s), TACAN, and VORTAC.
   HNG shall notify RND of any reported outages. Pilots should report any weak or anomalous
   signals to ATC. If HNG is the only facility open, pilot reports – in lieu of manning RND –
   may be used to indicate NAVAIDs are operating normally.
      2.11.3.1. When NAVAID outages occur, the following agencies or individuals will be
      notified by RND: SAT, HNG, AM, 902 Communication Squadron (CS) Communications
      Focal Point (Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) Maintenance), SOF,
      and the ATM, or AOF/CC (ATM or AOF/CC will notify the 12 OSS/CC and/or 12
      OSS/DO). When the NAVAID is returned to service, notification procedures remain the
      same. NOTE: The order in which notifications are made may vary depending on the
      NAVAID outage and extent to which the mission is affected.
   2.11.4. NAVAID Preventive Maintenance Inspections (PMIs): PMIs will normally be
   performed IAW the 12 OSS/902 CS Operations Letter, Malfunction/Interruption of Air
   Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) and Communication Equipment. When there
 16                                                            12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


   is scheduled OHOP that may affect PMI, ATC will coordinate with CS to ensure no adverse
   impact on aircraft operations.
      2.11.4.1. Unless performing preflight parameter checks during periods when the tower is
      unmanned, CS will not engage NAVAID interlocks without RND ATC approval.
      2.11.4.2. ATC will not release RWY 14L/32R (East) ILS, or DHK TACAN (or RND
      VORTAC in the event DHK TACAN is OTS) for unscheduled maintenance when the
      weather is forecasted to be, or pilot reports indicate, less than 3000ft above ground level
      (AGL) ceiling and/or less than 5 SM visibility for the duration of the unscheduled
      maintenance plus one hour after the unscheduled maintenance time.
      2.11.4.3. CS will coordinate all routine maintenance through ATC. ATC will coordinate
      with AOF/CC. AOF/CC will coordinate with OG/CC, affected flying squadron(s) and
      AM for completion of appropriate NOTAM action, if required.
      2.11.4.4. The following times have been established for PMIs at JBSA-RND when the
      current and forecasted weather is 1500ft ceiling or greater and visibility 5 SM or greater
      for the entire period of the PMI plus 1 hour: VORTAC and TACAN: Tuesday and
      Thursday 2230-0630L and ILS (ALL) Monday and Wednesday 2230L-0630L.
   2.11.5. NAVAID Restoration Priorities: In the event of multiple failures of NAVAIDs, CS
   will respond to outages in the following order: Radios, Active RWY ILS(s), TACAN,
   VORTAC, inactive RWY ILS(s).
   2.11.6. NAVAID outage response times shall be in accordance with 12 OSS/902 CS
   Operations Letter.
2.12. Transient Aircraft:
   2.12.1. Transient aircraft operations will be IAW AP/1.
   2.12.2. Transient Aircraft Local Sorties: Due to transient support contract limitations,
   transient aircraft are not authorized to fly local sorties out of JBSA-RND. Aircraft may
   depart to another station, land, service, depart and return to JBSA-RND based on PPR
   availability. Any exception must be approved by the OG/CC.
   2.12.3. Transient aircraft should not transit the south crossover and will normally be parked
   on the south ramp, unless otherwise directed by AM.
2.13. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) Procedures:
   2.13.1. RND/HNG have separate ATISs and will broadcast specific information pertinent to
   their operations. ATC shall operate the ATIS IAW FAAO 7110.65 and AFI 13-204V3; SOF
   may request additional critical information be included on the ATIS. RND/HNG ATC shall
   notify SAT TRACON of ATIS changes by STARS automation. HNG ATIS is broadcast over
   the VORTAC Freq 112.3.
   2.13.2. Controllers will ensure that pilots receive the most current pertinent information.
   Aircraft should receive ATIS information from San Antonio TRACON prior to being handed
   off to RND/HNG towers.
   2.13.3. RND/HNG ATIS will include simultaneous independent approaches are in use.
2.14. Aircraft Special Operations Areas/Ramps:
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                     17


   2.14.1. Arm/De-Arm Areas: JBSA-RND does not have facilities to handle aircraft with live
   ordinance. If de-arming is necessary, AM will contact Command Post to request
   EOD/Munitions personnel from JBSA-Lackland. Aircraft will be parked on the southern
   edge of TWY A6 or G6, and if equipped with forward firing ordnance, be pointed away from
   populated areas until pinned and then towed or taxied to the south ramp and parked away
   from other aircraft and personnel. The preferred location will be on the south eastern portion
   of the ramp until the south ramp is painted to accommodate fighter type aircraft.
   2.14.2. Engine Run-up Areas: The only authorized high powered engine run locations are
   located between TWY A, B, and C on the trim pad, the T-38 sound suppressor pad, and the
   HUSH house. There are no designated areas for transient fighters or heavy aircraft. Requests
   will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and be dependent upon location and ramp traffic.
   2.14.3. Drag Chute Jettison Areas: There are no drag chute jettison areas at Randolph.
   Aircraft with deployed drag chutes after landing will be instructed by ATC to maintain them
   to parking. In the event that they are jettisoned on the RWY, ATC will suspend operations
   and notify AM for retrieval.
2.15. Local Airfield Pavement Markings:
   2.15.1. Warm-up pads near the ends of the RWYs are designed for use by local aircraft only.
   TWY A1 and A6 warm-up pad parking spots are designed for use by T-38 aircraft. (When a
   T-1 aircraft uses the markings, T-38 and T-1 aircraft will leave an empty parking spot
   adjacent to T-1 aircraft to ensure the appropriate wing tip clearance.) TWY G1 and G6
   warm-up pad taxi line markings are designed for use by T-6 aircraft. See Attachment 3 for
   complete warm-up pad restrictions.
   2.15.2. All local aircraft parking areas are marked with Service zones (see AFI 11-218,
   Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, Para 1.22.2.1.3.). Designated AGE and
   vehicle painted boxes or lines on the ramp are marked with two broken white lines parallel to
   aircraft parking rows and provide an approx. 10ft wide lane, 10ft from parked aircraft to
   servicing vehicle/AGE when the vehicles/AGE are between the lines. The lane is not a
   roadway; use these lanes only to park while servicing the aircraft. All other vehicles will
   maintain a minimum of 25ft from any part of an aircraft.
   2.15.3. Local aircraft parking areas are marked to identify positioning of AGE and other
   support equipment such as fire bottles that ensure a minimum of 10 ft wingtip clearance of
   aircraft operating in and out of parking spots.
   2.15.4. All markings between taxiways and aprons are painted to define the width of the
   taxiway. These markings are two dashed yellow lines outlined in black.
2.16. Aircraft Towing Procedures: All aircraft towing will be at the discretion of MOC.
Towing operations within a ramp do not require ATC notification. All other tows will require
coordination with MOC; tow drivers will monitor Tower Net. All unusual operations/activities
on ramps or the CMA require prior coordination and approval by AM and ATC.
2.17. Aircraft Taxi Requirements/Routes: No aircraft will be allowed to taxi to the RWY
without establishing two-way radio contact with GC. GC shall not taxi any aircraft without valid
FP authorization from AM or local stereo FP in the system. On initial contact, pilots will state
their location, request taxi to the active RWY and advise GC of the number of aircraft in the
 18                                                               12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


flight (lead aircraft shall notify GC of any aircraft not accompanying the flight). Delayed aircraft
will individually call for taxi with current ATIS code and state clearance received or if departing
on a mission stereo departure.
   2.17.1. RND GC is the controlling agency for Taxilane Delta. Due to the south ramp tower
   blind spots, coordination and radio communications transfer shall be accomplished prior to
   the aircraft entering the South crossover from the East or after crossing from the West in
   order for the West tower to visually ensure the aircraft transits safely
   2.17.2. In areas where ATC cannot see taxiing transient aircraft, advise the aircraft to: use
   caution, portions of the aerodrome not visible from [name] tower.
   2.17.3. Heavy/Widebody Aircraft Operations: Heavy aircraft tend to create debris on the
   movement area. ATC will provide AM with a 15 mile call on heavy aircraft arrival and when
   heavy aircraft are taxiing for departure. Obstacles on the airfield limit and restrict aircraft
   movement on the ground. AM will determine the preferred routing based on aircraft weight
   vs. pavement weight bearing capacity, aircraft wingspan, and obstructions. AM will provide
   ATC the preferred taxi route of heavy aircraft to and from parking. If the preferred taxi route
   is not acceptable, ATC will notify AM. AM will conduct and document an airfield check to
   examine the primary takeoff, landing and taxi surfaces in support Heavy/Widebody aircraft.
   This will include a FOD check the RWY and taxi routes immediately after heavy aircraft.
   ATC will provide AM with notification of landing of heavy aircraft and when heavy aircraft
   are taxiing for departure. AM will check only taxi routes behind C-130s, C-9s and P-3s for
   FOD. NOTE: For a list of taxi restrictions see Attachment 3.
2.18. Airfield Maintenance:
   2.18.1. Repairs to the airfield must have a CE work order or contract. Coordinate with AM,
   CE, FD, OGV, Wing Safety, Terminal Enroute Procedures System representative (TERPS),
   SFS and tenant units to determine impact of proposed construction/repair projects.
   2.18.2. Sweeper Operations: The sweeper is tasked to support the airfield and is in radio
   contact with AM Monday thru Friday 0630L-1430L; sweeper is on call at other times.
   2.18.3. Grass Mowing: Grass at Randolph will be maintained at a height between 7 and 14
   inches. For details concerning the grass-cutting contract, contact CE Contract Office.
2.19. RWY Surface Condition (RSC) Values:
   2.19.1. Aircrews, ATC, SOFs may report a RWY Wet to Airfield Management Operations
   (AMPOS) based on observed precipitation. AM will verify/determine the RSC and pass it to
   ATC and CP.
   2.19.2. When water is the only form of visible moisture on 25 percent or more of the RWY
   surface area (whether in isolated areas or not), report the RSC as "wet RWY" and no RCR.
   Regardless of a Wet or Dry RSC, report the existence, location and depth of any standing
   water (ponding, water patches, puddles, etc.). Identify and report other information essential
   to safe aircraft operations in clear text following the RSC and RCR data. Examples include
   but are not limited to the following:
       2.19.2.1. The extent or depth of any precipitation on the RWY.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                          19


       2.19.2.2. Describe location of precipitation on partially covered RWYs (e.g., touchdown
       area, rollout area, etc.). Use patches of water in conjunction with RSC conditions. If
       possible identify the location of the patches.
   2.19.3. For the West RWY, AFM and OGV have agreed the RSC will either be Dry, Wet,
   Wet standing water or patches of water (and location) to coincide with the T-6 crosswind
   limitations.
   2.19.4. AM will re-inspect the RWY(s) when notified of an RSC change, or when requested
   by ATC or the SOF. During rapidly changing conditions RSC checks will be conducted more
   frequently to ensure aircrews are provided with timely and accurate information. Continuous
   rainfall negates any need to conduct RSC checks unless needed to verify status of standing
   water.
2.20. Procedures/Requirements for Conducting Airfield Inspections/Checks: An airfield
check, FOD, RSC BASH, habitat control, and ponding etc, will be completed on all primary
takeoff, landing and taxi surfaces prior to airfield operating hours. Completion of the daily
airfield inspection before the start of wing flying activities satisfies this requirement. However, if
daylight does not permit a complete inspection, the inspection must be completed when able
(minimum of once per day). Prior to opening for any OHOP, airfield checks will be completed
on the RWY and TWYs to be used. The RWY is considered closed until this inspection/check is
completed and AM transfers control of the RWY to ATC. Additional checks such as FOD, RSC
and BWC checks are required to reopen a RWY that has been closed, or at any other time as
requested by ATC or SOF.
   2.20.1. AM completes a quarterly inspection of the Seguin Auxiliary airfield. The AM, RSU
   Representative, SFS, CE (Operations/Construction Engineering), and Wing Safety will have
   representatives participating in this joint inspection. Other agencies may be invited to send
   representatives when reason exists for their involvement (OG, CS, etc.). Joint inspections
   survey the airfields at Seguin Auxiliary for compliance with design criteria and safety
   standards. Observations should include consideration of compliance, obstacles, frangibility,
   lighting and marking, and Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazards (BASH). Completion of the
   inspections will be documented using applicable portions of the Airfield Certification/Safety
   Inspection checklist from AFI 13-204V2 for inspections performed at Seguin Auxiliary
   Field. NOTE: The annual inspection will serve as the quarterly inspection for the quarter in
   which it is conducted.
   2.20.2. AM will complete an annual Airfield Certification/Safety Inspection of Randolph
   and Seguin Auxiliary airfield. AM/ATC(TERPS), SOF, RSU Representative, SFS, CE
   (Operations/Construction Engineering), and Wing Safety will have representatives
   participating in this inspection. Other agencies may be invited to send representatives when
   reason exists for their involvement (OG, CS, etc.). Joint inspections survey the airfields at
   Randolph and Seguin Auxiliary for compliance with design criteria and safety standards.
   Observations should include consideration of compliance, obstacles, frangibility, lighting and
   marking, and (BASH). Completion of the inspections will be documented using applicable
   portions of the Airfield Certification/Safety Inspection checklist from AFI 13-204 V2 and
   V3.
2.21. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures: Maintenance engine runs and taxi checks will be
coordinated with MOC. MOC will provide tail number, type and location, and taxi route, if
 20                                                               12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


applicable, to AM to ensure an authorized location is being used. AM will notify ATC.
Maintenance crews will contact the respective GC prior to engine start, providing tail number
and taxi route if applicable. Maintenance will monitor GC frequency any time engine(s) are
running. Upon termination, maintenance will contact GC and MOC. High Power Engine runs
will not normally be done at between the hours of 2200L and 0600L for noise abatement.
Exceptions to this policy require prior coordination and approval from 12 FTW/CV.
2.22. Noise Abatement Procedures: Practice approaches will not be flown at JBSA-RND
between the hours of 2200L and 0600L for noise abatement. Exceptions to this policy require
prior coordination and approval from 12 OG/CC. AM will be advised of any exceptions and
relay to ATC.
   2.22.1. Quiet Period/Ramp Freeze/Sterile Pattern Procedures may be for only one or both
   RWYs and/or specific apron areas. 12 OSS will coordinate required actions with the affected
   Flying Training Squadron (FTS), ATC and AM. AM will initiate NOTAM action for the
   Quiet Period/Ramp Freeze/Sterile Pattern NLT 24 hours in advance.
       2.22.1.1. Quiet Period: No takeoffs, overhead patterns or touch-and-goes. Aircraft may
       make one straight-in approach to a full stop landing. Additional restrictions on ramp
       operations may be made by 12 OSS/OSA. Ramp operations are defined as
       aircraft/vehicle movement, aerospace ground equipment (AGE) operation and refueling.
       2.22.1.2. Sterile Pattern: Patterns will be closed for scheduled activities, no departures or
       arrivals. Normally, there are no restrictions on ground operations. There are no
       restrictions on emergency Class D transitions. Other transitions may be approved if they
       do not impact the event requiring the sterile pattern.
          2.22.1.3.1. West Ramp Freeze: No aircraft in the West traffic pattern, no arrivals, no
          departures except IFEs. No aircraft/vehicle movement on the west flight line
          (vehicles, tows, AGE; aircraft engines runs). Emergency, safety, law enforcement
          vehicles/aircraft may continue to operate mission essential activities.
          2.22.1.3.2. East Ramp Freeze: No aircraft in the East traffic pattern, no arrivals, no
          departures except IFEs. No aircraft/vehicle movement on the East flight line
          (vehicles, tows, AGE; aircraft engines runs). Emergency, safety, law enforcement
          vehicles/aircraft may continue to operate mission essential activities.
          2.22.1.3.3. South Ramp Freeze: No aircraft in the East or West traffic pattern, no
          arrivals, no departures except IFEs. No aircraft/vehicle movement on the south ramp
          (vehicles, tows, AGE; aircraft engines runs). Emergency, safety, law enforcement
          vehicles/aircraft may continue to operate mission essential activities. East/west ramp
          operations may continue.
   2.22.2. MOC will:
       2.22.2.1. Ensure all maintenance personnel and POL on the affected parking aprons are
       aware of the ramp freeze start/stop times.
       2.22.2.2. Advise all maintenance personnel and POL on the affected flight lines when the
       ramp freeze has been instituted and to terminate restricted operations.
       2.22.2.3. Advise all maintenance personnel and POL on the affected flight lines when the
       ramp freeze has been terminated and to resume normal operations.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                       21


       2.22.2.4. Ensure all supporting units (Depot MX, COMBS units, etc.) are notified, as
       appropriate.
   2.22.3. FTS Operations Supervision will:
       2.22.3.1. Ensure aircrews are aware of the applicable procedures; advise departing
       aircrews not to start engines until the termination of the Quiet Period/Ramp Freeze.
       2.22.3.2. If applicable, advise the aircrew transport drivers to avoid movement in front of
       base operations (ramp side) from 20 minutes prior to departure/arrival of any DV activity
       until the Quiet Period is terminated.
       2.22.3.3. If applicable, notify the Seguin RCS Controller.
2.23. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas: ILS critical area dimensions are
described in FAAO 6750.16, Siting Criteria for Instrument Landing Systems and AFI 13-204V3.
Aircraft and vehicle access to the ILS critical area must be controlled to ensure the integrity of
ILS course signals whenever conditions are less than reported ceiling 800ft or visibility less than
2 SM.
   2.23.1. The ILS critical areas are protected on the movement areas by controlling access to
   the CMA.
   2.23.2. Perimeter road intrudes on the glideslope critical area for RWY 14L. ATC will notify
   AM to close the gates and clear the area when the WX is below or is forecast below minima
   requiring protection of the critical area. AM will then notify the fire dept and ATC when area
   is clear and gates are closed. Once closed access to the protected ILS critical area requires
   permission from ATC. Aircraft will be notified if the glideslope becomes unprotected due to
   vehicles driving through the critical area or if AM cannot close the gates prior to an arrival.
   ATC will discontinue use of RWY 14L glideslope for all aircraft when it is not protected and
   the weather is below minima. NOTE: Gates will be closed Mon-Fri, 0600-0830 for inbound
   vehicle traffic at the east gate.
   2.23.3. The only instrument hold lines on JBSA-RND are used to depict the boundary of the
   Precision Obstacle Free Zone. For purposes of Precision Approach Critical Area Protection,
   consider the established VFR hold lines as the hold limits. For depictions of the ILS Critical
   Areas see Attachment 2.
2.24. Restricted Areas on the Airfield: Restricted areas are off-limits to all individuals unless
escorted by an aircrew member of an aircraft that is parked within the restricted area. Temporary
restricted areas are marked with red rope, stanchions, and signs around aircraft.
2.25. Procedures for Suspending RWY Operations: AM has the authority to close, suspend
or resume airfield, RWY, or TWY operations. AM will notify ATC of any movement area
closures, suspensions, openings, or resumptions of operations. AM will conduct a RWY check
prior to resuming operations and provide a time RWY operations are expected to resume.
   2.25.1. ATC, AM or SOF may suspend operations to a RWY for reasons such as safety,
   RWY or barrier inspections, RWY sweeping, unauthorized vehicle on RWY, IFE arrival, etc.
   AM will initiate applicable NOTAM action.
2.26. Procedures for Opening and Closing the RWYs: The RWYs will be opened and closed
by formal transfer of control to the appropriate agency.
 22                                                             12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


   2.26.1. No later than 50 minutes prior to airfield opening, AM will contact SFS and advise
   that AM has control of the airfield.
   2.26.2. No later than 25 minutes prior to airfield opening, AM will proceed with the airfield
   opening checklist.
   2.26.3. At 5 minutes prior to airfield opening, AM will report to each Control Tower, as
   appropriate, the status of the airfield to include RSC, BASH condition, call signs of vehicles
   and personnel on the CMA, and any other information relevant to airfield conditions. The
   Control Towers will then assume control of the airfield by verbally broadcasting
   Randolph/Hangover Tower has control of the RWY on the ATC frequencies and the Tower
   and Crash Nets.
   2.26.4. Tower will notify AM when closing and AM will notify SFS that the RWYs are
   closed at airfield closing time.
2.27. Auxiliary Power Requirements: The 12 OG/CC has determined commercial/installation
power to be reliable. The following auxiliary power requirements/procedures have been
established.
   2.27.1. Air Traffic Control Towers, Airfield Management, Airfield Lighting, and ATCALS
   facilities are equipped with backup-generators with reliable auto-start capability.
   Additionally, critical systems will be equipped with uninterrupted power supplies. Specific
   systems and their aux power supply, procedures and user responsibilities are outlined in the
   12 OSS/ATCALS Ops Letter.
   2.27.2. Facilities will notify 902 CES/CEOFP concerning any diminished power condition.
   2.27.3. Facilities will be notified by 902 CES/CEOFP prior to any scheduled maintenance
   where power loads are transferred from commercial/installation to generator.
   2.27.4. ATC personnel will be trained by 902 CES/CEOFP annually on manual transfer,
   applicable checklists, and notification procedures.

       4.2.1.4. Standby. No aircraft airborne (locally) and no local launches.
       4.2.1.5. Weather Recall. Recovery of all airborne aircraft back to JBSA-RND. Aircraft
       with least amount of fuel recover first.
       4.2.1.6. Weather Divert. Diversion of airborne aircraft to the designated divert airfield.
       Aircraft with the least amount of fuel divert first.
   4.2.2. Pattern Saturation: ATC may issue full stop instructions due to pattern saturation or
   complexity. ATC will not normally impose any pattern priorities other than those listed in
   this directive.
   4.2.3. Overhead Pattern Break Zones: The normal break zone for initial overhead pattern
   traffic is from the approach end to 3000ft beyond the threshold. ATC may issue adjustments
   to the break zone for spacing and sequencing. If no break point is specified, the Pilot in
   Command (PIC) will break in the normal break zone. If a break point is specified along with
   a sequence/traffic call, it is the PIC‘s obligation to accept the sequence and comply with ATC
   instructions, or to request re-sequencing.
       4.2.3.1. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic
       pattern is permitted when:
           4.2.3.1.1. Approved by ATC.
           4.2.3.1.2. No more than four aircraft are in the flight.
           4.2.3.1.3. Aircraft are in trail by 6000ft or less. (If more than 6000ft aircraft will be
           separate flights).
           4.2.3.1.4. Aircraft may off-set slightly from the RWY in the direction of the break to
           increase lateral separation, but must use caution for aircraft on inside downwind.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                     25


         4.2.3.1.5. Aircraft shall not off-set further West than 5th St East (RWY 14L/32R), or
         further East than 5th St West (RWY 14R/32L).
         4.2.3.1.6. Published overhead pattern altitude will be used.
         4.2.3.1.7. Published airspeeds applicable to the airframe will be flown.
         4.2.3.1.8. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing will be flown.
  4.2.4. Closed Pattern Sequencing: ATC will approve closed traffic requests based on traffic.
  Aircraft requesting closed may be directed to extend their departure leg for sequencing.
  Unless otherwise directed by ATC, pilots upon receipt of approval for closed traffic may pull
  closed immediately.
  4.2.5. Altitude Restricted Low Approaches: A low approach with an altitude restriction of
  not less than 500ft above the field (1300ft MSL) may be authorized except over an aircraft in
  departure position or a departing aircraft. Restricted low approaches may be issued to aircraft
  when vehicles and/or equipment on the RWY or overrun/overruns. Altitude for restricted low
  approach for heavy aircraft will not be less than 1800ft MSL.
  4.2.6. Pattern Delays: Aircrews will advise GC if requesting VFR patterns prior to departing.
  Additionally, aircrews will make initial call to tower with intentions to include the term
  racetrack or patterns.
  4.2.7. Transient Practice Approaches/Patterns: VFR patterns/practice instrument approaches
  by transient military aircraft will be approved, as coordinated between ATC and SOF, on
  case-by-case basis so as to not impede the 12 FTW training mission. Instrument approaches
  by civilian aircraft will not be approved at any time during Wing flying. At other times,
  civilian aircraft are only authorized instrument approaches to a low approach. Contracted
  civilian aircraft authorized to land at Randolph will do so via one approach to a full stop. No
  civilian VFR patterns will be allowed without 12 OG/CC approvals.
  4.2.8. East Pattern Operations: All RWY 14L/32R (East) patterns are flown east of the
  airfield. For T-1/T-38 VFR traffic patterns RWY 14L/32R (East) altitudes, see Table 4.2.
  For transient VFR traffic patterns RWY 14L/32R (East) altitudes, see Table 4.3. VFR Entry
  coordinates are Zuehl: N29 28.181 W098 08.128 and Quarry N 29 40.713 W098 15.320.
     4.2.8.1. Pattern Status:
         4.2.8.1.1. Restricted Pattern/Overhead Open Procedures. Standard pattern entry is
         from an instrument approach, visual approach, or after initial takeoff. Non-standard
         entry requires tower approval prior to cancelling IFR with SAT TRACON. Aircrews
         will not cancel IFR until the approval is obtained.
         4.2.8.1.2. Restricted Pattern/Straight-In Only Procedures. The Randolph traffic
         pattern to RWY 14L/32R is restricted to straight-ins only. Standard pattern entry is
         from an IFR approach or after initial takeoff unless otherwise approved by Randolph
         ATC. ATC may approve low closed patterns. For aircraft established on downwind,
         ATC must approve a straight in approach before aircraft turn base leg. If straight-in is
         denied, ATC should direct re-entry or a 360 turn for spacing; pilots will maintain
         1,800ft until cleared for the straight-in approach. Normally, not more than three
         aircraft are permitted in the pattern at the same time.
 26                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


          4.2.8.1.3. Unrestricted Pattern Procedures: Standard pattern entry is from VFR entry,
          an IFR approach, or after initial takeoff. All portions of pattern open.

Table 4.1. East RWY Pattern Status and Weather Requirements:




Table 4.2. East VFR Pattern Altitudes:




Table 4.3. Transient VFR Pattern Altitudes (East):




      4.2.8.2. Radio Calls: Use full call signs on all radio calls. Expect tower to direct calls to
      pilots using aircraft call signs. However, in certain circumstances, tower may use pattern
      position to address aircraft. Pilots unable to make calls at designated reporting points will
      report actual position as soon as possible. Additionally:
          4.2.8.2.1. Formation aircraft will be treated as a single flight until flight integrity
          (aircraft are split up, on the go, etc.) is no longer required.
          4.2.8.2.2. All clearances and instructions should be acknowledged by the pilot.
      4.2.8.3. Taxi Operations: Request taxi and departure clearance with ATIS code and ramp
      position if other than East Ramp. When taxi clearance is received, pilots will
      acknowledge with CALL SIGN, repeat the assigned RWY, and squawk.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                     27


     4.2.8.4. Hammerhead Operations: After completing before takeoff checklists and when
     ready for departure, pilots will state, CALL SIGN, (patterns/interval/20 second or 1
     minute interval) holding short. In order to minimize radio calls, do not use in sequence or
     number one.
     4.2.8.5. Departure Leg:
        4.2.8.5.1. Aircraft on departure leg or going around on the East side, not cleared
        closed traffic, will turn crosswind between ½ mile and 1 mile past departure end at or
        below 2100ft MSL.
        4.2.8.5.2. Aircraft that were unable to break (i.e. carry initial straight through) will
        turn crosswind at departure end of the RWY at 2600ft MSL.
     4.2.8.6. Outside Downwind Procedures: Pilots will fly the outside downwind track and
     when established will report: outside downwind and state intentions (straight-in or
     initial). The expected response from tower will be: roger or unable, and additional
     instructions if required.
     4.2.8.7. Initial: Pilots will report: CALL SIGN, initial/TAC initial. Tower will respond
     with: CALL SIGN, roger if no conflict exists, issue a sequence or traffic to follow, or
     instruct the pilot to carry initial straight through for conflicts or other priorities.
     4.2.8.8. VFR Straight-In: When requesting a straight in tower will advise the aircraft to
     report Quarry/Zuehl authorizing the aircraft to proceed to Quarry/Zuehl and descend to
     1800ft MSL, unless otherwise instructed.
     4.2.8.9. Breakouts:
        4.2.8.9.1. The pattern status must be unrestricted. Aircraft will avoid Zuehl Airport
        by 1 NM or 1500ft.
        4.2.8.9.2. Breakout from 2,600ft: PIC will initiate a climbing turn away from the
        pattern, maintain 3,100ft until clear of the pattern, maneuver to descend for entry
        through VFR entry point, and report Quarry/Zuehl.
        4.2.8.9.3. Breakouts below 2,600ft: PIC will initiate a turn away from the pattern
        (opposite direction of pattern), maintain 1,800ft until clear of the pattern, maneuver to
        climb for entry through VFR entry point, and report Quarry/Zuehl.
     4.2.8.10. Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures:
        4.2.8.10.1. Missed approaches/go-arounds from straight-in/ILS approaches will be
        made as directed by ATC. Go-arounds from the VFR traffic pattern base leg or final
        turn will offset RWY 14L/32R to the east unless otherwise directed by ATC.
        4.2.8.10.2. Missed approach/go-around aircraft will not over fly aircraft on the RWY.
        Additionally unplanned missed approaches from RWY 14L/32R may be assigned a
        Rerun as a climb-out.
  4.2.9. West Pattern Operations: All RWY 14R/32L (West) patterns are flown west of the
  airfield. For T-6 VFR traffic patterns RWY 14R/32L (West) altitudes, see Table 4.4.
     4.2.9.1. Pattern Status:
 28                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


          4.2.9.1.1. Restricted Pattern Procedures: Standard pattern entry is from an instrument
          approach, visual approach, or after initial takeoff. Maximum aircraft allowed is six. A
          two-ship formation counts as two aircraft. No high breakouts or practice breakouts
          are permitted. Emergency Landing Patterns (ELPs) to low key are allowed provided
          VFR cloud clearances are observed by the pilot. Low breakouts are permitted only to
          avoid conflicts while flying a straight-in. If a conflict exists during pattern re-entry,
          pilot will execute a level, 360 degree turn away from outside downwind and re-enter
          the pattern. Pattern straight-ins are approved by HNG ATC provided adequate
          spacing can be maintained with instrument arrivals, and pattern traffic is minimal.
          4.2.9.1.2. Unrestricted/No High Key Pattern Procedures: Aircraft may enter pattern
          via instrument approach, initial take-off or VFR entry. High Key is closed, but
          aircraft may break to low key.
          4.2.9.1.3. Unrestricted Pattern Procedures: All portions of pattern open. High Key
          will be flown between 3300ft-3800ft MSL.

Table 4.4. West Pattern Status and Weather Requirements

Table 4.5. West VFR Pattern Altitudes:
      4.2.9.2. Radio Calls:
          4.2.9.2.1. Use full call signs on all radio calls. Tower will not normally respond to
          pilot position reports. Expect tower to direct calls to pilots using aircraft call sign.
          However, in certain circumstances, tower may use pattern position to address aircraft.
          Pilots unable to make calls at designated reporting points will report actual position as
          soon as possible.4.2.9.2.2. See Attachment 7 for a list of expected radio calls by
          pattern position.
      4.2.9.3. Taxi Operations: Request taxi and departure clearance with ATIS code and ramp
      position if other than West Ramp. When departing VFR, state the initial heading and
      requested altitude or CALL SIGN, VFR to SRXXX. When clearance is received, pilots will
      acknowledge with: CALL SIGN, repeat the assigned RWY, and squawk.
      4.2.9.4. Hammerhead Operations:
          4.2.9.4.1. After completing before takeoff checklists and when ready for departure,
          pilots will state: CALL SIGN, (patterns/interval/90 second interval) HOLDING
          SHORT. In order to minimize radio calls, do not use: IN SEQUENCE or NUMBER
          ONE. The expected radio call from tower will be: roger or no response.
          4.2.9.4.2. As traffic permits, tower will direct either: CALL SIGN, TAXI UP TO AND
          HOLD SHORT, CALL SIGN, (RWY) (WIND) CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF
          (PATTERNS/INTERVAL as required), or CALL SIGN (RWY) LINE-UP AND WAIT.
          Pilots will acknowledge as required.
          4.2.9.4.3. Pilots will not perform an over-speed governor check with an aircraft in
          front of their aircraft in the up to and hold short position.
      4.2.9.5. Departure leg:
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                   29


        4.2.9.5.1. Aircraft on departure leg, not cleared low key or closed, will turn
        crosswind between .5 mile and 1 mile past departure end.
        4.2.9.5.2. Aircraft offset, not cleared low key or closed, will turn crosswind past
        departure end and before 0.5 mile past departure end. Pilots will add: off-set to radio
        calls if in the offset position.
        4.2.9.5.3. Aircraft that were unable to break (i.e. break point straight through) will
        turn crosswind at departure end of the RWY.
        4.2.9.5.4. All aircraft turning crosswind will remain below 1300ft MSL until clear of
        inside downwind traffic.
        4.2.9.5.5. Tower will use: CALL SIGN, fly RWY heading to help de-conflict departure
        leg. If directed: fly RWY heading continue on RWY heading until given clearance
        form tower, either: CALL SIGN CROSSWIND/ CLOSED/ LOW KEY APPROVED. If
        no clearance is received by 3 miles, aircraft will perform a low breakout and re-enter
        the pattern through VFR entry.
        4.2.9.5.6. Tower will normally de-conflict departure leg from a top down, inside out
        approach.
        4.2.9.5.7. Pilots should not request closed or low key with traffic between initial and
        the break, between 5 and 2 miles on a straight-in/instrument approach, or between
        report high key and low key on ELPs. If the traffic conflict is resolved on the turn to
        crosswind, pilots may make their request by adding turning crosswind to the request.
        If told UNABLE, pilots will turn crosswind at the appropriate point for their departure
        leg. If told STANDBY fly RWY heading and then if no response is received turn
        crosswind by the appropriate point. If told closed approved/report low key, pilots will
        report closed downwind for a closed pattern or high downwind if going to low key.
        For sequencing, pilots will maintain at least 140 KIAS on closed downwind until
        abeam the break zone.
        4.2.9.5.8. Squawk code 1200 in the VFR pattern.
     4.2.9.6. Outside Downwind Procedures:
        4.2.9.6.1. Pilots on outside downwind or VFR entry will report: CALL SIGN,
        REQUEST HIGH KEY to indicate they will fly the pattern ground track to initial for
        high key. The expected response from tower will be: ROGER or no response.
        4.2.9.6.2. Pilots on outside downwind or VFR entry will report: CALL SIGN,
        REQUEST STRAIGHT-IN. Tower will respond CALL SIGN, REPORT 5 MILES or
        CALL SIGN, UNABLE. Tower will not normally approve straight-ins with
        ILS/instrument traffic between 7-12 miles. If cleared straight-in, begin descent when
        crossing IH-35 for RWY 14R or IH-10 for RWY 32L. If the straight-in is not
        approved by 3 NM, pilots will accomplish a low breakout, as depicted in the pattern
        diagram.
        4.2.9.6.3. Aircraft established in the pattern on outside downwind will breakout for
        formations and emergencies entering through VFR entry by climbing to 2300ft MSL
        straight ahead then proceeding to VFR entry.
30                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


     4.2.9.7. Initial:
         4.2.9.7.1. For overhead patterns, pilots will report, CALL SIGN, initial. Tower will
         respond with CALL SIGN, ROGER (if no conflict exists) then pilots can break in the
         break zone, CALL SIGN, CARRY STRAIGHT THROUGH (if a conflict exists) or
         CALL SIGN, STAND-BY (if a conflict exists, but may be eliminated by breakpoint). If
         instructed to: continue pilots will then continue to the break point and report CALL
         SIGN, BREAK POINT STRAIGHT THROUGH unless approved to break by ATC.
         4.2.9.7.2. If requesting high key, pilots will report: CALL SIGN, INITIAL FOR HIGH
         KEY. Tower will either respond: CALL SIGN, REPORT HIGH KEY or CALL SIGN,
         UNABLE HIGH KEY. If told to report high key, pilots will squawk 0400, climb to
         3,300-3,800ft MSL, and report reaching high key. At high key Tower will either
         direct pilots to report low key or orbit. If cleared low key, pilots will proceed to low
         key and report low key with gear position. If told to orbit, pilots will remain at 3,800ft
         MSL, perform an orbit to the west, and return to high key. If told unable high key, the
         above procedures for normal initial/standby will apply.
         4.2.9.7.3. If requesting low key, pilots will report: CALL SIGN, initial for low key.
         Tower will either respond with: CALL SIGN, REPORT LOW KEY or CALL SIGN,
         UNABLE LOW KEY, STANDYBY. The above procedures in paragraph 4.2.9.7.1, for
         STANDBY, will apply.
         4.2.9.7.4. Pilots will not initiate break with traffic between 5 and 2 miles on a
         straight-in/instrument approach, or with traffic between report high key and low key
         on ELPs.
     4.2.9.8. Emergency Landing Pattern (ELP):
         4.2.9.8.1. The following restrictions apply to ELPs:
             4.2.9.8.1.1. ELP‘s shall only be authorized for 12 FTW T-6 aircraft.
             4.2.9.8.1.2. ELP operations shall only be approved between sunrise and sunset.
             4.2.9.8.1.3. RND/HNG Tower and/or SAT TRACON may, at any time, before or
             after start of the maneuver, terminate ELP operations due to traffic or other
             limitations.
         4.2.9.8.2. Weather requirements for ELP operations are ceiling must be at least 500ft
         above the approved High Key or Low Key altitude and both, flight and surface
         visibility shall be 5 miles or greater.
         4.2.9.8.3. 12 FTW aircraft conducting ELPs from High Key shall squawk 0400.
         4.2.9.8.4. Pilots established in the pattern should not request direct to high key with
         more than 2 aircraft in the pattern.
             4.2.9.8.4.1. When authorized by RND/HNG Tower, aircraft shall proceed to High
             Key, overhead the RWY, at an altitude not to exceed 3,800ft MSL (unless
             otherwise approved by SAT TRACON).
             4.2.9.8.4.2. Pilots can request direct High Key from any pattern position.
             Maintain at or below 2800ft MSL until within 2NM or 14R/32L unless approved
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                       31


             by SAT during VFR return to RND. Target airspeed at High Key is 125 KIAS,
             not to exceed 150 KIAS. Direction of turns shall be as directed by RND/HNG
             Tower to contain the maneuver within the 2 NM maneuvering airspace.
             4.2.9.8.4.3. Normally, only one aircraft will be allowed to orbit at high key.
             4.2.9.8.4.4. With an aircraft orbiting at high key, pilots should not request closed
             or low key and should expect to go break point straight through if on initial.
             Tower will be directive if needed to de-conflict.
             4.2.9.8.4.5. High Key will not be approved unless within 2NM of RWY
             14R/32L.
             4.2.9.8.4.6. After passing High Key and cleared by tower, turn and descend to
             Low Key (abeam the RWY) at 2,300ft MSL, remaining within the 2 NM
             maneuvering airspace.
         4.2.9.8.5. If the maneuver will be made to RWY 14L/32R (week-ends, non-mission
         flying, or single RWY only) the maneuver/requirements are the same as above except
         the maneuver will be contained within 2NM east of RWY 14L/32R.
      4.2.9.9. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC): T-6 AHC profiles may only be
      conducted in the HNG Traffic Pattern.
         4.2.9.9.1. No other aircraft are permitted in the West Pattern, no arrivals and no
         departures during AHC profiles.
         4.2.9.9.2. Profiles may only be flown by 12FTW aircraft during daylight VMC.
         4.2.9.9.3. Pilots will proceed direct Low Key, Base Key, or Final from any of the
         Zones depicted in Figure 4.5
         4.2.9.9.4. Straight-In ELPs will fly the 90 to initial ground track.
         4.2.9.9.5. Aircraft will remain within the HNG portion of the Class Delta Surface
         Area.
         4.2.9.9.6. Pilots are required to report Low Key, Base Key, or Final as appropriate
         and will receive an ATC clearance.
         4.2.9.9.7. Controllers should expect late landing gear extractions and longer
         touchdown points.

Figure 4.5. AHC Zones.
      4.2.9.10. Final Procedures:
         4.2.9.10.1. Pilots will report gear down for overhead patterns/straight-ins and add
         low key, gear down for ELPs. Tower will respond with CALL SIGN, (RWY) (Wind)
         cleared touch and go. Pilots will acknowledge tower with CALL SIGN. Touch and go
         landing is the default.
         4.2.9.10.2. To indicate full stop, pilots will report the amount of fuel on board after
         the initial, high key, high downwind, closed downwind, or 5 mile point as appropriate
         (i.e. CALL SIGN, 5 miles, 500). Pilots will also add full stop to the gear down call (i.e.
32                                                               12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


        CALL SIGN, 2 miles, gear down, full stop). Tower will respond with CALL SIGN,
        (RWY) (Wind) cleared to land. Pilots will acknowledge all landing clearances.
        4.2.9.10.3. If required, tower may direct a go around (i.e. CALL SIGN, go around).
        Pilots will acknowledge with CALL SIGN, initiate a go around, and climb or descend
        to 1300ft MSL until initiating closed or turning crosswind and clear of inside
        downwind traffic. Pilots will normally off-set to the West, if necessary.
     4.2.9.11. Landing roll: The east half of the RWY is considered the cold side and the west
     side is considered the hot side. Full stops should be accomplished on the cold side when
     possible. If an aircraft full stops on the hot side the pilot will clear the cold side and make
     an advisory call stating, CALL SIGN centerline cross. No response required from tower.
     4.2.9.12. Breakouts:
        4.2.9.12.1. Pilots will attain breakout altitude (Low-1300ft MSL/High-2300ft MSL)
        before crossing any pattern ground track. Do not execute a high breakout when
        pattern is restricted.
        4.2.9.12.2. Aircraft will not breakout in the final turn, or inside 2 NM on a straight-in
        (go-around instead, offset as necessary).
        4.2.9.12.3. Aircraft will breakout at the perch if a straight-in aircraft inside of 2 NM
        is not in sight or if insufficient spacing exists.
        4.2.9.12.4. Ground tracks and climbs and descents for breakouts/reentry are depicted
        in Attachment 4 and Attachment 5.
        4.2.9.12.5. Aircraft will maneuver to re-enter at the VFR entry point at pattern
        altitude and airspeed. When breaking out report CALL SIGN, (Location), breaking
        out. While maneuvering to VFR entry, use caution for towers, other breakout traffic
        (low and high) and pattern entries from Truckstop.
     4.2.9.13. Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures:
        4.2.9.13.1. Missed approaches/go-arounds from straight-in/ILS approaches will be
        made as directed by ATC. Go-arounds from the VFR traffic pattern base leg or final
        turn will offset to the west unless otherwise directed by ATC.
        4.2.9.13.2. Missed approach/go-around aircraft will not over fly aircraft on the RWY.
        Additionally unplanned missed approaches from RWY 14R/32L may be assigned a
        Rerun as a climb-out.
     4.2.9.14. Pattern Entry:
        4.2.9.14.1. Pilots initial contact with Hangover tower should include the aircraft
        position (SPUR or approaching Truckstop, VFR entry, or high-key) and will be
        acknowledged by the tower. Subsequent position reports will not normally be
        acknowledged.
        4.2.9.14.2. Pilots returning to the pattern VFR may request to enter the pattern via
        direct high key, Truckstop/Karnes (as appropriate) or VFR entry. Tower will be
        directive for sequencing when requesting high key.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                       33


          4.2.9.14.3. Pilots entering at Karnes and desiring radar initial will state: CALL SIGN,
          Karnes Tower will acknowledge and the pilot will proceed to radar initial at 1800ft
          MSL. At 5 miles, pilots will report: CALL SIGN, radar initial. At 2 miles pilots
          report: CALL SIGN, initial and normal pattern initial procedures apply.
          4.2.9.14.4. Pilots entering at Karnes and desiring high key will make their request at
          radar initial: CALL SIGN, radar initial, for high key. Normal initial for high key
          procedures will then apply.
          4.2.9.14.5. Pilots entering at Karnes and desiring a straight-in will state: CALL SIGN,
          Karnes request straight in. Tower will respond: CALL SIGN, straight in approved or
          CALL SIGN, unable. If told: approved, pilots will descend to 1300ft MSL by 5 miles
          and report: CALL SIGN, 5 miles. Plan to arrive at the 5 NM point at 150 KIAS to aid
          in sequencing. At 2 NM, report: gear down. If the straight-in is not approved by the 3
          NM point, execute a low breakout. If told unable, pilots will proceed to radar initial
          and follow the above procedures for radar initial.
          4.2.9.14.6. Aircraft arriving via Karnes and overtaking ILS/instrument traffic to 32L
          will off-set to the East (no further than 5th St West) if the traffic is in sight. If the
          preceding traffic is not in sight, tower will be directive in deconflicting traffic.
          4.2.9.14.7. If the pattern is open when flying an instrument approach, make the five
          miles radar and two mile call to provide situational awareness to the pilots in the
          pattern.
      4.2.9.15. Pattern Departure: Pilots will request departure by adding: departing to the last
      two radio calls in the pattern. Expect departure clearance after the gear down call. If
      making the request at any other point, tower will explicitly approve or deny the request.
      For RWY 32L, either the Falls or outside downwind departure will be used. Pilots will
      query the tower if there is any doubt on which departure is in use. Pilots will call
      departing and change frequency on departure leg when 1 mile past departure end for
      RWY 14R or when passing IH-10 for RWY 32L outside downwind departure
      procedures.
      4.2.9.16. High Pattern: Weather permitting; the high pattern is used for emergencies or
      as required. Pilots requiring the high pattern will notify tower and follow normal pattern
      ground tracks. Tower may be able to obtain clearance for altitudes above the high pattern
      altitude if needed. ELPs will be discontinued when the high pattern is in use.
4.3. Special Procedures:
   4.3.1. VFR Transitions: Except where specified below, VFR transitions or loitering within
   the confines of Randolph‘s Class D are not authorized during 12 FTW pattern operations.
   4.3.2. Air Ambulance Transitions: Only aircraft on priority missions will be allowed to
   transition with aircraft in the pattern.
      4.3.2.1. Transitions are normally conducted east to west/west to east at midfield at or
      below 1300ft MSL.
      4.3.2.2. Pilots shall advise HNG/RND ATC if unable to cross at midfield or comply with
      the altitude restriction and state their intended route of flight and altitude.
 34                                                               12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


      4.3.2.3. ATC will normally restrict pattern operations at or above 1800ft MSL until
      priority missions are clear of traffic.
      4.3.2.4. If ATC is unable to limit certain operations, traffic information shall be
      exchanged.
   4.3.3. San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) Transitions: SAPD will be allowed to
   transition Randolph‘s Class D airspace VFR when in pursuit or in surveillance of suspects.
   ATC will normally restrict pattern operations to altitude 500ft above/below until priority
   missions are not a conflict and/or traffic information is issued.
   4.3.4. Pipeline Patrol Transitions: Pipeline Patrol flights provide a crucial public safety
   service and rarely effect 12FTW operations. The following procedures apply:
      4.3.4.1. All Pipeline patrol flights will be queried on their profile.
      4.3.4.2. ATC shall advise Pipeline aircraft to maintain at or below 1300ft MSL.
      4.3.4.3. Traffic advisories will be issued.
      4.3.4.4. ATC will issue restrictions to pattern aircraft when the potential for a conflict
      between Pipeline and pattern aircraft exists.
   4.3.5. Functional Check Flight (FCF): FCF aircraft will normally fly standard mission
   profiles and require no special handling. NOTE: Standard takeoff for FCF aircraft is a static
   departure. ATC will not solicit rolling/immediate takeoffs from FCF aircraft.
   4.3.6. Protection of the Overhead Traffic Patterns: Wing aircraft departing RWY 14L/32R
   (East) will maintain at or below 2100ft until departure end to protect aircraft in the overhead
   pattern. Wing aircraft departing RWY 14R/32L (West) will maintain at or below 1300ft until
   departure end to protect aircraft in the overhead pattern. ATC will issue departure restrictions
   to all other aircraft as necessary.
   4.3.7. Maximum Performance or Unrestricted Climbs: The PIC shall request max or
   unrestricted climbs on initial contact with GC and state altitude requested. Clearance for an
   unrestricted climb is not clearance for ground track deviations. Air Traffic Controllers will
   ensure protection of the overhead pattern.
   4.3.8. Unusual Maneuvers: ATC shall not solicit or approve any requests for a pilot to
   conduct unusual maneuvers within the Class D airspace. Unusual maneuvers include
   unnecessarily low passes, unscheduled flybys, practice instrument approaches to altitudes
   below specified minima (unless a landing or touch-and-go is to be made). ATC shall report
   unusual maneuvers to the AOF/CC.
4.4. Reduced Same RWY Separation (RSRS) Procedures: These procedures may be applied
to AETC aircraft and aircraft flown by the 415 FLTF.
   4.4.1. Similar trainer-type RSRS may only be applied to T-6/T-38 aircraft using alternate
   RWY side procedures. See Table 4.6 for RSRS distances for similar type aircraft operations.
      4.4.1.1. Use of alternate RWY side procedures is an aircrew responsibility. T-1 aircraft
      do not use alternating RWY side procedures. For T-1 following T-1, RSRS separation is
      6000ft and airborne.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                       35


       4.4.1.2. When alternate RWY side procedures are not or cannot be employed, the
       minimum RSRS is 6000ft in all cases.
       4.4.1.3. If both formation aircraft are positioned on the cold (exit) side of the RWY,
       RSRS of 3000ft may be applied between a landing formation and a subsequent arriving
       full stop/low approach single aircraft.

Table 4.6. RSRS Distances for Similar Trainer-Type Aircraft Operations:
   4.4.2. Dissimilar trainer-type aircraft are defined as a mix of different trainer airframes; for
   example, T-38/T-6, T-1/T-38. RSRS for dissimilar trainer-type aircraft is 6000ft and
   minimum in all cases.
   4.4.3. RSRS is not authorized for a departure following a full stop. Preceding arrival aircraft
   must be off the RWY.
   4.4.4. When the RWY is wet, the minimum RSRS is 6000ft in all cases.
   4.4.5. RSRS is not authorized if either aircraft is an emergency.
   4.4.6. RSRS for T-1 behind T-1 is always 6000ft.
4.5. Intersection Departures: Intersection departures are authorized with ATC approval.
 36                                                               12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


                                           Chapter 5

                                      IFR PROCEDURES

5.1. Radar Traffic Patterns: SAT TRACON provides approach control services to JBSA-
RND. All requests for radar traffic patterns must be coordinated with and approved by SAT
TRACON. Aircraft in RND/HNG VFR patterns requesting radar traffic patterns will be
coordinated and transferred to SAT TRACON for radar pick-up and vectors.
5.2. Local Departure Procedures:
   5.2.1. Rolling takeoff solicitation will only be used as necessary by ATC to expedite the
   traffic flow. The PIC is the final authority to accept or reject the rolling takeoff request. ATC
   will use the following phraseology when clearing an aircraft for a rolling takeoff: CALL
   SIGN wind, RWY other information as necessary) cleared for takeoff, rolling.
   5.2.2. Controlled Departure Time (CDT): ATC will attempt to accommodate CDT
   departures. Pilots should add CDT to the remarks section of the flight plan if applicable.
   Requests for CDTs shall be made prior to taxi. If prior notification through clearance
   delivery or GC is not received, CDTs may be denied or delayed.
   5.2.3. Element Departures: When requesting takeoff clearance, aircraft conducting element
   departures will advise ATC of the time interval desired.
   5.2.4. Interval Departures: Interval departures will be coordinated as specified in the
   RND/SAT TRACON LOA 20 seconds or 1 minute for T-38s and T-1s, or 90 seconds for T-
   6s.
   5.2.5. Abbreviated Departure Clearances: Abbreviated departure clearances are authorized
   for 12 FTW assigned aircraft on a stereo departure. As a minimum, CALL SIGN, assigned
   stereo route, and squawk will be issued. EXAMPLE: Boar 33 cleared to Randolph via the
   East T One, squawk 4243.
   5.2.6. Feed-on take-offs (rolling): T-1s only. When calling for clearance for a flight of two
   T-1s inform the controller that it will be a feed-on formation take-off. When cleared for take-
   off the first T-1 will proceed onto the RWY and initiate the departure procedure. When the
   15-second separation time has elapsed, the second T-1 will enter the runway, perform a
   rolling take-off, and complete their departure procedure.
5.3. Radar Vectors to Initial Procedures: All requests for radar vectors must be coordinated
with and approved by SAT TRACON. Aircraft requesting radar vectors to initial will be
coordinated and transferred to SAT TRACON for radar pick-up.
5.4. Auto Termination of IFR Services. IFR services are terminated 5 NM from RWY for 12
FTW/415th FLTF conducting an instrument approach when the pattern status is
Restricted/Overhead or better for RND or Restricted or better for HNG.
   5.4.1. In the event of a missed approach/go around aircraft must remain VFR.
   5.4.2. Aircraft that are departing on the IFR portion of their flight plan and those executing
   additional radar approaches are exempt from this procedure.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                    37


   5.4.3. Pilots are responsible for notifying ATC if unable to terminate IFR prior to the auto-
   termination point. In this case services will continue to touchdown/missed approach, and
   ATC will coordinate with the SOF to revise the pattern status.
   5.4.4. Aircraft on an instrument approach may request Initial when able to proceed VFR. If
   approved to report Initial IFR services are automatically terminated
   5.4.5. ATC must advise SAT TRACON via verbal coordination whenever the status of Auto
   Termination changes.
5.5. VMC Drag/Radar in Trail. Pilots will inform SAT TRACON of intent to drag on initial
contact. Drag procedure will occur at approximately 8 NM final. Trailing aircraft will remain
within 1 mile in trail of lead aircraft.
 38                                                                  12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014

                                EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

6.1. Operation of the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and Secondary Crash Net
(SCN): The following procedures shall be applied for operations at JBSA-RND and reported
operations at Seguin Auxiliary field. RND ATC shall activate their PCAS upon notification of
incidents at Seguin. Seguin RCSs will notify RND ATC via the direct line to the SOF. The SCN
will be activated whenever the PCAS is activated with the exception of maintenance checks.
Agencies Authorized on the PCAS: See Table 6.1. Agencies Authorized on the Secondary Crash
Net: see Table 6.2.
   6.1.1. PCAS activation is required when:
       6.1.1.1. An emergency or physiological incident is suspected or declared by the PIC,
       ATC, SOF or other competent authority.
       6.1.1.2. An aircraft engages a barrier (other than planned engagement).
       6.1.1.3. An aircraft has made a forced landing or is about to do so.
       6.1.1.4. An aircrew has made an emergency egress or is about to do so.
       6.1.1.5. The need for ground rescue of an aircrew appears likely.
       6.1.1.6. Hot brakes are suspected or declared.
       6.1.1.7. Aircraft hijacking is suspected or is in progress.
       6.1.1.8. Any unauthorized aircraft movement (landing, taxiing, etc.) is observed or
       reported.
       6.1.1.9. An aircraft departs a RWY or TWY surface.
       6.1.1.10. Control tower evacuation.
       6.1.1.11. Control tower duress.
       6.1.1.12. A base disaster or exercise (as applicable).
       6.1.1.13. NORDO aircraft (unless a Wing aircraft, and it can be determined it has no
       additional problems and requires no assistance, and is accompanied by a chase aircraft).
       6.1.1.14. Any other situation or circumstance observed by ATC that requires the
       immediate attention of Base/Wing authorities.
   6.1.2. ATC will provide all available information when the PCAS is activated. If available,
   forward the following information as a minimum:
       6.1.2.1. CALL SIGN, tail number, and type aircraft.
       6.1.2.2. Nature of the emergency.
       6.1.2.3. Pilot’s intentions.
       6.1.2.4. Fuel status.
          6.1.2.5. Number of personnel on board.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                       39

       6.1.2.7. ETA.
       6.1.2.8. Wind data.
       6.1.2.9. Any other pertinent information (ordnance, hazardous cargo [line number],
       suspected hydrazine leak, EPU activation etc.).
   6.1.3. Upon receipt of further information pertinent to the situation, ATC may reinitiate the
   PCAS or pass the information via the crash net or directly to the affected agency.
   6.1.4. If applicable, location of the crash site in the most easily understood terms or grid
   coordinates.
   6.1.5. If there is any doubt that a given situation constitutes a potential or actual emergency,
   the PCAS will be activated.
   6.1.6. The PCAS daily check will be initiated by both towers separately at approximately
   0800L. SCN daily check will be initiated by AM immediately following the PCAS daily
   check. SCN back-up procedures will be checked quarterly.
   6.1.7. Following a PCAS activation, the SCN will be activated and all available information
   will be passed verbatim. If SCN circuit is inoperative, AM will use the alternate SCN
   conference circuit to notify each office.

Table 6.1. Agencies Authorized on PCAS.




Table 6.2. Agencies Authorized on SCN.




6.2. Emergency Response Procedures: AM responds to all IFE/ground emergencies (GE).
AM will immediately respond to any IFE and hold short of the respective approach end of the
intended landing RWY. AM will respond to ATC instructions and stand-by until determination is
 40                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


made that a Foreign Object Damage (FOD) check is or is not required. Certain in-flight
emergencies do not pose a realistic FOD hazard and therefore should not require a RWY FOD
check upon landing. Examples include emergency or minimum fuel, simple fuel system
problems, electrical problems with instrumentation, pitot static problems, or any other minor
situation that poses no significant risk of FOD. In these situations, the SOF may waive the
requirement for a FOD check. Emergencies such as catastrophic engine, landing gear, hydraulic,
structural, or brake system problems and bird strikes will require a RWY FOD check
immediately after the suspect aircraft lands. Additionally, any time an emergency response
vehicle enters the RWY, a RWY FOD check will be accomplished. In these situations the SOF
may delay the requirement for a FOD check to recover Wing aircraft to full stops only to
preclude the creation of additional emergencies such as emergency fuel. AM will be released
ASAP when the decision is made that a FOD check is not required. AM vehicles will not be
positioned between any crash or rescue vehicle and the landing RWY or GE. AM does not
respond to off base emergencies.
   6.2.1. If directed to accomplish a FOD check, AM will respond expeditiously to complete
   the check and remain well clear of any and all other response vehicles. As a minimum, AM
   will complete the FOD check from the approach end of the landing RWY to the first
   available TWY past where the aircraft exited the RWY or to the nearest TWY that will allow
   AM to exit the RWY expeditiously.
   6.2.2. Designation and responsibilities of the Incident Commander: Senior Fire Officer
   (SFO) will normally be or assume designation/responsibility as the Incident Commander.
   Depending upon the nature and extent of the emergency, the SFO will maintain or relinquish
   the designation of Incident Commander and comply with the responsibilities identified in
   JBSA-RND PLAN 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan.
6.3. Evacuation Alarms: Evacuation alarms are installed at each localizer and glideslope site
at Randolph. In the event of an IFE, the control tower will activate the evacuation alarm as
necessary and leave in the on position until the emergency aircraft has landed and no longer
poses a threat.
   6.3.1. Meteorological and Navigation Maintenance (METNAV) will coordinate evacuation
   alarm checks on a weekly basis (normally on Friday).
6.4. Emergency Jettison of External Stores: Aircraft requiring jettison of external stores will
plan on using the area 8000ft x 400ft east of, adjacent to, and parallel to RWY 14L/32R.
   6.4.1. Jettison operations will be supervised and monitored by the SOF. The SOF, along with
   the aircrew and tower, shall visually confirm the jettison area is clear of all personnel. Tower
   shall issue the wind direction and velocity.
   6.4.2. Emergency aircraft shall commence dropping external stores upon crossing the
   airfield boundaries and stop upon reaching midfield. Multiple passes may be necessary to
   jettison all stores. All passes will be flown at 500ft AGL. NOTE: No live armament or
   ordinance will be dropped on JBSA-RND.
6.5. Fuel Dumping: Aircraft requesting fuel dumping will receive radar services, be instructed
when to begin fuel dump, and be separated from other aircraft by SAT TRACON.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                           41


6.6. Emergency Arresting/Barrier Gear Procedures: ATC will raise the BAK-15 IAW
FAAO 7110.65 when requested by aircrew, when directed by SOF, and when a NORDO T-38
aircraft is approaching to land.
6.7. Hot Brake Area and Procedures: Aircraft with hot brakes will be parked on TWY A1/A6
or TWY G1/G6. The PIC will notify ATC of suspected hot brakes upon landing or taxiing and, if
able, proceed to the Hot Brake Area. ATC will activate the PCAS and route all ground traffic
away from the aircraft.
6.8. Abandonment of Aircraft:
   6.8.1. Controlled Bailout Area: The controlled bailout area is DHK104/23 DME (SAT
   108/35 DME). Recommended altitude is 10,000ft MSL.
   6.8.2. Location Notification: Crews should attempt to relay information on location as soon
   as possible.
   6.8.3. Plotting Aircraft Coordinates: When ATC can approximately determine the location
   of the abandoned aircraft they will plot grid map coordinates from left to right then bottom to
   top. Using the overlay, determine the smaller grid in question and pass the information
   stating main grid followed by sub grid. NOTE: RND crash grid map is considered the
   master. 902 MSG/CEX Emergency Management is the OPR, 12 OSS/OSA is a required
   signer and will notify TERPS specialist of any changes/updates.
6.9. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/ELT Response Procedures: HNG and Seguin
RCS will notify RND ATC of any emergency signals received. RND ATC shall advise AM and
SAT TRACON of received signals. AM shall notify Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center
(ZHU), and appropriate base agencies to attempt to locate the source of the signal. ATC shall
notify AM when the signals are no longer received.
6.10. Hung Ordnance Procedures: In the event that an aircraft with hung ordnance lands at
JBSA-RND, it will be parked on TWY A6 or TWY G6 pointed away from populated areas or
heading 145 parallel to the RWY. AM will immediately notify CP to request assistance from
JBSA-Lackland Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)/Munitions.
6.11. Wind Limitations on Control Towers: The wind limitation for both towers is 89 knots.
ATC will evacuate facilities when the wind velocity reaches 50 knots.
6.12. Evacuation of ATC and AM Operations Facilities: ATC facilities will be evacuated for
bomb threat, fire, high winds, natural disaster, or as deemed necessary by ATC. If either facility
becomes disabled or is evacuated during Wing flying, the remaining facility will commandeer
the evacuating facility‘s frequencies, assume control of all air traffic, and implement Single
RWY Procedures (SRP). To the maximum extent possible, the evacuating facility will smoothly
transfer aircraft under its control to the operational tower. In addition, the evacuating facility will
initiate PCAS.
   6.12.1. If either facility evacuates when it is the only operational facility, ATC will
   broadcast their intentions on all available communications prior to departure. ATC will
   proceed to the opposite facility and immediately notify all appropriate agencies.
   6.12.2. If the evacuation is for high winds, ATC will notify SAT TRACON and AM that the
   facilities are being evacuated due to high winds. ATC will contact AM as soon as safely
   possible as to their whereabouts and condition and AM will issue appropriate NOTAMs. All
 42                                                               12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


   possible service will be provided to any air traffic prior to the evacuation. If both facilities
   are being evacuated, transfer control of traffic to SAT TRACON.
      6.12.2.1. ATC will transmit (Name) Tower is being evacuated due to high winds on all
      tower frequencies.
   6.12.3. When a decision to evacuate is made, all personnel in the tower will proceed to a
   location as directed by the CIC. In the event it is determined a safe departure from the facility
   is not possible, personnel will remain in the lowest, most enclosed portion of the facility. At
   no time shall any person delay evacuation based on traffic, inability to make notifications, or
   indecisiveness. All personnel must be evacuated in a safe and timely fashion without
   exception.
   6.12.4. Upon returning to the facility, ATC shall initiate opening checklists and account for
   all personnel. ATC shall immediately report facility damage, unaccounted personnel, or other
   operational disability to appropriate agencies. AM will conduct checks to re-open the airfield,
   if required.
   6.12.5. Evacuation of AM: AM will be evacuated for bomb threat, fire, or as deemed
   necessary by any on duty personnel. Activate the SCN and notify ATC. AM will evacuate to
   the 12 OSS Bldg 740. The following actions will be taken:
      6.12.5.1. If time permits, make notification of relocation action.
      6.12.5.2. After relocating, AM will contact all SCN agencies by phone or backup SCN
      and advise AM and WX (if appropriate) have relocated.
   6.12.6. Resuming operations at primary facilities:
      6.12.6.1. In the event evacuation of any facility was made due to fire, bomb, or security
      threat, ATC and AM will not return to any facility until authorized to do so by the on-
      scene commander.
      6.12.6.2. If evacuation was due to high wind, operations will not resume until surface
      wind velocity is less than 40 knots for at least 15 continuous minutes (ATC only).
      6.12.6.3. Facilities will be thoroughly inspected for damage. If there is reason to believe
      that the structure may be unsafe, normal operations will not normally be resumed until
      the structure has been evaluated by CE.
6.13. Single RWY Procedures (SRP).
   6.13.1. Both towers equally share the responsibility for coordination and sequencing aircraft
   to the open RWY. The following procedures will apply for control transfer of aircraft
   established in or entering the pattern:
      6.13.1.1. For aircraft established in each pattern (west and east) the tower initiating
      single-RWY procedures will retain control of aircraft and effect transfer of control of
      each aircraft to the open RWY tower. Normally this will occur on downwind, after
      coordination and sequencing with the open RWY tower and after eliminating potential
      conflicts with straight-in traffic.
      6.13.1.2. If the pattern status is Closed, the tower initiating single-RWY procedures will
      coordinate climb out for aircraft on final and transfer control with SAT TRACON.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                        43


       6.13.1.3. T-6/T-1A/T-38 Recovery Procedures. Aircraft recovering via the overhead
       pattern will enter their respective pattern as normal, call fuel on initial, and fly straight
       through unless directed to break. ATC coordination will follow if necessary. NOTE: If
       required to enter the pattern via an instrument approach (restricted/closed pattern), expect
       sequencing delays and a possible divert.
       6.13.1.4. Both Patterns Closed. All aircraft will recover via an instrument approach to
       the open RWY.
       6.13.1.5. ATC, in conjunction with the SOF, may restrict takeoffs until all aircraft that
       normally would have recovered to the closed RWY have landed. ATC/SOF may direct
       full-stop landings. Wing aircraft will follow procedures located in in-flight guides for
       Single-RWY Operations and carry the appropriate fuel.
       6.13.1.6. ATC will contact AM to monitor aircraft crossing and road traffic at the south
       cross over to ensure traffic stops for the aircraft if AM manning permits.
6.14. Flameout Procedures: Emergency flameout patterns will be as directed by SAT
TRACON based on pilot request. Simulated Flameout Operations are not authorized at
Randolph.
6.15. Alternate Facilities Procedures: RND ATC tower is the alternate facility for HNG
tower, and Hangover tower is the alternate facility for Randolph tower. Alternate facility
procedures are established only for recovery of airborne wing aircraft as defined in the tower
evacuation procedures defined in Para 6.12
6.16. Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft: The base response to hijack or theft attempts is outlined in
the Integrated Defense Plan.
   6.16.1. ATC responsibilities are limited to immediately activating the PCAS, issuing current
   position information, and assisting the Incident Commander by forwarding updated
   information and relaying any orders or instructions.
6.17. Mishap and Incident Reporting Procedures: All reportable incidents as identified in
AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force
Mishap Prevention Program, using AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, or AF IMT 651,
Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), as appropriate.
   6.17.1. Notification of a Mishap or Incident (HATR, CMAV, etc) will be made to
   AETC/A3OF IAW AFI 91-202 and AFI 13-204, V3, AETC Sup 1 within 24 hours. AF IMT
   651 will be submitted to Wing Safety within 24 hours. AF IMT 457 will be reported to Wing
   Safety within 24 hours.
   6.17.2. AOF personnel will not release the names of individuals allegedly involved in an
   aircraft incident or accident to agencies outside US Air Force Channels. The AOF/CC is the
   custodian of all recorded records in the towers and AMOPS. The ATM and AFM will only
   release recorded data to the AOF/CC.
   6.17.3. The CIC will accomplish the following tasks:
       6.17.3.1. If you suspect a controller may have contributed to the mishap, have the

9.2. NOTAM Procedures: Airfield Management is the primary NOTAM transmission agency
and will accomplish NOTAM action IAW AFI 11-208, Department of Defense Notice to Airmen
(NOTAM) System, and document actions on AF IMT 3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation.
AM will notify ATC of all NOTAMs that affect aerodrome operations and the ATC area of
jurisdiction by telephone. RND ATC is designated the primary NOTAM monitoring facility.
ATC will verify NOTAMs prior to airfield opening by accessing the NOTAM web site
(https://www.notams.jcs.mil/).
9.3. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Accounts, Procedures for Requesting
Changes: AM is the wing account manager who approves, issues, and distributes products and
requests NGA FLIP related products and associated items to wing agencies. Agencies order
requirements through AM according to AFI 11-201, Flight Information Publication, AFI 14-205,
Geospatial Information and Services (GI&S), and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
(NGA) Catalog of Maps, Charts, and Related Products.
   9.3.1. Requests for changes to FLIPs will be forwarded to the AM, instrument procedural
   changes should be forwarded to TERPS and changes to Special Use Airspace and published
   training routes should be routed to 12 OSS/OSOA.
   9.3.2. FTS may establish independent accounts with NGA through the AM. Once
   established with NGA, FTS will create an Automatic Distribution (AD) of requirements IAW
   Basis of Distribution Table located in NGA catalog. Product requirements not on the AD, or
   one-time orders, will be submitted in coordination with the AM.
   9.3.3. Agencies receiving AD products will revalidate requirements when requested by the
   AM. Quantities are established using NGA ordering criteria, published requirements and
   mission objectives. Units will request changes between review cycles in writing to the AM.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                     53


   9.3.4. FTS establish requirements needed to maintain and issue FLIP IAW Basis of
   Distribution Table located in NGA catalog. AM does not maintain or supply FLIP for issue
   to local aircrews.
   9.3.5. Academic training units, as well as FTS, can obtain outdated FLIP products for
   training purposes by submitting a written request to the AFM. All parties obtaining outdated
   publications will ensure those products are marked as Out-of Date and For Training Use
   Only. ATC shall not use any out of date products.
9.4. Waivers to Airfield/Airspace Criteria:
   9.4.1. Requests for waivers to airfield, terminal airspace, and TERPS criteria should be
   submitted to 902 MSG/CEAOP. All requests for Airfield and Airspace waivers will be
   coordinated with 12 OSS/OSA, 12 OSS/OSAT, and 12 OSS/OSAA prior to submission. 902
   MSG/CEAOP will provide a copy of all approved waivers to 12 OSS/OSAA. 12 OSS/OSAA
   will maintain a file copy of all approved waivers.
   9.4.2. The 12 OSS/OSOA (Airspace Manager) is responsible for all waiver requests and
   FLIP changes for Special Use Airspace/Airspace for Special Use and Aerial Events (e.g. Air
   Shows, Fly Bys, MOAs, etc.).
   9.4.3. Number and Status of Permanent/Temporary Waivers will be reported in the Airfield
   Operations Board Minutes quarterly.
9.5. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures: JBSA-RND requires the PIC landing at
the airfield to request prior permission before filing. PPR numbers will only be issued by AM.
EXCEPTIONS: Aircraft carrying a Distinguish Visitor Code 6 or higher or aircraft experiencing
an emergency. Aero medical Evacuation (AIREVAC) or Special Air Missions (SAM) are also
exempt from OBO/PPR restrictions, but are required to obtain a PPR number for tracking and
notification.
   9.5.1. Unless an emergency exists, ATC will not issue a landing clearance to civilian aircraft
   unless a PPR number is issued by AM or approval is received from the 12 FTW/CC. AM will
   pass inbound and outbound information to ATC for all transient aircraft.
   9.5.2. With the exception of use as an IFR alternate or as a destination for Special Air
   Missions (SAM) or Special Air Resource aircraft carrying Code 5 or higher persons, all PIC
   must obtain a PPR number.
9.6. Arriving Air Evacuation (Air Evac) Notification and Response Procedures: ATC shall
notify AM of any unscheduled inbound Air Evac aircraft ASAP after learning of the operation.
ATC shall provide AM a 15-mile call for all Air Evac arrivals. Upon PIC request – as passed by
ATC or directly via Pilot-to-Dispatch (PTD) – AM shall coordinate rescue protection standby
with Fire and Emergency Services. AM shall notify Fire and Emergency Services of any
proposed Air Evac departures requesting Fire and Emergency Services standby.
9.7. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals:
   9.7.1. Military aircraft arriving at JBSA-RND without prior notification to AM are
   considered No Flight Plan (FPNO). ATC shall assist AM in determining the aircraft‘s point
   of origin and intentions, consistent with higher priority duties.
 54                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


   9.7.2. Landing at Randolph (or Seguin Auxiliary) without prior notification to AM is
   unauthorized. Unless an emergency exists, ATC will not issue a landing clearance to the
   aircraft. ATC will initiate the PCAS upon landing of a non-authorized aircraft, or upon any
   suspicious civil aircraft operation. NOTE: Seguin will notify RND SOF immediately. RND
   SOF will inform ATC.
9.8. Distinguished Visitor Notification Procedures: AM will notify ATC, CP, TA, and the
appropriate protocol office of inbound and outbound aircraft carrying DVs. AM will in turn
notify CP and TA.
   9.8.1. Aircraft will normally park directly in front of AM on the DV line. Airfield
   Management (AM) personnel will establish contact, via a telephone call or a face-to-face
   meeting, with Transient Alert (TA) personnel at an agreed upon time each flying day,
   including weekends, to discuss the daily DV/transient aircraft schedule and proposed aircraft
   parking locations. Additionally, the weekend flying schedule will be reviewed during the
   Friday meetings.
   9.8.2. The designated weekend supervisor from each 12 FTW flying squadron will contact
   AM concerning DVs flying wing-assigned aircraft with special requirements (as applicable).
   9.8.3. When initially notified of an inbound DV aircraft, (through a departure message/etc.),
   AM will contact TA and confirm the DV aircraft‘s parking location.
   9.8.4. AM will also inform ATC of the inbound DV aircraft‘s parking location.
   9.8.5. Workload permitting, ATC will provide AM with a single 15 NM inbound call. AM
   will again contact TA, if possible, and confirm the DV parking location when ATC transmits
   the 15 mile inbound call.
9.9. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo: Aircraft with dangerous/hazardous cargo are not
authorized at Randolph unless it is an emergency situation. In emergencies see Attachment 2 for
locations.
9.10. Wear of Hats: The wearing of hats is not authorized on the airfield with the following
exceptions:
   9.10.1. Situations requiring Protocol and/or Honor Guard presence for O-6 and above
   movements.
   9.10.2. Maintenance Personnel: The wearing of hats is not authorized within 10ft of aircraft.
   If worn, must be tethered.
   9.10.3. Aircrews are authorized to wear issue winter hats during cold weather. T-38 and T-6
   aircrews will ensure all hats are removed and properly stowed prior to engine start.
   9.10.4. Construction Personnel: the wearing of hardhats in construction areas is authorized.
   Additionally, other types of hats (baseball caps, straw hats, etc) may be worn in construction
   areas by personnel (AM, Contracting, CE) overseeing construction activities.
9.11. Local Aircraft Priorities: Local priorities are not intended to be applied so stringently as
to impose undue delay or inefficiency of operation on any one aircraft.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                        55


Table 9.6. JBSA-RND ATC Local Aircraft Priorities:
   9.11.1. Blue Streak Procedures: Blue Streak procedures will be used for all Code 5 DVs
   and above.
       9.11.1.1. AM will notify ATC of the Blue Streak call sign and proposed departure time
       ASAP.
       9.11.1.2. When Blue Streak calls for taxi, ATC will immediately request a departure
       release from SAT TRACON. ATC will assume that the aircraft is ready for departure
       when it reaches the departure RWY. ATC shall notify the SOF of Blue Streak aircraft
       estimated arrival or proposed departure. Weather permitting, aircraft should normally be
       broken out or sent around to prevent Blue Streak delays.
       9.11.1.3. For Blue Streak arrivals, takeoff clearances should not normally be issued after
       Blue Streak aircraft reach 10 flying miles to land. Taxiing aircraft will be directed to give
       way to Blue Streak aircraft.
9.12. Lost Communications Instructions:
   9.12.1. Single ship NORDO aircraft will comply with DoD Flight Information Handbook
   procedures. Additional aircrew procedures are published in the appropriate MDS In-flight
   guides. T-6 aircraft during mission flying will land RWY 14R/32L. T-38/T-1 aircraft during
   mission flying will land RWY 14L/32R. During non-mission flying hours, aircraft will land
   RWY 14L/32R, unless alternate facility procedures are in effect in which case aircraft will
   land RWY 14R/32L.
   9.12.2. ATC will issue landing clearance and airfield information on tower and guard
   frequencies. ATC will also accompany landing clearance with the appropriate light gun
   signal.
9.13. Standard Climb-out Instructions: Departures not utilizing mission stereo routings will
be issued the following climb-out instructions:
   9.13.1. RWY 14L: Fly RWY heading, maintain 3000.
   9.13.2. RWY 14R: Fly heading 160, maintain 3000.
   9.13.3. RWY 32L: Fly RWY heading, climb and maintain 3000 until crossing SAT 005R
   (RND/DHK 15 DME), then climb and maintain 4000.
   9.13.4. RWY 32R: Fly heading 340, maintain 3000.
   9.13.5. RWY 32R: Fly heading 340 until 2.6 DME then turn right heading 125, maintain
   3000.
   9.13.6. After completion of initial climb out and transfer to SAT TRACON, departures can
   expect to receive radar vectors to join their FP routing.
9.14. Opposite Direction Takeoffs and Landings:
   9.14.1. IFR/IFR Arrival/Departure and IFR Arrival/IFR Arrival. Opposite direction IFR
   operations are only authorized at Randolph AFB for Flight Inspection and emergency
   aircraft.
 56                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


   9.14.2. VFR Same Runway Operations. Provided one or both aircraft are VFR ATC will
   ensure no aircraft turns base or proceeds closer than 4NM final before the preceding arrival
   has landed or departed and turned to avert conflict.
   9.14.3. VFR Parallel Runway Operations. Provided one or both aircraft are VFR
   simultaneous opposite direction operations are authorized. ATC shall ensure aircraft are
   separated by 6000ft or more.
9.15. Airfield Smoking Policy: Smoking is not authorized on JBSA-RND’s airfield.
9.16. Civilian Aircraft Operations: Authorization for civil aircraft to land will be verified
with AM. Civil aircraft are authorized to make practice approaches terminating in a low
approach only consistent with the mission requirements of the Wing. Civilian aircraft declaring
in-flight emergencies will be afforded all possible assistance, including landing and crash/rescue
support.
9.17. Civil Use of Military ATCALs: The DME portion of the JBSA-RND VORTAC (CH70)
is a part of the National Airspace System and is available for civil use. The JBSA-RND tower
will inform SATRACON if it is out of service.
9.18. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures: 12 OSS/OSA will maintain a
Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) program with 12 OSS/OSW (Weather). 12 OSS/OSW
NCOIC provides and documents limited observer training for ATC personnel. All controllers
during indoctrination training are required to complete limited observer training and have it
documented on the AF IMT 3622, Air Traffic Control/Weather Certification and Rating Record,
in their training records. CWW is especially important for the HNG, as it is beyond the observing
scope of the official observing point. As ATC personnel provide input to the weather station, 12
OSS/OSW will evaluate the information and may either encode and disseminate a new
observation based on the report, or may include the information in a scheduled observation.
Conditions observed may be different from what is observed at the weather station and the
observation may contain the differing data.
   9.18.1. ATC personnel will notify the weather station via hotline when any of the following
   are seen or occur on JBSA-RND:
       9.18.1.1. Visibility changes of one or more reportable values, when the prevailing
       visibility at the tower or the surface is less than 4 statute miles (SM).
       9.18.1.2. Precipitation begins or ends.
       9.18.1.3. Thunderstorms or lightning.
       9.18.1.4. Tornado or funnel cloud.
       9.18.1.5. Any other significant meteorological condition.
   9.18.2. ATC will pass any PIREPs received to 12 OSS/OSW.
   9.18.3. Hazardous/Severe Weather Notification Procedures and Lightning Response:
   AM/ATC will follow notification procedures in this section and comply with procedures
   outlined in 502d ABW PLAN 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management.
9.19. Bird/Wildlife Control: Local BASH program guidelines will be adhered to as outlined in
JBSA-RND BASH Plan 91-212, Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan.
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                      57


9.20. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)/Bird Watch Conditions (BWC): Locally
established bird watch conditions are outlined in the JBSA-RND BASH Plan 91-212.
   9.20.1. During wing flying the SOF will declare the BWC for their respective locations. The
   CIC will recommend BWC to the acting SOF, if there is not a SOF in their respective tower.
   CICs will work together with the AFM to determine the BWC all other times.
   9.20.2. Controllers will disseminate bird watch or alert conditions on initial contact to
   arriving and departing aircraft and as necessary to aircraft operating in the local patterns. A
   statement containing the BWC will be included on all ATIS broadcasts. ATIS broadcasts and
   initial notification of BWC should be accompanied by a brief description of location and type
   of activity (i.e., soaring birds, perch point at pattern altitude).
   9.20.3. Bat Procedures: T-38 and T-1 bat procedures will automatically be implemented
   from a period one hour prior to sunset to 30 minutes after sunrise from 1 April to 31 October.
   The SOF may also implement them anytime bats are reported or observed and deemed a
   factor to safe flight operations.
      9.20.3.1. When Bat Procedures are in effect, Wing T-38 sorties will be flown to an
      overhead (if open) full stop. Wing T-1 sorties will normally recover via one instrument
      approach or straight-in to a full stop. Wing T-38 and T-1 takeoffs during bat procedures
      require 12 OG/CC approval. If the SOF determines that special entry procedures are
      required to avoid high threat areas, ATC will advise the aircraft ASAP. ATC will advise
      transient T-38 and T-1 aircraft when bat procedures are in effect. Transient T-38 and T-1
      aircraft arrivals will terminate to full stop landings. ATC will include bat procedures
      advisories on the ATIS.
      9.20.3.2. In addition to restrictions contained in FLIP AP-1, the following restrictions
      apply to all 12 FTW aircraft from 1 June to 15 July: All aircraft will be limited to one
      approach to a full stop during the period starting one hour prior to one hour after official
      sunset. During this period, no takeoffs are allowed without OG/CC approval.
9.21. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operating from the Tower: SOFs will normally be in the
control tower prior to making decisions that affect air traffic control operations.
   9.21.1. ATC CICs will ensure proper coordination with SOFs is conducted to ensure the safe
   operation of the control tower. The CIC will inform SOF of equipment outages affecting the
   SOF console or other equipment as necessary. CICs will ensure controllers assist the SOF in
   whatever way possible as a secondary duty. SOFs will coordinate all requests through the
   CIC.
   9.21.2. The SOF must not perform ATC functions or transmit ATC instructions or
   clearances to an aircraft unless the instructions are required to prevent a mishap. When
   advice is extremely technical, or when the SOF feels that relay of information by the
   controller could cause an unacceptable delay, the SOF coordinates use of the frequency with
   the facility CIC and transmits directly to the affected aircraft.
   9.21.3. Unless time critical, the SOF will coordinate with the CIC prior to transmitting on
   Guard. The CIC will coordinate with opposite facility prior to the SOF transmitting on
   Guard. NOTE: A person who commandeers an ATC frequency assumes responsibility for
   separation of aircraft.
 58                                                              12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014


9.22. Taking of Photographs: Photographing the exterior of aircraft is authorized unless
expressly prohibited. Visitors are not to photograph any cockpit without express consent of the
PIC.
   9.22.1. Photographs are not authorized in or around established restricted areas when aircraft
   are present.
   9.22.2. Aerial Photography inside the Class D, over JBSA-RND must be coordinated and
   approved by 902 CE.
9.23. Pilot/Controller Communications: Aircraft will communicate on UHF to the maximum
extent possible when in contact with ATC. Pilots will acknowledge all ATC clearances and
control instructions. Pilots will not acknowledge position report requests.
9.24. Final Monitor Radar (FM)/Dual Simultaneous Independent Approach (SIA)
Procedures: The FM positions operate IAW SIA procedures located in FAAO 7110.65,
RND/SAT TRACON LOA, Tower OI 13-204, and local directives.
   9.24.1. FM will be open only during the time there is 12 FTW flying to both runways or as
   manning allows. FM positions will remain operational until HNG ATC terminates IFR
   operations, when Wing flying has been canceled, suspended, or terminated, and once
   coordination with SAT TRACON has been completed.
   9.24.2. FM monitors the No Transgression Zone and provides safety services and advisories
   as needed.
   9.24.3. If required separation is lost, or anticipated to be lost, pilots who have not reported
   the RWY in sight may be issued a safety alert and breakout instructions
9.25. Crop Dusting Operations: Crop dusters may obtain approval to conduct spraying
operations within designated areas of JBSA-RND Class D airspace. Pilots contact ATC or AM
by telephone in advance of spraying operations to request approval and are not expected to have
two-way radio capability. ATC will advise SAT TRACON and include an advisory on the ATIS
of any crop dusting activity.
9.26. Weather Smooth Flow (WSF) Operations: In the event there is no Simultaneous ILS
(RMP/SILS) capability, WSF operations will be activated when one or both of JBSA-RND
patterns are restricted (overhead or straight-in) or closed, requiring a recovery via an instrument
approach or radar vectors to a visual approach. During WSF operations the volume of 12 FTW
aircraft operating from JBSA-RND will be reduced to provide an orderly recovery sequence.
   9.26.1. Implementation of WSF requires that both SOFs coordinate with one another and
   each individual squadron‘s Operations Supervisor when either patterns status is closed or
   restricted. Squadrons will reduce total sorties per launch period IAW Table 9.7 below. The
   remaining sorties will be smooth flowed evenly throughout the period.

Table 9.7. Aircraft Take-off Rates:
12FTWI13-204 23 JUNE 2014                                                                    59


   9.26.2. Aircraft sorties cancelled due to implementation of WSF are permanently lost even if
   pattern status improves. If WSF occurs after a launch period has begun, the remaining sorties
   will launch at the established rate in Table 9.7. San Antonio Approach will allow racetracks
   and reruns on a traffic volume permitting basis. SOFs will notify San Antonio Approach
   supervisors when WSF in implemented and when WSF has terminated.
9.27. Weather Recall Procedures: The SOF initiates weather recall procedures. In the event of
a weather recall, ATC will transmit JBSA-RND (T-6, T-1, T-38, etc) weather recall in progress
on LC and GC frequencies. All approaches will terminate in full-stop landings unless otherwise
approved by the SOF.
