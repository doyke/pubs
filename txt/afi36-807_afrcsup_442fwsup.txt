and should be taken as close to the middle of the work schedule as possible. Compensatory time
and overtime are authorized subject to supervisor approval. Credit hours are not available to
employees working a compressed work schedule.

2.5.2. (Added) (442 FW) 5/4-9 Plan - This option allows an employee to work a combination of
eight nine-hour days and one eight-hour day per biweekly pay period for a total of 80 hours. A

2.7. (Added) (442 FW) Employees, with supervisor approval, may elect to work a flexible work
schedule in one of the following formats:

2.7.1. (Added) (442 FW) Flexi-tour. A full-time employee must work eight hours per day, 40
hours per week and 80-hours in a biweekly period. An employee may be allowed to determine
his or her schedule within the limits set by the agency. Group commanders, or their designated
representatives, establish core hours, a standard lunch break for their groups and approve flexible
hours of work around these core hours. Lunch breaks up to one hour are authorized and should
be taken as close to the middle of the work schedule as possible. If an employee wishes to adjust
his or her work schedule in such a manner that core hours have not been met, then the supervisor
must approve variations to these work hours no later than Wednesday prior to start of the
biweekly work schedule. EXCEPTION: Personnel scheduled for irregular duty (examples:
night flyer, supervisor of flying) may adjust their work hours on a weekly basis commensurate
with mission-driven work demands. These variations DO NOT require prior supervisory
approval, but must be appropriate and will be reviewed and verified by supervisors prior to
authorizing employees’ timecards.

subject to supervisor approval.

2.7.1.2. (Added) (442 FW) Core hours and bandwidths are established by group as follows:

Wing Staff/Medical Squadron 0900-1500*                           0630-2300
Mission Support Group          0900-1500                         0630-1800
Operations Group               1100-1500*                        0600-0100

the work day. The employee may start work no earlier than the bandwidth start time and end

                              Core Hours                        Bandwidth

2.12. (Added) (442 FW) Employees who are on special tours of duty for educational purposes
cannot be paid premium pay solely because the rescheduling of his/her tour of duty causes
him/her to work on a day, or during the hours of a day, when premium pay would otherwise be
required. Also, supervisors are not prohibited from assigning an employee to a regularly
scheduled shift requiring premium pay, for example, night pay, since no additional costs are
incurred. Supervisors must notify the civilian payroll office when an employee is assigned to or
changed from a special tour of duty to prevent inadvertent payment of premium pay.
Supervisors must maintain a record of these tours of duty for the purpose of responding to Office
of Personnel Management inquiries.

2.14. (Added) (442 FW) Work scheduled to exceed 40 hours in a week or 80 hours in the
biweekly pay period should be coordinated with and approved by the employee’s supervisor.
This work will be classified as and compensated for by one of the following:

2.14.1. (Added) (442 FW) Compensatory Time/Overtime - Any employee wishing to work
compensatory time or overtime will submit an Air Force Form 428, Request for Overtime,
Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time for approval prior to performance of work. No
compensatory time or overtime will be authorized without group commander approval.

2.14.2. (Added) (442 FW) Credit Hours - This option is for employees working a flexible work
schedule permits employees to work additional hours at the beginning or end of a normal
workday. Credit hours cannot be earned by an employee working a compressed work schedule.
There is no limit to the number of credit hours an employee can earn and use within an 80-hour
pay period; however, a maximum of 24 hours can be carried forward from one pay period into
the next.

4.4. (Added) (442 FW) Supervisors will generally schedule time for lunch apart from the hours
when one or two shifts are in operation i.e. when supervisors schedule more than one eight-hour
shift in a 24-hour period and an overlapping of shifts to permit time off for lunch is not possible,
supervisors may authorize an on-the-job lunch period of 20 minutes or less. On-the-job lunch
periods require that:

4.4.1. (Added) (442 FW) Employees spend their on-the-job lunch at or near their work stations.
Under these conditions, the time covered by the 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is
compensable.
