This instruction establishes policy and procedures, and defines responsibilities for 50th Space Wing (50
SW) radio frequency management at Schriever Air Force Base (AFB), subordinate organizations and
operating locations. It includes, but is not limited to, the functions of frequency procurement, assign-
ments, control, protection, coordination, scheduling, monitoring, and interference reporting. This instruc-
tion implements AFPD 33-1, Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems; AFI
33-118, Air Force Frequency Spectrum Management; AFMAN 33-120, Radio Frequency Spectrum Man-
agement; and AFI 10-707, AFSPC Sup1, Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, and applies to mili-
tary and non-military activities on Schriever AFB, its subordinate unit locations, and other operating
locations. It also applies to electromagnetic receiving systems requiring frequency protection for success-
ful operation.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
The revision of this publication is to meet the current 50 SW requirements. No significant content mate-
rial has changed. Address and phone numbers were updated, and a bullet was added regarding training for
unit points of contact (POCs).


1. Air Force Policy. The radio frequency (RF) spectrum is a limited natural resource vital to the support
of military operations. The intensive requirements being placed on this resource require effective manage-
ment at all command levels to ensure radio frequencies can be provided to meet essential mission require-
ments. AFI 33-118 and AFMAN 33-120 provide information, instructions, and directions for the
implementation of a frequency management program to ensure effective and efficient use of those limited
radio frequencies. AFI 10-707, AFSPC Sup 1 provides guidance for reporting, identifying, evaluating,
and controlling electromagnetic interference (EMI) and directions for the implementation of the Spectrum
Interference Resolution Program.

       longer needed. Updates needed frequency assignments whenever changes to operating parameters
       occur. Coordinates 5-year review updates with 50 SW Frequency Management Office a minimum
       of 180 days prior to the due date found in the Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) item 142
       or the license to operate. Addresses for 50 SW Frequency Management follows:

3. Procedures:
   3.1. Frequency Allocation. Any base activity or unit subordinate to the 50 SW planning to procure or
   develop a new system involving transmission or reception of RF energy, or planning to change the RF
   characteristics of an existing RF system, must include the frequency manager in the initial planning
   phase. This ensures new equipment is compatible in the current environments where equipment sup-
   porting 50 SW mission is employed, and conforms with Department of Defense (DoD), national, and
   international regulations and agreements. If the involved equipment has not been approved for use
   within DoD, the frequency management office will help develop and process a DD Form 1494, Appli-
   cation for Frequency Allocation. Lead-time is 8 to 12 months.
   3.2. Frequency Procurement. Any activity requiring a new RF assignment within an allocated band or
   modifications to an existing one, must contact the 50 SW Frequency Management
   Office. The frequency management office will provide assistance in frequency selections to ensure
   compatibility prior to drafting and processing a formal RF proposal.
   3.3. Frequency Assignment. Frequency requirements supporting the 50 SW, its GSUs, and tenants are
   complex, diverse, always changing, and involve varied commands and agencies that support unrelated
   programs and tests. All activities operating electromagnetic systems must have a radio frequency
   assignment issued by the Military Communications-Electronics Board (MCEB) or the 50 SW Fre-
   quency Manager. Any command, agency, business, or visiting unit who holds or receives a RF assign-
   ment document from their respective DoD frequency management agency, command, or the Federal
   Communications Commission (FCC) must send a copy of that document to the 50 SW Frequency
   Manager. This is done to minimize any EMI that could occur if frequencies used are in conflict with
   each other.
   3.4. Frequency Coordination. Any activity anticipating a need for coordination with other assigned
   agencies concerning RF matters must contact the 50 SW Frequency Manager prior to radiating. The
   frequency manager provides or performs all such coordination necessary to prevent or resolve fre-
   quency problems. Using the frequency manager for internal and external frequency coordination is
   mandatory and is the only acceptable way of ensuring appropriate technical review, preventing redun-
   dant or conflicting positions, and maintaining good relationships and credibility.
   3.5. EMI Reporting. Units experiencing EMI shall report the event(s) IAW AFI 10-707, AFSPC Sup
   1 and 50 SWI 10-215. These instructions contain procedures for resolving EMI to satellite systems,
   ground stations and non-satellite systems (e.g., Land Mobile Radio Networks).

    3.5.1. Satellite Systems /Non-Satellite Systems. 50 SW bases/GSUs and tenant units shall report
    all EMI affecting non-satellite systems to the 50 SW/CP in accordance with 50 SWI 10-215.
