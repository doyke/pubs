This Air Force Manual (AFMAN) implements Executive Order (E.O.) 13103, Computer
Software Piracy and Air Force Policy Directives (AFPD) 33-1, Cyberspace Support and supports
AFPD 33-2, Information Assurance (IA) Program; AFPD 63-1/20-1, Integrated Life Cycle
Management; and AFPD 10-6, Capabilities-Based Planning & Requirements Development. This
AFMAN provides the overarching guidance and direction for managing IT hardware and
software. The hardware management guidance identifies responsibilities for supporting Air
Force (AF) IT hardware (IT assets) and maintaining accountability of Personal Wireless
Communications Systems (PWCS) including cellular telephones and pagers. The software
management guidance identifies responsibilities for management of commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) and AF-unique software acquired/developed by the AF (other than software internal to a
weapon system; see AFPD 63-1/20-1, Integrated Life Cycle Management). This AFMAN
applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve (AFR) unless indicated
otherwise. One or more paragraphs of this AFMAN may not apply to non-AF-managed joint
service systems. These paragraphs are marked as follows: (NOT APPLICABLE TO NON-AF-

                                 IT ASSET MANAGEMENT

1.1. Overview. This manual provides guidance and direction for operational management of IT
hardware and software. Hardware management guidance identifies responsibilities for
supporting AF IT hardware assets including maintaining physical accountability of PWCS.
Refer to AFI 33-590, Radio Management, for overall PWCS management guidance. Software
management guidance identifies responsibilities for operational management of COTS and AF-
unique software acquired or developed by the AF (other than software internal to a weapon
system; see AFPD 63-1/20-1). Refer to AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management,
for guidelines, policies, and procedures for AF personnel who develop, review, approve, or
manage systems, subsystems, end-items, and services. Technologies and techniques for
continuous network monitoring and automatic tracking of hardware and software assets will be
used to the maximum extent possible in place of manual physical inventories. Manual
inventories and procedures must continue to be followed for hardware or software that cannot be
accounted for with automated tracking techniques due to assets not installed, not configurable as
discoverable, or not connected to a monitored network.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities. Figure 1.1 below represents an overview of those IT Asset
Management roles and responsibilities from the AF to the organizational level.

     AFMAN 33-282, Computer Security (COMPUSEC), (T-0).
     1.2.14.12. Cellular devices must be disposed of IAW applicable National Information
     Assurance Partnership Protection Profiles (NIAP PPs) or Security Technical
     Implementation Guides (STIGs). In cases where those documents do not specify disposal
     procedures, devices must be sanitized with a National Security Agency (NSA) approved
     method/product before being transferred outside the AF, (T-0).
     1.2.14.13. Excess cellular devices exposed to classified information must be turned in to
     DLADS for destruction. Before sending cellular devices to DLADS for destruction they
     shall be wiped based on the NIAP PP or STIG, (T-0).
  1.2.15. Client Systems Technician/Helpdesk Responsibilities (CST). Each Client
  Systems Technician/Helpdesk will:
     1.2.15.1. Not purchase, obtain, or install hardware or software without prior coordination
     with the applicable ECO, ITEC, or BSLM, (T-3).
     1.2.15.2. Notify the BSLM (or equivalents) of any actions performed that changes local
     software licenses installed on computer systems, (T-3). CSTs must maintain a record of
     and notify BSLMs when installing software from shared folders or using installation
     CDs/DVDs. Also maintain a record of and notify BSLM (or equivalents) when
     uninstalling, upgrading, or performing any actions that change the amount or number of

                          HARDWARE ASSET MANAGEMENT

Section 2A—Hardware Assets Accountability and Reporting

2.1. Accountability of IT Hardware Assets and Inventory Management.
   2.1.1. Accountability Determination. The accountability of hardware assets is governed by
   multiple and complex congressional, federal, DoD, and AF policies. Hardware assets may be
   hybrid devices with multiple uses complicating the clear definition of a specific hardware
   type. The following paragraphs will be used to determine accountability of AF IT assets
   based on acquisition cost thresholds and features of the hardware.
      2.1.1.1. Send concerns about the inclusion or exclusion of IT hardware assets in
      AFEMS-AIM to 38 CYRS/SCM (38CYRS.ITAM@us.af.mil or DSN 779-6280).
      2.1.1.2. Refer to AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System, and the IT Asset
      Management checklist in the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) for hardware
      and software inspection criteria.
   2.1.2. Sensitive IT Assets (Controlled Inventory Items).
      2.1.2.1. Sensitive IT assets are any IT hardware with persistent storage (e.g. laptop,
      desktop, server, tablet, smartphone, external hard drive, and thumb drive) or are Internet
      Protocol (IP) network capable (e.g. thin client, network printer, router, switch, and VoIP
      phone). Persistent storage does not include device firmware. IP network capability does
      not include Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) capabilities lacking IP network
      features (e.g. Bluetooth, RF, and infrared).
      2.1.2.2. Sensitive IT assets must be accounted for in AFEMS-AIM as commodity code
      “A” due to their capability to process and/or transmit personally identifiable information
      or other sensitive agency information according to DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and
      Management of DoD Equipment and Other Accountable Property.                        Physical
      accountability of these items is required in support of IT configuration management and
      information assurance requirements. Physical accountability supports the goal of
      automating the association of IT assets with network configuration management items
      and to enhance overall cyberspace situational awareness of physical assets, (T-1).
      2.1.2.3. An ROS is required for the loss of any sensitive IT asset regardless of their cost
      according to AFMAN 23-220, (T-1).
      2.1.2.4. Report the loss of any IT asset with persistent storage to the ISSO, wing IA or
      Information Protection (IP) office, according to requirements outlined in AFI 33-200 and
      AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, and any local procedures.
   2.1.3. Non-Sensitive IT Assets.
      2.1.3.1. Non-Sensitive IT Assets are peripherals and other IT hardware lacking both
      persistent storage and IP network capabilities (e.g. mouse, keyboard, monitor, non-
      network displays, non-network capable Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) switch, non-
      network capable fax machine, and non-network capable printer). Non-sensitive IT assets
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                  17


      include IT hardware providing WPAN capabilities without IP network capabilities (e.g.
      wireless mouse and Bluetooth keyboard).
      2.1.3.2. Non-sensitive IT assets with a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more are
      accountable items and must be accounted for in AFEMS-AIM, (T-1).
      2.1.3.3. Non-sensitive IT assets with a unit acquisition cost of less than $5,000 may be
      tracked locally IAW Material Management (23 series) policies or in AFEMS-AIM.
         2.1.3.3.1. If AFEMS-AIM is used to track non-sensitive IT assets, an ROS is
         required to adjust those records in AFEMS-AIM when a non-sensitive asset is lost,
         destroyed or otherwise unaccountable, (T-1).
   2.1.4. Personal Wireless Communications System (PWCS) including Commercial Mobile
   Device (CMD), Cellular Phones, and Pagers.
      2.1.4.1. Any PWCS hardware meeting the definition of sensitive IT assets (persistent
      storage or IP network capable) must be accounted for as sensitive IT assets (e.g. CMDs,
      smartphones, tablets) according to paragraph 2.1.2.2.
      2.1.4.2. If not a sensitive IT asset, PWCS hardware will be accounted for in AFEMS-
      AIM as PWCS commodity code "P" assets (e.g. portable radios, base stations, PWCS
      infrastructure equipment, Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) equipment, and Type-1
      encryption capable cellular telephones).
      2.1.4.3. Type-1 CMDs and Secure Mobile Environment Portable Electronic Devices
      (SME PEDs) will be managed by the Communications Security (COMSEC) Responsible
      Officer (CRO).
      2.1.4.4. CMDs, cellular phones, and pagers that are not Type-1 encryption capable and
      do not meet the definition of sensitive IT assets are non-accountable PWCS items (e.g.
      basic cellular telephones and pagers).
2.2. Hardware Assets Ordering and Procurement Guidance.
   2.2.1. All AF IT hardware (including PWCS) will be procured using applicable AF
   Information Technology Commodity Council (ITCC) enterprise buying programs via
   AFWay at https://www.afway.af.mil, (e.g. Quantum Enterprise Buy [QEB], Digital Printing
   & Imaging [DPI], Cellular Services & Devices BPAs). All AF IT hardware not purchased
   through AFWay, are mandated to use the NETCENTS-2 contracts, see Chapter 4, (T-1).
      2.2.1.1. All requests for servers must comply with current National Defense
      Authorization Act as depicted in AFI 33-150. A DOD unique identifying number must
      accompany the acquisition.
      2.2.1.2. The MAJCOM/A6s (or equivalents) may approve a QEB or DPI waiver via
      AFWay process, however MAJCOMs and Program Offices must use either AFWay-
      approved vendors or a NETCENTS-2 contract to meet their mission requirements, (T-1).
      See Chapter 4 for details on NETCENTS-2 contracts.
      2.2.1.3. Orders for equipment that will reside in SCIFs will be selected from the E/APL
      or other designed SCIF cognizant security authority representative prior to purchase.
 18                                                         AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014


      2.2.1.4. DLA-Document Services is the preferred provider for printing services
      according to DoDI5330.03_AFI33-395.
      2.2.1.5. All hardware purchases shall be in compliance with US Code Title 10 Sections
      2222, 2382, and 2867, AFI 63-101, AFI 33-141, AFMAN 33-407, and the most recent
      published DCMO guidance for Defense Business Systems Funds Certification and
      Defense Business System Integrated Program/Budget Review (currently, Version 3.0
      published April 2014).
   2.2.2. Those submitting purchase requests will ensure a Wide Area Workflow (WAWF)
   Business Partner Network (BPN) number is listed at http://www.bpn.gov/.
   2.2.3. Ensure complete information on shipping labels for ordered equipment. Obtain
   confirmation that procurement officials specify, as a contractual requirement, that “Ship To”
   and “Mark For” information is detailed on the shipping labels. This will alleviate problems
   with the receipt and acceptance processing of new hardware assets.
      2.2.3.1. “Mark For” information will contain; Contract Number, Purchase Order
      Number, Address, Phone Number, Email Address, Resource Manager Name, and ITEC
      Name (when applicable).
      2.2.3.2. “Ship To” information will contain the complete delivery address. This includes
      the Equipment Control Officer name. This will correspond to the DoD Activity Address
      Code (DoDAAC) and the system of record for real property (ACES-RP).
2.3. Receipt and Acceptance of Hardware Assets.
   2.3.1. IT asset accountability must be established by formal receipt and acceptance in an
   accountable property system of record according to DoDI 5000.64. For IT hardware assets,
   the AF's official accountable property system of record is the AFEMS-AIM module or
   DMLSS for medical WRM assets. AF IT asset accountability will be established in a timely
   manner by the following:
      2.3.1.1. Receive and secure any assets, if not received by the ECO, until proper
      accountability is established. This practice will not be the normal way of receiving
      property. All assets will be centrally received through the ECO, (T-3). Assets within
      SCIFs will follow the Intelligence Community Directive 503, Committee on National
      Security Systems Instruction 1253, or other policies issued by national intelligence
      community elements.
      2.3.1.2. The ECO or supporting personnel will enter newly received IT assets into
      AFEMS-AIM within 10 working days of receipt and acceptance, (T-2).
      2.3.1.3. Ensure correct MAJCOM code is entered into AFEMS-AIM for all assets in
      their DRA. The MAJCOM code must correctly identify the owning command which
      may differ from the host base’s command, (T-2).
      2.3.1.4. For equipment not immediately installed, the ECO or supporting personnel will
      use the appropriate IT asset status code according to Attachment 2 (i.e., Status Code 03 -
      Received on-site, but not installed), (T-2).
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                   19


     2.3.1.5. If the receiver/acceptor of the IT asset is not the ECO or supporting personnel,
     the receiver/acceptor will notify the ECO upon receipt and acceptance of the IT asset so
     accountability is established in the AFEMS-AIM system within 10 working days of
     receipt and acceptance, (T-2).
     2.3.1.6. Ensure unique asset identification is established for each item according to
     Serialized Item Management (SIM) and Item Unique Identification (IUID) guidance in
     AFI 63-101/20-101, (T-2).
         2.3.1.6.1. When the device is too small, user generated labels that include
         Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, part number, and serial number
         will be used.
         2.3.1.6.2. IUID labels will either be affixed to the asset by the manufacturer or will
         be applied by the ECO.
             2.3.1.6.2.1. If the labels, placed onto the asset by the manufacturer, do not
             contain Cage, Part# and Serial # or if the label placed by the manufacturer does
             not match the data entered into AIM for the asset, then a label with the correct
             Cage, Part# and Serial matching the data in AIM must be placed onto the item.
         2.3.1.6.3. Equivalent labels will contain the CAGE code, part number and serial
         number of the asset.
     2.3.1.7. For holding accounts in AFEMS-AIM, the ECO login user record for holding
     accounts will not be used as this causes system discrepancy when trying to make changes
     to the DRA. The establishment of a central receiving and distribution point is mandatory
     for ensuring accurate accountability throughout the lifecycle of IT assets, (T-2).
  2.3.2. Federal agencies must pay commercial vendor bills on time and pay interest when
  payments are late according to DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Volume 10, Chapter 7, Prompt
  Payment Act. Consequently, the AF is subject to interest penalties if the proper invoice and
  receiving reports for IT assets are not processed in a timely manner. To ensure timely
  payment to vendors and avoid interest penalties, SAF/FMP mandates the use of Wide Area
  Workflow (WAWF) to electronically submit all receiving reports to the Defense Finance and
  Accounting Service (DFAS), (T-1).
     2.3.2.1. All personnel receiving or accepting IT assets on behalf of the ECO will ensure
     receiving reports are processed using WAWF within 3 working days of receipt and
     acceptance, (T-3).
     2.3.2.2. If the ECO or the person who received the IT does not have visibility of the
     order in WAWF, the unit Resource Advisor will be contacted to ensure payment through
     appropriate channels, (T-3).
     2.3.2.3. If WAWF is unavailable, the receiving report will be completed manually with a
     DD Form 250 and a copy forwarded to your local Financial Management Accounting
     Liaison Office (ALO) for processing to WAWF within 3 working days of IT asset receipt
     and acceptance, (T-3).
  2.3.3. Managing Capital Assets. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act), 31
  U.S.C. §901-903, specifies capitalization and depreciation of equipment with an
  acquisition/leased cost equal to or greater than $100K.
 20                                                          AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014


      2.3.3.1. Special attention needs to be taken when loading the acquisition/lease cost and
      the fund code. AFEMS-AIM internally computes the depreciation of these assets and
      reports the cost data by fund code to DFAS. The cost data for IT assets is part of the AF
      Financial statement that is annually submitted to Congress.
      2.3.3.2. Acquisition cost, which is what depreciation is based on, includes all costs
      incurred to bring the asset to a form and location suitable for its intended use (e.g.,
      amounts paid to vendors, transportation to point of initial use, handling and storage costs,
      interest costs paid, and direct and indirect production costs). The acquisition cost is
      typically found on an accompanying invoice.
2.4. Establishing Custodial Responsibility of Hardware Assets.
   2.4.1. For effective AF hardware asset controls, custodial responsibility is established when
   an individual takes physical custody of the property and provides handwritten or digital
   signature on a custody receipt document or in a system such as an AFEMS-AIM inventory
   list or a hand receipt.
   2.4.2. Personnel having custodial responsibility may incur pecuniary liability for the loss,
   destruction, or damage to property caused by willful misconduct, deliberate unauthorized
   use, or negligence in the use, care, custody, or safeguard of the property from causes other
   than normal wear and tear.
   2.4.3. There are two methods to establish custodial responsibility.
      2.4.3.1. Establish an organizational asset equipment account in AFEMS-AIM.
          2.4.3.1.1. The organizational commander appoints an ITEC/PEC for the account.
          2.4.3.1.2. The ITEC/PEC accepts custodial responsibility on behalf of the
          organization by certifying an AFEMS-AIM inventory list provided by the ECO with
          handwritten or digital signature.
          2.4.3.1.3. The ITEC/PEC conducts the annual inventory according to paragraph 2.5.
          2.4.3.1.4. ITECs/PECs will maintain accountability and tracking of all assigned IT
          assets. It is highly recommended that ITECs/PECs have end users sign a hand receipt
          or digitally sign an email or system acknowledgment for the hardware assets in the
          user’s possession or hardware assets they use on a regular basis. Hand receipts must
          be accomplished for easily transported devices such as laptops, PEDs, tablets, etc.
          Digital signatures are encouraged, (T-2).
      2.4.3.2. With prior AFECO and/or MECO approval, CSs authorize the ECO to create
      equipment accounts in AFEMS-AIM without assigning traditional equipment custodians.
      This method can only be used for smaller organizations where it is not feasible to appoint
      ITECs/PECs. This authorization must be in writing or as a digitally signed document or
      email and use of hand receipts for this method is mandatory.
   2.4.4. Hand receipts may be AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, a digitally signed
   electronic hand receipt, or digital signature in an automated system. If the AF 1297 is not
   used, the hand receipt or automated system must state, “I acknowledge receipt of and
   responsibility in accordance with AFI 23-111 for the items described below and will return
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                    21


   them by the return date indicated.” All hand receipts must be signed and contain the signer’s
   contact information.
   2.4.5. IT assets that are components of weapons systems or other major systems and are
   already tracked in another property management system will not be tracked in AFEMS-AIM.
   2.4.6. Equipment in possession/use of deployed home station personnel will be tracked and
   managed within the home station inventory. Equipment transferred to other units or left
   forward must be properly transferred from the home station (losing unit) account to an
   appropriate gaining unit to maintain full accountability.
2.5. Inventory of Hardware Assets.
   2.5.1. A inventory validates the existence, proper location, and correct quantity of hardware
   assets as stated in the inventory records in AFEMS-AIM. Inventory will be reconciled with
   the records contained in the AFEMS-AIM database.
   2.5.2. ECOs have the authority to freeze ITEC/PEC accounts for failure to comply with this
   AFMAN. This option should only be utilized after providing the ITEC/PEC an opportunity
   to correct any deficiencies in a timely manner due to the potential for serious impact to an
   organization’s mission.
   2.5.3. Official AF validation techniques for an inventory include: hands-on verification,
   barcode scanning, IUID, radio frequency identification (RFID), and network log-on or use
   records including the Enterprise IT Service Management (EITSM) suite, and using network
   auto-discovery tools.
   2.5.4. Regardless of the validation technique used during the inventory, results of the
   validation will be reconciled with the records contained in the AFEMS-AIM database, (T-1).
   2.5.5. The annual inventory will be conducted not later than 365 calendar days from the date
   the commander signed the current inventory listing. Complete out of cycle inventories when
   directed or required by AFECO, MECO, CSO, or ECO, (T-1).
      2.5.5.1. In deployed locations, the forward commander determines the timeline for
      inventory based on rotation schedules.
      2.5.5.2. Outgoing and incoming primary ITECs/PECs conduct and certify a loss-gain
      joint inventory, not later than 30 calendar days prior to the ITEC/PEC being relieved of
      duty.
          2.5.5.2.1. If the ITEC/PEC leaves prior to this joint loss-gain inventory being
          accomplished, the organizational commander assumes responsibility for all assets on
          that inventory.
          2.5.5.2.2. The departing ITEC/PEC must reconcile missing items under the guidance
          of the ECO prior to certifying the loss-gain inventory.
          2.5.5.2.3. DELETED.
      2.5.5.3. If inventory discrepancies are discovered, the commander or equivalent will be
      informed and a Report of Survey (ROS) will be processed according to AFMAN 23-220,
      Reports of Survey for Air Force Property.
22                                                         AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014


        2.5.5.3.1. A DD Form 200 is required to adjust records for all sensitive IT assets
        (refer to paragraph 2.1) within AFEMS-AIM regardless of dollar value.
        2.5.5.3.2. For non-sensitive IT Assets, A DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher
        may be used in place of an ROS when criteria in AFMAN 23-220 paragraph 16.1.2
        are met; this excludes the loss of sensitive IT assets.
  2.5.6. Upon completion of the inventory, the ITEC/PEC and the organizational commander
  or equivalent must approve and certify the official AIM generated inventory with
  handwritten or digital signature and forwards it to the ECO, (T-2).
        2.5.6.1. The commander’s signature certifies to the ECO the annual inventory is
        complete. This date will be used as the official inventory date in AFEMS-AIM.
     2.5.6.2. Annual inventories can still be certified and completed even though items are
     missing as long as items are documented as part of an initiated ROS investigation.
  2.5.7. Only the most current inventory will be retained in the ITEC/PEC/ECO folder or
  Electronic Records Management system, (T-3).
     2.5.7.1. The ITEC/PEC will maintain the original certified inventory and a copy will be
     retained in the ECO file.
     2.5.7.2. If digital signatures are used, the ITEC/PEC and ECO will each file a copy in
     their electronic records management system (file plan, electronic records management
     solution, electronic record keeping system or automated information system).
     2.5.7.3. Past inventory records will be reviewed to ensure they are complete before
     disposing of old inventory data and ensure source documents are retained to support
     current inventory records, e.g., ROS, hand receipts, etc.
     2.5.7.4. The ECO, ITEC, and PEC will maintain electronic record folders with the
     following suggestions (as applicable) for each tab or directory.
        2.5.7.4.1. TAB 1 – Current digitally signed ITEC/PEC designation.
        2.5.7.4.2. TAB 2 – Current Annual Inventory.
        2.5.7.4.3. TAB 3 – Hand Receipts.
        2.5.7.4.4. TAB 4 – DD Form 1348-1A for disposal or disposition actions; any other
        disposal receipts received from DLADS.
        2.5.7.4.5. TAB 5 – Asset transfer documentation.
        2.5.7.4.6. TAB 6 – Training Certificates.
        2.5.7.4.7. The format of the tabs will be consistent between the ECO and ITEC/PEC.
        Automated processes will be used and existing 6-part folders should be transitioned to
        electronic records management (e.g. AFRIMS T33-07 R07.00 as file plan baseline).
  2.5.8. ITECs/PECs ensure all assets are reflected on an AFEMS-AIM inventory listing. If
  hardware equipment is found in the work area that is not on the AFEMS-AIM inventory
  listing, determine if the equipment should be added to AFEMS-AIM to establish
  accountability according to guidance from the ECO and this AFMAN.
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                     23


   2.5.9. During the inventory, an ITEC/PEC will contact each individual with equipment
   issued via hand receipt to verify the equipment’s status. At a minimum, the ITEC/PEC will
   annotate the following on his/her copy of the hand receipt: person contacted, contact date,
   updated contact information if required, and initial the entry. A digitally signed email, from
   the possessor of the equipment is the preferred method of documenting the contact, (T-3).
   2.5.10. The IT asset status codes within AFEMS-AIM will be reviewed during the annual
   inventory to ensure the codes reflect the current status using Attachment 2, (T-2). Status
   codes allow the purchasing agent/entity to make accurate and informed buying decisions.
   For organizations that centrally procure, these codes are crucial to that process.
   2.5.11. When completing inventory adjustments in AFEMS-AIM, ECOs will use the
   following database user’s manual categories to ensure proper disposition, (T-1).
      2.5.11.1. Reverse Post: A reverse post can be processed against an add asset record up
      and until another action has been taken against that record. Once a transaction has been
      processed against the record, it cannot be reverse posted.
      2.5.11.2. Maintenance Swap: Assets returned to the vendor with a replacement asset
      provided by the vendor.
      2.5.11.3. Returned: Assets returned to the Vendor without replacement.
      2.5.11.4. External Disposal: This category includes assets disposed outside the normal
      AFEMS-AIM or Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (DLADS) process (e.g.,
      transfer to organization/activities that do not use AFEMS-AIM to account for IT
      hardware assets).
      2.5.11.5. Destroyed: This category includes Combat Losses, Natural disasters, and
      Authorized disposal of IT components in the area of responsibility (AOR).
      2.5.11.6. Assets Tracked Elsewhere:       Assets are managed on another government
      system.
      2.5.11.7. Report of Survey: Asset has been assigned a ROS number.
   2.5.12. During the inventory, AFEMS-AIM deficiencies (e.g. missing assets, incorrect
   locations, unrecorded property items) are identified and these deficiencies are corrected as
   part of the process.
2.6. Contractor Guidance.
   2.6.1. Organizational commanders grant contractor employees access to, or allow operation
   of, government-furnished IT resources or contractor-owned IT resources processing
   government information. This access is governed by the terms and conditions of the contract
   with the employee’s company and, as appropriately coordinated with the contracting officer.
      2.6.1.1. All AF-owned IT assets furnished to contractors as Government Furnished
      Property (GFP) will be accounted for according to this AFMAN and DoDI 5000.64, (T-
      1).
      2.6.1.2. Establish the extent of contractor liability in the provisions of the applicable
      contract’s government property clause according to AFI 23-111.
 24                                                         AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014


   2.6.2. If contractor support employees are assigned to perform ECO duties under the terms
   of a contract, the AF retains responsibility for obligating funds and receiving assets as they
   are inherently governmental functions according to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
   Subpart 7.5, Inherently Governmental Functions.
   2.6.3. Contractors may function as ITECs (if according to and within the contract
   provisions) for DoD-owned IT assets.
   2.6.4. The Accountable Officer functions and responsibilities are defined by DoDFMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 12, Special Accounts, Funds and Programs, Chapter 7. Accountable
   Officers exercise substantive discretionary authority in determining the U.S. Government’s
   requirements and controlling government assets. The responsibilities of the Accountable
   Officer and the position of the Accountable Officer are not contractible.
       2.6.4.1. Contractors may perform functions in support of the Accountable Officer and
       functions where they are performing according to criteria defined by the U.S.
       Government and allowed by the contract terms and conditions. For instance, contractors
       can process requisitions, maintain stock control records, perform storage and
       warehousing, and make local procurements of items specified as deliverables in the
       contract.
       2.6.4.2. The administrative fund control is inherently a governmental responsibility. The
       contractor can process all required paperwork up to but not including funds obligation,
       which must be done by the government employee designated as responsible for funds
       control. The contractor can also process such documents as ROS and adjustments to
       stock levels, but approval must rest with the Accountable Officer. In all cases, the
       administrative control of funds must be retained by the government.
2.7. Active Duty General Officers (GO) and Senior Executive Service (SES) Civilians
Notebook Computers and Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs).
   2.7.1. The GO’s or SES’ current unit of assignment will purchase a GO and SES notebook
   computer/PED through the local CS (or equivalent) and follow the standard requirement
   process, (T-3).
   2.7.2. If desired by the GO or SES, the notebook computer/PED may accompany the GO or
   SES from assignment to assignment. This does not include devices with a commercial
   wireless service contract. The GO or SES will work with the losing and gaining unit to
   ensure proper inventory accountability, (T-2). The local ITEC retains accountability for the
   notebook computer/PED until transferred to the new location.
   2.7.3. When a GO or SES retires or leaves AF service, he or she must surrender the
   notebook computer/PED to the supporting ECO, (T-1).

Section 2B—Hardware Assets IT Systems Maintenance (Not Applicable to Non-AF Managed
Joint Service Systems)

2.8. Support Plans. Organizations develop an Acquisitions Strategy (AS), IT asset Life Cycle
Management Plan (LCMP), and/or Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) for IT assets they
procure according to AFI 63-101/20-101 to ensure logistics support throughout the expected
lifecycle.
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                     25


   2.8.1. A support plan includes planning and developing a spare and repair parts support plan,
   determining initial requirements, acquisition planning, distribution, and replenishment of
   inventory spares. A support plan also includes periodic reviews to assure that IT assets are
   sustained and upgraded as necessary in accordance with the target, implementation and
   operational baselines according to AFPD 33-4.
   2.8.2. Although there is no standard method to determine the quantity of spare equipment or
   repair parts to keep on hand, consider technical data such as mean time between failure rates,
   reliability data obtained from the manufacturer, and order and ship time from the source of
   supply when analyzing supply support. Personnel should also consider mission impact
   factors such as single point of failure and/or mission critical items. Ultimately it is the
   commander’s or maintenance superintendent’s decision based on past experience for low
   density/COTS systems that determine the number of on-hand spares necessary to ensure
   mission accomplishment.
   2.8.3. Regardless of the method used to determine the quantity of spare equipment or repair
   parts to keep on hand, the rationale/methodology used to determine the quantity will be
   documented in the AS/LCMP/LCSP.
   2.8.4. Any AS/LCMP/LCSP generated by organizations outside PEO C3I&N must be
   coordinated with applicable MAJCOM A6, HQ AFSPC/A4C, and approved by PEO C3I&N
   prior to acquisition of IT hardware.
2.9. Maintenance Management. Maintenance management requirements are necessary to
avoid risks to personnel, prevent damage to IT equipment, and ensure IT equipment availability
to meet mission. Touch maintenance shall not be performed by personnel who are not formally
task certified according to AFI 33-150, Management of Cyberspace Support Activities, and
appropriate 3DXXX Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP), (T-1). This includes
any action requiring removal of factory installed covers on electronic equipment for purposes
other than replacement of consumables (i.e. printer toner cartridges) designed by the
manufacturer as user replaceable items. This specifically includes hard drives, power supplies,
internal CD/DVD drives, and circuit cards.
   2.9.1. The headquarters or field-level unit determines if the IT hardware is considered
   mission critical or non-mission critical for maintenance management purposes.
   2.9.2. Maintenance personnel performing tasks on IT hardware follow the maintenance
   management requirements for mission critical and non-mission critical items according to
   Technical Order (TO) 00-33A-1001, General Communications Activities Management
   Procedures and Practice Requirements.
   2.9.3. Cannibalization may be used to satisfy an existing requirement or to meet priority
   mission requirements if it is the only option available to prevent mission impact. All
   cannibalization and documentation will be performed according to TO 00-20-3, Maintenance
   Processing of Reparable Property and Repair Cycle Asset Control System, (T-3). SCIF IT
   hardware assets are excluded from cannibalization actions.
   2.9.4. According to TO 00-20-2, Maintenance Data Documentation, Chief of
   Maintenance/Chief of Mission Systems Flight, CS, or designated representative approval is
   required before any cannibalization action on mission critical IT equipment is initiated.
 26                                                         AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014


   2.9.5. The CS Commander (or equivalent) or designated representative can approve
   cannibalization of operational non-mission critical IT equipment. The CS (or equivalent)
   must have procedures to ensure non-mission critical cannibalized IT assets are restored to
   full operational capability, (T-3).
   2.9.6. Maintenance actions to obtain assemblies, sub-assemblies, or parts are considered
   transfers and are not treated as cannibalization actions. The CS (or equivalent) may retain
   assemblies, sub-assemblies, or parts from spare IT assets for maintenance redundancy and
   operational spares when the communications unit has a maintenance or operational support
   mission.
   2.9.7. The CS Commander (or equivalent) may also approve the use of unserviceable IT
   hardware assets as a source for spare parts to maintain other IT equipment. This authority
   should only be used when allowed by the parent MAJCOM and a cost analysis clearly
   determines it is economically feasible to use excess assets instead of procuring new items,
   (T-2).
   2.9.8. Assemblies, sub-assemblies, and parts obtained for maintenance redundancy or
   operational spares are accounted for in the AFEMS-AIM. Ensure the IT asset status in the
   AFEMS-AIM is updated to identify these items as operational spares. Asset status codes are
   listed in Attachment 2.
   2.9.9. Prior to disposition of IT assets, warranty dates must be verified to ensure items are
   outside their warranty expiration, (T-3).
2.10. IT Systems Maintenance Reporting. Users with maintenance contracts document all IT
asset maintenance on vendor maintenance forms according to the appropriate/applicable
contract. HQ AFSPC/A4/7, in coordination with HQ AFSPC/A6, will specify procedures for
logging, documenting, collecting, processing, and filing copies of maintenance records according
to TO 00-33A-1001.
2.11. Computation of Payments. Contracts that apply to managed hardware assets.
   2.11.1. Effective Start Date for Rental or Lease. The effective date for rented/leased IT
   assets shall be clearly stated in the lease document – this may be a predetermined specific
   date or a date dependent upon the completion of specific testing and acceptance. A
   government-caused acceptance test delay may require payment for the delayed period.
   Consult the individual contract for specific guidance.
   2.11.2. ECOs compute charges for rented/leased IT assets, using available vendor forms.
   2.11.3. For AF-managed systems, the verifying activity refers to the equipment utilization
   reports and the input to the reports (IT assets/equipment orders and other appropriate
   records), to validate the services. Submit claims for credit within 60 calendar days (or as
   stated in the contract). The IT assets contract manager designates the verifying activity for
   non-AF managed systems (e.g., joint service systems).
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                      27


Section 2C—Transfer or Disposition of Hardware Assets

2.12. Guidance for Transfer or Disposition of Hardware Assets.
   2.12.1. The CS Commander (or equivalent) must ensure all assets in their DRA are cleared
   prior to closing that account (base closures, BRAC, mission changes, etc.). The CS (or
   equivalent) remains accountable for all assets until properly closed. Refer to AFI 23-111,
   Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force, for more specific
   guidance on accountable officer responsibilities. (T-1)
   2.12.2. Ensure the disposition of DoD computer hard drives and/or hard drive sanitization is
   performed according to AFMAN 33-282. IT assets within SCIFs will follow the Intelligence
   Community Directive 503, Committee on National Security Systems Instruction 1253 or
   other policies issued by national IC elements. (T-0)
   2.12.3. Software purchased with original equipment manufacturer IT is considered an
   integral part of the system. Therefore, the software must be maintained with the system. If
   the system is transferred, the software licenses must accompany the system. Transfer all
   software licenses with the system. Exception may be when the terms of the software license
   allows for software to be recoverable and reused upon decommissioning of system assets.
   (T-2)
2.13. Transferring Non-excess Hardware Assets to another Department of Defense
Component, Federal Agency, State, or Local Government. The transfer of non-excess IT
assets occurs when a function (i.e. base realignment and closure), and the IT assets acquired to
support that function, is transferred to another DoD component or Federal agency.
   2.13.1. The losing ITEC/PEC provides the losing ECO with a letter of transfer, signed by the
   losing commander documenting the transfer of the function and equipment.
   2.13.2. Ensure a DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, is signed and
   dated by a designated official from the shipping activity (Traffic Management Office or
   commercial carrier) and the ITEC/PEC. For local transfers where no shipping activity is
   involved, the gaining and losing ITEC/PEC signs the DD Form 1149.
   2.13.3. The losing activity ECO will account for the transferred hardware. The ECO will
   also identify excess hardware created as a result of the transfer of a function.
       2.13.3.1. The losing ECO and the gaining ECO or other accountable officer will:
           2.13.3.1.1. Identify and report maintenance contracts that supported transferred
           assets to contracting officials.
           2.13.3.1.2. Assist contracting officials, as required, in transferring contracts to the
           gaining activity.
   2.13.4. The losing ECO will:
       2.13.4.1. Update the asset status field in AFEMS-AIM using the codes in Attachment 2.
       2.13.4.2. Provide account records information to the gaining activity as required.
       2.13.4.3. Review all contract obligations with the gaining and losing activities and
       contracting officials. Pay close attention to any contract termination clauses (applies
 28                                                           AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014


       when extra maintenance has been paid for by the losing organization). Use currently
       established AFEMS-AIM guidance for the removal of items from an account.
       2.13.4.4. Review hardware assets release dates. Give adequate notice to the vendor to
       preclude payment of extra costs.
       2.13.4.5. Coordinate hardware assets release dates with other base functions, as required.
       2.13.4.6. Ensure hard drive sanitization according to AFMAN 33-282.
       2.13.4.7. Provide the hardware system database records or custodian report to the
       ITEC/PEC. The ITEC/PEC will add all applicable records regarding the transfer to their
       applicable ITEC/PEC electronic records.
       2.13.4.8. Properly inventory, package, warehouse, and secure equipment when storing
       hardware assets before transfer.
       2.13.4.9. Notify the AFEMS Help Desk to delete or archive the records of the equipment
       being transferred.
2.14. Excess Hardware. An item is considered excess when it is no longer required due to
mission change, equipment upgrades, technology changes, obsolescence, etc. The item is also
considered excess when the total quantity on hand exceeds the required quantity, as identified in
the technical solution/requirements document, plus the number of authorized spares as identified
in the AS/LCMP/LCSP. According to AFI 23-111, accountable individuals are responsible for
properly identifying, reporting, and determining correct disposition of unserviceable, reparable,
or excess property.
   2.14.1. MECOs or base CSs/ECOs, when permitted by their MECO, may develop their own
   excess hardware assets retention policies. However, the rationale for the retention policy
   must be approved by Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and documented
   in the AS/LCMP/LCSP.
   2.14.2. The ECO will authorize the ITEC/PEC to retain serviceable excess asset items for
   maintenance redundancy or operational spares if allowed by the parent MAJCOM.
   2.14.3. The ITEC/PEC will notify the ECO when hardware assets become excess NLT 30
   calendar days before the equipment goes off line if possible. This allows completion of the
   screening cycle while the equipment is still in use, eliminating the need to store excess assets.
   If not possible, until receipt of final disposition instructions, the ITEC/PEC will store the
   equipment to prevent damage, deterioration, or unauthorized cannibalization.
   2.14.4. Available AF excess assets can be located using DLADS at
   http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/. ECOs must use the AFEMS-AIM module to
   process any excess IT assets in AIM. Other methods or systems (DLADS Electronic Turn-in
   Documents [ETIDS]) may be used for non-sensitive IT assets not tracked in AIM.
   2.14.5. Dispose of and/or reuse classified media and systems according to remanence
   security guidance in AFMAN 33-282.
2.15. Obtaining Excess Resources.
   2.15.1. The ECO may direct hardware asset reutilization for new requirements or to replace
   equipment that does not meet minimum standards when allowed by the parent MAJCOM.
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                   29


   2.15.2. To acquire equipment from DLADS, the ITEC submits documentation (DD Form
   1348-1A) for coordination to the ECO. Assets can either be viewed at the DLADS location
   or researched at http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/.
   2.15.3. ECOs establish accountability in the AFEMS-AIM for hardware equipment acquired
   through any source that meets the criteria for accountability in accordance with this AFMAN.
2.16. Transferring Excess Hardware Assets to the DLADS.
   2.16.1. DLADS is the primary DoD agent for disposal of all obsolete, unserviceable, or
   excess military property and equipment. All AF hardware will be disposed of through the
   DLADS.
   2.16.2. DLADS guidelines for excess and the disposal of hardware assets can be found at
   http://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/.
   2.16.3. All media being disposed of or transferred to DLADS or another entity outside of the
   DoD will be sanitized and/or destroyed as applicable according to AFMAN 33-282.
   2.16.4. ECOs must establish an MOA with their servicing DLADS office in order to transfer
   IT equipment directly to local schools under the Computers for Learning Program.
   Donations of IT equipment to schools can only take place after completion of the mandatory
   DoD reutilization screening and then the IT equipment may be donated only to registered and
   qualified institutions identified by the DLADS.
   2.16.5. No IT assets can be donated directly to a school or other government entity without
   the approval of the DLADS.
   2.16.6. ECOs will use AIM generated 1348A to process DLADS disposals. ETIDS will not
   be used for these transactions.
2.17. Exchange or Sale of Government Automated Resources.
   2.17.1. Contract partners have programs designed to recover (give credit for equipment that
   still has market value) and recycle (dispose of hardware assets in an environmentally safe
   manner and replace due to obsolescence or un-serviceability) hardware assets. The proceeds
   or credit is applied toward the purchase of replacement government automation resources.
   See DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation and Defense
   Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), current edition, Part 217.70, Exchange
   of Personal Property, for more specific guidance.
   2.17.2. Adherence to disposal procedures in NIAP PPs or DoD STIGs is required. When
   those resources are unavailable or do not address disposal, following remanence security
   requirements according to AFMAN 33-282 is vital to all transactions relating to excess IT
   including warranty exchanges.

                           SOFTWARE ASSET MANAGEMENT

3.1. Software Assets General Guidance and Procedures. Software asset management shall be
centralized and managed at the highest level of common usage but no lower than the BSLM, (T-
2). The CS Commander (or equivalent) at each installation implements licensed COTS or other
software for local requirements not fulfilled by enterprise software licensing. The management
of software licenses at the base level does not include those software licenses that are managed
through enterprise software licensing programs. Software asset management program ensures
organizations that deploy and manage COTS software track software entitlements and
implementation information.
   3.1.1. Organizations will maintain a hard or soft copy of the software license inventory and
   “Proof-of-License Ownership” of GOTS/COTS software in use within their organization.
   3.1.2. Organizations will store proof of license agreements or licenses (e.g. user manuals,
   purchase documentation, CDs, etc.) and software media in a secure centralized location (e.g.,
   locked drawer, file cabinet, room, etc.) or electronically if applicable. Work with local
   Functional Area Record Manager or Base Records Management Office to ensure proper
   retention and disposition of official records and records approval in the office file system.
   3.1.3. Organizations will inventory all licensed software annually and, if available utilize
   auto-discovery tools, to track and report implemented software and license information. The
   Organization commander will certify the annual inventory with a handwritten or digital
   signature indicating completion of the inventory and submit to the BSLM (or equivalents).
   3.1.4. Organizations will audit all systems to ensure no illegal or unauthorized copies of
   software is installed. Sampling procedures may be used if active inventorying/auto discovery
   systems are available.
   3.1.5. Automated tools should be used to the maximum extent possible for tracking software
   installed on the base network where applicable. Note: AFEMS-AIM should not to be used
   for tracking software licenses.
   3.1.6. All implemented software must be certified for use according to AFI 33-210 and free
   of viruses and malicious logic.
   3.1.7. All common-user desktop/laptop software on new computer systems will comply with
   the AF SDC.
   3.1.8. The BSLM will annually instruct organizations and personnel on appropriate licensed
   software usage considering The Copyright Act, E.O. 13103, Computer Software Piracy, this
   AFMAN and applicable DoD guidance, (T-3).
       3.1.8.1. Coordinate instruction through the local JA office to ensure accuracy in the
       message before instructing how, and to what extent, a user may be held liable for
       unauthorized or illegal use of computer software.
       3.1.8.2. Place semi-annual reminders of the need for proper software license
       management in base bulletins and other media to increase and reinforce the legal
       requirement of maintaining software licenses according to their stated conditions.
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                       31

3.3. Software Developed Using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Office Software
Tools. Personnel are required to use licensed COTS office software to increase productivity and
overall organization effectiveness. Users must obtain approval from the CS (or equivalent)
before developing shared single-user, networked multi-user, or “group” computer applications
built with COTS office software tools. This precludes later impact on network and server
capacity, avoids duplication of effort on similar application software within the installation or
MAJCOM, and ensures continued software support after departure of one or more of the original
user-developers, (T-1). AF user-developers shall:
   3.3.1. Ensure the AF retains property rights to the computer software developed in the
   course of their duties, (T-1).
   3.3.2. Not bypass computer and network server operating systems, security systems, or
   access controls provided by higher authority, (T-1).
   3.3.3. Provide the CS Commander (or equivalent) a software documentation package in
   appropriate digital format, (T-2). The software package must include:
       3.3.3.1. The author or point of contact, organization, and telephone number.
       3.3.3.2. A descriptive unclassified title with version number as the first delivery (use
       Version 1.0).
       3.3.3.3. A brief (one paragraph) unclassified description of the software’s functionality
       for use in publishing software catalogs; and a classified description, if necessary, to more
       fully explain the software’s capabilities.
       3.3.3.4. A brief description of all testing performed on the mission application software
       and its databases.
       3.3.3.5. A brief user’s guide. The user’s guide should include:
           3.3.3.5.1. The hardware configuration required.
           3.3.3.5.2. The supporting software required including the operating system and any
           supporting COTS software with version release number.
           3.3.3.5.3. Compiling and linking instructions, if applicable.
           3.3.3.5.4. Descriptions of the software installation process, required hardware setup,
           menus, and software capabilities and functions.
           3.3.3.5.5. Samples of output screens and print products produced (if any).
           3.3.3.5.6. Other information useful for continued effective use and maintenance of
           the mission application software.
3.4. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Software
Development, Reuse, and Release. Adhere to DoDD 4630.05,                 Interoperability and
Supportability of Information Technology (IT) and National Security Systems (NSS); DoDI
4630.8, Procedures for Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology (IT) and
National Security Systems; and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6212.01E,
Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology and National Security Systems
when developing mission or application software for C4I systems.
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                      33


  3.4.1. Do not develop software organically unless quality, cost, performance, schedule, or
  interoperability requirements cannot be met with COTS or non-developmental item software.
  Develop requirements for IT capabilities in accordance with AFPD 10-6, Capabilities-Based
  Planning & Requirements Development.            This applies to AF Program Objective
  Memorandum (AFPOM)-funded units.
     3.4.1.1. Acquire an approved mission needs statement before developing organic
     software requiring over 6 man-months of effort or costing in excess of $50,000. If
     software is developed organically through a contractor, the contract must contain the
     proper FAR/DFAR clauses on data rights.
     3.4.1.2. All units that develop or maintain software will have a software process
     improvement (SPI) program and a documented SPI plan, including at least:
         3.4.1.2.1. A baseline of their current capabilities.
         3.4.1.2.2. Goals and milestones they intend to reach.
         3.4.1.2.3. Metrics to measure their progress toward their goals and milestones.
         3.4.1.2.4. Timeline for SPI appraisals. The Software Technology Support Center
         (STSC) at Hill Air Force Base, Utah is available on a fee-recovery basis for SPI
         appraisals, but any qualified SPI appraiser may be used.
         3.4.1.2.5. Identify life-cycle support requirements for the life of developed software.
  3.4.2. Government Software Release or Disclosure. It is AF policy to release, upon
  consideration of a valid written request, specific software developed with government funds,
  which is a government work (created by government personnel) or software created by a
  contractor where the AF has a government rights license. Release of software by the AF is
  not permitted if it violates a copyright or terms of a contract. The OPR for the software is the
  approval authority to release or disclose that software. Additional approval may be required
  at a higher level depending upon the recipient in accordance with AFI 16-201, Air Force
  Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program. When not for foreign release and the
  OPR is in doubt regarding the release of software, send the request to SAF/CIO A6 for
  resolution. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests must be sent to the local FOIA
  manager to control and respond using guidelines in the AF supplement to DoD 5400.7-
  R_AFMAN 33-302 (DoD 5400.7-R), Freedom of Information Act Program.
     3.4.2.1. Before releasing the software, the OPR shall require the requester to sign a
     MOA. The MOA shall be written to govern maintenance and support relationships for
     the software or document the lack of these relationships if the OPR will not provide
     support.
     3.4.2.2. Releases of AF-owned or developed software from software reuse libraries, or
     software under AF-industry Cooperative Research and Development Agreements
     (CRADA), are exceptions to this policy.
  3.4.3. When developing mission or application software for information systems, it is
  desirable to utilize the Software Engineering Institute’s Software Capability Maturity Model
  Integrated (CMMI) as advised by the STSC (http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil), or the Systems
  Engineering Process (SEP), maintained by the Program Executive Office for Business and
 34                                                        AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014


   Enterprise                    Systems                  (AFPEO                         BES)
   (http://public.gunter.af.mil/applications/sep/menus/Main.aspx).
3.5. Software Configuration, Change, and Release Management. Use AF IT Services
Methods and Procedures Technical Orders (MPTOs) for Configuration Management and Change
Management as applicable. Use ISO/IEC 20000, or Information Technology Infrastructure
Library (ITIL), Configuration Management, Change Management, and Release Management
processes to plan, identify, control, monitor, verify, and manage software configuration items.
Typically, software configuration items would include information such as purchase order
number, purchase date, software manufacturer, software title, and version implemented.
   3.5.1. AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist, will be used for software and software license
   management as needed.
   3.5.2. Program managers and software developers must integrate information assurance into
   their systems using guidance contained in AFPD 33-2 and the AF 33-200 series publications.
   These publications give policy guidelines for developing and using the computer,
   communications, and emissions security programs needed for all AF communications and
   information systems.
   3.5.3. The AF is committed to meeting the DoD objective of developing interoperable and
   maintainable systems based on open standards. DoD and AF guidance identifies a common
   set of mandatory IT standards and guidelines used in all new systems and system upgrades in
   the DoD. To that end, system developers, contract administrators, and maintainers must:
       3.5.3.1. Adhere to the guidance given in the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture
       (DoDIEA).
       3.5.3.2. Adhere to the guidance given in the target, implementation, and operational
       baselines according to AFPD 33-4.
       3.5.3.3. Each unit ensures that upgrades to systems under maintenance comply to the
       maximum extent possible with the DoDIEA and AF baselines as they are updated.
   3.5.4. The AF is committed to sharing AF information to those with a validated need for the
   information. To that end, it is important that architectural artifacts capture the roles and
   permissions of users of AF information, in context of the supported mission and business
   processes, and that authorization and access to AF information is provisioned to support the
   defined roles and permissions.
   3.5.5. Software reuse is the practice of using existing software components to develop new
   software applications. Software reuse benefits the AF through increased developer
   productivity, improved quality and reliability of software-intensive systems, enhanced
   system interoperability, lowered program technical risk, and shortened software development
   and maintenance time.
       3.5.5.1. Reusable software components may include executable software binaries, source
       code segments, program documentation, project plans, requirement descriptions, design
       and architecture documents, database schemas, test data and test plans, user’s manuals,
       software tools, and object classes.
AFMAN33-153 19 MARCH 2014                                                                   35


         3.5.5.1.1. These assets are most efficiently reused when designed to fit into a
         product-line architecture for a mission area or functional domain using standard
         interfaces and common communications protocols.
         3.5.5.1.2. Domain product-line components can be used to create families of related
         systems designed to share a common software architecture for the domain.
     3.5.5.2. The AF Integration Test Lifecycle Capability maintains a software reuse library
     or repository for internal sharing of the reusable software components developed at the
     location.
  3.5.6. The AF is faced with restrictions on the amount of information that can be provided to
  our forces, particularly in remote areas of the world. Therefore, software designers and
  developers must discipline themselves in the quantity and content of non-mission essential
  information sent over supporting network infrastructures (that is, ensuring sending only
  operationally necessary data).
     3.5.6.1. In addition to DoD direction, follow all policy and procedures in AFMAN 33-
     152, User Responsibilities and Guidance of Information Systems on downloading from
     the Internet, transmission of email attachments, video teleconferencing, Web browsing,
     and conservation measures during periods of surge or network degradation.
     3.5.6.2. AF-developed software (including that developed specifically for the AF) will
     accommodate network infrastructure considerations into its systems design and internal
     code, such that it does not overtax the infrastructure on which it relies and operates.
  3.5.7. The AF will develop new software capabilities only as a last resort if no other
  solutions satisfy requirements. When developing software, focus should be on web-centric
  application development without dependence on specific client platforms so that the end-user
  device can be agnostic to the mission application: Unless technically or operationally
  unfeasible, all services developed or procured will comply with the following key elements:
     3.5.7.1. Be based on bounded user requirements with all information assets described
     through detailed business process re-engineering and generating Quality of Service
     (QoS), performance, and access rules consistent with associated architecture products,
     support plans and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
     3.5.7.2. Be web-enabled with data made visible, discoverable, and accessible using open,
     standard, lightweight protocols and techniques.
     3.5.7.3. Be clientless with all web services and applications accessible securely via
     standard web browsers from AF-standard desktops or other edge devices.
     3.5.7.4. Utilize strong two-way authentication using public key infrastructure (PKI)
     when available.

Terms
Accountable Officer—An individual appointed by proper authority who maintains items and/or
financial records in connection with government property, irrespective of whether the property is
in his or her possession for use or storage, or is in the possession of others to whom it has been
