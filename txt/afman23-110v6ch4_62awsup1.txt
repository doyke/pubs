AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 4 is supplemented as follows: This publication supplements pro-
cedures required to implement and maintain a Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP). It applies to
all organizations and tenant units physically located at McChord Air Force Base that generate economi-
cally reclaimable quantities of precious metals. The metals covered in the PMRP include gold, silver, plat-
inum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, osmium, and ruthenium. It implements DOD Directive 4160.22,
AFPD 23-5, AFI 31-209, AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 4, and T.O. 00-25-113-C17.
Program Objectives: The Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP) is established to ensure precious
metals are reclaimed, refined, and used for authorized internal purposes. Due to the Department of
Defense (DOD) increased emphasis in precious metals, all Air Force activities must ensure internal con-
trols and security measures are put into effect. Emphasis is also required in accounting, documentation,
and safeguarding of these metals at all levels.
4.2.9. Installation PMRP manager will visit each participating activity at least once every 12 months.
4.9.2. All precious metal bearing property will be turned in to the base Precious Metals Recovery Pro-
gram Manager (62 LRS/LGRDCI) for transfer to the servicing DRMO.
4.19. (Added) Unit PMRP Monitor responsibilities:
4.19.1. (Added) Appoint, in writing, a primary and alternate PMRP monitor as required. Letters of
appointment will be forwarded to 62 LRS/LGRDCI. Letters are to include names and ranks of primary
and alternate monitors, phone number, squadron, flight, section, type of recovery equipment, kind of pre-
cious metal bearing scrap generated, and the kind of fine precious metals and high content precious metal
items used, such as anodes, brazing, and solder which have controlled item code "R" assigned. Monitors
will ensure compliance with the provisions of the PMRP within their respective organizations.
4.19.2. (Added) Maintain or have ready access to applicable technical order in the 00-25-113 series (Air-
craft Maintenance), AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 4--Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP),
and AFI 31-209--The Air Force Resource Protection Program. (CD-ROM).

4.19.3. (Added) Maintain records for use of fine precious metals and turn-in of fine precious metals,
scrap, and end items not on accountable supply records.
4.19.4. (Added) Appoint, as applicable, individual(s) to harvest silver flake and sludge from an electro-
lytic unit and/or change cartridges.
4.19.5. (Added) Ensure that a disinterested party (one who does not operate the equipment or harvest the
silver) witnesses the harvesting and also weighs the flake and/or sludge or cartridge and signs the turn-in
document as being accurate.
4.19.6. (Added) Maintain a self-inspection program to include periodic testing of hypo solution draining
from electrolytic/cartridge units to ensure they are operating properly and compliant with receipt, issue,
and turn-in requirements.
4.19.7. (Added) Provide the PMRP Manager with the results of any items being tested for the presence of
precious metals.
4.19.8. (Added) Maintain auditable records of receiving, issuing, handling, and using fine precious met-
