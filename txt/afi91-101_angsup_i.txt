                                PROGRAM INFORMATION

1.1. Goal. The goal of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program is to incorporate
maximum nuclear surety, consistent with operational requirements, from weapon system
development to retirement from the inventory.
1.2. Safety Standards. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program ensures personnel
design and operate nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems to satisfy the safety standards
in Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 3150.2, DOD Nuclear Weapon System Safety
Program. The DOD safety standards are:
     1.2.1. There shall be positive measures to prevent nuclear weapons involved in accidents or
     incidents, or jettisoned weapons, from producing a nuclear yield.
     1.2.2. There shall be positive measures to prevent DELIBERATE prearming, arming,
     launching, or releasing of nuclear weapons, except upon execution of emergency war orders
     or when directed by competent authority.
     1.2.3. There shall be positive measures to prevent INADVERTENT prearming, arming,
     launching, or releasing of nuclear weapons in all normal and credible abnormal
     environments.
     1.2.4. There shall be positive measures to ensure adequate security of   nuclear weapons,
     pursuant to DODM S-5210.41-M_AFMAN31-108V1, The Air Force                Nuclear Weapon
     Security Manual, DODM S-5210.41-M_AFMAN31-108V2, General                 Nuclear Weapon
     Security Procedures, and DODM S-5210.41-M_AFMAN31-108V3,                 Nuclear Weapon
     Specific Requirements.

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Commanders’/Directors’ Emphasis. Commanders at all levels are responsible for the
success of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program. Commanders MUST emphasize that
safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons are important to the United States.
The following is not an all inclusive list of restrictions dealing with nuclear weapons.
Commanders should review the Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR) for their specific weapon
system(s) found in AFIs 91-111 thru 91-117.
   2.1.1. Do not use nuclear weapons to troubleshoot faults, that is, to confirm a fault exists, to
   aid in fault isolation, or to verify fault correction. AFI 91-107, Design, Evaluation,
   Troubleshooting, and Maintenance Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems, contains specific
   guidance.
   2.1.2. During exercises, do not wear complete chemical ensembles when handling war
   reserve nuclear weapons. Remove the gas mask (to aid in identification) and gloves (to
   ensure weapons are not inadvertently damaged).
   2.1.3. Storing nuclear weapons in one facility and conventional munitions in another facility
   within the same weapons storage area (WSA) is not considered simultaneous presence and
   does not require MAJCOM approval. Conventional munitions inherently part of a nuclear
   weapon system and/or nuclear weapon component (e.g. forward shroud, forward section,
   electrical explosive devices, and limited life components) located in the same assembly,
   surveillance, and inspection (AS&I)/maintenance and inspection (M&I), vault or storage
   facility are not considered simultaneous presence. Do not store nuclear weapons and
   conventional munitions together, except:
       2.1.3.1. As part of flightline or protective aircraft shelter operations conducted according
       to nuclear weapon system safety rules.
       2.1.3.2. The MAJCOM/CC may approve the temporary storage of nuclear and
       conventional munitions within a WSA facility to facilitate the warehousing of these
       materials in order to meet immediate operational requirements. AFMAN 91-201,
       Explosive Safety Standards, and Technical Order (TO) 11N-20-7, Nuclear Safety
       Criteria, contain specific guidance. Reference AFMAN 91-201 for storage requirements
       of nuclear weapon components within a weapons storage and security system (WS3)
       vault.
       2.1.3.3. The Wing/CC may approve the immediate storage of nuclear and conventional
       munitions within a WSA facility for 72 hours in the event of fire, flood, or natural
       disaster, or if the nuclear storage facility can no longer be secured and initiate
       PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV) procedures prescribed in
       AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Storage for more than 72 hours requires
       MAJCOM/CC approval.
       2.1.3.4. Storage of nuclear and conventional munitions within a WSA facility for more
       than 90 days requires a waiver be granted by AF/SE. At a minimum, the waiver shall
       include a mitigation plan containing: the reasons for requesting the waiver, risk
 6                                               AFI91-101_ANGSUP_I 27 FEBRUARY 2012


        assessment, any corrective action or actions to ultimately correct the waiver, and
        expected duration of the waiver. While the waiver is in existence it will be reviewed at
        least quarterly by the affected Wing/CC and MAJCOM/CC for validity and progress
        updates.
     2.1.4. Implement local procedures to:
        2.1.4.1. Prohibit direct overflight, in airspace controlled by the base, of WSAs, weapon
        movements, nuclear loaded aircraft, and aircraft shelters with nuclear weapons inside.
        Over flight of aircraft shelters where the weapons inside are secured in a WS3 vault is
        permitted.
        2.1.4.2. Ensure aircraft with forward firing ordnance, to the maximum extent possible,
        are not parked pointed toward Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) flightline operations
        and active convoy routes.
        2.1.4.3. Ensure aircraft with forward firing ordnance are limited, to the maximum extent
        possible, from sweeping across PNAF flightline operations and active convoy routes.
        2.1.4.4. Prohibit direct overflight of PNAF aircraft during ground operations within that
        airspace controlled by the base.
