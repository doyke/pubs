This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 23-2, Management of US Air
Force Bulk Petroleum and Related Products, and is used in conjunction with AFI 23-201, Fuels
Management. It establishes the 673d Air Base Wing’s Management of Hydrant Utilization
rate/goal and identifies the procedures used for reporting bi-annual hydrant survey results to HQ
PACAF/ A4RP. In accordance with AFI 23-201, paragraph 6.6.2. It incorporates local Joint
Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER) procedures to manage the efficient use of the wing hydrant
systems. This publication applies to all 3rd Wing and transient aircraft units but does not apply
to the US Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard units and members. Compliance with this
instruction cannot be waived. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication
to the Office Of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication. Route the AF Form 847 through the appropriate chain of command.
Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS). See Attachment 1 for a Glossary of References and Supporting

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Though
the local hydrant goal has not changed for the Wing, the process in which the Fuels Management
Flight collects the data has, as identified in paragraph 3.

1. General. JBER has three Type III Hydrant Refueling Systems designed to support medium
and large frame aircraft via 42 hydrant outlets. These systems provide efficient fuel support and
should be used to refuel and defuel aircraft whenever fuel requests exceed 5,499 gallons.
2. Hydrant Usage Goals. A joint survey was conducted with members from the Operations,
Maintenance, and Logistics Readiness Groups to develop an optimum hydrant usage goal. A
goal of 80 percent was agreed upon by all attendees. The approved goal of 80 percent will
remain valid until support capabilities or mission support requirements change.
3. Hydrant Utilization Procedures. Monthly, the Fuels Management Flight will query the
month’s fuel issues (greater than 5,499 gallons) using the Fuels Manager Defense System in
accordance with AFI 23-201 paragraph 6.6. The Fuels Management Flight will monitor the
hydrant utilization rate and report to the 673 LRS/CC when rates fall below 80 percent. These
procedures will be used to report bi-annual hydrant survey results to HQ PACAF.
4. Information Collections. No information collections are required by this publication.
