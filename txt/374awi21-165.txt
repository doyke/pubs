                                           Chapter 1

              FLYING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

1.1. Guidance. The Lead Major Command (MAJCOM) for Mobility Air Forces (MAF) is Air
Mobility Command (AMC). As the Lead MAJCOM, AMC is responsible for providing
guidance for MAF assets worldwide. In this capacity, they have published an AFI 21-
101_AMCSUP, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, governing aircraft
scheduling procedures. 374 AWI 21-165, Aircraft Flying and Maintenance Scheduling
Procedures, covers First-Look Requirements, Annual Flying Hour Allocation, Quarterly,
Monthly, and Weekly Scheduling. Additionally, coordination procedures for schedule changes
are detailed.
1.2. Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. Wing Current Operations (374 OSS/OSO) is responsible to the 374 OG/CC for the
     management of 374 AW Operations and Maintenance (O&M) hours. Additionally, 374
     OSS/OSO is the focal point for all Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) missions
     tasked by PACAF Air Mobility Division (AMD). TWCF hours are managed by
     AMC/A3TR.
        1.2.1.1. AMC/A3TR monitors monthly O&M and TWCF data by drawing from
        Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) reports. 374 OSS/OSO will
        audit G081 hours to ensure the monthly data is accurate by the 15th of the following
        month.
        1.2.1.2. 374 OSS/OSO is responsible for preparing monthly reports on Flying Hour
        Program (FHP) for distribution to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF).
     1.2.2. Maintenance Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (374 MOS/PS&D) is responsible
     to the 374 MXG/CC for maintaining historical data and for the development of wing
     maintenance plans.
     1.2.3. The 374 OG/CC and the 374 MXG/CC share responsibility for the overall execution
     of the weekly schedule.
1.2.4. The 374 AW/CC will approve the annual Flying Hour Program (FHP) and the
monthly/weekly schedule.
1.3. Annual Planning.
     1.3.1. AMC distributes annual flying hours IAW AFI 11-101, Management Reports on the
     Flying Hour Program. This initial allocation does not take contingencies into account and is
     based on Programmed Aircraft Authorization (PAA) rather than aircraft actually on station.
     When aircraft are deployed, scheduling agencies will work together to adjust the program to
     a more realistic goal based on Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) schedules, Time
     Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) programs, exercises and off-station trainers.
     1.3.2. The purpose of the annual planning cycle is to balance projected flying hour
     requirements (AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program Management) with projected maintenance
     capabilities (AFI 21-101_AMCSUP). The annual planning cycle begins with development of
374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012                                                                         5


   First Look Requirements on or about 15 March each year.             First Look Requirements
   generation methodology is identified in AFI 21-101_AMCSUP.
   1.3.3. 374 MXG and 374 OG will develop and agree upon a standard weekly shell based on
   training requirements and tail availability not later than the end of the annual planning cycle.
1.4. Quarterly Planning.
   1.4.1. IAW AFI 21-101, quarterly requirements will be provided by 374 OSS/OSO to 374
   MOS/PS&D no later than (NLT) 25 days before the beginning of the quarter. Quarterly
   planning is discussed during the weekly scheduling meetings. A rolling three-month plan
   satisfies the intent of quarterly planning.
   1.4.2. On a weekly basis, 374 OSS/OSO will notify 5 AF/A3O of all out-of-country
   exercises and Off Station Trainer’s (OST’s) for the following month.
1.5. Monthly Planning. Follow instructions IAW AFI 21-101.             The monthly planning is
discussed during the weekly scheduling meetings.
1.6. Weekly Scheduling. The weekly schedule is the final refinement to the monthly plan and
results in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule. The weekly scheduling meeting takes
place every Wednesday, and a separate meeting chaired by both 374 MXG/CC and 374 OG/CC
will take place every Thursday. At a minimum, the agencies in attendance will be: 374
OSS/OSO, 36 Airlift Squadron (AS), 459 AS (as needed), 374 Aircraft Maintenance Squadron
(AMXS)/ Maintenance Aircraft (MOO or Supt, and Production Superintendent), 374
Maintenance Squadron (MXS/ Maintenance Aircraft (MXA), 374 MOS/PS&D and 374
Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS)/Combat Mobility Flight (CMF). The group-approved
schedule will be compiled into an Air Movement Table (AMT) by 374 OSS/OSO and shall be
submitted to 374 MOS/PS&D for compilation. A complete paper copy shall be given to the 374
AW/CC at/before the Friday Wing Stand-up, or at a time designated by the 374 AW/CC.
   1.6.1. 459 AS will provide the 374 MOS/PS&D with a schedule from the Patriot Excalibur
   (PEX) system, which reflects the known flying plan for the following week, NLT 1400 on
   Thursdays. 374 MOS/PS&D will include the schedule in the Weekly Flying and
   Maintenance Schedule to be signed by the 374 MXG/CC, 374 OG/CC, and 374 AW/CC
   1.6.2. 374 OSS/OSO will annotate on the weekly and daily flying schedule all mission
   unique requirements, including but not limited to: tire wear limits, increased Liquid Oxygen
   (LOX) requirements, secure voice, chaff & flare, Frequency Modulation (FM) immunity,
   extra oxygen bottles, aircrew signs & plaques, special air show requirements, unimproved
   runway preparation, Diplomatic (DIP) clearance aircraft, Flying Crew Chief (FCC)
   requirements and Mode IV/IFF.
   1.6.3. Once the weekly Flying and Maintenance Schedule is reviewed and signed by the 374
   MXG/CC, 374 OG/CC, and 374 AW/CC, it becomes the final schedule for both operations
   and maintenance and the basis for deviation reporting. Follow it as printed or as amended by
   coordinated changes. 374 MOS/PS&D distributes next week’s schedule to each appropriate
   activity and work center via email NLT 1200 Friday. Weekly flying and maintenance
   schedules may be transmitted electronically via SharePoint.
 6                                                               374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012


1.7. Changes to the Weekly Flying and Maintenance Schedule.
     1.7.1. Daily flight schedules are derived from the weekly schedule and are provided to the
     appropriate agencies via the Global Decision and Support System II (G2). G2 is NOT the
     official record until changes have been coordinated.
     1.7.2. AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination. IAW AFI 21-101, AF
     Forms 2407 are used to coordinate with, and inform affected agencies of changed schedule
     information. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF Form 2407 and coordinates
     it through the affected Pro Super, Operations Officer/Maintenance Superintendent, and
     required group staff agencies (i.e., 374 MOS/MOC, 374 MOS/PS&D, etc). Any change to
     the printed schedule will require an AF Form 2407 with the following exceptions: a change
     to the original printed takeoff or landing time of 15 minutes or less; a change of aircrew
     names, ranges, or airspace; or a change arising after the first crew ready time for the
     squadron’s current day’s scheduled flying window.
        1.7.2.1. 459 AS will finalize next day’s flying schedule NLT 1600L. Any changes to the
        flying schedule after this time will require an AF Form 2407 be generated and routed
        appropriately.
        1.7.2.2. AF Form 2407 Approval Authority. All AF Form 2407 changes that add aircraft
        and/or sorties or increase the flying window require both 374 OG/CC and 374 MXG/CC
        approvals.
     1.7.3. Tail Number Swaps. 374 AMXS will make every effort to interchange aircraft at the
     daily maintenance production meeting the day prior to the aircraft’s scheduled flight.
     Interchanges made after the daily maintenance production meeting and before the unit’s first
     crew ready time the next day, require an AF Form 2407 be coordinated through required
     agencies. In the event that an assigned tail is Not Mission Capable (NMC) and a spare is
     listed on the flying schedule, 374 AMXS will execute a tail swap NLT crew show time per
     the Sequence of Events (SOE). If the aircraft status changes to NMC after crew show, the
     Production Superintendent in coordination with the aircrew will decide whether to tail swap
     based on the NMC condition, ETIC, and mission requirements.
     1.7.4. TWCF Missions. For AMD directed schedule changes on TWCF missions, 374
     OSS/OSO will initiate the AF Form 2407.
     1.7.5. An AF Form 2407 will be generated at the start of an exercise to cancel local flying
     for the affected days/week. All AF From 2407’s generated during an exercise require
     MXG/CC and OG/CC approval.
     1.7.6. Combat sortie generation will include operations using Air Tasking Orders.
     Operations and Maintenance shall meet daily to discuss ATO schedule during combat sortie
     generation. A schedule derived from an ATO is applicable to all affected organizations and
     no AF Form 2407 is required to implement the new schedule. All changes after the new ATO
     derived schedule has been published, up to the first unit crew show time, will be documented
     and coordinated on an AF Form 2407. Unlike a planned sortie surge, early and late take-offs
     are recorded on second and subsequent sorties, unless an ops change is made to the ATO.
     Normal deviations will be recorded against all sorties using the new published schedule
     derived from the ATO.
374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012                                                                         7


1.8. Maintenance Debriefing.
   1.8.1. Aircrew will normally conduct formal maintenance debriefings immediately following
   their flight.
   1.8.2. During off station missions greater than three days, the AC or flying crew chief will
   ensure all AFTO Form 781s, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, are faxed or
   scanned following the last sortie of the day, or as soon as practical. (Debrief Fax: 315-225-
   6032).
1.9. Mission Launch Sequence.
   1.9.1. All mission support and preflight activities will be accomplished IAW the Sequence
   of Events (SOE) at Attachment 2. Items in boldface print are considered on the critical path.
   All agencies supporting the aircraft launch will monitor their respective timeline events in the
   launch sequence via G2. In the event of a takeoff deviation, the agency responsible for the
   first critical path item to delay the sequence will accept responsibility for the deviation.
   Every effort will be made to block out on time. Exception: After notifying Command Post,
   crews flying tactical missions may adjust takeoff time, based on the latest computer flight
   plan, to make time on target. The sequence of events will remain the same up to ―Engine
   Start.‖ Engine start will be based on the adjusted takeoff time.
   1.9.2. Departure SOE times will be tracked in G2. Maintenance will report critical path
   event completion to Command Post at earliest convenience or when making the off-the-deck
   call. 374 MOS/MOC will record all takeoff deviations (-21/+15) for and discuss process
   breakdowns with squadron and group leadership at the daily maintenance meetings. In the
   event of a departure delay, 374 MOS/MOC will distribute copies of the late mission’s
   departure SOE to all agencies supporting the launch.

                                             Chapter 2

                             FLYING SCHEDULE DEVIATIONS

2.1. Purpose. This chapter defines flying schedule deviations as previously published in the
rescinded PACAF Supplement to AFI 21-165. The deviation tables have moved to the AFI 21-
101_AMCSUP, but do not provide the same level of detail as the old regulation. This chapter
serves to clarify these deviation codes. The cornerstone of a successful flying schedule is
understanding how the flying and maintenance schedule is executed in comparison to the
original plan. The differences between scheduled and actual events are recorded while executing
the flying and maintenance schedule and are called deviations. Recorded deviations are the
beginning of a process aimed at improving unit flying and maintenance operations. Deviation
data is recorded so follow-up analysis can identify appropriate corrective actions when
necessary.
2.2. Requirements. The 374 MOS/MOC is responsible for documenting deviations to the
weekly flying schedule and determining the cause of each deviation. 374 AMXS maintenance
supervision will monitor deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication. All
deviations will be recorded IAW this publication and AFCSM 21-565, Volume 2, CAMS/IMDS
Operational Event Subsystem, Software User Manual.
2.3. Flying Schedule Deviations. A flying schedule deviation is any departure from the printed
weekly flying and maintenance schedule. Deviations apply to the printed weekly flying and
maintenance schedule and will be recorded even though a coordinated change may be
accomplished using an AF Form 2407. When a unit coordinates a change using an AF Form
2407, the unit is informing everyone of the changed information. Do not record multiple
deviations against a single line entry, except for additions that air abort or cancel, spares that air
abort and late takeoffs that air abort. For deviation reporting purposes, the AFTO Form 781 will
be the source document for takeoff/landing data. Personnel entering deviations in G081 will
provide a detailed explanation for all deviations in the remarks section and a Job Control
Number in G081, as applicable. Flying schedule deviations fall into one of the following
categories:
     2.3.1. Ground Deviations. Ground deviations are events occurring before aircraft takeoff.
     All ground deviations are recorded in G081 and used in flying scheduling effectiveness
     calculations unless otherwise noted. Specific ground deviations are:
        2.3.1.1. Addition (AD). An aircraft or sortie added to the flying and maintenance
        schedule and not printed on the weekly flying and maintenance schedule. Additions will
        be recorded against the agency Operation’s (OP), Maintenance (MX), or Head Quarters
        (HQ) requesting the additional sortie or aircraft. Maintenance additions are rare and
        occur only when maintenance requests a specific aircraft or sortie solely for maintenance
        purposes without an operational requirement for the change (i.e., phase or hangar queen
        management). Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Operational Check Flights (OCFs)
        whose primary purpose is to perform maintenance checks are not additions. FCF/OCF
        sorties and sorties originating off-station without home-unit support (e.g., Maintenance
        Repair/Response Teams - MRTs) will be considered "scheduled-as-flown‖ without
        recording deviations.
374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012                                                                         9


Note: Scheduled maintenance and the ability of maintenance to support additional requirements
must be carefully considered before adding sorties. All additions, including FCFs/OCFs, will be
coordinated and approved at the group-level using AF Forms 2407 IAW paragraph 1.7.2.
       2.3.1.2. Cancellation (CX). An aircraft or sortie that is removed from the printed
       schedule for any reason. If a cancellation results from a deviation in a previous go of the
       same aircraft, record the deviation against the agency that caused the original deviation.
       Replacing a scheduled aircraft with an aircraft not on the printed weekly flying and
       maintenance schedule results in cancellation of the original sortie and an addition for the
       new aircraft line.
       2.3.1.3. Early Takeoff (ET). An early takeoff deviation is a scheduled sortie launching
       more than 20 minutes prior to publish takeoff time.
       2.3.1.4. Ground Abort (GA). A ground abort is an event after crew show time that
       prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from becoming airborne. Ground aborts are categorized
       as maintenance Ground Abort, Before Engine Start (GAA), Ground Abort, After Engine
       Start (GAB), and Ground Abort, After Taxi (GAC), operations, Higher Head Quarter
       (HHQ), weather, sympathy, other, etc. The difference between a ground abort and a
       cancellation is after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel. A
       ground abort by itself is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as canceled sortie
       or late takeoff. Ground aborts on FCFs or OCFs will be recorded in G081, but not used
       when computing Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE). Ground aborted missions flown
       by a spare aircraft will not be included when computing FSE.
           2.3.1.4.1. If the original aborted aircraft is launched on the original scheduled
           mission but exceeds late takeoff criteria, the sortie will be recorded only as a late
           takeoff.
           2.3.1.4.2. If an aircraft lands Code 2 or 3 and takes a spare aircraft, only the spare
           action is recorded.
       2.3.1.5. Late Takeoff (LT). A late takeoff occurs when a scheduled sortie becomes
       airborne at 15 minutes or more after the published takeoff time. If the printed tail number
       ground aborts and is replaced by a spare that takes off late, only the late takeoff is
       computed in FSE. If a late takeoff is caused by a late takeoff in a previous go of the same
       aircraft, record the deviation against the agency that caused the original delay.
       2.3.1.6. Spare (SP). A spare is a designated aircraft on the printed flying and
       maintenance schedule to be used in case a scheduled aircraft cannot fly its scheduled
       sortie. Spares can include previously added, cancelled, aborted, flown, cross-country, or
       FCF/OCF aircraft on the same day’s flying and maintenance schedule. Do not count
       printed spares flown in scheduled lines as deviations when computing FSE. Note: Use of
       spares will be discussed between Pro Super and Ops.
       2.3.1.7. Interchange/Tail Number Swap (TS). Interchanges are changes to the printed
       flying and maintenance schedule involving aircraft tail numbers printed on that day's
       flying and maintenance schedule. Interchanges may include changing aircraft in printed
       line numbers with printed spare aircraft or to different printed line numbers. Interchanges
       do not include aircraft not printed on that day in the printed weekly flying and
       maintenance schedule. Interchanges made after crew show on a crew ready aircraft
 10                                                             374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012


       should be charged as a ground abort. Interchanges made after the daily maintenance
       production meeting and prior to the first crew ready time the next day require AF Form
       2407 coordination. The 374 MOS/MOC must be notified of all interchanges. Record all
       interchanges in G081. Interchanges that result in a late takeoff will be coded as a late
       takeoff. Do not count interchanges as deviations when computing FSE.
   2.3.2. Air Deviations. Air deviations are events occurring after takeoff and are recorded in
   G081, but not included in FSE calculations. Air deviations are recorded to enable thorough
   analysis of aircraft and maintenance performance. Air deviations fall into the following:
       2.3.2.1. Air Abort (AA). An aircraft/sortie that cannot complete its mission for any
       reason. Air aborts are considered a sortie flown when reporting total sorties flown. Air
       aborts will be coded to the agency or condition that caused the aborted mission. An air
       abort will not be recorded when malfunctions occur during the "Before Takeoff
       Checklist" portion of helicopter sorties. Note: Effective mission decisions will be made
       by operations. A non-effective mission does not necessarily mean an air abort occurred.
       For example: a sortie where all planned mission tasks were completed, but the mission
       was non-effective due to uncompleted training events, would not be coded as an air abort.
       Do not count air aborts as deviations when computing FSE.
2.4. Deviation Causes. Deviations will be assigned a primary cause. 374 MOS/MOC will
contact the agency that is recorded against the deviation and a determination of the primary
cause will be made by all involved agencies. Conflicts in deviation cause code assignment will
be referred to Maintenance Operations Flight supervision and if necessary, resolved by the 374
MOS/CC. Deviations resulting from a sequence of events delay will be the first delayed event in
the sequence of events, and will be assigned a primary (root) cause. Deviations will be assigned
one of the following causes:
Note: Use x for any character for MAJCOM/local use.
   2.4.1. Maintenance (MTx). Deviations resulting from aircraft discrepancies, unscheduled
   maintenance, or actions taken for maintenance consideration.
   2.4.2. Operations (OPx). Deviations resulting from operations/aircrew actions including
   mission changes, aircrew substitutions, aircrew illnesses (including short notice aircrew
   physical/mental disqualifications), and over-stressing the aircraft. OP will also be used for
   deviations resulting from Operations Group-controlled operations factors including those
   caused by quiet-hours, mission/load planning, life support, intelligence, mission changes that
   require new airspace or range times, base operations and Mission Essential Personnel
   (MEPs).
   2.4.3. Supply (SUx). Deviations as a result of supply delivery time exceeding the allowable
   standard in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, and the aircraft was not replaced by a
   spare.
       2.4.3.1. Cancellations resulting from a documented Not Mission Capable Supply
       (NMCS) or Partially Mission Capable Supply (PMCS) status condition will be charged to
       supply.
       2.4.3.2. Late takeoffs/cancels due to late delivery of Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants
       (POL) will be charged to 374 LRS/Fuels Management Flight. A late takeoff for POL
374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012                                                                        11


     delivery can only be assessed if LRS has been given adequate time to respond to a fuel
     request. LRS needs at least 45 minutes to fulfill requests and may be extended depending
     on current workload. A late request for fuel will be charged to maintenance.
  2.4.4. Higher Headquarters, MAJCOM (HQT), NAF (HQN), and Other (HQP). Deviations
  resulting from guidance outside unit/wing control. Guidance may include alert tasking, HQ-
  directed quiet hours, airspace/route/range denials/closures, depot schedule changes, DV
  traveler requirements or other external, customer-driven changes. When an aircraft printed in
  the weekly flying and maintenance schedule as a HQ-directed alert or off-base mission is
  replaced by a spare, one of the following options may be used:
     2.4.4.1. The originally scheduled prime aircraft remaining on base may fly the sorties of
     the departed aircraft for the remainder of the week.
     2.4.4.2. Scheduled sorties may be interchanged with a printed spare aircraft on each
     day's flying and maintenance schedule.
  2.4.5. Weather (WXx). Deviations resulting from weather conditions. Units may add
  sorties to the flying schedule to compensate for higher than projected weather losses.
  2.4.6. Sympathetic (SYx). Deviations occurring when a flight of two or more aircraft, under
  the command of a flight leader or instructor pilot are canceled, aborted, or late due to a
  cancellation, abort, or delay of one of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Record
  deviations caused by aircraft/missions in previous scheduled flights using the cause of the
  earlier deviation – not SY. Flights engaged in training with other units and delayed by the
  other unit will record the delay as sympathy. Sorties replacing sympathy aborts or sympathy
  cancellations on the same day will be recorded as sympathy additions. Sortie deviations
  caused by scheduled tanker/receiver and/or mission events will be recorded as sympathy
  (e.g., Airborne Warning and Control System support, Minimum Interval Takeoff causing
  takeoff delay or cancellation). Sortie deviations caused by another unit’s or command’s
  support will be coded as sympathy.
  2.4.7. Air Traffic Control (ATx). Deviations resulting from air traffic control issues such as
  flight clearance delays, tower communication failures, conflicting air traffic, runway
  changes, runway closures or ground emergencies affecting aircraft movement.
  2.4.8. Other (OTx). Deviations resulting from unusual circumstances not covered by other
  causes listed. OT deviations may include:
     2.4.8.1. Malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to equipment undergoing tests
     or evaluations associated with Operational Testing and Evaluation (OT&E).
     Development Testing and Evaluation (DT&E), or Initial Operational Testing and
     Evaluation (IOT&E).
     2.4.8.2. Unusual circumstances such as bird strikes, damage during air refueling, and
     unscheduled alert swap out.
     2.4.8.3. Equipment. Deviations caused by National Airborne Operations Center or Air
     Intelligence Agency or Air Force Material Command equipment, and other support
     equipment.
12                                                            374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012


     2.4.8.4. When an aircraft is off-station and cannot return for a scheduled sortie/mission,
     record an OTx deviation for the reason the aircraft was unable to return. The deviation
     narrative will be specific (maintenance, operations, weather, etc.).
  2.4.9. Utilization (UTE). Deviations resulting from commander-directed UTE management.
  2.4.10. Exercise, Higher Headquarters (EXH).            Deviations resulting from higher
  headquarters directed exercises including alarm and force protection conditions.
  2.4.11. Exercise, Local (EXL). Deviations resulting from wing/unit directed exercises
  including alarm and force protection conditions.

                   AIRCREW/AIRCRAFT TASKING SYSTEM (AATS)

3.1. Background. Aircrew/Aircraft tasking System (AATS) is a mechanism for 13 Air Force
(AF) to allocate both aircrews and aircraft between AMD and 374 AW. AMD must have a
stable number of aircrews and aircraft to task for missions and 374 AW must have a stable
number of aircrews and aircraft to support training and other requirements. In order to
accomplish this stability, 36 AS, 374 MOS/PS&D, and 374 AMXS will complete an aircraft
accountability worksheet (tally sheet) each week. This tally sheet takes the number of assigned
crews, examines Duty Not Including Flying (DNIFs), training, etc. to determine the number of
available crews each week. For detailed instructions for completing AATS, see the PACAF
Concept of Operations (CONOPS).
3.2. Squadron Responsibilities: The 36 AS will complete and forward the aircrew availability
for the next two weeks to 374 OSS/OSO NLT Tuesday 1200. 374 MOS/PS&D will complete
the aircraft availability for the next three weeks and forward to 374 AMXS NLT Monday 1400.
The 374 AMXS will forward their approval to 374 OSS/OSO NLT Tuesday 1200.
3.3. Current Operations Responsibilities: 374 OSS/OSO will validate the tally sheet and
inform the squadron of any discrepancies. The official worksheet will be presented to the 374
OG/CD and 374 MXG/CD during the weekly scheduling meeting. 374 OSS/OSO will email the
AATS worksheet to 613 AOC/AMDL and courtesy copy PACAF A3Tv3 NLT 1400
Wednesday.
 14                                                              374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012


                                           Chapter 4

                     CARGO MOVEMENT AND SPACE BLOCKING

4.1. The movement of non-billable cargo is a complex process that requires significant
coordination and cooperation between the 36 AS, 374 MXG, 374 OSS/OSO, 374 LRS, and
730 Air Mobility Squadron (AMS). It is imperative that Aircraft Commander/Mission
Commander (AC/MC) work closely with these agencies when planning off station missions that
require the movement of support equipment, airdrop and air-land equipment, or aircraft assets.
Moreover, when adding Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) to the Aircrew Flight Authorization,
it is important the 36 AS schedulers coordinate with 374 OSS/OSO to ensure the necessary
amount of additional seats are space blocked in G2.
4.2. Guidance. Defense Transportation Regulation 4500.9R, Part II is the governing regulation
for all cargo movement. If cargo is hazardous, AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials
for Military Air Shipments, must also be complied with. The guidance in this instruction is
intended to clarify and simplify those regulations.
4.3. Types of Cargo. When coordinating for movement of wing-owned cargo on wing aircraft,
it is necessary to understand the terminology used for different types of non-billable cargo. Any
cargo not covered by these definitions will require a billable accounting code for AMC handling.
   4.3.1. Aircraft Assets. Aircraft Assets are defined as assets which are installed components
   or in direct support of the aircraft which is being operated (i.e., parts contained in the
   Readiness Spares Package [RSP], spare tires, spare propeller, etc.). The RSP must be for
   exclusive use by the transporting aircraft. In a 3-ship package, one aircraft may carry the
   RSP that will support the entire package. However, parts being moved as part of a
   Maintenance Recovery Team (MRT) should be prepared and manifest as billable cargo.
   4.3.2. Equipment in Direct Support of the Mission. This is defined as specific assets which
   are required to support a specific O&M aircraft mission (i.e., MOTHER, computers, printers,
   fax machines, etc.).
   4.3.3. Aircrew Baggage. Aircrew baggage includes, but is not limited to, personal clothing,
   professional equipment, other items necessary for the health, welfare, and morale of the
   aircrew and MEP on the flight authorization orders.
4.4. Transportation Accounting Code (TAC). TACs are needed for any cargo handled by
AMC. Air Force Special Assignment Mission (FSAM) TAC is a non-billable AMC TAC for
non-channel Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) cargo.                 PACAF/A4RD has
coordinated with AMC and approved the use of FSAM TAC for wing aircraft carrying wing-
owned, aircraft maintenance related cargo to repair/recover an aircraft. Unit TACs must be used
for all other movements (i.e., PACAF TWCF funded missions).
4.5. AMC Requirements. In order for 730 AMS to load/unload cargo, it must be prepared and
palletized by the user. A DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, with a
valid TAC is required. The user will deliver tasked cargo to Outbound Cargo (374
LRS/LGRDDCO) at the Transportation Management Office (TMO), building 4145. TMO will
insure the cargo is loaded into GATES for In-Transit Visibility (ITV) and airworthy. TMO will
374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012                                                                    15


then deliver the cargo to the 730 AMS for manifesting and loading. Only after these
requirements have been met, will 730 AMS load/unload manifested cargo from an aircraft.
4.6. Types of Movement.
   4.6.1. When cargo and passenger movements requiring Operation Plan (OPLAN),
   CONPLAN, or HHQ Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD), and/or
   Disaster/Humanitarian coordination are assigned to 374 AW aircraft, the 374 AW Installation
   Deployment Officer (374 AW/IDO) will receive/obtain a copy of tasking from the
   headquarters level tasking authority to move cargo and/or passengers. The IDO will
   immediately provide copies of the tasking to supporting agencies; 374 AW units,
   group/squadron commanders, the 730 AMS representatives, as required. The IDO will
   stand-up Wing deployment/reception work centers as needed to support taskings. The
   preparation/processing of cargo and passengers will be IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Defense
   Transportation Regulation, Part III, AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, and
   the Installation Deployment Plan (IDP).
   4.6.2. When cargo and passenger movement is part of a PACAF Exercise (i.e., Cope Tiger,
   PAR, Red Flag), it is usually classified as a TPFDD and handled as described in paragraph
   4.6.1. Mission Commanders (MCs) should coordinate with different users to come up with a
   draft load plan. Each user will process cargo as described in paragraph 4.6.1 and coordinate
   with the MC on the overall load plan. The MC’s draft load plan should be given to the Wing
   deployment/reception workcenters to aid in building the final load plan.
   4.6.3. Airdrop/Air-land Training Equipment. 374 LRS/CMF is responsible for preparing,
   loading, and off loading all 36 AS airdrop and air-land training equipment on all home
   station training missions (to include Fuji Range and Draughon Range). Airdrop and air-land
   training equipment is defined as Container Delivery System bundles, Heavy Equipment, pet
   rocks, and combat offload pallets. This equipment will be noted on the published weekly
   schedule. When training equipment is required for off station trainers (i.e., equipment will
   not be dropped or offloaded at home station), 374 LRS/CMF will coordinate with 374
   LRS/LGRD to process and manifest the equipment as cargo using the FSM TAC.
   4.6.4. Aircrew Baggage (as defined in paragraph 4.3.3.) should not be loaded by 730 AMS
   or 374 LRS/CMF, even if palletized. 374 OSS/OSK should maintain qualified forklift
   drivers to load these pallets.
4.7. Aircraft Assets Space Blocking Procedures. Space blocking in G2 is provided for
visibility and planning purposes. It does not take the place of ITV (GATES) and does not
require AMC (730 AMS) to process the cargo. Only Aircraft Assets (as defined in paragraph
4.3.1.) and MEP can be space blocked. 374 OSS/OSO is responsible for inputting the necessary
space blocking remarks in G2. Users should coordinate during/prior to the weekly scheduling
meeting, but NLT 24 hours prior to mission departure.
   4.7.1. O&M Off Station Missions.
       4.7.1.1. Asset owners will contact 36 AS/Central Scheduling and inform them of how
       many pallet positions need to be space blocked.
 16                                                              374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012


      4.7.1.2. The Asset owner is responsible for palletizing and weighing the cargo and
      informing the Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) of weights for load planning
      purposes.
      4.7.1.3. The 36 AS/Central Scheduler will notify 374 OSS/OSO. 374 OSS/OSO will
      place the following comment in G2: IAW AMC MSG 27 JUN 06-MOVEMENT OF
      AIRCRAFT ASSETS. SPACE BLOCK XX PALLETS FOR AIRCRAFT ASSETS (also
      provide pallet type, i.e., ―ISU 90‖, and weight).
   4.7.2. TWCF Missions.
      4.7.2.1. Prior to Execution, 374 OSS/OSO will notify 613 Air Operation Center
      (AOC)/Air Mobility Division Airlift Plans (AMDL) to insert the necessary comments

Terms
AATS—Aircrew/Aircraft Tracking System is a tasking tool that takes into account limitations
imposed by aircrew and aircraft availability.
Addition—A sortie or aircraft added to the printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule.
Air Abort—An airborne aircraft that cannot complete its primary or alternate mission for any
reason.
Air Deviation Code—A deviation from the scheduled sortie flight plan occurring after aircraft
takeoff.
Cancellation—An aircraft or sortie removed from the printed flying and maintenance schedule
for any reason.
Crew Ready—An aircraft properly inspected, fueled, with required weapons loaded, necessary
maintenance actions completed, the exceptional release signed off (for the first flight of the day)
and the tail number passed to operations. Units develop and publish specific crew ready times
for each assigned MDS as agreed upon by the 374 MXG/OG CCs.
Crew Show—The time the aircrew arrives at the aircraft. Units develop and publish specific
crew show times for each assigned MDS as agreed upon by the 374 MXG/OG/CCs.
Daily Maintenance Production Meeting—A meeting chaired by the 374 MXG/CD to prioritize
maintenance requirements as required by AFI 21-101, Chapter 3, paragraph 3.5.1.
Deviation—A departure from the printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule.
Early Takeoff—Scheduled sorties launched more than 20 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff.
Do not record early takeoff deviations for hot pit turn sorties.
374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012                                                                           39


Exercise—A unit or higher headquarters event designed to test or evaluate an organization's
plans, procedures, and operational/maintenance capabilities. Exercises can be a combat sortie
generation, or an unscheduled local or higher headquarters tasking. Operational readiness
inspections and wing directed operational readiness evaluations are combat sortie generations.
Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE)—The rate used to determine how well the flying and
maintenance schedule was executed.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)—The flight of an aircraft, in accordance with the applicable
dash –6 manual, to verify aircraft airworthiness.
Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC),
operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy, other, etc. The difference between a ground abort and a
cancellation is after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel. A ground
abort by itself is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as canceled sortie or late takeoff.
Higher Headquarters (HHQ)—A controlling agency normally above wing level.
Interchange—Tail number swap made to the flying and maintenance schedule IAW paragraph
2.3.1.7.
Late Takeoff—A scheduled sortie launched more than 14 minutes after scheduled takeoff time.
Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE)—A measurement used to determine the
percentage of scheduled maintenance actions actually started on the dates published in the
weekly flying and maintenance schedule.
Operational Check Flight (OCF)—The first flight of an aircraft after extensive maintenance or
downtime and not requiring an FCF. The primary purpose of an OCF sortie is to perform
system(s) operational checks.
Operations and Maintenance Day (O&M)—Monday through Friday, not including federal
holidays or foreign national holidays when flying is not permitted.
Scheduled Sortie—An aircraft scheduled for flight by tail number on the weekly flying and
maintenance schedule. Functional Check Flights (FCF) and Operational Check Flights (OCF)
are excluded.
Scheduled Maintenance Action—A maintenance requirement printed in the flying and
maintenance schedule.
Sortie—An operational flight by one aircraft. A sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move
forward on takeoff or takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne
flight when the aircraft returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the
engines are stopped, or the aircraft is on the surface for 5 minutes, whichever occurs first or b) a
change is made in the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. Consider missions
where some crewmembers deplane and the remaining original crew re-launch as a continuation
of the original sortie - (AFI 11-401).
Spare—An aircraft designated as a spare on the printed flying and maintenance schedule.
Spares are aircraft printed in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule that have been
identified as ―spare or SP‖, canceled or aborted, aircraft flown in an earlier sortie, or an aircraft
 40                                                              374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012


released after FCF/OCF. Spare aircraft, IAW the definition above, flown in a scheduled sortie
are not included as deviations in FSE calculations.
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)—Established to finance the operations of the
Single Manager Operating Agency for Airlift Service. TWCF pays for operating costs, which
are replenished by charging airlift users for services performed. It is also used as a management
tool to promote the efficient use of the airlift by-product of AMC's peacetime training program.
Weekly Flying and Maintenance Schedule—The schedule, agreed to by operations and
maintenance and signed by the 374 MXG/OG/AW/CCs, to support the unit's flying and
maintenance requirements. In this publication, it is referred to as the "flying and maintenance
schedule."
374AWI21-165 16 MAY 2012                                                                     41

                              SEQUENCE OF EVENTS (SOE)

Note: The tables below direct the latest time that an event may be completed without disrupting
the flow of the mission and causing a deviation. The intent is to establish a routine ―no later
than‖ time for completion. If Mission Commanders and schedulers determine more time is
necessary for mission preparation, an earlier time should be scheduled.
