                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose.
1.1.1. This instruction provides guidance on how to implement the Defense Production
Act (DPA) of 1950 (50 U. S.C. App § 2061 et seq.) and the Department of Commerce (DOC)
Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) Regulation (15 CFR 700). It describes rated
orders, the organizations responsible for implementing DPAS, and procedures for processing
rated orders and obtaining Special Priorities Assistance (SPA). This instruction also describes
the process for direct investment in developing or sustaining industrial capacity and provides
detailed procedures for the Air Force national security review of foreign direct investments in or
acquisitions of US companies under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States (CFIUS).
1.2. Applicability.
   1.2.1. This instruction applies to AF programs throughout the lifecycle, as well as AF
   purchase orders that are designated as “highest” or “critical to” national urgency. This
   instruction also applies to activities that maintain industrial base capabilities and to any
   foreign acquisitions of US industrial capabilities key to national security.
1.3. Background.
   1.3.1. Congress enacted the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App § 2061
   et seq.) to provide the President the authority to ensure the nation’s industrial resources
   would be made available in a timely manner to support national security needs for products,
   equipment, materials, and services. The DPA is not a permanent law; it must be periodically
   reauthorized. The DPA has three titles.
   1.3.2. Title I, Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS). Title I provides the
   President with authorities to put defense orders placed with domestic companies ahead of
   commercial orders placed with these same firms. Defense orders are assigned an industrial
   priority rating of either “DO” or “DX”. The “DX” rating is authorized by the Secretary of
   Defense in support of programs of the highest national urgency. The industrial priority rating
   cascades from the prime contractor down through all subcontractors. A rated order placed
   with a supplier takes precedence over all non-rated orders and must be filled ahead of the
   non-rated orders as needed to meet required delivery dates. DPAS also provides for Special
   Priorities Assistance (SPA) through the Department of Commerce to enable national security
   programs to address unique needs.
   1.3.3. Title III, Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply. The authorities provided in
   Title III enable the President to authorize direct investment in developing or sustaining
   industrial capacity in areas determined critical to national security. Title III provides
   authorities to make investments in domestic industrial capabilities but typically does not have
   its own appropriations. Congress first authorized the DPA Title III program in 1950 to
   enable industry to mine and produce materials for the Korean War. Title III continues to
   adapt to changing defense needs and today creates capacity for a diverse set of advanced
   materials.

    1.3.4. Title VII, Authority to Review Certain Mergers and Acquisitions. Title VII gives the
    President the authority to block or undo the foreign acquisition or investment in cases
    involving domestic industrial capabilities key to national security. This Presidential authority
    is exercised through the CFIUS chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. The committee
    determines the impact on national security of foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies and
    provides a recommendation to: allow the transaction to proceed, mitigate the risk to national
    security, or block the transaction. The Department of Defense (DoD) is a standing member
    of the Committee represented by the Secretary of Defense. The Deputy Assistant Secretary
    of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy (DASD(MIBP)) is the DoD official
    with primary responsibility for CFIUS matters.
