1. Overview. HQ AETC/IA is responsible for oversight, policy, and advocacy of all AETC
international programs including, but not limited to, Military Personnel Exchange Program
(MPEP), review of training requirements for Foreign Military Sales cases received through the
Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT), foreign national visits, foreign
disclosure, and other programs involving contact with foreign militaries, foreign governments,
international organizations, and their government representatives.
2. General Information. AETC supports the US national security policy by conducting
international activities to build partnerships that further coalition warfighting capability, enhance
collective security, build partnership capacity, and foster international cooperation. HQ
AETC/IA oversees these activities, providing assistance to AETC organizations. Furthermore,
HQ AETC/IA provides a central point of contact for international matters for the Command and
is the initial coordination agency for all international visits to AETC organizations. However,
this authority does not extend to oversight of the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program
(ENJJPT) or ENJJPT supporting activities.
3. Foreign Visits. HQ AETC/IA supervises all AETC international visitor programs.
    3.1. Foreign Visit Notifications. Notification of international visits to AETC units
    normally occurs through one of several channels: direct communication from HQ AF Foreign
    Liaison Division (HAF/CVAI) for a Chief of Staff Air Force Counterpart Program visit;
    project officer notification or coordination from another country, major command, combatant
    command, and/or Air Staff; direct notification from the HQ AETC Command Section; and
    receipt of a Foreign Visit Request from the Department of Defense’s (DoD) International
    Visit Program’s Foreign Visit System.
    3.2. HQ AETC/IAD. Inform HQ AETC/IAD of all foreign visit requests, including direct
    requests to individual organizations and invitations by AETC units. AETC organizations will
    report all visit requests to HQ AETC/IAD when contacted by offices other than HQ
    AETC/IAD.
AETCI16-101 8 APRIL 2010                                                                      3


     3.1.1. Foreign Visit Requests (FVR):
         3.1.1.1. An FVR to visit an AETC organization is submitted by the requesting
         Embassy into the Foreign Visit System no later than 30 days prior to the proposed
         visit. DoD forwards the request to Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force,
         International Affairs, Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Division
         (SAF/IAPD), who forwards it to HQ AETC/IAD via the security policy automation
         network (SPAN). HQ AETC/IAD uses SPAN to pass the FVR to the unit via the
         appropriate numbered Air Force (NAF) or AU for coordination.
         3.1.1.2. If the unit can support the FVR as requested, the unit commander will
         identify a point of contact (POC) to include name, grade, telephone number, and
         office symbol within the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the visit. If the
         unit cannot support the FVR as requested, the unit commander will provide
         alternative dates. HQ AETC/IAD will pass the unit’s response to SAF/IAPD via
         SPAN.
     3.1.2. U. S. Government (USG) Sponsored Visits. For USG-sponsored visits, no
     requirement exists for foreign governments to submit an FVR or security assurances to
     participate in these types of visits when classified or controlled unclassified information
     will not be disclosed.
         3.1.2.1. In situations where foreign visitors are traveling to AETC organizations on
         USG-issued invitational travel orders, HQ AETC/IAD will create an internal FVR for
         foreign visits sponsored by US Embassies (USEMB) and/or combatant commands
         (COCOM). These sponsored visits support DoD objectives. SAF/IAPD has
         determined no foreign government assurances regarding visiting members’ security
         clearances are necessary since the information being disclosed will neither be
         classified or controlled by export laws.
         3.1.2.2. AETC units will notify HQ AETC/IAD of proposed USEMB and COCOM-
         sponsored visits so HQ AETC/IAD can assist them in planning and coordinating such
         events. Once notified, HQ AETC/IAD will use SPAN to create an internal Air Force-
         only visit, and staff to other authorities as required to ensure the visit is vetted
         appropriately. The FVS visit record will then be used to document disclosure
         guidance for the AETC visit POC.
     3.1.3. Supportability Check. Prior to formal visit tasking, HQ AETC/IAD may
     perform a supportability check with AU, 2 AF, and/or 19 AF to determine the appropriate
     unit to support a foreign DV visit. A supportability check does not constitute formal
     tasking to the unit; it determines whether a unit has the resources and time available to
     host and support a foreign DV visit. The supportability check should also evaluate which
     unit should appropriately support a specific foreign DV visit (or which unit is appropriate
     to support a specific foreign visit), proposed timing, and base schedules.
  3.2. Categories of Visits. International DV visits to AETC are a matter of command
  interest and must receive every consideration to ensure visit requirements are met in a
  professional manner. Responsibilities for hosting foreign national visits generally fall into
  one of two categories: visits to AETC organizations in San Antonio, and visits to all other
  AETC organizations.

    3.2.1. Visits to the San Antonio Area. (The San Antonio area includes Randolph AFB,
    Lackland AFB, Fort Sam Houston, and AETC organizations at Camp Bullis.) The visit
    OPR for international visits to AETC within San Antonio is determined by several
    factors: the visitors’ rank, specific individuals they are visiting, the purpose of the visit,
    and organizations the foreign visitors wish to visit. The visit OPR will coordinate base
    operating support functions with the 502d Air Base Wing ( 502 ABW) for all
    international visits to AETC organizations in the San Antonio area while visits to specific
    offices will still be arranged through the parent organization. For instance, the visit OPR
    would arrange transportation and billeting support requirements for an international DV
    visit to basic military training (BMT) at Lackland AFB with the 502 ABW and
    coordinate BMT mission briefings and orientation tours through the 37th Training Wing
    (37 TRW).
       3.2.1.1. General Officer and Civilian Equivalent Visits. HQ AETC/IA will
       coordinate with HQ AETC/DS and the HQ AETC/Command Section to assign the
       visit OPR who will be responsible for coordinating all arrangements for foreign Air
       Chiefs, general officer and above, or civilian equivalent visits to AETC. HQ
       AETC/IA will also arrange foreign general officer visits when multi-base visits are
       planned to organizations at Randolph AFB and Lackland AFB and perform a
       supportability check to coordinate timing and base schedules.
       3.2.1.2. Visits by Colonels (O-6) and Below. In coordination with HQ AETC/IA,
       AFSAT will coordinate all arrangements for international visitors in the rank of
       colonel and below planning to visit organizations at Randolph AFB. AFSAT will also
       arrange international visits for colonels and below when multi-base visits are planned
       to organizations at Randolph AFB and Lackland AFB.
       3.2.1.3. HQ AETC Directorate and Tenant Organization Visits. HQ AETC/IA
       will coordinate with HQ AETC/DS and HQ AETC Command Section to identify and
       appoint the appropriate AETC directorate or tenant organizations to serve as visit
       OPR when foreign visitors (general officers, colonels and below) are visiting
       Randolph AFB (or Lackland AFB) for a specific purpose and there is no HQ
       AETC/CC/CV (or their representative) involvement. For instance, HQ
       AETC/A2/3/10 would handle a general officer visit from the United Kingdom if the
       sole purpose of the visit was to review unmanned aerial system officer and sensor
       operator training. Likewise, Air Force Recruiting Service would handle a team of
       foreign lieutenant colonels if the goal of the visit was to review enlisted and officer
       recruiting strategies.
       3.2.1.4. Lackland AFB Only Visits. As required, 37 TRW and 59th Medical Wing
       will host and organize all foreign visit support arrangements when international
       visitors (to include general officers, civilian equivalents, and colonels and below) are
       specifically visiting Lackland AFB and there are no planned AETC-level activities or
       involvement. However, depending on the rank and position of the visitor, HQ
       AETC/IAD will ask HQ AETC/CC/CV (or offer to appropriate leadership) if they
       would like to meet the DV.
    3.2.2. Visits to all other AETC Organizations. Many international visitors to AETC
    organizations visit Air Force bases outside San Antonio. HQ AETC/IAD will coordinate
AETCI16-101 8 APRIL 2010                                                                       5
