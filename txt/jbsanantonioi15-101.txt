                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 802d Operations Support Squadron (802 OSS) Weather Flight (WF) or
(JBSA WF) provides or arranges weather services and support to JBSA and other associate units
assigned to LAFB. The WF is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for all weather services
for JBSA at LAFB. This instruction establishes requirements and outlines duties and
responsibilities of the WF and for reciprocal support requirements with other JBSA and LAFB
agencies.
1.2. Implementation. This instruction covers daily operations to include exercise and
contingency operations. Unless superseded by Emergency War Orders, this instruction will be
followed during wartime operations.
1.3. Concept of Operations. The WF is the single point of contact for weather information and
will provide or arrange all weather services for units assigned for JBSA and LAFB. The WF
leverages the support of the 26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS) for 24-hour
forecasts, Meteorological Watch (METWATCH), and resource protection services.
     1.3.1. Delineation of Duties. Weather duties are split between the WF and the 26 OWS.
     The WF is the focal point for all weather support for at JBSA and LAFB.
     1.3.2. Airfield Operating Hours. The Airfield is normally open Monday-Thursday 0700-
     0230L and Friday-Sunday 0700-2300L. During airfield operating hours, the WF will provide

     provided by 26 OWS IAW Air Force Instruction (AFI) 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and
     Responsibilities. At a minimum, services provided include resource protection in the form of
     forecasted/observed watches, warnings, and advisories. During hours of closure, the WF will
     have a forecaster on-call to provide weather support for: severe weather events,
     Distinguished Visitor (DV), Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC), operational contingency
     missions, or any other resource protection issue.
1.4. Transient Aircrew Services. IAW AFMAN 15-129, Air and Space Weather Operations -
Processes and Procedures, paragraph 4.6, transient aircrews can receive flight weather briefings
from the JBSA WF IAW standard duty priorities or they can contact their home station WF or
the 26 OWS briefing cell. (See Para 4.4.)
1.5. Duty Priorities. The duty priorities of the WF are outlined in Tables 1.1. and 26 OWS in
Table 1.2. These priorities were developed IAW AFMAN 15-129 and exist to balance limited
manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities focus efforts during peak work periods prone
to task saturation and priority conflicts. Weather technicians will use sound judgment when
complying with these duty priorities, especially where there is imminent danger to life and
property.

   2.2.1. The WF maintains hours corresponding to Airfield hours – (typically Mon-Thu 0700-
   0230L and Fri-Sun 0700-2300L). Exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis for airfield
   closures in conjunction with federal holidays.
       2.2.1.1. A forecaster will be on duty whenever the airfield is open.
       2.2.1.2. Staff services will be available Monday-Friday 0730-1630L, with the exception
       of federal holidays.
   2.2.2. During hours of airfield closure, 26 OWS will provide METWATCH and resource
   protection services for JBSA and LAFB. The WF maintains at least one forecaster on on-call
   at all times to be recalled for duty.
   2.2.3. In the event any of the following criteria is met at scheduled closure time, the WF will
   not close until the criteria is no longer a factor.
       2.2.3.1. A watch or warning for Tornadoes, Hail > ¾ inch, freezing precipitation, > 1
       inch of snow and/or winds > 50kts.
       2.2.3.2. LAFB airfield remains open for any other reason.
2.3. On-Call Forecaster Recall:
   2.3.1. The WF maintains a forecaster on-call at all times. This forecaster is available to be
   recalled anytime the WF leadership, 26 OSW,, and/or the 502 CP notifies them of a need
   (operational, meteorological or as per 502 ABW, 802 MSG or 802 OSS/CC) to reopen.
   Upon recall, the on-call forecaster will report to the WF office and will notify the 26 OWS
   and 502 CP upon arrival.
   2.3.2. In the event any of the following criteria occur during airfield closed hours, the on-call
   forecaster will be recalled.
       2.3.2.1. A watch or warning for Tornadoes, Hail > ¾ inch, Freezing Precipitation, > 1

2.4. Meteorological Equipment:
   2.4.1. Open Principal User Processor (OPUP) also known as Next Generation Radar
   (NEXRAD). The WF is a principle member of the Unit Radar Committee for the NEXRAD
   Radar Product Generator (RPG) located in New Braunfels, Texas. The WF uses the OPUP,
   which displays graphic and alphanumeric data critical to the timely detection of tornadic
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                              11


   circulation within thunderstorms. The OPUP obtains data via a dedicated line to the RPG
   and is the most important piece of equipment for the WF in terms of
   maintenance/communications restorative priorities. The WF maintains the OPUP while the
   radar and RPG are maintained by the National Weather Service and contracted maintenance.
   If the OPUP fails, some backup radar data is available over the Internet.
   2.4.2. AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Station. The FMQ-19 is an integrated
   system of multiple weather sensors and data automation components that continually
   measure environmental conditions to provide responsive, reliable, accurate, real-time weather
   data to all supported agencies. The FMQ-19 measures airfield weather conditions to include
   but not limited to wind direction, wind speed, present weather, runway visual range,
   visibility, cloud heights as well as coverage, temperature, dew point, station pressure, and
   lightning detection
2.5. Communication Equipment:
   2.5.1. JET is the Air Force Weather’s (AFW) primary communications and computer
   software system. AFW uses JET hardware and desktop software to transmit data to, and
   receive data from weather agencies worldwide via the internet.
      2.5.1.1. The WF and 26 OWS use JET locally to disseminate observations, forecasts,
      advisories, watches, and warnings to the 502 CP, ATC, SOF, Maintenance Control,
      flying squadron CP and/or duty desks, and Crisis Action Team (CAT). If JET
      malfunctions in any office on base, that office should immediately inform the WF for
      troubleshooting and repairs. If the WF cannot perform resolve the outage they will refer
      the problem to the Help Desk at AFWA and will track the outage.
      2.5.1.2. In the event of a JET outage, the dissemination of watches, warnings, advisories,
      TAFs, observations, etc., will be limited to fax, email, and/or phone notification to only
      the agencies listed in Table 2.1. If available, watches, warnings, and advisories issued by
      the 26 OWS will continue to be disseminated using Integrated Weather Warning
      Capability (IWWC) and calls from the WF will be considered a back up. In addition to
      voice dissemination to the listed agencies, all observations will be uploaded through
      JAAWIN for long line availability.

   2.5.3. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is a vital tool for the WF. Information
   available over the internet and intranet is used to acquire weather data to provide mission
   essential briefings and forecasts. In the event of LAN failure, all services are significantly
   degraded.
   2.5.4. Telephone. The WF has several multi-line phones in the operations area, with many
   others nearby that can be used to relay information. After watches, warnings and advisories
   are issued, the WF will call the critical agencies listed in Table 2.2 to ensure the messages
   have been received.

Table 2.2. Agencies Notified.
  ATC                                   Hotline / 925-2547

       2.5.4.1. During JET outages, the WF will use a conference call to simultaneously notify
       those agencies listed in Table 2.1. After dialing the conference call number (925-9210)
       and all parties have answered, the forecaster will relay the information and request the
       initials of each agency’s representative to verify receipt.
   2.5.5. Telephones in the Operations (Ops) area also have hotlines to the tower, 502 CP, 149
   Ops Desk, and 433 CP. Table 2.3 lists the primary phone numbers for the WF.

Table 2.3. The WF Duty Phone Numbers.

2.6. Building Power. Building 1610 is a leaseback facility from Port San Antonio. However,
the 802d Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) is the point of contact for associated power.
2.7. WF Limitations:
   2.7.1. The official point of observation is the active FMQ-19 sensor. When augmenting the
   FMQ-19 the augmenting point of observation will be on the “N” located 2 grounding spots
   out the door on the west side of building 1610. It does not allow a clear, unobstructed 360
   degree view around the runway complex. The technician’s view from north through
   southeast is obstructed by trees, buildings, and hangars. The obstruction interferes with
   accurate visibility measurements and may obscure features moving in from the stated
   directions.
       2.7.1.1. The WF has coordinated a Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) with the LAFB
       tower and is reliant on visibility and present weather data passed from the tower to
       construct representative weather reports. (See paragraph 5.9 for details on CWW).
       2.7.1.2. During augmentation high intensity security lights located on nearby buildings
       hinder the technician’s ability to determine sky condition and visibility at night.
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                           13


  2.7.2. Optimum forecast and observing support is dependent on fully operational
  communication and meteorological sensing equipment.
  2.7.3. The FMQ-19 lightning detection system is used to determine the approximate
  direction and distance of lightning strikes contacting the ground. Equipment limitations and
  operational status would limit lightning detection.
  2.7.4. Certain services, such as, Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) briefings and SOF
  training may not be available without prior coordination, due to manning levels or duty
  priority.

       3.4.2.1. A departure alternate is required if ceiling or visibility is below landing
       minimums for the departure airfield. Do not use category II Instrument Landing System
       minimums to determine if a departure alternate is required.
          3.4.2.1.1. A departure alternate within 30 minutes flying time must be equal to or
          better than the published approach minimums and be forecast to remain so until 1
          hour after takeoff.
          3.4.2.1.2. A departure alternate within 2 hours flying time must be at least 500-1
          above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but in no case lower
          than 600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and
          forecast to remain so for 1 hour after estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the alternate.
       3.4.2.2. Two destination alternates are required when:
          3.4.2.2.1. Forecast visibility is less than published for an available DoD approach.
          3.4.2.2.2. Forecast is less than Visual Flight Rules (VFR) for any destination where a
          Non-Directional Beacon is the only available approach.
       3.4.2.3. At least one destination alternate is required regardless of forecast weather, when
       the departure or destination aerodrome is outside the 48 CONUS states.
   3.4.3. KC-135. Per AFI 11-2KC-135 V3, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures, and AFI 11-

                                     MISSION SERVICES

4.1. General. Mission services are actions taken by the WF and 26 OWS directly relating to the
missions of our customer.
   4.1.1. The MEF is the primary tool used to accomplish these tasks. MEFs are tailored to
   individual customer requirements.
   4.1.2. The WF provides all local mission services while the airfield is open. Transient
   mission services are handled as detailed in paragraph 1.4.
4.2. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF):
   4.2.1. The MEF is developed using the 12-step process outlined in AFMAN 15-129. During
   this process, the WF personnel create the MEF by fusing and tailoring products created by
   strategic and regional weather centers, as well as information supplied by local units and
   agencies. The end result is a product designed to provide timely, accurate and relevant
   weather information to customers. MEFs must be horizontally consistent with, but not
   necessarily mirror, products issued by 26 OWS and AFWA. During rapidly changing
   conditions, the WF will amend the MEF to reflect accurate conditions and brief the customer,
   then back-brief 26 OWS if crossing TAF categories as time permits.
   4.2.2. The MEF is a forecast product geared for aviation support. It is tailored to fit the daily
   mission needs of the 149 FW, 433 AW, 313 FLTF, and 342 TRS. At a minimum, this
   product includes the forecast weather conditions at LAFB (takeoff and recovery), and all
   scheduled Military Operating Areas (MOAs) including flight level winds, hazards, and space
   weather data. Additional information such as target acquisition data, illumination data for
   Night Vision Goggles (NVG), low level route forecasts, aerial refueling track forecasts, and
   drop zone forecasts will be provided as mission requirements dictate. The MEF is
   considered a legal flight weather briefing for local flying. The format of the MEF is flexible
   and changes as necessary to meet the needs of customers. There is an example of the MEF in
   Attachment 3.
   4.2.3. MEF Publishing. The WF will publish the MEF 26 OWS webpage no later than 30
   minutes prior to the first scheduled mission brief of the day. The MEF will only contain
   information for which the daily schedule of each customer requires and will not be produced
   on days that no local flying is scheduled. If the 26 OWS webpage is down, the WF will e-
   mail or fax the MEF to the flying customer.
   4.2.4. No MEF will be produced for 433 AW cross county missions for which In-Flight
   Management (IFM) support exists. These missions will be supported by the Tactical Airlift
   Control Center (TACC) at Scott AFB, IL.
   4.2.5. MEF Amendments. The MEF is amendable until the last tenant mission is complete.
   The WF will amend the MEF anytime amendment criteria occurs or is expected to occur but
   is not forecast or, is forecast but does not occur at the specified time unless atmospheric
   conditions indicate occurrence is imminent. Amendment criteria can be found in Tables 4.1
   and 4.2.
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                                            23


        4.2.5.1. Amendment criteria are defined as mission limiting thresholds that will impact
        any mission. These thresholds will be considered required amendment criteria from 1
        hour prior to takeoff times until the mission is complete. Amendments will be issued as
        soon as possible IAW duty priorities.
        4.2.5.2. Takeoff and Recovery. The WF will amend the takeoff and recovery portion of
        the MEF any time observed or forecast conditions decrease to less than or increase to
        equal or exceed the following thresholds:

        4.2.5.3. Operating Areas and Route. The WF will amend the operating area and route
        portion of the MEF any time observed or forecasted conditions decrease to less than or
        increase to equal or exceed the thresholds listed in Table 4.2. Target acquisition data will
        be updated if affected by this amendment and required by subsequent flights into the
        affected area.

       4.2.5.4. Representative. Amend MEF any other time the WF deems it to be
       unrepresentative of the current or forecast conditions at any other location on the MEF.
4.3. Flight Weather Briefings. The WF will provide flight weather briefings to all aircrew as
duty priorities permit. Aircrew should request briefings to the WF at least 2 hours prior to brief
time. The WF will provide a MEF DD 175-1 Flight Weather Briefing, or verbal briefing to all
aircrew, as duty priorities allow. If WF is unable to accommodate aircrew, the 26 OWS briefing
cell will provide the flight weather briefings to any and all aircrew. Although the WF is manned
whenever the airfield is open, the WF duty priorities place briefings for LAFB aircrews ahead of
transient aircrew. AMOPS maintains the flight planning room adjacent to the weather section.
A transient aircrew briefing terminal is provided along with instructions on contacting the 26
OWS briefing cell to obtain a weather brief and/or accessing weather information.
4.4. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). When contacted by aircrew on the PMSV, the WF will
provide timely, relevant and accurate weather data to include observations, forecasts,
watches/warnings/advisories and hazards. The WF is assigned PMSV frequency is 239.8 MHz
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                          25


and is available for phone patches (DSN 945-5709/5808 COMM 210-925-5709/5808) IAW duty
priorities.
   4.4.1. The WF will solicit a PIREP during each PMSV contact with aircrew, and will log
   them on Joint Base San Antonio Form 179, Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) Log. PIREPs are
   a tool for aircrew to help the WF better serve them and enhance flight safety.
   4.4.2. The RAFB WF shares the same PMSV frequency and will monitor this frequency
   during LAFB WF PMSV outages, and will provide backup support. AMOPS will annotate
   long term outages via Notice to Airmen until repairs are complete. LAFB will reciprocate
   PMSV support for the RAFB WF. The WF will notify ATC personnel of any PMSV outage.
4.5. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH is how the WF monitors the weather for all
missions originating out of LAFB and/or any local customer briefed by LAFB WF. When
necessary, the WF will amend the MEF and contact the SOF, Top III or duty desk of each flying
unit and relay why MEF was amended. The WF will MISSIONWATCH all transient flights
briefed by the WF until closing. All remaining flights being MISSIONWATCH by the LAFB
WF will be handed off to the 26 OWS.
4.6. Space Weather. The WF will brief space weather events during any MEF, focusing on
impacts to communications. Space weather products are available from the JAAWIN webpage.
Also, the MEF contains a link to the CONUS space weather products page. The WF will submit
any reported space weather impacts through the JAAWIN web page. For more information about
space weather products, please contact the WF.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

5.1. Airfield Services. Airfield Services include those actions and areas that affect JBSA and
LAFB. Airfield Services include weather observing, resource protection and PMSV.
5.2. Weather Observations. Observations will be taken and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-
111, Surface Weather Observations. The FMQ-19 is the AF standard system for automated
observations, with WF technicians augmenting the when required. When in automated mode,
the FMQ-19 continually senses and reports the following weather elements: wind, visibility,
precipitation/obstructions to vision, cloud height, sky cover, temperature, dew point, altimeter
(ALSTG) and lightning.
Note: The FMQ-19 reports weather elements over a more limited area, concentrating on the
approach end of the active runway. The FMQ-19 takes readings every minute, and uses time
averaging of elements for more consistent observations.
   5.2.1. Types of Observations. There are two types of observations: Aviation Routine
   Weather Report (METAR), Special (SPECI) Observations and all observations are taken
   from the official observation point (examples shown in Attachment 4).
       5.2.1.1. METAR (Routine Meteorological Observation Report). A METAR is a
       regularly scheduled observation taken and disseminated every hour at 55-59 minutes after
       the hour. A METAR observation may also include special weather criteria that were met
       during the given observing period. METAR observations are disseminated locally and
       longline.
       5.2.1.2. SPECI (Special Observation). A SPECI is an unscheduled observation taken
       and disseminated when any special criteria in AFMAN 15-111 or local criteria listed in
       Attachment 2 has been observed. SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted after
       the last relevant criteria is observed and will be disseminated locally and longline.
   5.2.2. Official Point of Observation. The official point of observation is the active FMQ-19
   sensor. When augmenting the FMQ-19, weather technicians will use the “N” located 2
   grounding spots out the door on the west side of building 1610. When operating from the
   AOL, the technician will augment the FMQ-19 from the “N” located SE out of Bldg 1161
   toward the road that leads to the fire station.
   5.2.3. Backup Observation Site Limitations. The view from the backup observation point is
   restricted. High intensity security lights severely limit the ability to determine nighttime
   visibility, cloud amounts and heights.
   5.2.4. FMQ-19 Operations. The WF will operate the FMQ-19 in full automated mode to
   provide the official METAR and SPECI observations for LAFB, except when augmentation
   is required IAW AFMAN 15-111.
       5.2.4.1. Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having certified weather
       technicians manually add or edit data to observations generated by the FMQ-19. The two
       augmentation processes are supplementing and back-up.
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                              27


          5.2.4.1.1. Supplementing: manually adding weather data to the automated
          observation that is beyond the capability of the FMQ-19 to detect. Technicians will
          supplement observations whenever they are present and the following conditions are
          observed:
              5.2.4.1.1.1. Tornado (+FC) (Note) (also required when airfield is closed)
              5.2.4.1.1.2. Funnel Cloud (FC) (Note) (also required when airfield is closed)
              5.2.4.1.1.3. Hail (GR) (local warning criteria of ½ inch or greater)
              5.2.4.1.1.4. Volcanic Ash (VA)
              5.2.4.1.1.5. Sandstorm (Dust) (SS)
              5.2.4.1.1.6. Snow Depth – Only during airfield operating hours and if heavy
              snow warning has been issued and snowfall is occurring, add Snow Depth remark
              (4/sss).
              5.2.4.1.1.7. WF technicians will place JET in augment mode and be prepared to
              supplement the FMQ-19 when the airfields is open and a weather watch or
              warning has been issued for the above criteria, is forecasted to occur within 2
              hours or whenever the weather criteria above is observed. Always take
              Operational Risk Management (ORM) into consideration when deciding whether
              or not to supplement observations. Safety of the technician always comes first and
              safety of flight and resource protection is paramount.
Note: Immediate reporting of a tornado or funnel cloud takes precedence over other phenomena.
          5.2.4.1.2. Back-up.    manually providing weather data for the FMQ-19 when a
          sensor, sensors or the entire system is inoperable due to system or communications
          failure.
              5.2.4.1.2.1. When an FMQ-19 sensor is no longer working properly, the
              technician will report the outage and perform back-up on logged out sensor(s)
              until fixed. The technician will enter the corrected or missing element in the
              METAR/SPECI.
                 5.2.4.1.2.1.1. If the technician is backing up the wind sensor, all wind data
                 will be estimated and WND DATA ESTMD will be added in col 13 of the
                 3813/3803
                 5.2.4.1.2.1.2. If the technician is backing up the any pressure senor, all
                 pressures will be estimated and SLP/ALSTG ESTMD will be added in col 13
                 of the 3813/3803
              5.2.4.1.2.2. Altimeter Updates: When backing up the FMQ-19 pressure sensor,
              ALSTG update SPECIs will be taken at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes
              when there has been a change of 0.01 inch Hg or more since the last reported
              ALSTG value and a METAR or SPECI has not been taken in the interim.
       5.2.4.2. The technician will maintain situational awareness of local weather conditions
       and the FMQ-19 observations during airfield operating hours. Weather technicians will

       also monitor area observation and forecast products to keep abreast of changes expected
       to affect the LAFB AOR.
5.3. Weather Watch. The FMQ-19 system performs a Continuous Weather Watch. When the
FMQ-19 requires augmentation, WF personnel will conduct a BWW (see para 5.8).
5.4. Back-up Dissemination Procedures. During JET or communications outages, the WF will
disseminate weather observations locally to agencies shown in Table 2.1 (in order), and record
dissemination on Local Dissemination Log.

       5.5.1.3. 1800Z (1300L CDT / 1200L CST)
   5.5.2. The 26 OWS disseminates the TAF locally and longline using JET. Once the TAF
   has been disseminated, it is viewable by all JET users on LAFB. In the event of a JET
   malfunction on their end, 26 OWS will contact the WF, which will in-turn disseminate the
   TAF. In the event of a widespread JET failure, the WF will contact 26 OWS, obtain the TAF
   and email, fax, or phone to applicable agencies, shown in Table 2.1.
   5.5.3. The 26 OWS will amend the TAF as described in Attachment 5, for all watch,
   warning and advisory conditions.
   5.5.4. The MEF is considered the official flight planning forecast for all local customers.
5.6. Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. The 26 OWS and the WF perform resource
protection for LAFB. Resource Protection is detailed in Chapter 7.
5.7. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). The BWW is defined as WF personnel checking weather
conditions at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes. The WF will conduct a BWW during airfield
operating hours whenever augmentation of the FMQ-19 is required. WF personnel also perform
a BWW when any of the following conditions are occurring or are forecast to occur within 1
hour.
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                            29

6.4. CAT Weather Briefings. The WF is a regular member of JBSA CAT. In cases when a
weather representative’s presence is required, the 502 ABW Chief of Readiness Plans will notify
the WF as soon as the requirement is known. After notification, a representative from the WF
will report to the CAT prepared to brief local weather using the same presentations normally
used for the 802 MSG Staff Briefing. The weather representative will be as prepared as possible
to cover impromptu requirements. Subsequent CAT weather briefings for the same event will be
as detailed as the situation and wing leadership require.
6.5. Mass Deployment/Concept Briefings. Upon request, WF will provide a mass weather
briefing in the event of any mass deployment of personnel or aircraft from LAFB. Given proper
notification, the WF will brief special situations, such as hurricane, evacuations to the level of
detail intrinsic to the situation. The WF requests notification 24 hours in advance of mass
briefings (when possible) to prepare.
6.6. IRC Weather Briefings. Upon request, the WF will brief the weather portion of all local
IRC briefings. The briefing covers WF services and focuses on seasonal climatology and flight
hazards. The WF requests at least 1 week advance notification (when possible) to prepare.
6.7. SOF Weather Briefings. The WF will brief the weather portion of all local SOF briefings.
The briefing covers the WF services and focuses on seasonal climatology and flight hazards.
The WF requests at least 2 days advance notification (when possible) to prepare.

                               RESOURCE PROTECTION

7.1. General. This section details actions undertaken by the WF and 26 OWS to provide
resource protection to JBSA and LAFB through the use of weather watches, warnings and.
advisories
7.2. Delineation of Duties. 26 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecast watches, warnings
and advisories. The WF provides “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS and is responsible for issuing
all observed warnings and advisories. In the event of imminent threat to life and property
requiring an urgent dissemination, the WF will issue warnings normally issued by 26 OWS. In
these cases, the WF will inform 26 OWS as time permits.
   7.2.1. Expanded Eyes Forward: Expanded eyes forward support will be provided whenever
   (SWAP) are in place. Eyes forward support to the 26 OWS will focus on the specific severe
   weather the SWAP was initiated for.
   7.2.2. WF personnel will utilize the CWW to aid in augmentation of the FMQ-19 and
   perform enhanced METWATCH procedures as applicable prior to and during the onset of
   severe weather (tornados, winds > 50kts and/or hail > ¾ inch).
7.3. Unit Requirements. Units are responsible for coordinating additional watch, warning and
advisory support.
   7.3.1. Customers requesting support must validate the requirement by providing the WF with
   a list of protective actions taken each time the watch/warning/advisory is received.
   7.3.2. If the request falls within the operational capabilities of the WF or 26 OWS, then
   weather personnel will monitor and advise of such significant weather formations.
7.4. Weather Watches. A weather watch alerts JBSA and LAFB units to the potential of
weather conditions that may threaten life and property. When a weather watch is issued by the
26 OWS, all units should prepare to take protective actions in the event the weather watch is
upgraded to warning status. See Attachment 6 for watch format.

7.6. Observed Weather Warning. An observed weather warning will be issued for lightning.
An observed warning will only be issued when the condition occurs. During airfield closure
hours, or in the event the WF is unable to issue, 26 OWS will issue an observed warning. See
Attachment 6 for sample warning format.
7.7. Weather Advisories. Weather advisories are weather information bulletins to alert base
units to specific mission-impacting criteria not defined as weather watch or warning criteria.
   7.7.1. Observed Weather Advisories:
       7.7.1.1. The WF will normally issue observed advisories and LAFB.
       7.7.1.2. Upon initial occurrence, the technician will issue the advisory with a valid time
       of Until Further Notice (UFN).
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                              35


       7.7.1.3. Once issued, observed advisories are canceled when the forecaster can
       reasonably determine that atmospheric conditions no longer support reoccurrence.

Hard Freeze (Temp < 25°F)                                                 6 Hours
7.8. Dissemination. Dissemination of watches, warnings and advisories, extensions, and
cancellations are done via JET and IWWC. The WF will confirm receipt through a phone call to
Tower/SOF, 26 OWS, AMOPS, and 502 CP. See Attachment 6 for more information on
dissemination.
7.9. Weather Watches, Warnings (observed and forecasted) and advisories (observed and
forecasted). Numbers are assigned to the warnings sequentially, by month and the number of
the warning. For example, warning number 04-001 would be the first warning during the month
of April. This is done automatically by IWWC; you will not be able to edit the numbers.
7.10. Operational Reports (OPREP). 502 CP will initiate the process of reporting the impact
of severe weather to higher headquarters. The weather flight will provide the following to the
502 CP to 802 OSS/CC and AETC/A3OW:

   7.11.3. WF will provide weather data to 802 CES and Bioenvironmental upon request.
7.12. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP).
   7.12.1. The purpose of SWAP is to provide a means for the WF to systematically and
   collectively manage the additional strain and decision making processes that accompany
   severe weather. SWAP is a cooperative effort between the 26 OWS and the WF in which
   each agency has specific roles and responsibilities as defined by AFMAN 15-129.
   7.12.2. When directed by weather flight chief, 26 OWS or 502 CP, the WF will activate the
   Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT). Once activated, the SWAT will provide JBSA and
   LAFB with clear and timely notification of severe weather threatening JBSA and/or LAFB.
   The SWAT Leader will recall additional members as needed to intensify METWATCH,
   operate the radar, record and disseminate observations.
   7.12.3. SWAP will be implemented and the SWAT will be activated any time:
       7.12.3.1. Severe weather Watch or Warning has been issued for JBSA,
          7.12.3.1.1. Severe weather is defined as:
              7.12.3.1.1.1. Tornadic Activity,
              7.12.3.1.1.2. Damaging Winds > 50 Knots,
              7.12.3.1.1.3. Large Hail > ¾ inch.
          7.12.3.1.2. JBSA refers to LAFB, Lackland Training Annex (Medina), FSH, and
          Camp Bullis
       7.12.3.2. Severe weather has been observed at JBSA and/or LAFB.
       7.12.3.3. The shift leader determines the potential for severe weather is strong enough to
       warrant SWAT activation.
       7.12.3.4. Anytime the 26 OWS deems SWAP implementation is required in the interest
       of resource protection and/or flight safety
Note: If the event poses an imminent threat to life and/or property the WF will issue the
appropriate Weather Warning prior to calling SWAT leader.
   7.12.4. Notify the weather flight chief to make a determination on SWAT recall any time:
       7.12.4.1. The 26 OWS issues a weather watch or warning for > 1 inch of snow
       accumulation within 12 hours.
       7.12.4.2. The 26 OWS issues a weather watch or warning for freezing precipitation.
   7.12.5. The weather flight chief or duty forecaster may activate the SWAT but delay actual
   formation anytime the potential or expected onset time of severe weather is more than 2
   hours beyond notification time.
   7.12.6. At a minimum, the WF and 26 OWS will conduct and document a semi-annual
   exercise of coordinated SWAP. An actual severe weather event meets the intent of an
   exercise.
   7.12.7. During hours of airfield closure, 26 OWS will pass all watches, warnings and
   advisories to the 502 CP, who will then pass any severe watches or warnings to the on-call
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                              37


   forecaster or the WF Flight Chief if the on-call forecaster is not available. The on-call
   forecaster will assess the situation and determine the need to activate the SWAP.
7.13. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Advisories:
   7.13.1. Hurricane/tropical storm advisories are issued to alert agencies of the potential for
   winds 50 knots or greater within 72, 48, 24, or 12 hours respectively at JBSA and LAFB.
   These special advisories are based on the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts and
   outlined in 502d Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan 10-2. Information will
   include current storm location, forecast track with maximum wind speeds and intensity trend.
   The WF cannot deviate from the official forecast from the NHC and 26 OWS official
   forecast per AFMAN 15-129. Due to the uncertainty of the 72 and 48-hour outlooks, they
   should be used for planning purposes only.
      7.13.1.1. Hurricane Condition (HURCON) 5 indicates the threat of a hurricane exists.
      7.13.1.2. HURCON 4: 50 knot/58 miles per hour (mph) winds or higher within 72 hours.

      7.13.1.4. HURCON 2: 50 knot/58 mph winds or higher within 24 hours.
      7.13.1.5. HURCON 1: 50 knot/58 mph winds or higher within 12 hours.
   7.13.2. Once tropical activity has begun, the NHC will issue forecast bulletins at 03, 09, 15,
   and 21Z. The WF will provide updates to hurricane bulletins locally as required. The WF
   will brief JBSA and LAFB leadership and local flying customers on any tropical depression,
   tropical storm, or hurricane that is physically, or is forecast into the area depicted in
   Attachment 10.
   7.13.3. 502 ABW/CC will issue updates to the HURCON status as necessary. The WF will
   notify 26 OWS of any change in HURCON status. Upon going to HURCON 2, the WF will
   commence 24-hour operations. The WF will attend CAT meetings and provide detailed
   reports on the progress of the tropical storm/hurricane upon request.
7.14. Weather Support for FSH and Camp Bullis:
   7.14.1. Point Warnings support from the 26 OWS.
      7.14.1.1. Both point warning TX17 (Ft Sam Houston) and point warning 1TX7 (Camp
      Bullis) are the responsibility of the 26 OWS Lackland forecaster.
      7.14.1.2. The 26 OWS will not issue point warnings for FSH or Camp Bullis without
      prior coordination with JBSA WF.
   7.14.2. The JBSA WF will issue plain language weather messages for dissemination by the
   FSH Installation Control Center (ICC). These bulletins will include but not be limited to:

eruptions and/or tornadic activity when a delay in reporting all elements of the SPECI would
cause an immediate threat to life or property.
A2.16. Altimeter Updates. When backing-up the FMQ-19 or FMQ-19 pressure sensor(s),
altimeter update SPECIs will be taken at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes when there has
been a change of 0.01 inch Hg or more since the last reported ALSTG value and a METAR or
SPECI has not been taken in the interval. Ensure ATC knows the ASTG is estimated, and add
ALSTG ESTMD in column 13 of the 3813/3803.

A5.3. TAF Amendment Criteria. The 24-hour forecast specifies the time of occurrence (to the
nearest hour), the duration, and the intensity (where applicable) of the weather elements listed
below. The weather elements listed in Table A5.1 must be considered when issuing the TAF for
LAFB and if expected to occur will be included in the forecast. If at any time the conditions
listed in this section occur but are not correctly forecast or are forecast to occur and do not occur
by the specified predominant change group ending time, the TAF must be amended.

event that 26 OWS is unable to amend, the WF will amend the TAF during duty hours. TAF
Amendments will be accomplished with the following guidelines:
    A5.4.1. Anytime an unforecast change meeting the TAF amendment criteria is expected to
    occur and is expected to last more than 30 minutes and is not correctly forecast by the next
    whole hour.
    A5.4.2. Anytime an unforecast change meeting the TAF amendment criteria occurs, is
    expected to last at least 30 minutes and is not forecast by the next whole hour from the time
    of occurrence.
    A5.4.3. Anytime a forecast condition meeting the TAF amendment criteria does not occur
    by the specified hour and is not expected to occur within the next 30 minutes.
    A5.4.4. Anytime a forecast condition within a TEMPO group becomes predominant or is not
    expected to occur.
A5.5. Limited METWATCH. During periods when the WF is closed, 26 OWS will append the
last line of the TAF with the words “LIMITED METWATCH YYGG TIL YYGG” where “YY”
is the day of the month UTC and “GG” is the time to the nearest whole hour UTC. During these
times the forecast will only be amended for warning criteria defined in Table 7.2
JBSANANTONIOI15-101 6 MARCH 2012                                                              57


A5.6. Last No Amendments. During periods when the airfield is closed and a TAF is not
required, 26 OWS will append the last line of the TAF with the words “LAST NO AMDS AFT
YYGG NEXT YYGG” where “YY” is the day of the month UTC and “GG” is the time to the
nearest whole hour UTC.
A5.7. TAF Specification Criteria. In addition to the criteria listed in Table A5.1, the 26 OWS
forecaster must consider additional weather criteria as deemed operationally significant by local
customers. These non-amendable thresholds are required to be specified when issuing the initial
and any subsequent TAFs. The WF forecasters have the leverage to adjust their local products
and briefings to meet the specified needs of the local customers provided the adjusted forecast
does not cross amendment thresholds without prior coordination between the 26 OWS and the
WF forecasters.
   A5.7.1. Ceiling less than or equal to 5,000 and 1,500 feet.
   A5.7.2. Visibility less than or equal to 5 miles and 3 miles.
   A5.7.3. All speed changes of 10 knots or more.
   A5.7.4. Onset time, duration, type and intensity of all thunderstorms, precipitation, icing,
   turbulence, and non-convective low-level wind shear.
   A5.7.5. The lowest expected altimeter setting for each specified forecast period.

                       WATCH/WARNING/ADVISORY FORMAT

A6.1. General. This attachment explains formats and notification procedures for LAFB’s
weather watches, warnings and advisories. Each watch, warning and/or advisory will contain the
following elements in order of transmission:
   A6.1.1. LAFB header, watch, warning or advisory number (numbered XX-XXX, i.e. 05-
   001, etc….).
   A6.1.2. Valid time in UTC and local time.
   A6.1.3. Body of warning/watch/advisory.
A6.2. Weather Watch Example:
LACKLAND AFB WEATHER WATCH 09-002
VALID 05/1100Z (05/0600L) TO 05/1500Z (05/1000L)
THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH WINDS 50KTS OR
GREATER AND/OR HAIL 3/4 INCH OR GREATER. A WARNING WILL BE ISSUED IF
AND WHEN CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR.
A6.3. Weather Warning Examples:
LACKLAND AFB WEATHER WARNING 09-001
VALID 05/1300Z (05/0800L) TO 05/1400Z (05/0900L)
SOUTH TO SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS 35-49 KNOTS MAX EXPECTED: 45KTS
THIS UPGRADES ADVISORY #09-024
WATCH #09-002 IS STILL IN EFFECT

LACKLAND AFB WEATHER WARNING 10-004
VALID 19/1921Z (19/1421L) TO UFN (UFN)
LIGHTNING WITHIN 5NM IS OBSERVED AT LACKLAND AFB/KELLY ANNEX.
A6.4. Weather Advisory Example:
LACKLAND AFB WEATHER ADVISORY 09-024
VALID 18/1714Z (18/1214L) TO 18/2300Z (18/1700L)
SURFACE WINDS 25-34 KNOTS. MAX EXPECTED: 30 KNOTS
A6.5. Dissemination. The WF leverages a pyramid notification system to promptly disseminate
weather watches, warnings, and advisories. The WF or 26 OWS initiates the process by
disseminating, canceling, or extending an advisory, watch, or warning over JET. Upon receiving
watches, warnings, or advisories via JET, the 502 CP will disseminate the alert via the AtHoc to
other agencies on LAFB. Each organization is responsible for internal dissemination. When the
JET is inoperable, the WF and 26 OWS will use telephone notification to transmit watches,
warnings and advisories. Figure A6.1 illustrates the dissemination pyramid.
A6.6. Backup Calls. The WF will call critical agencies to verify receipt of issues, extensions,
or cancellations of all watches, warnings and advisories whether issued by the WF or by 26
OWS. 26 OWS will notify Primary Command and Control, ATC, and WF when Weather
