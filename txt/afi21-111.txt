                                     GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Objective and Scope: This instruction specifies the responsibilities associated with the
USAF Advanced Maintenance and Munitions Operations School, the Advanced Maintenance
and Munitions Education Program (AMMEP) and the selection of all USAF AMMOS students.
Due to the diversity of missions throughout the Air Force, this instruction provides only
common, required actions. Specific programs may require MAJCOM, NAF, wing, maintenance
group, or squadron supplements to this instruction. Graduates of the USAF AMMOS possess the
knowledge and skills necessary to produce airpower as required to meet mission requirements at
home station and deployed and provide expert advice on aircraft and munitions maintenance
related requirements, plans, applications, and issues at AEF lead wings, Numbered Air Forces
(NAFs) and unified commands. The graduate is trained in operational and expeditionary aircraft
and munitions maintenance Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and is familiar with Air
Operations Center (AOC) operations, Air Force Forces (AFFOR) Staffs, and Combat Air Force
(CAF), Mobility Air Force (MAF), and Special Operations Forces (SOF) combat support TTPs.
     1.1.1. History: USAF AMMOS was developed due to maintenance and logistics lessons
     learned during Operation ALLIED FORCE. The conceptual framework was to create highly
     skilled operational logisticians with the wartime skills capable of mobilizing, bedding down,
     employing, sustaining, redeploying, and reconstituting combat air power and the support
     functions associated with combat airpower. Over time, USAF AMMOS has transformed to
     provide a deliberate focus on advanced operational and tactical maintenance.
     1.1.2. Mission: Provide Captains and senior noncommissioned officers graduate-level
     expertise in tactical and operational aircraft skill sets under the construct of the USAF Agile
     Combat Support master processes (see Table 1.1.). Develop officers and SNCOs with the
     ability to expand USAF combat capabilities through the efficient production of combat
     airpower, mentor and develop fellow officers and senior noncommissioned officers, and to
     critically think to solve problems and provide sound advice to leadership.

                         USAF AMMOS CSC SELECTION PROCESS

3.1. Purpose: This chapter describes the procedures for nominating and selecting active duty
and ARC (ANG/AFRC) USAF maintenance and munitions officers to attend CSC and the
responsibilities of the agencies involved. The primary goal of this process is to select the most
qualified officers to attend USAF AMMOS. In 2013, CSC evolved from a 15 to a 7-week
course. However, the shorter course maintained a rigorous curriculum focused on preparing our
maintenance and munitions leaders to win tomorrow's wars by expanding combat capability
through graduate-level education in all aspects of operational and tactical maintenance structured
around the Agile Combat Support master processes. Course curriculum moved from the
integration of Joint Expeditionary Logistics to a deliberate focus on advanced operational and
tactical maintenance. As a result of the course length reduction and AMMOS’s work to increase
class size, every aircraft maintenance and munitions officer will have the opportunity to attend at
some point in their eligibility window. Although many of the expeditionary logistics lessons
have been scoped down or deleted, CSC remains the most rigorous and demanding course

     USAF AMMOS website at: https://wwwmil.nellis.af.mil/units/ammos/ (T-2). Failure
     to meet suspense dates for prerequisite items may result in disenrollment from the course.
     Extensions to suspense dates will only be approved on a case-by-case basis and must be
     coordinated directly through the USAF AMMOS Registrar (T-2).
     5.4.2.3. Selectees must ensure they meet all course entry criteria prior to their class start
     date (T-2). If an individual is unable to meet course entry requirements due to
     extenuating circumstances, send a waiver request to HQ ACC/A4Q as appropriate for
     ARC units (T-2). Include the following information: reason for waiver request,
     justification for waiver and any other pertinent information (T-2).
     5.4.2.4. Situations can occur that impact selectee’s availability to attend USAF
     AMMOS. These situations (due to sickness, injury, real world operations, etc.) will be
     handled on a case-by-case basis. The selectee’s unit must contact AFRC/A4M or
     ANG/A4M, as appropriate, and state the reason(s) for the selectee’s inability to attend
     (T-2). AFRC/A4M or ANG/A4M, as appropriate, will subsequently notify HQ ACC/A4
     through HQ ACC/A4Q.          HQ ACC/A4Q will notify USAF AMMOS and HQ
     AFPC/DPALL. It is imperative to make the non-attendance determination as soon as
     possible so HQ ACC/A4Q can notify the first alternate to attend USAF AMMOS and
     complete the mandatory prerequisite training.

     5.4.2.5. While attending USAF AMMOS a student may be grandfathered to attend a
     subsequent class if unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond their
     control. Examples are: illness, injury, family emergencies and contingency operations.
     HQ ACC/A4 is the final approval authority for all grandfathering decisions.
