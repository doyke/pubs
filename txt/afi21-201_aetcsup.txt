SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This document
removes general maintenance policy, responsibilities, and organizational structures that were
incorporated into AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management. This document
also renumbers numerous paragraphs to align with the most current version of AFI 21-201;
deletes all redundant information requests; changes guidance to include the designation of the
802 Logistics Readiness Squadron, Lackland AFB TX as a small and unique unit; and adds
guidance for minimum AF Munitions Command and Control (MC2) SharePoint application
requirements for small and unique units.
1.2. Deviations and Waivers. All AETC units except the 325th Maintenance Group (MXG) at
