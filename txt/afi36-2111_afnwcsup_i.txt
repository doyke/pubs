                                   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose: LCBP is a premier two-year developmental program, with a one-year follow on
assignment to the same installation, where officers are competitively selected and developed as
materiel management officers with the potential to fill future senior materiel management
leadership positions in the Air Force and Joint logistics systems. Officers selected for this
program gain valuable knowledge and experience in managing the acquisition and sustainment
aspects of the Air Force logistics system through rotational assignments in various functional
areas of Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), to include the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center
(AFGLSC) units at ALC bases, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). All career broadening
officers (CBOs) will be required to obtain a level I certification in both Life Cycle Logistics
(LCL) and Program Management (PM) for program completion. After the two-year program is
complete, the final year can be used at the discretion of the ALC Vice Commander (ALC/CV)
and DLA AF National Account Manager (NAM) to allow CBOs to gain additional experience
within ALC, AFGLSC and DLA functional areas. This additional year can also be used to
complete LCL level II certification provided the CBO is in a Life Cyle Logistics (―L-coded‖)
position. Normal assignment rules apply when PCSing to this program.
1.1. (AFNWC) Purpose: Career Broadening Officers (CBOs) will be assigned to the Air Force
Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC). After the two-year program is complete, CBOs may serve
a third/final year at the discretion of the AFNWC Vice Commander (AFNWC/CV).
1.2. Eligible Career Fields: LCBP is an AF/A4/7 sponsored AFMC training program that
applies to officers in the following Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs): 21R (Logistics
Readiness), 21A/M (Aircraft Maintenance, Munitions and Missile Maintenance), 61X
(Scientist), 62E (Engineer), 63A (Acquisition Manager), 64PX (Contracting), and 65FX
(Financial Management). For DLA positions, only the 21R AFSC is eligible to participate.
1.2. (AFNWC) Eligible Career Fields: For AFNWC positions, only 21M Air Force Specialty
Code (AFSC) is eligible to participate.
1.3. Description: This program provides work experience in all areas of acquisition logistics
and sustainment and explains relationships between ALC logistics functions. Officers rotate
through designated wing(s) or directorates as prescribed in paragraph 2.1. While in each
organization, participants learn how different functions work together and are given tasks that
support mission needs while reinforcing concepts to be learned. Rotation through every wing or
directorate is desired, but the rotation process is designed to provide participants exposure to the
key elements of acquisition and life cycle logistics to maximize learning.

                                             Chapter 2

                                 PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Program Phases: The three designated phases of the program, the objectives and the
mandatory education requirements are as follows:
     2.1.1. Phase I: Orientation. This phase consists of in-processing, initial acquisition
     training, and an Air Force Materiel Command introductory conference. This phase lasts
     approximately one month.
     2.1.2. Phase II: Rotations. This is a 20-month long work-and-learn phase emphasizing
     professional growth and active participation. Throughout this phase, CBOs will continue to
     complete logistics and acquisition courses from Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)
     and Defense Acquisition University (DAU), professional development seminars, and tours.
     This phase consists of three six to eight month flexible rotations, defined as Phase IIA, Phase
     IIB, and Phase IIC. From the ALCs, LCBP participants will obtain experience in the Supply
     Chain Management, Depot Maintenance, and PM mission areas. Each CBO will complete
     one rotation in each of these three mission areas, in any sequence. Within the Supply Chain
     Management and PM mission areas, one of the rotations should be accomplished within a
     ―commodity‖ area and the other rotation should be in a ―weapon system‖ area. The first
     rotation through the three mission areas begins after completion of Phase I. CBOs assigned to
     the DLA Inventory Control Point (ICP) will obtain experience in Demand/Supply Planning,
     Acquisition, Weapon System Support, Contingency Planning and Supply Chain Management
     using a similar approach as the ALCs.
     2.1.2. (AFNWC) Phase II: Rotations. CBOs assigned to the AFNWC will obtain nuclear
     unique experience in joint Department of Energy/Department of Defense (DOE/DoD)
     warhead/bomb management (AFNWC Nuclear Weapons Division (AFNWC/NCW)),
     warhead transport, weapons systems management maintenance and equipment (AFNWC
     Nuclear Weapons Logistics Division (AFNWC/NCL)), nuclear surety and certifications
     (AFNWC Nuclear Systems Division (AFNWC/NCS)), acquisitions and modifications
     (AFNWC/NCS, AFNWC/NCL and AFNWC/XR), and an optional rotation in financial
     management (AFNWC Financial Management (AFNWC/FM), AFNWC Contracting
     (AFNWC/PK) and/or Air Force Program Execution Office for Strategic Systems
     (AFPEO/SS)). Since the AFNWC Nuclear Capabilities Directorate (AFNWC/NC) is the
     execution area of the center, CBOs should spend a minimum of two rotations within the
     AFNWC/NC in accordance with (IAW) Attachment 5, Table A5.1.
     2.1.3. Phase III: Two Options. With the approval of the ALC or DLA Program Advisors,
     the officer may elect one of two options for the remaining three months of the program: 1)
     extension of Phase II rotations to compensate for training, leave, or other out of rotation time
     or 2) the addition of an abbreviated rotation via temporary duty (TDY) in another Air
     Logistics Center or ICP area.
     2.1.3. (AFNWC) Phase III: Two Options. The AFNWC/CV approves the elected phase
     III option.
2.2. Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) Certifications: All CBOs are
required to obtain a level I certification in both LCL and PM for program completion. The ALC
AFI36-2111_AFNWCSUP_I 5 JULY 2012                                                               7


and DLA executive agents must ensure students are placed in an ―L‖ coded position, complete
the DAU training as directed by AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
Management (see courses at http://icatalog.dau.mil), and are performing work in a designated
acquisition organization (such as an acquisition sustainment unit or aircraft sustainment wing) in
order to obtain the level I LCL and PM certifications. If the CBO remains at the ALC or DLA
after program completion, they may work towards level II LCL certification as long as the
position to which they are assigned is an "L" coded position. CBOs must enroll in the
introductory classes during Phase I of the program and plan ahead to ensure all certification
requirements are met. Failure to complete all required courses may impact the officer’s follow-
on assignment and/or completion of the program. NOTE: Due to the AFRC manpower funding
process, AFRC sponsored CBOs remain assigned to their home unit throughout their
participation in LCBP and will be unable to occupy an ―L‖ coded position. Once the AFRC
CBO completes the program and all DAU educational requirements, they will coordinate with
AF/A4LF for APDP adjudication and conferment of appropriate LCL certification.
   2.2.1. Minimum requirements to obtain level I certification in LCL are occupying an ―L‖
   coded position within a unit, obtaining one year of acquisition and/or sustainment experience
   in life cycle logistics, and completion of courses as outlined in the current DAU Catalog.
   When occupying an ―L‖ coded position, a CBO must be performing work in a designated
   acquisition organization to receive credit towards their level I certification.
   2.2.2. Minimum requirements to obtain level I certification in PM are occupying an
   acquisition coded position in any functional stall, as well as completing the required Level I
   training. Therefore, while occupying an ―L‖ coded position within a unit as part of the LCBP
   program, CBOs shall be able to obtain the required one-year acquisition experience. Upon
   completion of Level I PM courses, CBOs will be eligible for Level I PM certification. When
   occupying an ―L‖ coded position, CBOs must be performing work in a designated acquisition
   organization to receive credit towards their level I certification in both LCL and PM.
   2.2.3. Minimum requirements to obtain level II certification in LCL include occupying an
   ―L‖ coded position within a unit for a minimum of two years, obtaining two years of
   acquisition and/or sustainment experience in life cycle logistics and completion of courses as
   outlined in the current DAU Catalog. When occupying an ―L‖ coded position, CBOs must
   be performing work in a designated acquisition organization to receive credit towards level II
   certification.

                             ROTATIONAL TRAINING PLANS

3.1. Objectives: Training objectives for LCBP are outlined in the Training Matrices for the
ALCs and DLA ICP and are provided in Figure A2.1. and Figure A3.1. of this AFI. These
objectives will be reviewed annually to ensure accuracy.
3.1. (AFNWC) Objectives: A "Master List" of training objectives for the AFNWC is outlined
in Attachment 4. This list provides extensive possible training activities for the CBO during
rotations. Prior to starting a new rotation the CBO will coordinate a meeting with the hosting
organization to review the training matrix and circle the tasks for the CBO to complete during
the rotation. The CBO will coordinate the training matrix with the AFNWC/CV for approval
before starting the rotation. The CBO will be responsible for maintaining their specific training
matrix.
3.2. Intent: The intent of the training objectives is to expose CBOs to key logistics concepts
and issues within their LCBP assignment. These training objectives are not confined solely to
one rotation and require continued accomplishment throughout the entire assignment.
3.2. (AFNWC) Intent: For AFNWC rotations the hosting organization supervisor will sign off
as the trainer for all tasks accomplished within their area of expertise.
3.3. Focus: It is unrealistic to expect a CBO to master these objectives over the course of
several months for each rotation. Instead, each rotation should be used to focus efforts and
attention on key learning objectives. The intent is for CBOs to satisfy the training objectives
first through a combination of methods to include hands-on, training courses, workshops, self-
study, and readings. ALC Vice Commanders (ALC/CVs), DLA Functional Directors (FDs), and
program mentors play a significant role in mentoring, counseling, and assessing officer
development with respect to the attached objectives. At the end of a CBO’s assignment, he/she
should be able to comfortably discuss the key points associated with each of the objectives
outlined in Figure A2.1. and Figure A3.1. of this AFI.
3.3. (AFNWC) Focus: It is unrealistic to expect a CBO to master these objectives over the

counseling, and assessing officer development with respect to the attached objectives. At the end
of a CBO’s assignment, he/she should be able to comfortably discuss with the AFNWC/CV the
circled tasks in the training matrix and any other key points associated with each of the
objectives outlined in Attachment 4 of this Supplement.

                                SELECTION PROCEDURES

4.1. Selection: Officers will use their Airman Development Plan (ADP) to communicate their
desire to participate in the LCBP to Developmental Teams (DTs). DTs from the 21X career
fields are responsible for selecting officers to attend LCBP during their fall DT meetings (6XX
officers will use the guidance contained in para. 4.2 below. Air Force Reserve Officers will use
the guidance contained in para. 4.3 below). The following guidance outlines the process for the
21X active duty officer selection for the LCBP.
   4.1.1. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) will notify DTs of the program timeline and
   processes to meet assignment timelines.
   4.1.2. DTs will receive supplemental guidance in a separate message from their responsible
   career field managers outlining individual board processes and program vacancies for the
   following fiscal year.
   4.1.3. AFPC will review candidate eligibility to ensure officers satisfy time-on-station (TOS)
   requirements, meet primary career path goals, and ensure timing of LCBP entry is
   appropriate and applicable for each officer.
   4.1.4. Officers will be notified of their eligibility for the LCBP through an email or AMS
   Robot message from AFPC.
   4.1.5. During fall DT meetings, the teams will make selections to fill program vacancies as
   outlined in Table 4.1.
   4.1.6. An appropriate number of alternates will be designated to fill potential vacancies.
   4.1.7. Results of the selection process will be published in a consolidated selection message
   NLT 30 days after the last selection board and will identify selected officers and the gaining
   unit.
4.2. 6XX AFSC Selection: For 6XX career fields, officers must communicate their desire for
LCBP selection via AF IMT 3849, PME/AFIT/RTFB/Officer Worksheet, submission to
Acquisition Officer Assignments Branch at AFPC. The following guidance outlines the process
for the selection of officers into the LCBP.
   4.2.1. Once AF IMT 3849 is received, eligible candidate records will be reviewed and
   scored by the Acquisition Officer Assignments Branch.
   4.2.2. LCBP candidates will be rank ordered and forwarded to 6XX Career Field Managers
   (CFMs) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition
   (SAF/AQ) or Financial Management (SAF/FM) for review and selection.
   4.2.3. After officer records are reviewed and rank ordering verified by 6XX CFMs, results
   will be published NLT 30 days after selection and will identify selected officers, projected
   Report No Later Than Dates, and the gaining unit.
   4.2.4. An appropriate number of alternates will be designated to fill potential vacancies.

4.3. AFRC Selection: The following guidance outlines the process for the selection of Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) officers into the LCBP. Program participation will depend on
AFRC officer availability and AFMC coordination for additional CBO positions for the program.
   4.3.1. AFRC will fund two LCBP positions per year for officers with a primary AFSC of
   21X. These positions are in addition to the active duty positions annotated in Table 4.1 and
   require coordination with AFMC each year to ensure proper placement of potential CBOs.
   4.3.2. 21X officers interested in the LCBP will express their desires in their AFRC Officer
   Development Plan.
   4.3.3. Eligible candidate records will be reviewed scored, and rank ordered by the AFRC
   21X DTs during their fall DT meetings.
   4.3.4. After verification by the CFM, results will be published NLT 30 days after selection.
   The published results will identify selected officers, in addition to projected Report No Later
   Than Dates and gaining units.
   4.3.5. The AFRC 21X DTs will vector LCBP graduates into an appropriate Reserve
   assignment upon completion of LCBP, to include assignment as a Traditional Reservist, Air
   Reserve Technician, or Individual Mobilization Augmentee. AFRC will not normally fund
   follow-on active duty assignments, TDYs, or PCSs upon completion of LCBP, and officers
   should not expect to be vectored into such an assignment.
   4.3.6. Reserve CBOs will be awarded the Special Experience Identifier (SEI) ―LLA‖ upon
   success completion of the LCBP, IAW procedures established in paragraph 8.1 of this AFI.
4.4. Commander’s Involvement: Commanders are encouraged to indicate officers’ desires to
attend LCBP in the ADP and in officer evaluations.
4.5. Allocations: The DTs will select 16/17 (alternating years) officers and assign them based
on the matrix provided below for a total of 33 officers participating in the program at any given
time. An appropriate number of alternates will be designated to fill potential vacancies.

                     ADDITIONAL DUTIES AND DEPLOYMENTS

7.1. Expectations: Additional duties for officers in the program should be minimal and only be
assigned with the approval of the Program Advisor.
7.2. AEF Posturing: Officers in the LCBP are assigned against Line of the Air Force positions
and must be aligned against a Unit Type Code (UTC) using an availability code of ―DXX‖.
DXX UTCs have the capability to meet the Mission Capability of the UTC, but the UTC is not
normally available for deployment. Unit commanders will code the UTCs ―Yellow‖ in AEF
Reporting Tool with comments explaining the degradation of the UTC and completion date of
the career broadening program. Deployment of a DXX UTC is only done in coordination with
the Major Command Functional Area Manager (FAM) who will confirm availability with the
providing organization. Headquarters Air Force (HAF) FAMs must provide specific guidance to
respective AFMC FAMs to ensure this process is managed correctly.
   7.2.1. (Added-AFNWC) Due to their non-deployable status CBOs will not be recalled for
   local exercises. They are in training status and will be recalled for information purposes
   only. CBOs are responsible to the AFNWC/CV during all recalls, not attached units. CBO
   recall information will be tracked by the AFNWC Logistic Directorate (AFNWC/LG) per
   paragraph 9.13.3. of this supplement.
   7.2.2. (Added-AFNWC) CBOs will participate in Higher Headquarters (HHQ) Inspections;
   to include recalls and inspection activities that impact their current rotation.
