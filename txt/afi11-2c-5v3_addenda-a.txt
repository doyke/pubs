                                            Chapter 1

                                            POLICY

1.1. General. This instruction establishes basic configurations, standard equipment, and
equipment location aboard the C-5. Included are weight and balance, standard weight and
moment data for use in completing DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-
Transport/Tactical.
1.2. Airplane Coding. This instruction provides coverage for C-5A, C-5B, C-5M, and C-5A
Space Canister Modified (SCM) airplanes. C-5A airplanes are designated by the letter {A} C-5B
by the letter {B}, C-5M by the letter {M}, and C-5A SCM by the letter {S}. Portions of this
instruction are designated by the use of these symbols to indicate applicability to C-5A, C-5B, C-
5M, C-5A SCM, or C-5M SCM airplanes. Items not designated as applicable to either {A}, {B},
{M}, or {S} airplanes are applicable to all four series.
1.3. Responsibility. Air Force units performing services on the C-5 airplane, e.g. terminal
services, support equipment branch, and Aircrew Flight Equipment are responsible for
configuring the aircraft with the equipment listed in this instruction or as outlined in mission
directives. This includes stowage or installation of the equipment according to the configurations
in this instruction and applicable installation directives (i.e. Technical Orders (T.O.) 1C-5A-2-2,
1C-5M-2-2, 1C-5A-21, 1C-5M-21, 1C-5A- 9 and 1C-5M-9). During preflight, aircrew personnel
will ensure that required mission equipment has been provided and properly serviced, installed,
or stowed.
1.4. Standard Configuration Codes. Use the letter codes in Table 1.1 when referring to C-5
configurations. The number that identifies the configuration capability will follow the letter code.
Each configuration code will be indicated in the mission directive.
1.5. Deviations and Waivers. Configurations in this instruction may require deviations for
specific mission requirements. Each mission directive will identify the basic configuration and
any deviations. For example, a Phoenix Banner mission carrying presidential helicopters may
require an additional winch. Deviations may require changes to weight and balance calculations.
1.6. Weight and Balance. To standardize equipment quantities and locations, items shown in
Table 2.1. will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft except
for maintenance and inspection. Equipment in Table 2.2 will be pre-positioned for all local
training and operational missions to meet standard configurations listed in Table 3.1 and will be
entered in reference 5, 6, or 7 of DD Form 365-4. EXCEPTION: To maximize fuel savings
without impacting manpower and storage area requirements, items marked with an asterisk (*) in
tables 2.1 and 2.2 may be removed for local training missions. Any removed equipment must be
placed back onboard the aircraft prior to departing home station for a scheduled mission.
1.7. Changes and Supplements. See AFI 11-2C-5V3, C-5 Operations Procedures, Chapter 1.
1.8. References. See AFI 11-2C-5V3 and the following:

                         CONSOLIDATED EQUIPMENT TABLES

2.1. Scope. All airplanes will be configured with the equipment listed in Table 2.1. This
equipment will be included in the aircraft basic weight. Items listed in Table 2.2 are added only
as necessary to attain standard configurations listed in Table 3.1 and/or comply with mission
directives.
2.2. Forms. AFVA 11-225, C-5 Passenger Emergency Information Card, informs passengers
of the proper location and use of emergency equipment and exits (see AFI 11-202V3, General
Flight Rules, for passenger briefing card requirements).
2.3. Aircraft Life Sustaining Equipment (ALSE). Configure aircraft in accordance with T.O.
1C-5A-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series, C-5A and C-5B Airplanes, and T.O. 1C-5M-1, Flight
Manual, USAF Series, C-5M Airplanes. Aircraft commanders (AC) may request that additional
equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as
required. However, units will ensure they do not exceed their total equipment authorizations per
applicable allowance standards (AS).

NOTES:
1. Part number (P/N) 358-1506 series oxygen mask with goggles attached is the preferred
smoke and fume protection for aircrew personnel. Firefighters smoke masks may be used until
358-series oxygen masks and goggles are available.
2. EPOS is the preferred system for passenger smoke and fume protection. As a minimum,
each aircraft will have one EPOS per passenger. Preposition additional EPOS for increased
scheduled PAX loads.
3. Add parachutes as required by other configuration publications.
4. The A/C is the preferred LPU for passengers. As a minimum, each aircraft will have one
LPU for each passenger.
5. The LPU-10/P LPU is required to integrate with ALSE and is designed for use by aircrew
personnel. A/C LPUs are not compatible for use with parachutes and survival vests and must
not be used as a substitute for this LPU.
6. Survival Vests are required when parachutes are prepositioned aboard aircraft, or any time
aircrew is flying a combat mission and they are required by theater SPINS. Survival vests
provide crewmembers the necessary survival items while waiting for rescue or return to duty.
Quantities will match number of parachutes aboard aircraft.
7. Aircraft flying over water to Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) will load one 25-
person life raft and five LPU-10/Ps to support crewmembers as required.
8. For all aircraft transfers, position ALSE on each aircraft IAW permanent transfer
configuration. Units gaining transferred aircraft, to include PDM aircraft, will contact the
losing organization’s AFE section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and
inspection records. Gaining AFE organization will conduct an aircraft acceptance inspection
and forward a copy of discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective
MAJCOM IAW T.O. 00-20-1. Do not transfer aircraft with less than the required equipment.
The losing organization will make up any necessary shortages from on-hand assets to ensure
transferring aircraft has required equipment installed.

                                            Chapter 4

                                       LOAD PLANNING

4.1. Scope. This chapter contains information to assist personnel in load planning.
4.2. General. Table 4.1 contains standard weight information. The following factors must be
considered during load planning:
   4.2.1. The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the loaded airplane
   shall be within specified forward and aft limits. Consideration must also be given to offload
   sequence, airplane limitations, and emergency jettisoning. For fuel efficiency, plan for a zero
   fuel center of gravity of approximately 38 percent of MAC. NOTE: Any possible addition of
   passengers and baggage must be accounted for during planning to prevent the possibility of
   exceeding aircraft limitations. For example, if a full load of passengers and baggage could be
   added, initially loadplanning for a zero fuel center of gravity of 36 percent of MAC would
   prevent exceeding aircraft center of gravity limitations.
   4.2.2. Pallets loaded in pallet positions 1, 2, 35, and 36 (forward and aft ramps) shall have a
   14-inch access, which shall extend from the outboard edge of the pallet to the vertical
   stacking line of the cargo (T.O. 1C-5A-9, and T.O. 1C-5M-9).
   4.2.3. No lateral overhang permitted for pallets loaded into the aircraft rail system. Ensure
   the maximum width of 104 inches of usable area of the pallet is not exceeded (T.O. 1C-5A-9
   and T.O. 1C-5M-9).
   4.2.4. The maximum height of cargo for pallet positions 35 and 36 (aft ramp) shall not
   exceed 70 inches measured on the aft side of the pallet (T.O. 1C-5A-9, and T.O. 1C-5M-9)
   4.2.5. The weight limit on the forward or aft ramp is 7,500 pounds-per-pallet position (T.O.
   1C-5A-9, and T.O. 1C-5M-9)
   4.2.6. {S} AFT cargo door configuration prohibits left or right straight in loading of
   palletized cargo into the logistics rail system (T.O. 1C-5A-9-1, and T.O. 1C-5M-9-1).
   4.2.7. When 20 or more passengers or troops are planned, a pallet position shall be left open
   to accommodate the palletized baggage.
   4.2.8. Do not place cargo in a position that shall restrict the use of the flight deck or troop
   compartment ladders.
4.3. Planning for the Loading and Placement of Hazardous Cargo. All classes of hazardous
materials listed as acceptable for air transportation may be transported on the C-5 airplane.
Hazardous cargo that is considered jettisonable shall not be positioned forward of non-
jettisonable cargo, i.e. vehicles, helicopters, pallet trains, etc., except when weight and location
will permit jettisoning by hand. Hazardous jettisonable cargo must be readily accessible and
positioned for emergency jettison.
4.4. Miscellaneous Data.
4.5. {A}{B} Personnel Limitation with One Lavatory Inoperative. The Personnel Limitation
Chart (Figure 4.1.) reflects the number of passengers or troops that one troop compartment

lavatory can accommodate and must be considered when determining the number of personnel
that can be airlifted with one inoperative lavatory.

   mission requirements dictate a weight above 635,850 pounds, consult T.O. 1C-5A-1 or T.O.
   1C-5M-1, Section V, Sink Rate Limitations, and document the associated allowable sink
   speed in the remarks section.
   A2.2.3. Allowable ZFW. The maximum ZFW is 665,000 pounds unless nonstandard fuel
   sequence procedures are used or aircraft is structurally restricted. Verify the allowable ZFW
   with the flight engineer.

table 2-1, or enter by compartment centroid. Use fuselage station (FS) 440 for compartment "A";
FS 730 for compartment "B"; FS 917 for compartment "C"; and FS 2031 for compartment "E".
A2.6. Reference 4. Enter crew baggage at 50 pounds each using FS 500. Additional weight
should be added per crewmember when mobility bags are carried.
A2.7. Reference 5, 6 and 7 (see Chapter 3). Enter weight and moment. Also, indicate
configuration used.
A2.8. Reference 8. Enter liquid nitrogen weight and moment. Use FS 1418 for liquid nitrogen
moment computations.
A2.9. Reference 9. The total of references 1 through 8.
A2.10. Reference 10. Enter takeoff fuel (ramp fuel minus 3,000 pounds for taxi and takeoff
roll). Fuel moments may be computed using the interpolation method or using 14 moments for
each 1,000 pounds of fuel over the standard fuel figures in T.O. 1C-5A-5-2 or T.O. 1C-5M-5-2.
A2.11. Reference 11. Leave blank.
A2.12. Reference 12. The total of references 9 and 10.
A2.13. Reference 13. Distribution of Allowable Load:
   A2.13.1. Enter 463L pallets with cargo by pallet position or fuselage station.
 22                                       AFI11-2C-5V3_ADDENDA-A 1 NOVEMBER 2011

   T.O. 1C-5M-5-2, page 2-10, or enter by compartment centroid (Use FS 1675 for
   compartment "E".)
A2.14. Reference 14. Enter the ZFW, zero fuel moment, and zero fuel percent of MAC. If the
ZFW CG falls outside the ZFW envelope (loading data manual), the cargo load preplan must be
adjusted.
A2.15. Reference 15. Subtotals; enter totals from reference 13.
A2.16. Reference 16. Enter the total of references 12 and 15.
A2.17. Reference 17. Enter the takeoff CG in percent of MAC.
A2.18. Reference 18. Enter corrections (when applicable).
A2.19. Reference 19. Enter the total of references 16 and 18. If no corrections, leave blank.
A2.20. Reference 20. Enter the corrected CG in percent of MAC. If no corrections, leave blank.
A2.21. Reference 21. Enter ZFW and moment. (Adjust if corrections are made)
A2.22. Reference 22. Leave blank except for airdrop missions.
A2.23. Reference 23. Enter estimated landing fuel weight and moment. Check computerized
flight plan or use 30,000 pounds for first hour of flight and 20,000 pounds per hour for remainder
of flight.
A2.24. Reference 24. Enter the total of references 21 and 23. This weight should not exceed the
allowable landing GW shown in the limitations block.
A2.25. Reference 25. Enter the estimated landing CG in percent of MAC.
A2.26. Remarks Block. Enter nonstandard fuel sequence information, if applicable, the
maneuver load limit (if less than 2.5g), and any aircraft structural weight restrictions.
   A2.26.1. Nonstandard fuel sequencing will be used when maintenance problems preclude
   the use of certain fuel tanks. Nonstandard fuel procedures are essentially the same as
   standard fuel sequencing with the following exceptions:
       A2.26.1.1. The flight engineer will inform or provide the loadmaster of the conditions
       requiring this configuration and the fuel weight distribution of individual tanks.
       A2.26.1.2. Fuel weight moments will be computed using the standard sequence fuel
       moment tables in T.O. 1C-5A-5-2, T.O. 1C-5A-5-2-1, T.O. 1C-5M-5-2, and T.O. 1C-
       5M-5-2-1.
       A2.26.1.3. Special zero fuel weight center of gravity (ZFWCG) restrictions are required
       when using nonstandard fuel sequencing. Enter ZFWCG limitation in the limitation
       block. (See T.O. 1C-5A-1 or T.O. 1C-5M-1, figure 5-7.).
       A2.26.1.4. Weight limitation restriction. Depending on which tanks are empty, the
       takeoff and fuel allowable gross weight limitations will be restricted. The landing
       limitation will remain at 769,000 pounds. Comply with T.O. 1C-5A-1 or T.O. 1C-5M-1,
       section V, Nonstandard Fuel Sequence Procedures.

      A2.26.1.5. Use the remarks block to record the fuel breakdown of symmetrical tanks,
      weight and moments, i.e., 1 and 4 main tanks 47,000 pounds @ 758 moments. NOTE:
      When calculating moments for fuel, use 14 moments for each 1,000 pounds of fuel over
      the standard fuel figures contained in T.O. 1C-5A-5-2 or T.O. 1C-5M-5-2.
   A2.26.2. Maneuver load limitations apply.
      A2.26.2.1. When ZFW does not exceed 590,000 pounds and takeoff GW does not
      exceed 769,000 pounds, no entry required.
      A2.26.2.2. When ZFW is between 590,000 and 635,000 pounds or takeoff GW is greater
      than 769,000 pounds, enter "Maneuver load limit 2.25g.”
      A2.26.2.3. When ZFW is between 635,000 and 665,000 pounds, enter "maneuver load
      limit 2.0g.”
