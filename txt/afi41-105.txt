SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
incorporates changes to Air Force enlisted medical training programs as a result of the 882d
Training Group relocation, which were driven by the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment
Commission Report (BRAC) recommendations, from Sheppard AFB, TX to Joint Base San
Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, TX and subsequent stand up of the 937 Training Group (937 TRG)
at 37 TRW, Lackland AFB, TX, supporting METC. HQ AF/SG1 has been updated to HQ
AF/SG1/8.

                                           Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Training Philosophy.
1.1. The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) has a continuing need for highly skilled officers
and enlisted members to be part of the Air Force health care team. The Readiness of the AFMS
relies on the right training, at the right time, and is paramount to carrying out the Air Force
mission. The AFMS has several approved avenues to obtain enlisted and officer initial skills
training, to include those that are conducted in MTFs and affiliated training sites under the
guidance of AETC or Air Force Material Command (AFMC). All training must consistently be
assessed to reflect the needs of AFMS personnel in the evolving health care environment.
1.2. Training Programs.
   1.2.1. Phase I Medical Training Programs: This category includes officer and enlisted
   resident medical training taught and instructed at the United States Air Force School of
   Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM), METC at the 937 TRG, and geographically separated
   locations.
   1.2.2. Phase II Medical Training Programs: These programs are managed by the 937 TRG
   and are an extension of Phase I training. Phase II programs encompass initial skill courses for
   officer and enlisted medical personnel conducted at AF MTFs, Sister Service MTFs and
   civilian partner platforms by personnel assigned to that facility. The USAF Consolidated
   Training Plan (CTP) for Non-Resident Medical Training Programs covers phase II and non-
   resident training.
   1.2.3. Advanced and Supplemental Training: This category contains all other formal officer
   and enlisted courses managed by the 937 TRG and USAFSAM not classified as Phase I or II
   training. Advanced and Supplemental Training, IAW AFI 36-2201 Air Force Training
   Program, defines Advanced Training as formal courses that provide individuals who are
   qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills
   and knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field. Supplemental Training is
   training toward a portion of an AF specialty without change to the AFSC.

Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and Field Operating Agencies
(FOAs) that require corporate review. Special Program Authorizations (SPA) included in the

   2.7.2. The Medical Resource Management Office of each MTF is responsible for requesting,
   through their MAJCOM, “T” prefix designations for each enlisted course supervisor (CS)
   position. (T-1). These requests must identify the specific Unit Manpower Document (UMD)

   addition, annexes are provided by the 937 TRG for each course and contain, as a minimum, a
   training standard, course chart, instructional guide, student performance checklists, and a
   study reference list.
