This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 41-1, Health Care Programs and
Resources. It gives directive requirements for the operation, management, surveillance, and
evaluation of officer and enlisted medical training programs conducted in the U.S. Air Force
medical treatment facilities (MTF). This instruction complements the training structure under
Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for programs conducted at other major command
(MAJCOM) MTFs. This publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command and Air National
Guard medical personnel during initial skills training while under the 882 Training Group. It
does not provide guidance for Graduate Medical Education programs. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Requests for
policy clarification or waivers to this instruction should be sent to HQ AF/ SG1, 1500 Wilson
Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates changes to medical training programs as a result of the stand up of the
Medical Education Training Campus (METC) in San Antonio Texas and the relocation of the
882d Training Group (882 TRG) from Sheppard AFB, Texas to Ft Sam Houston, Texas. HQ
AF/SGC has been updated to HQ AF/SG1. DoDI 6000.16, Military Health Support for Stability
Operations has been added as a reference.

                                            Chapter 1

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Training Philosophy. The Air Force Medical Service has a continuing need for highly
skilled officers and enlisted members to be part of the Air Force health care team. To support this
continuing need, the Air Force Medical Service has approved selected enlisted and officer initial
skills training to be conducted in MTFs under the guidance of AETC.
1.2. Training Programs.
     1.2.1. Phase I Medical Training Programs: This category includes all officers and enlisted
     resident medical training managed by the 882 TRG, Ft Sam Houston, Texas.
     1.2.2. Phase II Medical Training Programs: These programs are an extension of Phase I
     training. They encompass those formal courses for officer or enlisted medical personnel
     conducted at MTFs by personnel assigned to that facility.
     1.2.3. Advanced and Supplemental Programs: This category contains all other formal officer
     and enlisted courses managed by the 882 TRG not classified as Phase I or II training.
1.3. 882 TRG Guidance.
     1.3.1. USAF Consolidated Training Plan (CTP) is the primary document directing control of
     instruction and program/course administration of Phase II and supplemental medical training
     programs. In addition, annexes are provided by the 882 TRG for each course and contain, as
     a minimum, a training standard, course chart, instructional guide, student performance
     checklists, and a study reference list.
     1.3.2. Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) and/or training affiliation agreements (TAA)
     are not required for Phase II medical training because the CTP contains the required
     information.

   2.4.2. MTFs will exercise command, supervision, and administrative control over students as
   established in the CTP. Note: Students are not part of the permanent staffing at the Phase II
   medical facility and are not included in related staffing computations. Consequently, students
   are not used in direct support of patient workload for other than training purposes and do not
   participate in permanent party ancillary training.
2.5. 882d Training Group (882 TRG) provides the following:
   2.5.1. Guidance (CTP) to the MTFs conducting medical training courses.
   2.5.2. On-site evaluation of course administration IAW CTP.
