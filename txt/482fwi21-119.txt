       Tower net) and net A7 (alternate Ramp net). Both radio nets will be monitored at all
       times during movements of live 1.1 and 1.2 explosives to and from Alert Facility.
       WARNING: At no time shall a delivery crew use the alternate route until the above
       steps have been taken.
