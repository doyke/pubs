guidance governing the self inspection (SI) program for the 100th Air Refueling Wing (100
ARW). Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Significant revisions
include: Integration of the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) software. New
procedures for semi-annual currency and accuracy reviews of unit regulatory guidance libraries
and SI checklists are now included. Deficiency/Causal Codes and the AF 8-Step Problem
Solving Model have been incorporated into the SI program.
1. PURPOSE:
   1.1. The objective of a SI program is to provide commanders and supervisors at all levels
   with an effective tool for assessing unit health, performance capabilities, and to ensure
   compliance with all applicable directives and regulatory guidance. Program involvement
   must start at the highest level while allowing for execution and deficiency resolution at the
2                                                      MILDENHALLI90-102 22 JULY 2011


    lowest level. This program provides guidance that directs the execution of unit SIs via MICT
    at least twice annually.
    1.2. A secondary function of this program is a means of tracking MAJCOM inspection
    deficiencies and wing exercise deficiencies until recommended and approved for closure.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
    2.1. The Vice Wing Commander (100 ARW/CV)
       2.1.1. 100 ARW/CV will provide overall supervision to the SI Program.
       2.1.2. 100 ARW/CV will appoint, in writing, 100 ARW/XPI as the wing SI Program
       managers.
       2.1.3. 100 ARW/CV will monitor the wing SI Program for all subordinate Groups,
       Squadrons, and Staff Agencies.
       2.1.4. 100 ARW/CV will accomplish MICT commander responsibilities and actions for
       the wing SI Program.
       2.1.5. Following a major inspection (USAFE/IG Compliance (CI) or Operational
       Readiness Inspections, etc) 100 ARW/CV may waive the next semi-annual inspection
       cycle requirements stipulated in this publication if the SI is deemed redundant or
       unnecessary.
    2.2. Group Commanders and Director of Staff
       2.2.1. Group commanders and the Director of Staff (DS) will appoint, in writing, a
       group-level SI monitor. Group commanders and the DS will forward appointment letter
       updates to 100 ARW/XPI whenever appointments change. See template at attachment 2.
       2.2.2. Group commanders and the DS will monitor the SI Program for all subordinate
       Units, Squadrons, and Staff Agencies.
       2.2.3. Group commanders and the DS will accomplish MICT commander responsibilities
       and actions for their group/staff SI Programs.
       2.2.4. Group commanders and the DS will provide guidance concerning the resolution
       and closure of SI deficiencies within their groups. When practical, resolution and closure
       of deficiencies should follow the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined in the
       Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) Playbook. Group
       commanders and the DS may delegate this responsibility to subordinate commanders and
       agency chiefs.
    2.3. Squadron Commanders and Wing Staff Agency Chiefs
       2.3.1. Squadron commanders and wing staff agency chiefs will each appoint, in writing,
       a unit SI monitor and ensure group monitors forward all appointment letters to 100
       ARW/XPI. See template at attachment 2.
       2.3.2. Squadron commanders and agency chiefs will monitor their SI program on a
       quarterly basis.
MILDENHALLI90-102 22 JULY 2011                                                               3


     2.3.3. Squadron commanders and agency chiefs will provide guidance concerning the
     resolution and closure of SI deficiencies within their units if delegated the authority by
     their group commander/DS.
  2.4. 100 ARW/XPI (Program Management)
     2.4.1. 100 ARW/XPI will act as the wing SI program managers. 100 ARW/XPI initiates
     the semi-annual SI cycle. 100 ARW/XPI monitors and reports the completion of all unit
     SIs to 100 ARW/CV.
     2.4.2. 100 ARW/XPI will ensure compliance with this instruction by conducting
     quarterly spot inspections of 100 ARW units’ SI programs.
     2.4.3. 100 ARW/XPI will function as the 100 ARW’s MICT Help Desk. In this capacity
     100 ARW/XPI will provide training to group and unit monitors to enable them to train
     their unit personnel (via the train-the-trainer concept). Further, 100 ARW/XPI will
     function as the final troubleshooting resource for group and unit administrators when
     MICT issues cannot be resolved at the lowest possible level using MICT training slides,
     user guides, and how to demonstrations available within MICT and on the MICT
     Customer Support Community of Practice (CoP). Additionally, 100 ARW/XPI will
     function as the single 100 ARW liaison to the AF level MICT Help Desk, MICT
     representatives, and program managers.
  2.5. Group and Wing Staff (Group) Monitors
     2.5.1. Prior to each SI cycle, group monitors will ensure that unit monitors lead currency
     and accuracy reviews of unit regulatory guidance libraries and all unit SI checklists.
     2.5.2. Group monitors will ensure their organizations complete semi-annual SIs and use
     MICT to track open deficiencies within their groups/staff agencies.
     2.5.3. Upon completion of the inspection cycle, and receipt of unit level reports (see
     section 2.6.3), group monitors will compile and submit unit reports to their group
     commander and 100ARW/XPI. Additionally, group monitors will compile and submit a
     separate summary report for group programs to their group commander and 100
     ARW/XPI.
        2.5.3.1. Reports must be submitted no later than 105 days after the start of the SI
        period.
        2.5.3.2. Group monitors will retain a copy of each semi-annual report and any SI
        checklists or SI documentation not archived within MICT as evidence of inspection
        completion until the next 100ARW CI is completed.
        2.5.3.3. The group programs summary report will comply with the standards detailed
        for unit level summary reports specified in 2.6.3.
     2.5.4. Group monitors will execute group/staff level guidance concerning the resolution
     and closure of SI deficiencies within their groups/staff agencies.
     2.5.5. Group monitors will attempt to solve MICT issues at the lowest possible level and
     troubleshoot within their groups using MICT training slides, user guides, and how to
     demonstrations.

       monitors will:
          2.6.1.1. Lead a review of all unit regulatory guidance libraries to ensure the unit is
          operating from current and accurate guidance (including, but not limited to Air Force
          Instructions, Manuals, Publications, Technical Orders, Commercial Manuals, and
          applicable MAJCOM and wing level supplements).
          2.6.1.2. Lead a review of all unit SI checklists to ensure their currency and accuracy.
          Search MICT, the AF Checklist Service and AF E-Publishing sites for the latest AF
          and MAJCOM compliance checklists. If necessary contact appropriate functional
          area managers and points of contact (POCs) to ensure currency and accuracy of SI
          checklists. If checklists are generated or supplemented locally, ensure any recent
          regulatory guidance changes have been incorporated in the checklists.
       2.6.2. No later than the last duty day of January and July of each calendar year unit
       monitors will ensure their organizations complete semi-annual SIs and track open
       deficiencies within their units. Unit monitors will ensure that all applicable additional
       duty and safety checklists are assessed during the inspection cycle. Reference section
       3.2.4 for more information on additional duty and safety checklists.
       2.6.3. Upon completion of an inspection cycle, unit monitors will prepare reports
       documenting the inspection. Retain a copy of each semi-annual report as evidence of
       inspection completion until the next 100 ARW UCI is completed. The report will be sent
       to the unit commander or agency chief and then to the group level SI monitor no later
       than 90 days after the start of the SI cycle. The report will include:
          2.6.3.1. The number of deficiencies remaining open from previous inspection
          periods.
          2.6.3.2. The number of checklist items inspected during the current inspection
          period.
          2.6.3.3. The number of new deficiencies found during the current inspection period.
          2.6.3.4. The number of new deficiencies closed during the inspection period.

          period.
          2.6.3.6. Any AF or MAJCOM SIIs evaluated.
       2.6.4. Unit monitors will execute group/staff and any unit level guidance concerning the
       resolution and closure of SI deficiencies within their units.
       2.6.5. Unit monitors will attempt to solve MICT issues at the lowest possible level and
       troubleshoot within their units using MICT training slides, user guides, and how to
       demonstrations.
    2.7. Additional Duty POCs
       2.7.1. No later than the last duty day of June and December of each calendar year
       additional duty POCs will:
MILDENHALLI90-102 22 JULY 2011                                                                  5


        2.7.1.1. Lead their unit level representatives in a review of all regulatory guidance
        pertaining to their additional duty area to ensure POCs and unit level representatives
        are operating from current and accurate guidance.
        2.7.1.2. Lead a review of all POC and unit level additional duty checklists to ensure
        their currency and accuracy. Search MICT, the AF Checklist Service, and AF E-
        Publishing sites for the latest AF and MAJCOM compliance checklists. If necessary,
        contact appropriate functional area managers and POCs to ensure currency and
        accuracy of SI checklists. If checklists are generated or supplemented locally, ensure
        any recent regulatory guidance changes have been incorporated in the checklists.
        2.7.1.3. Distribute any changes to regulatory guidance or checklists to unit level
        representatives.
     2.7.2. As necessary or as required by other regulatory guidance additional duty POCs
     will conduct unit level visits to assess the health of unit level additional duty programs
     and verify the currency and accuracy of unit level additional duty checklists and
     regulatory guidance.
3. PROGRAM GUIDANCE:
  3.1. Inspection Period
     3.1.1. 100 ARW/XPI will ensure all 100 ARW organizations conduct SIs at least twice
     per calendar year. The normal timeframe for review of regulatory guidance libraries and
     review of all unit SI checklists to ensure their currency and accuracy is June and
     December with the last day of the month as the target completion date. The normal
     timeframe for inspections is January and July with the last day of the month as the target
     completion date. Semi-annual SIs will:
        3.1.1.1. Review the status of any open deficiencies from previous inspections.
        3.1.1.2. Assess all unit SI checklists (including functional area and all applicable
        additional duty and safety checklists).
        3.1.1.3. Check compliance with current AF and MAJCOM SIIs.
        3.1.1.4. Initiate corrective action as required.
        3.1.1.5. Upon completion of the inspections, unit and group monitors will prepare
        reports documenting the inspection. Reports will list all deficiencies and supporting
        information as outlined in section 2.5.3 and 2.6.3 of this instruction.
     3.1.2. The normal inspection cycle will be 105 days. The timeline for these 105 days is:
        3.1.2.1. Days 1-30: The first 30 days will ordinarily be initiated in the month of June
        or December. In this phase, all self inspection checklists will be checked for currency
        and accuracy.
        3.1.2.2. Days 31-60: After being initiated by 100 ARW/XPI, this phase is for the
        execution of self inspection checklists. Self inspection checklists should be completed
        no later than 60 days following the start of the self inspection cycle.
        3.1.2.3. Days 61-90: Following the completion of the self inspection checklists at the
        unit level, unit monitors will have 30 days to compile a self inspection report signed
6                                                      MILDENHALLI90-102 22 JULY 2011


           by the unit commander. These reports will be presented to group monitors no later
           than 60 days following the initialization of the self inspection cycle.
           3.1.2.4. Days 90-105: During the final 15 days of the inspection cycle, group
           monitors will compile and submit a summary report to 100 ARW/XPI.
       3.1.3. The waiver authority for any deviations from the stated timeline is 100ARW/CV
    3.2. SI Checklists
       3.2.1. Each functional area within each unit that operates using regulatory guidance
       should have a SI checklist. If a checklist is not provided by the AF or MAJCOM level
       HQ, then a locally generated checklist should be created and used. Solicit information
       from USAFE functional managers when using or generating checklists to ensure
       checklists are current and accurate. Only the group commander or DS will determine if a
       unit or functional area is exempt from creating and using locally generated checklists.
       All units will, at a minimum, track and assess the applicable checklists that are posted on
       the AF Checklist Service and AF E-Publishing sites.
       3.2.2. Locally generated SI checklists should be created using the applicable regulatory
       guidance as the guide. If no AF- or MAJCOM-level checklists exist, unit commanders
       should direct a functional expert to create a checklist to help managers, supervisors, and
       commanders accomplish an internal assessment of their organizations’ processes and
       procedures. Examples of tools that may be used to help develop a local checklist are
       inputs from IG Reports, Inspector’s Tips, Staff Assistance Visits, and unit level operating
       instructions. A good rule of thumb is that a checklist item should be written for every
       “Will, Shall, or Must” instruction contained in the regulatory guidance that applies to the
       unit’s functional area. From all of these inputs, functional experts should mold checklists
       to fit the specific unit and its unique conditions, to ensure the checklist is current,
       accurate and relevant to the unit’s mission. Assign primary POCs and the necessary
       number of alternate POCs within MICT for each checklist. These individuals are
       responsible for assessing checklists and ensuring the accuracy and currency of the SI
       checklist they develop.
       3.2.3. All checklists shall be maintained, assessed, and archived within MICT to the
       maximum extent possible. Procedures for building, supplementing, archiving and
       uploading checklist within MICT are listed in training slides, user guides, and how to
       demonstrations available within MICT and on the MICT Customer Support Community
       of Practice (CoP).
       3.2.4. SI checklists are divided into three primary categories: functional area, additional
       duty, and safety. Additional duty checklists and some functional area and safety
       checklists impact most or all units under the 100 ARW. Units should track and assess all
       functional area checklists that apply to their mission areas. Units should also track and
       assess all additional duty and safety checklists when they apply to their mission areas.
       100 ARW XPI shall maintain a master list of additional duties and their respective POCs.
    3.3. Deficiency Closure and Corrective Action:
       3.3.1. Per paragraph 2.4 of AFI90-201 units will use deficiency/causal codes listed in
       Table 2.1, Deficiency/Causal Codes and Explanations, when conducting SIs. If the
MILDENHALLI90-102 22 JULY 2011                                                                  7


      checklist is being executed within MICT, assign deficiency/causal codes to SI
      deficiencies using the drop down list available within MICT.
      3.3.2. When practical resolution and closure of deficiencies should follow the AF 8-Step
      Problem Solving Model as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook. A guide to 8-Step
      Problem Solving is linked within MICT.
      3.3.3. Compose a plan/countermeasures to prevent the deficiency from occurring in the
      future.
      3.3.4. Implement and document training as required.
      3.3.5. Implement new process(es) or internal technique(s) as required.
   3.4. SI Binder:
      3.4.1. Every 100 ARW groups, squadrons, and wing staff agency required to perform SIs
      should maintain a unit SI binder (physical or electronic formats are acceptable).
   3.4.2. Unit SI binders will follow the subsequent format:
          3.4.2.1. (Section One) Administration:        Include copies of the most current
          appointment letters for your level and below.
          3.4.2.2. (Section Two) Regulatory/Policy Guidance:         Include this instruction
          (MILDI 90-102) and any local policy directives pertaining to SIs. Units should
          incorporate their group commander/DS SI policy directives into their binders. At a
          minimum, units should list the location (electronic or physical) where all applicable
          regulatory guidance can be found.
          3.4.2.3. (Section Three) Reports: Maintain all reports detailed in sections 2.5.3 and
          2.6.3 for each semiannual SI from the last UCI until completion of the next UCI.
          3.4.2.4. (Section Four) Miscellaneous: Includes any other materials relating to unit
          deficiencies, trends, and or inspections (i.e., HHQ inspection results, local exercise
          after action reports (AARs), unit SI reports, MAJCOM functional out-briefs, etc.
          when applicable to the unit).
4. 100 ARW Exercise Deficiencies:
   4.1. Guidance for the wing exercise program is provided in MILDI 90-201, where the
   definition of an exercise deficiency can also be found. Exercise deficiencies will be listed in
   the AAR published for each 100 ARW Quick Bank (QB) and FLASH exercise. The AARs
   are posted on the 100 ARW/XPI Community of Practice page.
   4.2. All wing exercise deficiencies will be tracked utilizing deficiency checklists within
   MICT. The primary POC listed for each deficiency is responsible for coordinating with any
   alternate POCs. Only after this is accomplished may the primary POC submit a request for
   closure to 100 ARW/XPI through the squadron and group commanders/DS.
   4.3. Wing exercise deficiencies will be tracked by the unit SI monitor until final closure is
   approved by 100 ARW/XPI. The status of open deficiencies, to include estimated
   completion dates and recommended actions for closure, will be reported by the unit SI
   monitor to the appropriate commander monthly. The 100 ARW target is for 90% of all
8                                                      MILDENHALLI90-102 22 JULY 2011


    deficiencies for each exercise to be closed within 60 days after the publication date of the
    exercise AAR, and 100% closed within 90 days following publication of the AAR.
    4.4. Closing an exercise deficiency:
       4.4.1. Match the deficiency with a deficiency/causal codes listed in Table 2.1 of AFI90-
       201.
       4.4.1.1. Identify the root cause of the deficiency; the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model
       should be used in deficiency resolution as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook.
       4.4.2. Compose a plan/countermeasures to prevent the deficiency from occurring in the
       future.
       4.4.3. Implement and document training as required.
       4.4.4. Implement new process(es) or internal technique(s) as required.
    4.5. 100 ARW/XPI will track the status of open critical and significant exercise deficiencies
    and provide monthly reports to 100 ARW/CV. Group commanders/DS are responsible for
    tracking and closing open minor exercise deficiencies internally.
