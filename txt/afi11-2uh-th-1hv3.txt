SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
removes all tactics, techniques, and procedures now incorporated into Air Force Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-3.H-1 Combat Aircraft Fundamentals H-1, 4 January
2010. Significant chapter changes include: Chapter 4, Training Procedures - deleted references to
traffic pattern, takeoffs and landings, hover maneuvers, transition maneuvers, instrument
maneuvers, hydraulics-off approaches, emergency governor operations, simulated fixed pedal
malfunctions, and simulated engine failures; Chapter 5, Unprepared Landing Site Procedures -
deleted references to: aircraft control techniques, pre-mission preparation, unprepared site
selection/evaluation, approaches, go-around decisions, hover, remote takeoff and landing,
turbulent air techniques and tail rotor considerations. Chapter 6, Night Operations - deleted
references to ambient illumination requirements, aircraft configurations, site selection for
training, and flight planning; Chapter 7, Formation Procedures - removed information on safety
considerations, communications checks, formation types, formations maneuvers (line up for
takeoff, takeoff, aborts, rejoins), en route, changing formations, lead changes, instrument
meteorological conditions avoidance, lost visual procedures and terminal operations including
formation landings; Chapter 8, Low-level Operations - changed to reflect the deletion of: the
flight planning section, unknown position guidance, low-level flight, low-level approach
procedures, and enemy threat encounters and evasive maneuvering; and Chapter 9, Search and
Rescue (SAR) Procedures - reflects the transfer SAR mission planning, search procedures and
search patterns information.

Notes:
1. Equipment designated for flight in day, night, IMC, or NVG must be operational and the
minimum required, regardless of the intended mission.
2. Required equipment items 1, 3, 9, and 15 must be operational at both pilot and copilot
stations. All vacuum and electrical sources for flight instruments must be operational.
3. As determined by the aircraft commander.
4. As required seasonally or on flights of more than 1 hour at temperatures below 0 degrees
Celsius.
5. The NVG infrared searchlight must be installed and operational for NVG flights below 20
percent illumination. Failure of the light in flight must be evaluated to determine its impact
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                   9

on the mission and further NVG flight.
6. Must be operational for anticipated flight below 10 degrees Celsius.
7. Both ADCs are required for all phases of flight.
8. To accept an aircraft for flight all three MFD’s must be operational. For a mission
already in progress, if one MFD fails, the crew may elect to continue the mission. Two
failed MFDs (one pilot’s still working) requires the flight to return to base.

2.4. Altitude Restrictions:
   2.4.1. Conduct all operations at or above 300 feet above ground level (AGL) except when
   lower altitudes are required for takeoff, landing, and operations in approved areas or routes.
   2.4.2. The minimum altitude for low-level training is 100 feet above highest obstacle
   (AHO).
   2.4.3. Avoid buildings, farm-related facilities, and structures by 500-foot slant range.
2.5. Weather Minimums. Prior to takeoff, ensure an appropriate course of action is identified
(and briefed) in the event of an emergency after takeoff. Forecast and observed weather
(predominate) must meet minimums specified.
   2.5.1. All VFR training flights require a 700-foot ceiling and 2 statute miles (sm) visibility,
   except:
       2.5.1.1. Night, NVG, cross-country, and student team flights require a 1,000-foot ceiling
       and 3 sm visibility.
       2.5.1.2. If observed or forecast weather conditions deteriorate below the specified
       minimums, terminate training by recovering to an airfield or landing the aircraft. Note:
       Weather minimums in paragraphs 2.5.1.1 and 2.5.1.2 do not apply to hover and air taxi
       operations at the aerodrome.
   2.5.2. Surface wind limits are 30 knots or less, or a gust spread of 15 knots. For student team
   sorties, the wind limits are 20 knots or less (including gusts), or a gust spread of 10 knots.
   2.5.3. Flight may be made into areas of known or forecast thunderstorms if visual
   meteorological conditions (VMC) are maintained and thunderstorm activity is avoided by a
   minimum of 5 nautical miles (nm). Do not fly into rain shafts beneath cumulonimbus clouds.
2.6. Standard Configurations and Weight and Balance. Compute a new or corrected form if
the initial takeoff weight changes by more than 500 pounds. For configuration changes of less
than 500 pounds, the aircraft commander ensures the resulting center of gravity is within limits.
2.7. Passengers. When the squadron is tasked to fly with passengers on board, follow the
requirements of AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supplements. Passengers
will:
 10                                                       AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010


   2.7.1. Be escorted while under the rotor disk with rotors turning. The aircraft commander or
   designated representative will brief passengers on procedures to follow.
   2.7.2. Not occupy a cockpit seat with the engine running unless authorized via a formal
   orientation request, according to AFI 11-401 and appropriate supplements.
   2.7.3. Receive egress, aircraft familiarization, and EP briefings.
   2.7.4. Have access to hearing protection, provided by aircrews prior to flight.
2.8. Acceptance and FCF Procedures:
   2.8.1. General. Acceptance and functional check flights are inherently more dangerous than
   normal flights. In order to be safely flown, aircrews must be knowledgeable of aircraft
   systems, limits, and check flight procedures.
   2.8.2. Maintenance Briefing. Prior to any FCF, the crew will receive a maintenance
   briefing. The briefing should outline FCF requirements, ensure a review of maintenance
   documentation, and clarify any questions. After aircraft release, or at the end of the day, the
   FCF crew will provide a thorough debrief to maintenance. Maintenance will ensure FCF
   checklists and documentation are complete.
   2.8.3. Local Procedures. Units define their local FCF area. Follow guidance in TO 1-1-
   300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance Operational Checks, for flight
   conditions. If needed, address any unit-unique FCF restrictions in the unit supplement.
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                  11

                                 AIRCREW PROCEDURES

3.1. Aircrew Uniforms and Protective Devices:
   3.1.1. When reporting for flying duties, pilots will wear appropriate flight clothing and carry
   a set of identification (ID) tags on their person.
   3.1.2. Aircrew members will wear reflective belts from official sunset to official sunrise and
   should wear reflective belts while on the flight line during periods of reduced visibility.
   Reflective materials will not be permanently attached or affixed to flight clothing.
3.2. Aircrew Publications Requirements. The UH-1H does not have a U.S. Air Force-style
flightcrew checklist. An Air Force-style flightcrew checklist training aid has been developed
from the Army UH-1H/V Operator's Manual, Technical Manual (TM) 55-1520-210-10. The
flightcrew checklist training aid incorporates all information from TM 55-1520-210-10, and is
approved by 58 operations group (OG) commander (CC). In any checklists, additional notes
amplifying checklist procedures and limitations may be added in pencil. Each crewmember is
responsible to ensure amplifying notes are current.
3.3. Maps. Pilots will plan flights and fly with current maps, including the most recent edition
of the squadron hazards map. Squadron safety will maintain a 1:250,000 joint operations graphic
(JOG) hazards map with updates from the chart updating manual (CHUM) posted.
3.4. Crew Briefings and Checklists. The pilot will ensure all applicable briefings and
checklists are completed prior to the event.
3.5. Flightcrew Information File (FCIF). The FCIF contains reference material appropriate
for squadron operations as designated by the OG/CC. Aircrews will review the FCIF before
departure on all missions. An electronic equivalent may be used. The aircraft commander will
provide an FCIF update to all crewmembers who are delinquent in their FCIF review or who join
a mission en route.
3.6. Flight Plans. A MAJCOM-approved form or flight authorization may be used instead of
DD Form 175, Flight Plan, Military, for VFR flights terminating at the base of departure.
3.7. Flight Planning:
   3.7.1. Use AF IMT 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, or a more detailed navigation log
   for all flights outside the local flying area.
   3.7.2. Prepare an AF IMT 70 for each navigation, remote, low-level, and NVG mission. As a
   minimum, the IMT will include turning points, headings, distances, estimated times of arrival
   (ETA), minimum safe altitudes (MSA), and fuel computations.
   3.7.3. Complete takeoff and landing data (TOLD) prior to takeoff, and, whenever possible,
   prior to the aircrew briefing.
   3.7.4. The same TOLD will suffice for consecutive takeoffs and landings when aircraft gross
   weight or environmental conditions have not increased significantly; that is, by 200 pounds
   gross weight, 5 degrees Celsius, or 500 feet pressure altitude (PA).
 12                                                        AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010


   3.7.5. Aircraft commanders must plan to arrive at their destination with a minimum fuel
   reserve of 250 pounds (for both VFR and IFR).
3.8. Required Documentation:
   3.8.1. Prior to departure, the pilot will ensure a current mission kit is aboard the aircraft. See
   paragraph 2.2.
   3.8.2. Each pilot will carry a unit-developed in-flight guide (IFG) and the flightcrew
   checklist or flightcrew checklist training aid.
   3.8.3. Before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft systems, review the AFTO
   Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. An authorized maintenance
   person (or the aircraft commander when off-station) must sign the exceptional release before
   flight. The fuel identaplate or aviation into-plane card (aviation credit card) must be aboard
   the aircraft when off-station refueling is planned or required. A canned weight and balance
   form will be dated within 1 year.
3.9. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations:
   3.9.1. At locations with refueling support, aircrews will not personally accomplish the
   refueling unless extenuating circumstances dictate. When not directly involved in the
   refueling operation, personnel will remain at least 50 feet from the aircraft. Hot refueling
   requires execution of the appropriate hot refueling checklist.
   3.9.2. The card is used to pay for services at commercial fixed base operators (FBO). These
   services include aviation fuel, aircraft oil and fluids, or other minor maintenance items.
   Charges incurred during this routine aircraft servicing generate a charge receipt. The aircraft
   commander is responsible for ensuring the receipt is correct and all appropriate signatures are
   obtained before departing the FBO. The aircraft commander then gives all charge receipts to
   the unit document control officer (DCO) when the mission is complete. Charges incurred for
   other services, including landing fees, aircraft de-icing, follow-me trucks, and other airfield-
   related services might not generate a receipt for the aircrew. If a receipt is not generated and
   provided to the aircrew, the aircraft commander will note the location and services
   performed, and provide the information when submitting receipts to the unit DCO after the
   mission is complete. If a separate receipt is generated, turn it in to the unit DCO.
3.10. Dropped Object Prevention. During preflight inspections, the aircrew will pay particular
attention to panels and components, which are potential dropped objects. Secure all cargo and
mission equipment inside the aircraft prior to any aircraft movement. Warning: Loose objects
can become hazardous projectiles during any violent maneuver or hard landing. Secure objects to
prevent personnel injury or aircraft damage.
3.11. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements. The pilot will ensure sufficient quantities of
appropriate serviceable aircrew flight equipment, survival equipment, and protective clothing are
aboard the aircraft. Crewmembers will wear survival vests on all flights.
3.12. Instrument Cockpit Check. Complete an instrument cockpit check before takeoff if
expecting IMC during flight. Note: This procedure applies to the TH-1H Only. See dual
systems in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. For the purposes of the instrument cockpit
check/navigation equipment check, the very high frequency omni-directional range station
(VOR), tactical air navigation (TACAN), distance measuring equipment (DME) or an IFR-
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                     13


certified global positioning system (GPS) may be used in place of a second like system. When
checking dual systems, the systems are considered reliable for instrument flight if they check
within ±4 degrees and 1/2 nm or 3 percent (whichever is greater) of each other.
3.13. Checklist. Use the challenge (read) and response (accomplish) method when using the
checklist. During EPs, the crewmember reading the checklist will read the entire step (challenge
and response). The crewmember who is accomplishing will repeat the response. A checklist is
not complete until all items are completed in sequence.
3.14. Seatbelts:
   3.14.1. The pilot on the controls has his or her seatbelt and shoulder harness fastened when
   rotors are turning.
   3.14.2. When doors are open during flight, all occupants in the cabin area will wear a
   seatbelt or gunner’s belt.
   3.14.3. When doors are closed during flight, the aircraft commander may direct
   crewmembers to perform duties in the cabin unrestrained for brief periods, as required.
   3.14.4. TH-1H crewmembers sitting in the center observer seat may fly without shoulder
   straps if straps hinder their ability to perform aircrew duties. The shoulder harness will be
   worn during actual and simulated emergency procedures.
3.15. Radios:
   3.15.1. The pilot informs the crew which radio is primary. All crewmembers monitor the
   primary radio unless the aircraft commander specifically directs otherwise.
   3.15.2. All crewmembers listen to the intercom. The aircraft commander must provide
   clearance prior to going off the intercom. During critical phases of flight, limit transmissions
   within the aircraft to those essential for crew coordination.
3.16. Scanners. Crewmembers who are not performing basic crew duties will act as scanners to
avoid obstacles during ground taxiing and confined-area operations and to reduce the potential of
a midair collision during arrivals, departures, and simulated instrument flight.
3.17. Forced or Precautionary Landings. The helicopter has a unique ability to land nearly
anywhere, which provides the pilot with a tremendous safety advantage. If the pilot becomes
doubtful of the helicopter’s airworthiness (see paragraph 3.17.1) or encounters hazardous
weather conditions (see paragraph 3.17.2), he or she will execute a precautionary landing,
provided landing conditions are not more hazardous than the in-flight problem. Aircrew safety
takes priority over aircraft security and maintenance accessibility. Report all precautionary
landings through appropriate channels as soon as communications are established.
   3.17.1. Forced or Precautionary Landings Due to In-Flight Malfunction. The aircrew
   will comply with the flight manual and local procedures. In the event a forced or
   precautionary landing occurs at a location where communications are not available, the
   aircrew will remain at the landing site and await assistance. However, if a greater hazard
   exists to the crew or aircraft by landing at a site, the aircrew will continue to the nearest safe
   landing area. Base the decision to resume flight under these circumstances on a thorough
   evaluation of all the hazards and risks involved.

   3.17.2. Precautionary Landings Due to Weather. If weather deteriorates during VFR
   operations, a precautionary landing is a viable option. Course reversal, course deviation, or
   continuation under IFR are also viable options. The aircraft commander may authorize
   further flight after a precautionary landing for weather. He or she will make a reasonable
   effort to notify appropriate agencies of the precautionary landing, and to gain additional
   weather information.
3.18. Flight Following. Flight following with an appropriate controlling agency (local
agencies, flight service station [FSS], air traffic control [ATC]), or aircraft is required for all
flights. Aircrews conducting formation flights must establish flight following with an agency or
aircraft outside of their formation.
3.19. Advisory Calls:
   3.19.1. Mandatory altitude calls for the pilot not flying (PNF) during IFR include:
       3.19.1.1. Nonprecision Approaches. Call ―one hundred feet above minimums,‖
       ―minimums‖ at minimum descent altitude, and ―runway in sight.‖ Do not call ―runway in
       sight‖ too soon if vision is obstructed by fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc. Call ―go-
       around‖ at the missed approach point if the runway environment is not in sight.
       3.19.1.2. Precision Approaches. Call ―one hundred feet above‖ when one hundred feet
       above decision height. Then, if the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a
       position for a normal landing, call ―land‖ at decision height. Otherwise, call ―go-around.‖
       3.19.1.3. Climbout or Descent. Calls will be at 500 and 100 feet below or above
       assigned altitude and 500 and 100 feet below or above initial approach fix altitude or
       holding altitude.
   3.19.2. The PNF will announce heading deviations of 10 degrees, airspeed deviations of 10
   knots, and altitude deviations exceeding 100 feet. Any crewmember who sees a deviation of
   100 feet in altitude or a potential terrain or obstruction problem will immediately tell the
   pilot. Also, announce deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown.
3.20. Maintenance Debriefing. As soon as possible after arrival, the aircraft commander and
other required crewmembers will debrief maintenance on the condition of the aircraft.
3.21. Postflight Debriefing:
   3.21.1. The aircraft commander of each flight will give each crewmember the opportunity to
   discuss unusual aspects of the mission. These debriefings may be formal or informal, as the
   situation requires.
   3.21.2. For training flights, the instructor will review and evaluate the overall training
   performed, advise the student of future training requirements, answer technical questions,
   and complete training reports.
3.22. Fuel Conservation. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a limited
commodity and precious resource and consider fuel optimization throughout all phases of
mission planning and execution. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and
flight routing for fuel efficiency. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel optimization
measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission and training
accomplishment:
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                   15


  3.22.1. Delay engine start time. Establish and implement local engine start time standards.
  3.22.2. Minimize aircraft weight by removing unnecessary equipment for a given mission.
  3.22.3. Establish command and control (C2) and flight following procedures to ensure
  timely notification of mission changes or cancellations.

                                           Chapter 4

                                 TRAINING PROCEDURES

4.1. Instructor Requirements. The student to instructor ratio will not exceed 2 to 1. The
squadron director of operations (DO) has waiver authority. All IPs are safety observers and are
responsible for their students actions. The flight commander or designated representative will
conduct the daily briefing and ensure all instructors are thoroughly briefed on mission execution
and potential hazards.
   4.1.1. Training is designed to develop aircrew proficiency, reaction time, planning, and
   judgment in preparation for actual emergencies. Simulated emergencies must provide
   realistic training without unacceptably increasing risk. Accomplish simulated emergency
   maneuvers according to the flight manual and this chapter. Warning: Instructors must be
   alert and take prompt action to terminate simulated emergency maneuvers. They must
   execute corrective action at the first indication of deteriorating aircraft performance or
   serious student proficiency problems.
   4.1.2. The instructor will emphasize procedures for positive identification of the simulated
   emergency condition before initiating corrective action. System failures must not be
   unreasonably compounded. When initiating EPs, temper the ―surprise‖ approach to allow for
   a possible wrong reaction, which could jeopardize safety. Practice such emergencies with
   sufficient airspeed and altitude to ensure a safe recovery.
   4.1.3. In high-density traffic areas, simulate emergencies that could require indepth analysis,
   discussion, or detailed cockpit duties only when traffic congestion is low.
4.2. Prohibited Maneuvers. Do not intentionally accomplish actual engine shutdown in flight,
blade stall, or power settling (vortex ring state) in the aircraft.
4.3. Training Requirements:
   4.3.1. Accomplish unusual attitude and EP training only under daytime VMC conditions,
   with no passengers. An IP must always be at a set of controls.
   4.3.2. Use local auxiliary fields and airfields for EP and normal procedure maneuvers that
   require a slide landing. If accurate wind information cannot be obtained through tower
   services, a wind detection device, readily discernible to the pilot flying (PF), is required.
   4.3.3. Ensure the IFG depicts the auxiliary field, highlighting all normal and unusual
   conditions, such as size, landing directions, and location of any known obstructions (wind
   socks, tires, etc.).
   4.3.4. Ensure crash and fire rescue are available to conduct EP training.
4.4. Training Maneuver Parameters. Use Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
(AFTTP) 3-3, H-1 for procedures to accomplish training maneuvers. Because the TH-1H hover
power charts use 4-foot skid heights for calculating performance requirements, use a 4-foot,
instead of a 5-foot, skid height when performing required maneuvers.
4.5. General EP Training:
   4.5.1. Conduct EP training:
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                17


       4.5.1.1. During VMC
       4.5.1.2. After official sunrise but before official sunset
       4.5.1.3. During training, currency, or evaluation flights.
       4.5.1.4. When no passengers are on board
       4.5.1.5. With an IP or EP at a set of controls.
   4.5.2. EP training requires aligning the aircraft landing direction within 45 degrees of the
   wind direction when winds exceed 15 knots (including peak gusts). At or below 15 knots
   (including peak gusts), align the aircraft landing direction to within 90 degrees of the wind
   direction. For hovering autorotations, the wind is aligned within 15 degrees of landing
   heading. Wind reporting capability must be available at the location where EPs are
   conducted.
4.6. Unusual Attitude Training. Entry must be at or above 1,000 feet AGL. Simulated unusual
attitudes will not exceed 30 degrees of bank; a 20-degree, nose-high attitude; or a 10-degree,
nose-low attitude.
4.7. Practice Autorotation Considerations:
   4.7.1. The initial autorotation for training, currency, or evaluations is a straight-ahead
   autorotation accomplished by the IP or IP candidate to evaluate aircraft performance.
   Warning: IPs must terminate the maneuver and initiate a power recovery at the first
   indication of abnormally high or low rotor revolutions per minute (rpm), excessive sink rate,
   low airspeed, or ineffective flare.
   4.7.2. Straight-ahead or 180-degree autorotations may be accomplished to a power recovery
   or touchdown. The pilot must brief which termination is intended on downwind.
   4.7.3. When practicing turning autorotations in excess of 180 degrees, terminate with power
   recovery at or above 250 feet AGL.
   4.7.4. When practicing hovering autorotations or initiating a simulated engine failure (SEF)
   from a hover, begin at an altitude of 5/4 feet AGL.

                     UNPREPARED LANDING SITE PROCEDURES

5.1. Crew Coordination:
   5.1.1. Obstacle Clearance. Crewmembers will announce the clock position, relative to the
   nose of the aircraft, and the estimated distance of any obstacle whenever horizontal rotor
   clearance is 25 feet or less. Example: ―tree, nine o’clock, 20 feet.‖
   5.1.2. Voice Procedures. On final approach, the PNF makes advisory altitude calls in 100-
   foot increments when above 300 feet AGL, and 50-foot increments when below 300 feet
   AGL. The advisory will include altitude, airspeed, and, at the PF’s discretion, descent and
   power applied, in that order. Example: ―250 feet, 40 knots, sink 500, torque 30 percent.‖
   After each advisory call, the scanner provides terrain or hazard clearance inputs.
5.2. Low Reconnaissance. During the low reconnaissance, the pilot confirms the touchdown
point.
5.3. Power-Available Check. The PF will:
   5.3.1. Perform a power-available check prior to the low reconnaissance. Perform this check
   en route to or at the site.
   5.3.2. Perform the power-available check as near as possible to the same PA and outside air
   temperature as the site. For training, slowly apply collective pitch without drooping rotor
   speed (Nr) below 319 rpm/97 percent until reaching out of ground effect (OGE) + 3 psi/OGE
   + 5 percent or a limit defined by the flight manual. An actual power check may also be
   accomplished. In this case, slowly apply collective pitch without drooping Nr below 97
   percent until computed power or a limit (as defined by the flight manual) is reached. It is left
   to the discretion of the crew whether to pull beyond computed power available in order to
   determine actual engine power capabilities. As a minimum, the engines(s) must produce
   computed power available. If the engine fails to produce the computed power available,
   terminate the flight.
   5.3.3. Compare maximum power available with power required for the intended hover
   heights. This comparison determines the power margin for the operation. When the power
   margin is 5 psi/10 percent or less, a second aircrew member recomputes TOLD to confirm
   power requirements.
5.4. Power Requirements. Operational power requirements are according to the flight manual.
Additionally, when landing in areas with a restricted escape route (either operationally or in
training), minimum power is OGE + 3 psi/OGE + 5 percent.
5.5. Site Selection for Training. Refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone
Operations, for helicopter landing zone dimension and survey requirements.
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                  19

                                   NIGHT OPERATIONS

Section 6A—Night Operations (Unaided)

6.1. Altitude Restrictions. Minimum en route altitude for unaided night navigation is 500 feet
above the highest obstacle within 5 nm of the route of flight unless published helicopter routes
dictate a lower altitude.
6.2. Illumination Requirements for Helicopter Landing Areas. Operations into unprepared
sites between official sunset and official sunrise are allowed only if the area is outlined by
discernible lights.
6.3. Crew Coordination. Mandatory PNF calls are:
   6.3.1. During night VFR descents, 1,000 feet above intended altitude, 500 feet above
   intended altitude, 100 feet above intended altitude, and intended altitude.
   6.3.2. On final approach, advisory calls every 100 feet when above 300 feet AGL and every
   50 feet when below 300 feet AGL. The advisory includes altitude and airspeed and, at the
   PF’s discretion, descent rate and power applied, in that order. Example: "250 feet, 40 knots,
   sink 500, torque 15."
   6.3.3. On final approach when rates of descent are greater than 500 feet per minute (fpm).
   ―Go-around‖ if rate of descent exceeds 800 fpm.
6.4. Night Approaches to Unprepared Sites:
   6.4.1. Do not leave flight altitude until the landing zone (LZ) location is positively
   identified. If adequate lighting is available, brief and conduct a site evaluation prior to the
   approach, much the same as under daylight conditions. Do not, under any circumstances,
   conduct an unaided low reconnaissance or descend below 300 feet AGL until established on
   the approach.
   6.4.2. Factors that determine how to conduct the evaluation include knowledge of the area in
   general, known hazards, and terrain features from briefings or charts.. Determine wind
   direction before making the first approach. Forecast winds may be used when wind direction
   cannot be determined otherwise. When using forecast winds, ensure an adequate power
   margin is available in the event winds differ from forecast.
   6.4.3. Use the type of approach best suited to the situation. Adjust the pattern altitude
   accordingly but no lower than 300 feet AGL on downwind. Throughout the approach, use the
   altimeter to maintain awareness of aircraft height above the ground.
   6.4.4. Establish a final approach to commence at no lower than 300 feet AGL. Cross-
   reference instruments throughout the approach to reach approximately 200 feet AGL with an
   approximate groundspeed of 30 knots. During the last 100 feet of the approach, limit the rate
   of descent to 300 fpm. Approaches at night will generally be flown with slightly slower rates
   of descent and closure rates than during daylight operations. As closure rates decrease, the
   time the aircraft remains in the AVOID area of the height velocity envelope increases.
 20                                                       AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010


   6.4.5. The decision to make an approach to a hover or a touchdown is based on power
   available and landing site condition.
6.5. Site Selection for Training:
   6.5.1. Night training should include operations to unprepared sites.
   6.5.2. The minimum LZ size is 3 rotor diameters. Select sites where the vertical
   development of the surrounding terrain does not restrict a go-around with minimum
   maneuvering from any point during the approach.
   6.5.3. The obstacles or terrain within 3 nm of the site will not exceed 200 feet above the site
   elevation. To satisfy this requirement, restrict the approach and departure route to directions
   that avoid terrain or obstacles exceeding the above criteria.
   6.5.4. Units will list eligible night landing sites and include applicable restricted approach
   and departure routes in the IFG.
   6.5.5. For sites without permanent lighting, make a visual survey of the site prior to full
   darkness, and position the lights to outline the landing area. Check for obstacles, general site
   condition, and wind. This survey may be accomplished by other crews flying during the day
   or by the ground party. After dark, NVG-equipped crews may accomplish a survey.
6.6. LZ Lighting:
   6.6.1. Use some type of LZ lighting to help the pilot locate and identify the LZ for a night
   landing. Lighting aids that have been used successfully include terminal guidance systems,
   expeditionary lights, flare illumination, and makeshift light sources (vehicle lights,
   flashlights, strobe lights, bonfires, smudge pots, etc.). Surface vehicle headlights are an
   excellent lighting source provided they do not blind the pilot during the approach.
   6.6.2. When practical, employ a standard LZ lighting pattern. LZ lighting should be visible
   to the pilot, identify an area free of obstacles and safe for hovering and landing, employ three
   or more lights at least 15 feet apart to prevent autokinetic illusions, and provide orientation
   along an obstacle-free corridor for landings and takeoffs.
   6.6.3. Because a variety of LZ lighting patterns are in use, the pilot should anticipate
   diversity in lighting patterns when participating in joint or combined operations.
   6.6.4. The inverted Y light system is an excellent way to identify LZs. Lights for the
   inverted Y will normally be spaced in compliance with Figure 6.1. When set up in this
   fashion, the inverted Y provides visual cues to enable the pilot to determine the correctness
   of the glide angle by observing the apparent distance between the lights in the stem of the Y.
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                      21


Figure 6.1. Inverted-Y Light System.




   6.6.5. If the lights in the stem appear merged into a single light, a shallow glide angle is
   indicated. If the distance between lights in the stem appears to increase, the approach is
   becoming steeper.
   6.6.6. Approach path lineup corrections can also be made using the stem of the Y. For
   example, if the stem points to the left, the helicopter is left of course and should correct to the
   right. In addition, the following guidance applies:
      6.6.6.1. The direction of the approach is into the open end of the Y.
      6.6.6.2. The touchdown area is outlined by the triangle formed by the three lights
      marking the open end of the Y.
      6.6.6.3. When set up properly, wind direction will be along the stem of the Y.

6.8. Altitude Restrictions. The minimum en route altitude is 100 feet AHO in surveyed low-
level areas.
6.9. Exterior Aircraft Lighting:
   6.9.1. Set position lights to steady bright during flight.
       6.9.1.1. The anticollision light may be extinguished and the position lights set to dim
       during terminal area operations if the lights create a hazard to the aircrew.
       6.9.1.2. For formations, the lead aircraft sets position lights to steady dim in flight;
       succeeding aircraft also carry steady dim, except the last aircraft which carries steady
       bright and the anticollision light.
   6.9.2. An operable searchlight or landing light equipped with an infrared filter is required
   for NVG training flights below 20 percent equivalent moon illumination (EMI) and highly
   recommended for all NVG flights.
6.10. Terminal Area Operations:
   6.10.1. Do not leave the en route altitude until reaching the terminal operations area. Brief
   and conduct an unprepared site evaluation prior to the approach according to daytime
   unprepared site procedures in Chapter 5. Exception: An unprepared site evaluation is not
   required for tactical approaches at sites discussed in mission planning and briefing prior to
   flight.
   6.10.2. Approaches at night are generally flown with slower rates of closure and descent
   than approaches during the day. As closure rates decrease, the time the aircraft remains in the
   unsafe area of the height velocity envelope increases. Coordinate advisory calls and visual
   cues throughout the approach to reach approximately 200 feet AGL with an approximate
   groundspeed of 30 knots. During the last 100 feet of the approach, limit the descent rate to
   approximately 300 fpm. During the final approach, consider using the infrared searchlight to
   enhance visual cues.
6.11. Crew Coordination:
   6.11.1. Cruise flight on NVGs is similar to unaided cruise flight. The PF is primarily
   responsible for aircraft control; the PNF navigates; and the scanner provides terrain and
   obstacle clearance inputs. The PNF will monitor the gauges and keep the crew informed of
   the aircraft’s position, significant obstacles, and mission progress.
   6.11.2. Crew coordination during terminal operations is critical. The entire crew will help
   each other maintain orientation to the landing site while in the pattern. Dropping chem-sticks
   during high and low reconnaissance may help establish a reference point for identifying the
   intended landing spot.
   6.11.3. PNF mandatory calls are:
       6.11.3.1. During night VFR descents, 1,000 feet above intended altitude, 500 feet above
       intended altitude, 100 feet above intended altitude, and intended altitude.
       6.11.3.2. On final approach, advisory calls every 100 feet when above 300 feet AGL and
       every 50 feet when below 300 feet AGL. The advisory includes altitude and airspeed and,
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                  23


     at the PF’s discretion, descent rate and power applied, in that order. Example: ―250 feet,
     40 knots, sink 500, torque 30 percent‖.
     6.11.3.3. On final approach, when rates of descent are greater than 500 fpm. ―Go-
     around‖ if rate of descent exceeds 800 fpm.
  6.11.4. Reduced peripheral vision degrades the ability to perceive motion, especially while
  in a hover. Closure rate, descent rate, hover drift, and altitude must be consciously and
  deliberately perceived because peripheral and instinctive analysis are insufficient. Frequent,
  deliberate head-turning to examine groundspeed and hover-drift is required. Scanners are
  particularly valuable in helping the PF with early detection of excessive closure rates, descent
  rates, and any unintended drift. The scanner’s primary duties are obstacle clearance, hover
  altitude reference, and drift detection.

                                FORMATION PROCEDURES

7.1. General. The minimum separation between the closest portions of any two helicopters in
any formation is 1 rotor disk (RD) diameter, but the tactical situation will usually dictate more
separation. Vertical step-up is optional for each succeeding helicopter.
7.2. Dissimilar Formation. Formation flights with dissimilar aircraft are authorized when all
participating crewmembers are briefed and thoroughly familiar with the other aircraft’s
performance and tactics. RD separation is based on the largest RD diameter.
7.3. Minimum Formation Separation:
   7.3.1. Fluid Trail. Minimum lateral separation is 1 RD.
   7.3.2. Fixed Trail. Limit maneuvers to those necessary for landing alignment in the LZ.
   Minimum separation is 1 RD.
   7.3.3. Staggered Formation. Minimum separation is 1 RD.
   7.3.4. Combat Cruise Formation. Minimum separation is 500 feet between all aircraft.
   Since reduced separation is typically required for landing, lead may direct a change to
   another formation (fluid trail, fixed trail, or staggered) at any designated point en route
   (typically the initial point). Aircraft separation distances should be driven by METT-TC
   (mission, enemy, terrain and weather; troops and support available – time available; civil
   considerations). See AFTTP 303.H-1 for detailed consideration of these variables.
7.4. Formation Taxi. The flight normally taxis in order with a minimum of 100 feet of spacing
from the main rotor to the tail rotor.
7.5. Turning Rejoins. Perform turning rejoins for training purposes during the day only.
7.6. Formation Procedures after Breakup. After initiating breakup procedures, all aircraft in
the formation turn transponder to normal, anticollision light on (position lights to steady bright
for nighttime operations).

                                           Chapter 8

                                LOW-LEVEL OPERATIONS

8.1. General. Flight below 300 feet AGL is considered low-level flying. Low-level flight
entails greater risk than normal flight, so it requires additional restrictions.
8.2. Low-Level Flight Areas. Low-level flight must be conducted in surveyed low-level flight
areas. The area or route will have defined boundaries and meet these requirements:
   8.2.1. Complete an extensive map study of the selected routes and areas.
   8.2.2. Annotate on the flight map all manmade obstacles higher than the lowest altitude to be
   flown.
8.3. Maps:
   8.3.1. Maintain a master map depicting the low-level flight areas or routes for flight planning
   purposes. Annotate all manmade obstacles over 50 feet AGL, except when below the tree
   line. Also, annotate published low-level routes, nap of the earth (NOE) boxes, no-fly areas,
   and other hazards within the boundaries.
   8.3.2. Update the master map monthly, using CHUM data and map updates. Annotate the
   CHUM update date on the master map. Continuously scan for uncharted obstacles. When
   they are found, temporarily suspend flight operations and record appropriate information
   (location and approximate height AGL). After landing, immediately pass this information to
   the unit safety officer.
   8.3.3. Maps used for flying will reflect the same information as the master map.
   Crewmembers will ensure the map is updated and annotated, using the latest CHUM.
   Aircraft commanders will provide a copy of the planned low-level flight route to current
   operations.
8.4. Route Selection (Training):
   8.4.1. Use the syllabus and student guide to plan low-level navigation training routes.
   8.4.2. Attempt to select an initial point that can be over flown on the inbound heading,
   minimizing turns from the last leg flown (recommend 30 degrees or less).
   8.4.3. Review and deconflict low altitude charts for IFR, VFR, and slow-speed, low-altitude
   training routes, and annotate potential conflict areas along the proposed routes during pre-
   mission planning. Note: Avoid following roads or wires to an LZ.
8.5. AF IMT 70. Prepare an AF IMT 70, or a more detailed navigation log, for each mission.
Include the following, at a minimum: turning points, headings, distances, estimated time en route
(ETE), MSAs, and fuel computations.
8.6. Power Check. Prior to any low-level operations, perform a power available check. At
minimum, OGE power must be available for all low-level training operations.
8.7. Crew Coordination. Crew coordination is a critical factor during low-level operations.
Limit crew conversation to accomplishment of essential tasks. Each crewmember calls out
hazardous obstacles and assists navigation by identifying prominent features along the route.
 26                                                    AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010


Warning: Three to four seconds are needed from the time a stimulus (perceived closure rate,
crewmember input, etc.) is received and recognized until the reaction (control input,
crewmember action, etc.) is complete. All crewmembers must be cognizant of this relationship,
especially during critical phases of flight.
8.8. Evasive Maneuver Training. Minimum altitude for en route evasive maneuvering is 100
feet AHO.
AFI11-2UH-TH-1HV3 2 JULY 2010                                                                 27

                     SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) PROCEDURES

9.1. SAR Requests:
   9.1.1. All SAR requests and information should flow through a single point of contact, such
   as the squadron duty controller or operations supervisor. Their primary role is to collect all
   pertinent facts necessary to initiate the mission planning. They will also seek flight
   authorization from the commander or the commander's representative, and advise the Joint
   Rescue Coordination Center of the unit’s ability to support the search.
   9.1.2. All SAR missions are potentially increased risk. Unit and wing leadership must
   consider mission requirements and weigh the risk potential before accepting a SAR mission.
9.2. On scene Procedures. Perform a power available check prior to search operations.
Perform the power available check either enroute or at the search location. Perform the power
check as near as possible to the same PA and outside air temperature as the recovery site.
Compare maximum power available with power required for the intended hover heights. Note:
This comparison determines the power margin for the operation. When power margin is 5 psi/10
Percent or less, a second aircrew member will confirm power requirements. Do not assume
power available in flight is equal to power available at the site.
9.3. Training Search Restrictions. Day search training may be accomplished at a minimum
altitude of 100 feet AHO. NVG search training may be accomplished at a minimum altitude of
300 feet AGL. Minimum airspeed is 50 knots.
9.4. Forms Adopted (or IMTs): DD Form 175, Flight Plan, Military
DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing

Terms
Abort—To terminate a specific maneuver, or turn back from or cut short a mission before
successful completion for reasons other than enemy action. This may occur after an aircraft is
airborne or on the ground before takeoff.
Blind—No visual contact with friendly aircraft (wingman). The opposite of ―visual.‖
Caution—An operating procedure, technique, or information that may result in damage to
equipment if not carefully followed.
Contact—Term used to acknowledge sighting of a specific reference point.
Divert—An operational term for the in-flight change to a mission’s intended point of landing or
mission location.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)—A verbal evaluation used to evaluate emergency
procedures and systems knowledge.
Effective Translational Lift (ETL)—The point where the main and tail rotor systems fly into
undisturbed air and become more efficient, approximately 20 knots for the H-1.
Inadvertent IMC—The unplanned entry into IMC during VMC flight. Requires immediate
change from VFR to IFR flight.
Initial Point—A point near LZ when final course alterations are made to arrive at the specified
objective.
Knock It Off—A call by anyone in the crew or formation to discontinue maneuvering. Usually
called when an unsafe situation is developing.
Objective Point—A drop zone, LZ, or extraction zone or point at which a low-level route
terminates.
Popeye—Flying in clouds or areas of reduced visibility.
Rejoin—The procedure for two or more aircraft in a formation to close the separation distance
after a breakout.
Rotor Disk (RD)—A measure of separation within a helicopter formation based on the largest
rotor size of any aircraft within the formation.
