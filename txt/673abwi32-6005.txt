SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It’s revised to
clarify approval authorities, termination of entitlements and procedures for extensions.
1. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). TLA is an allowance designed to partially
reimburse members and family members the added living costs at an Outside the Continental
United States (OCONUS) duty station when occupying temporary lodging incident to permanent
change of station (PCS).
2. Service Member’s Responsibility. It’s the member’s responsibility to contact and provide
all associated information regarding both inbound and outbound TLA requests to the Capital
Asset Management Element JBER-Elmendorf store front office (673 CES/CEAC), 6346 Arctic
Warrior Drive, JBER, AK 99506, DSN 317-552-4439, Monday – Friday, 0800 – 1630, or JBER-
Richardson store front office, 724 Postal Service Loop, #4500, Building 600, JBER, AK 99505-
4500, DSN 317-384-3907, Monday – Friday, 0800-1630.
3. Transient Quarters:
     3.1. On-installation transient quarters will be used to the fullest extent possible. If on-
     installation transient quarters are not available, the service member/dependent will be
     authorized to reside off installation by receipt of a nonavailability letter (NAL) provided
     from the North Star Inn ®, JBER-Elmendorf 7153 Fighter Drive, JBER, AK 99506, DSN
     317-552-2454, or by JBER-Richardson, Building 600 (Welcome Center), Suite 101,
     Richardson Drive, JBER, AK 99505, DSN 317-384-5660. To ensure authorized entitlements
     are not exceeded, the number should confirm maximum lodging allowances with the Air
     Force Accounting and Finance Office, 673 CPTS/FMF, DSN 317-552-9104, or Army
     Defense Military Pay Office, DMPO, DSN 317-384-0047, prior to making off-base
     temporary lodging arrangements.
     3.2. The member/dependents may elect to stay at North Star Inn ® at either the JBER-
     Elmendorf or JBER-Richardson locations. Pets are authorized in both locations and the
     North Star Inn ® offers a list of off-installations kennels as an optional consideration for the
     member’s convenience. Pet fees are not reimbursable cost expenditures when filing TLA
     claims.
     3.3. If a member/dependent elects to reside in a hotel/motel, or other transient off-
     installation lodging without a NAL, reimbursement will be based at rates of the referring
     lodging office and not the maximum lodging allowance.
673ABWI32-6005 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  3


   3.4. The member/dependent may also elect to stay with friends or family in the local vicinity
   while seeking adequate housing. Reimbursement of TLA claims will be based on zero
   dollars for lodging; however, the applicable rate for meals will be authorized.
   3.5. While seeking adequate permanent housing, the member/dependent must obtain
   transient lodging within the local vicinity and normal commuting distance, which will be
   defined as not further than Palmer on Alaska Highway 1 north, not further than Wasilla on
   Alaska Highway 3, and not further than Whittier on Highway 1 south to qualify for
   reimbursement for TLA lodging as authorized.
4. PCS Incoming Personnel:
   4.1. Accompanied personnel are authorized TLA entitlements effective upon arrival
   (reporting/signing-in) to JBER. The member/dependent may receive TLA for any day a
   member is on leave or permissive travel in the permanent duty station (PDS) vicinity, after
   reporting for duty, while seeking private sector housing or awaiting Government quarters
   assignment. TLA is not payable for any day a member is on leave or permissive travel away
   from the PDS vicinity, unless one or more dependents remains in the PDS vicinity to
   continue to seek private sector housing or while awaiting Government quarters assignment.
   If the member or dependents elect to obtain lodging outside the local vicinity at any time
   during the entitlement period, TLA will not be authorized.
   4.2. Unaccompanied E-4 (SrA) Air Force personnel with 3 years of service (YOS), or of a
   higher rank are authorized TLA entitlements, unless the commander requires them to reside
   on the installation for reasons of military necessity, readiness, or discipline. Inbound
   unaccompanied Air Force Priority 2 E-4s within 60 days of reaching 3 YOS are authorized
   TLA, providing that they are also receiving basic allowance for housing (BAH). All other
   unaccompanied Air Force personnel must reside in unaccompanied housing upon arrival to
   JBER, unless otherwise directed by the dormitory superintendent and First Sergeant Barracks
   Program (FSBP) managers. Unaccompanied Army personnel E-5 (SGT) and below will be
   assigned unaccompanied housing upon arrival. Army E-6 (SSGT) and higher are qualified to
   receive BAH and are authorized TLA entitlements.
   4.3. TLA may be authorized for a maximum of 60 nights while seeking adequate permanent
   housing upon initial arrival (reporting/signing-in) to JBER. TLA stops when renting upon
   member’s receipt of keys, lease begins, or access to the house/apartment. TLA stops when
   purchasing a home on the recording date after the closing date. Delay in purchase of a home
   beyond the initial 60 nights of entitlement does not constitute an authorization for an
   extension. If authorized members elect to purchase a home, the member must make interim
   arrangements for housing if they are unable to occupy the home they are purchasing prior to
   the end of the 60-night period. In all cases, TLA stops after 60 nights unless conditions of
   paragraph 7, this instruction, apply.
5. PCS Outbound Personnel:
   5.1. Unaccompanied members residing in the dormitories will not be authorized TLA
   entitlement, if deemed necessary.
   5.2. Accompanied members and unaccompanied members residing outside dormitories and
   barracks with BAH authorization are entitled TLA for the 5 nights immediately preceding
   their date of PCS departure from JBER. The reduction in authorized TLA is in support of
 4                                                        673ABWI32-6005 22 MARCH 2012


     our loaner furnishings program that allows personnel to secure housing earlier upon their
     arrival and stay in their housing longer upon their departure, thus saving TLA funds. Loaner
     furnishings are made available through the Furnishings Management Office, 6346 Arctic
     Warrior Drive, JBER, AK 99506, DSN 317-552-2740, Monday – Friday, 0800-1630, or
     Furnishing Management Office, Building 600, 724 Postal Service Loop, #4500, JBER, AK
     99505-4500, (907) 384-3907. Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), paragraph U9150.B2
     requires the senior commander of OCONUS areas where more than one service is
     represented to issue written guidance for all services in the area. In Alaska, the senior
     commander is the ALCOM/11 AF Commander who delegated authority to installation
     commanders to judiciously administer TLA in accordance with JFTR. As such, the 673
     ABW Installation Commander establishes the number of TLA days authorized at JBER
     through this publication.
6. Procedures for Submitting TLA Claims:
     6.1. Submissions for inbound members/dependents are accompanied in 15 night increments
     until adequate housing has been obtained. The maximum entitlement period is 60 nights.
     6.2. Submissions for outbound members/dependents may be accompanied within 72 hours,
     prior to departure from the base.
     6.3. The following items must be completed and provided with each submission for TLA
     entitlement:
        6.3.1. AF Form 1357, Request for Temporary Lodging Allowance, available at 673
        CES/CEAC, Capital Asset Management Element Store Front Office, or the on site store
        front office at Building 600.
        6.3.2. NAL from the North Star Inn ® or Fort Richardson lodging, if applicable.
        6.3.3. Two copies of the member’s PCS orders.
        6.3.4. One copy of paid lodging/hotel receipts with the name of the lodging/hotel, daily
        rate, member’s name, and inclusive dates for the period claimed.
        6.3.5. Community Housing Checklist for inbound personnel only (see Attachment 2).
        The member must comply with the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) by
        aggressively seeking adequate permanent housing. Completion of the Community
        Housing Checklist at each submission for TLA establishes compliance. If the member
        fails to aggressively seek permanent housing, or fails to submit acceptable reasons for
        noncompliance, they will be denied payment of or further entitlement to TLA.
7. Extensions. Extensions are granted on a case-by-case basis and submitted through the
Capital Asset Management Element JBER-Elmendorf storefront office (673 CES/CEAC), 6346
Arctic Warrior Drive, JBER AK 99506, DSN 317-552-4439, Monday – Friday, 0800-1630, or
JBER-Richardson store front office, 724 Postal Service Loop, #4500, Building 600, JBER, AK
99505-4500, DSN 317- 384-3907, Monday – Friday, 0800-1630. Your request will be
forwarded to the 673d Civil Engineer Squadron Deputy Commander (673 CES/CD) for
approval/disapproval. Extensions are approved for reasons, through no fault of the member,
which require occupancy of transient quarters for more than the initial occupancy. Extensions
must be approved prior to filing for TLA reimbursement. Nonreceipt of household goods does
not constitute authorization for TLA extensions. Extensions for outbound members exceeding
673ABWI32-6005 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  5


the five nights allowed by this publication will be in accordance with JFTR Section 4, U9710.
Extensions for TLA entitlement beyond the initial 60 nights for inbound members may be
approved on a case-by-case basis in increments of 15 nights or fewer as follows:
   7.1. Acts of God, fire, earthquake, riot, civil unrest or other disturbances which make
   normally available or anticipated housing temporarily or permanently uninhabitable or
   available.
   7.2. Withdrawal of private sector housing from the market by the landlord.
   7.3. Member is unable to secure housing considered by 673 CES/CEAC to be suitable for
   the member’s needs.
   7.4. When the member or dependents is hospitalized, or the member’s duties require the
   member to be away from the permanent duty station, resulting in curtailment of opportunities
   to arrange for private sector housing.
   7.5. Delay in availability of/assignment to on-base housing due to Service requirement.
