writing. The unit will receive formal notification not later than (NLT) 60 days before the visit,
although informal coordination will occur prior to this date. For ANG visits, notifications will
also be sent to the State Adjutant General and NGB/XO. The intent of this message /
memorandum is to confirm the dates of the visit and inform the unit of the scope of the
evaluation and support requirements.

A1.13.1.1. At a minimum, the message / memorandum will include the following:

A1.13.1.1.1. Approximate number of team members.

A1.13.1.1.2. Planned visit dates.

A1.13.1.1.3. Program(s) to be inspected.

A1.13.1.1.4. Support required (clearances, workspaces, accounts, etc.).

A1.13.1.2. Thirty days prior to the visit, a follow-up message will include name, rank, security
clearance, social security number, and evaluation area of each team member. Note that self-
assessment team members must possess adequate security clearance to conduct their visit.

A1.13.2. Team Chief Responsibilities.

A1.13.2.1. The team chief, or a designated representative, will formally in-brief and out-brief
the unit commander and staff.

A1.13.2.2. The team chief, or a designated representative, will plan the number and types of
evaluations to be conducted and may select which individuals will be evaluated. If the team
chief does not designate specific individuals, the selection is up to the unit.

A1.13.2.3. Prior to departure, the team chief, or a designated representative, will provide the
commander and DO an outbrief and copies of the draft report.

A1.13.3. Reports.

A1.13.3.1. Findings. All findings identified in the report must reference a specific publication /
directive or applicable training reference.

A1.13.3.2. Forward the formal report to the unit within 10 working days after completion of the
visit.

A1.13.3.3. Overall Unit Operations Training Health. The team chief will decide overall unit
operations training health using the “discrepancy, finding, inadequacy or observation” concept.

A1.13.3.3.1 Any unit whose health is deemed as having a significant discrepancy (i.e., negative
mission impact) must provide a get-well plan for all identified issues within 10 duty days after
receipt of the report. They must then follow-up on each item every 30 days until all items are
closed. The 26 OSS team chief will coordinate with the unit and approve closure of identified
items.

A1.13.4. Supplemental/Follow-Up Visits.

A1.13.4.1. If/when all areas of a visit cannot be completed, make a supplemental visit. Conduct
it as soon as practical after the incomplete visit.

A1.13.4.2. Make a follow-up visit if any unit receives a significant discrepancy. Follow-up
visits should normally be scheduled not earlier than 90 calendar days or later than 180 calendar
days following the original visit.

A1.13.4.3. Send a 30-day notification letter prior to visits.

A1.13.4.4. Add supplemental and follow-up formal reports to the initial reports following the
same format as the original. On follow-up visits, the team may elect to re-inspect only those
areas that had findings.

A1.13.4.5. Regarding supplemental visits, all areas rated during the initial visit will be annotated
“Previously Rated.”

A1.13.4.6. In the event the unit receives a second write-up during a follow-up visit, the team
chief will immediately notify all applicable chains of command and recommend courses of
action to alleviate the root cause.

A1.13.5. Informal Visits. 26 OSS/OST personnel will periodically visit units. The purpose of
these visits is to maintain currency, provide education, feedback, cross-feed trends, and exchange
information. These informal visits will not result in a formal visit report. 26 OSS/OST
personnel may, at the request of the commander, provide an informal report that will not be
forwarded to HHQ.

A1.14. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) Training.

A1.14.1. In accordance with AFSPCI 10-260 Tactics Development Program, if unit
instructor/evaluator training is required for a TTP, the operational unit will have 120 calendar
days from time of TTP document approval to train unit instructors/evaluators with support from
the TTP development/validation organization. Once unit instructor/evaluator training on a new
TTP is complete (or if no training is required), units will have 90 calendar days to develop the
capability to train and evaluate the TTP. Local leadership will determine if/when the TTP will
be trained and evaluated based on current unit mission statement. Unit DOT sections will work
with the Weapons and Tactics (DOK) and Stan/Eval sections to ensure TTP training is
accomplished, documented, and reviewed at the quarterly Tactics, Intel, Training and Evaluation
(TITE) meetings.

A1.14.2. Dissemination. The 26 OSS/OSK will disseminate all newly published cyber tactics
quarterly to unit DOK sections. As soon as practicable upon receipt, DOK, DOT, and Stan/Eval
should meet to discuss the applicability of these tactics to their respective units. Unit
commanders will decide if a specific tactic applies to their weapon system employment.
A1.14.3. Training. When a unit commander implements a TTP, the DOT section will notify 26
OSS/OST of date of implementation/approval and work with DOK to train and evaluate
operators. Units will have 90 calendar days to develop and accomplish all necessary training.

A1.14.4. Reporting. Each DOT section must determine if a change to their MTTL and/or MQT
is required. Route all new/updated MTTLs to 26 OSS/OST for approval. DOT must report
compliance to 26 OSS/OST in accordance with Attachment 12.

training status, and CT status. Members who hold more than one certification will be placed
under the highest cert that they hold with an asterisk next to their name. Use the remarks section
to list the other certifications each member holds. Totals and colors are automatically calculated.

A12.2.2. If unit cybercrew positions need updating, or if there are notable major changes to the
metrics in the unit, please inform 26 OSS/OST.

A12.3. Instructor Training Metrics. The 26 OSS/OST will collect and report instructor training
metrics on a quarterly basis to leadership. The Chief of Operations Training will update unit
metrics no later than COB on the first workday of each month. The spreadsheet is organized by
squadron.

A12.3.1. Ensure the number of required instructors for your unit is updated.

A12.3.2. For each instructor, ensure the date of the last instructor evaluation is current. The
colors and totals will update automatically. If an instructor is due for an annual evaluation
within 60 days, the total in the final column will turn yellow.

A12.3.3. Ensure the listing of instructors is accurate, and update as necessary.

A12.4. TTP Training Compliance Metrics.

A12.4.1. The 26 OSS/OST will collect and report TTP training compliance metrics on a
quarterly basis to leadership. The Chief of Operations Training will update unit metrics no later
90 days after the unit adopts the TTP. The Tactics Compliance metrics spreadsheet is located on
the 26 OSS/OST SIPRNet SharePoint website.

A12.4.2. Each new source of TTPs will be entered in the first column by OST. Each unit will
update their column for each TTP, upon implementation of the TTP, the date all required
cybercrew members were trained, and the date that all cybercrews were successfully evaluated.
If a TTP does not apply to a squadron or does not require training per unit/CC or DO direction,
that squadron will enter “NA” for that TTP.

Block 4: Same format as Block 3

Block 5: Select the type of training accomplished. Note: Use individual training (IT) when an
individual is placed in restricted status as a result of evaluation deficiencies / recommendation or
non-completion or failure of CT. The unit commander or designated representative may direct
individual training for substandard mission performance or other situations (e.g., upon return
from extended temporary duty (TDY), or to correct deficiencies identified during an evaluation).
Tailor individual training to meet the needs of the individual.

Blocks 6 & 7: Select the appropriate system and rating.
Block 8: List the title of the script or lesson, along with any version number and/or version date.
If a test score is applicable, record it here as well. However, if multiple test scores are required,
add them in Block 11 with a note in the “Test Score” block: See Block 11.

Block 9: List all task numbers from the Master Training Task List (MTTL) covered in the
scenario. However, if multiple tasks are trained, indicate “See Block 11” in this block and
annotate each task in Block 11.

Block 10: If applicable, rate each area trained during the event.

      1 = Unsatisfactory – Incapable of performing the task, needs significant improvement
      2 = Marginal – Showed a lack of proficiency/knowledge, needs improvement
      3 = Satisfactory – No significant problems noted, can improve
      4 = Excellent – Exceeds task requirements, needs little improvement
      5 = Outstanding – Far exceeds all task requirements, needs no improvement

Block 11: Provide an overview of any strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations observed
during the training event. The intent of this block is to provide a higher-level overview. If any
of the proficiency ratings are noteworthy, explain them here. Document specific observations in
Block 17. If recommended corrective actions are beyond normal training progression, check the
appropriate box. Clearly explain each recommendation in Block 11.

Blocks 12 & 13: Both the student and the instructor must sign NLT 5 duty days after the training
event. Signatures indicate the training was accomplished and sufficiently debriefed. Signatures
do not constitute agreement with the comments.

Block 14: The certifying official (Commander of Operations Officer) will order corrective
actions based on recommendations from the instructor. Select the appropriate box to describe
briefly the corrective action(s).

Block 15-16: The certifying official will sign and date the form when corrective actions are
required. Certifying official signature is required NLT 5 duty days after the training event.

Block 17: Record all training deficiencies noted during the conduct of the training event.
Describe them in sufficient detail so that they may be reconstructed during the event debrief.
List the associated task and/or checklist, if applicable. If desired, use the deficiency codes at the
bottom of the page to help. Use a continuation sheet if necessary.

A13.2. After all corrective actions are noted or an “N/A” is entered, the following line needs to
be added:
        “------------------------------NOTHING FOLLOWS----------------------------------“
