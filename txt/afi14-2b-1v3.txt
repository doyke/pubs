                         EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of external intelligence training (EIT): Aircrew
Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be
coordinated with the wing/group tactics flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force
protection (FP) organizations (e.g. Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special
Investigations (AFOSI), etc.) as defined in AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection.
(T-2)
3.2. SIO responsibilities. The SIO will:
   3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems, projected
   wartime/Air Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
   3.2.2. Appoint in writing an EIT program manager to oversee program execution. (T-3)
   3.2.3. Assign only qualified trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT events. Specialized
   training requirements and evaluation criteria for EIT trainers are identified in AFI 14-2B-1,
   Volumes 1 and 2. (T-3)
   3.2.4. Develop written guidance outlining procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
   evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. List specific training objectives for each major
   area of intelligence training and the training method and resources used to satisfy each
   objective. (T-3)
   3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
   guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
   training, as well as, any agency for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly
   scheduled basis. (T-3)
   3.2.6. Determine if other unit personnel require EIT and modify training requirements as
   appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. EIT Program Manager. The EIT program manager will:
   3.3.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from
   operational squadrons, tactics representatives, aircrew flight equipment (AFE) personnel, SF
   personnel, AFOSI, and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as
   appropriate. (T-2)
       3.3.1.1. Effective training methods will be used and can include, but are not limited to:
       briefings, demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic
       training sessions.
       3.3.1.2. Training resources can include, but are not limited to threat briefings, current
       intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
       materials, and weapons system videos.
   3.3.2. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training cycle.
   (T-3)

     3.3.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
     requirements. (T-3)
     3.3.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned and
     apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
     3.3.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group EIT program to the appropriate
     commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
     minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (high miss questions,
     weak areas, etc.); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable. (T-3)
3.4. Aircrew Intelligence Training. AIT is EIT provided to the units assigned and attached
aircrew. The assigned Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course (IWIC) or Intelligence Sensor
and Weapons Instructors Course (ISWIC) graduate will be directly responsible for the
management of the AIT program. When an IWIC or ISWIC graduate is not assigned, the SIO
will manage the AIT program.
     3.4.1. Flying squadron intelligence personnel provide input to and execute the AIT program.
     (T-2) They will provide questions and answers specific to the squadron's mission for the unit
     Master Question File (MQF), administer AIT tests to aircrew at the end of each training
     cycle, and document AIT provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of
     personnel receiving training, date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the name
     of the trainer conducting the training. In addition, they will provide a written evaluation of
     the squadron’s AIT program to the squadron commander and the EIT program manager (see
     Attachment 5). (T-3)
     3.4.2. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Each
     item in the AIT training plan will be taught at least once during the training cycle. The plan
     will ensure the objectives for each AIT category are evaluated with a test. All aircrew
     covered by the training plan will pass each test with a minimum score of 85% correctable to
     100% via a review of the missed test items with a qualified trainer. (T-3)
     3.4.3. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW AFI 11-2B-1B,
     Volume 1, B-1 Operations Procedures. Details of the prorating schedule must be outlined in
     the AIT Plan and/or other written instructions. (T-3)
     3.4.4. Aircrew intelligence training categories include threat knowledge, visual recognition,
     personnel recovery, and collection and reporting. Additional categories can be added based
     on the unit’s operational mission. (T-2)
        3.4.4.1. Threat Knowledge Training. Develop specific threat knowledge training
        objectives tailored to the B-1, unit mission, local area, deployment base(s) and forward
        operating locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for
        direct unit involvement. The minimum standards for B-1 AIT threat briefings are in
        Attachment 3. The references listed in Chapter 1 of this instruction can be supplemented
        with other publications such as National Air and Space Intelligence Center products,
        Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country Studies, etc. when developing threat
        knowledge training materials.
        3.4.4.2. Visual Recognition (VR) Training. Develop specific VR training objectives
        tailored to the B-1, unit mission, base and forward operating locations. Include

       enemy/adversary, friendly or neutral weapon systems that may be encountered in the
       operational environment, based on unit mission and operations plan/concept of operations
       plan (OPLAN/CONPLAN) tasking. Identify key differences between friendly weapons
       systems and threat weapon system look-alikes. Incorporate all aspects/angles, theater
       specific paint schemes, national markings and various configurations. Include examples
       of weapons employment to illustrate to aircrew how threats might appear when employed
       (muzzle flashes, smoke plumes, burst patterns, etc.). Training should teach aircrew how
       to describe threats they encounter to assist intelligence personnel in positive
       identification.
       3.4.4.3. Personnel Recovery (PR) Operational Support Training. When assigned, a
       SERE specialist will conduct PR operational support training. The SERE specialist will
       coordinate PR operations support training requirements with intelligence and AFE
       personnel and document these requirements in a memorandum of agreement (MOA).
       Units without SERE personnel will coordinate an MOA with AFE and operations. This
       category will be omitted if intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational
       support training to aircrew. If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support
       training, address as a minimum: PR materials (Isolated Personnel Report (ISOPREP)
       maintenance and review, evasion plan of action (EPA) preparation) and theater combat
       recovery procedures.

       necessary to enable aircrew to initiate aircrew-originated reports (e.g. In-flight Report
       (INFLTREP)) and familiarize them with the information requirements of the intelligence-
       generated Mission Report (MISREP) and other intelligence reports. A critical component
       of this training will be the unit’s essential elements of information (EEI). Training will
       identify and describe theater-specific and peacetime reporting requirements.

aircrew, ask amplifying questions relevant to the mission, identify time-sensitive information and
disseminate appropriately and expediently.
Deployment Briefing—A briefing to provide intelligence information to aircrew, key staff, and
deploying personnel prior to deployment. Intelligence information is tailored to the unit’s
specific mission, roles and combat profiles IAW the unit OPLAN/OPORD tasking. It includes a
synopsis of the military and political situation generating the deployment, enemy activity and
force disposition (air, ground and naval, as applicable) in the AOR and along deployment route,
enemy tactics and employment strategies, potential and or anticipated enemy reactions to the
deployment, possible en-route hazards to flight, bailout or alternate landing issues (for hostile,
friendly and neutral areas), known threats (terrorist or regular military forces) in vicinity of bed
down location, reporting instructions and EEI and additional items as dictated by the local
situation.
External Intelligence Training (EIT)—Intelligence training given by intelligence personnel to
aircrew or other non-intelligence AFSC personnel.

External Intelligence Training (EIT) Trainer—Current and qualified (CMR or BMC)
intelligence personnel who have completed the EIT specialized training and maintain currency as
an EIT trainer. Only qualified and current trainers may conduct unsupervised intelligence
training for aircrew or other non-intelligence Air Force Specialty Code personnel.
Initial Situation Briefing—The briefing conducted at the outset of a crisis that outlines the
initial situation to the commander and staff. It includes the current situation, including major
events leading to the crisis, any national decisions, enemy force disposition, current situation at
deployment location, local area situation (e.g., terrorist activity, subversion threats, etc.),
anticipated enemy reactions, possible en-route flight hazards for previously scheduled and
transient flights.
Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager—The IPTPM is appointed by the SIO to
oversee the execution of the Intelligence Personnel Training Program.
Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment—An analytical methodology
employed to reduce uncertainties concerning the enemy, environment, and terrain for all types of
operations. Intelligence preparation of the operational environment builds and extensive data
base for each potential area in which a unit may be required to operate. The database is then
analyzed in detail to determine the impact of the enemy, environment, and terrain on operations
and presents it in graphic form. Intelligence preparation of the operational environment is a
continuing process.
Intelligence Reports—Reports generated by intelligence personnel to provide information to
higher headquarters (e.g., MISREPs and Intelligence Reports).
Internal Training Program—The internal intelligence training program is a unit-developed and
maintained program. It is intended to facilitate all personnel in maintaining their qualifications
and currencies. This volume provides a basic starting point for B-1 intelligence units and may be
modified by the SIO based on the unit’s requirements.
Mission Briefing—A briefing to provide unit operators with the latest intelligence affecting the
mission. Accurate and timely intelligence information should be provided on the general
situation since the last briefing, mission information, general situation in the CAP/objective area,
en route and mission area threats (SAMs/ADA/AAA/air/naval/laser and spectral interference
threats/etc.), and other factors essential to mission success.
Mission Package Construction—The mission package provides the operator with the
intelligence materials necessary to accomplish the mission. The mission package includes route
maps, threat information and other local mission package requirements.
Mission Planning—The planning accomplished by intelligence personnel to support the
operational mission. Mission planning provides operators with the intelligence materials
necessary to accomplish the mission and may include route maps, imagery, and other local
mission folder requirements. Aircrew should receive the latest intelligence and most accurate
information available on routes, CAP area, targets of strikers being supported, threats, evasion
and recovery and other factors essential to planning the mission.
Mission Planning Cell Initial Situation Briefing—The MPC initial situation briefing is the
feasibility briefing that provides mission planners with the latest intelligence and most accurate

other factors essential to planning the mission.
Mission Tracking—Maintaining situational awareness of ongoing missions by monitoring
mission execution and communicating with other mission related agencies and coordination
centers.
Personnel Recovery—The aggregation of military, civil, and political efforts to obtain the
release or recovery of personnel from uncertain or hostile environments and denied areas
whether they are captured, missing, or isolated.
Senior Intelligence Officer—The SIO is the highest-ranking Air Force officer holding the 14N3
or 14N4 AFSC or Series 0132 Civilian serving in an Air Force intelligence position. The SIO's
authority extends to all directly subordinate units. Installations with intelligence activities in
different chains of command will have separate SIOs. In this capacity, the SIO provides senior
guidance on all policy development, interpretations, and applications
Situation Briefing—The briefing which provides the latest intelligence to assist commanders,
staff and aircrew in their decision making. It incorporates significant military and or political
events, enemy force disposition (ground, air and air defense, naval, as applicable), indications of
impending enemy attack, enemy tactics and or employment strategies, potential course of enemy
action, local area situation (terrorism, sabotage, subversion threats, etc.).
Step Briefing—A briefing given to aircrew immediately prior to departure for tasked mission.
The step briefing provides the aircrew with last minute intelligence affecting their mission and
highlights changes in the intelligence situation since the mission briefing.
Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance has the potential to create moderate risk of mission or program
degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waivers
may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM

                     AIRCREW INTELLIGENCE TRAINING REPORT

MEMORANDUM FOR XX SQ/CC

FROM: [Unit]

SUBJECT: Summary of Squadron Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT)

1. The XX Bomb Squadron has 25 assigned combat mission ready (CMR) pilots and 26
assigned CMR WSOs 78 percent of all aircrew received 100 percent of their required
intelligence training topics for this training cycle. The status of intelligence training is listed
below:

Ed D. Tyler                      WSO               PR, ISOPREP
3. The annual Intelligence MQF test was administered on 15 Jan 2011. All CMR aircrew have
taken the 100 question test (Pilots : 50 questions and 50 visual recognition slides; WSOs : 50
questions). While not all aircrew have obtained the minimum passing score of 85 percent the
first time around, all tests have been corrected to 100 percent. A total of 25 pilots took the test.
A total of 26 WSOs took the test. The initial average test score for the squadron was 95 percent.

4. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and MiG-29,
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
