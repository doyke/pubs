1. Overview. Augmentation is defined as installation-level realignment of personnel, in duties
outside their primary skill set and unit of assignment, to meet the installation's short-term
exercise, contingency, wartime, or emergency requirements. The Augmentation Duty Program is
designed to assist commanders in validating, approving, and documenting the need for these
additional, short-term personnel requirements. It also aids commanders in identifying, training,
and tracking personnel to meet validated requirements.
2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. The Commander, Joint Base Charleston (JBC) will establish an Augmentation Duty
   Program and Augmentation Review Board (ARB) to determine all installation-level
   augmentation requirements.
2                                                   JBCHARLESTONI10-243 4 JUNE 2014


    2.2. The Deputy Commander, Joint Base Charleston (DJBC) is the primary Augmentation
    Duty Program OPR and ARB chairperson. He/she advises the JBC on ARB decisions and
    serves as the primary approval authority for all augmentee call-ups.
    2.3. The Command Chief (628 ABW/CCC), in close coordination with all wing, group, and
    mission partner senior enlisted leaders, oversees the Augmentation Duty Program on behalf
    of the DJBC and is responsible for day-to-day execution of the program.
    2.4. The ARB will convene annually, or more often as deemed necessary by the DJBC, to
    validate and prioritize augmentation requirements and identify available resources to fill
    them. The ARB has overall responsibility for tasking units to meet augmentation
    requirements, and will also ensure training programs are established to ensure readiness of
    personnel to meet those requirements. The ARB will be comprised of two groups:
       2.4.1. Board Members. Board members represent the command structure at wing, group,
       and mission partner levels. The DJBC serves as the chairperson. All Joint Base
       Charleston wing, group, and mission partner commanders (0-6 level or deputy) should
       serve as board members.
       2.4.2. Board Advisors. Board Advisors represent installation support functions that
       provide key information for ARB action and decision making. At a minimum, advisors
       will consist of the Chief, Manpower & Organization (628 FSS/FSMM); Chief, Military
       Personnel    (628 FSS/FSMP); and the Installation Augmentation Manager (628
       ABW/XP). The chairperson may appoint additional advisors to the ARB as required.
    2.5. The Chief, Manpower & Organization, using approved management engineering
    methods, advises the ARB regarding validation and approval of augmentation requirements.
    Specific responsibilities are:
       2.5.1. Assist units in determining total augmentation requirements under approved
       scenarios.
       2.5.2. Review all augmentation requests prior to each ARB meeting.
       2.5.3. Advise the ARB based on their assessment of the need for and utilization of
       augmentees, and recommend approval/disapproval of augmentation requests.
    2.6. The Chief, Military Personnel advises the ARB regarding validation and approval of
    exemption and shortfall/reclama requests as well as fair-share taskings. Specific
    responsibilities are:
       2.6.1. Advise units regarding augmentee exemption and shortfall/reclama requests.
       2.6.2. Review all exemption requests prior to each ARB meeting.
       2.6.3. Advise the ARB based on their assessment of exemption requests, and recommend
       approval/disapproval of these requests.
       2.6.4. Advise the ARB regarding fair-share unit taskings to fill all validated
       augmentation requirements. Fair-share taskings will be determined by subtracting
       ARB-approved exemptions from a unit's assigned E-1 through E-5 end strength.
    2.7. The Installation Augmentation Manager, in close coordination with 628 ABW/CCC,
    administers the installation's Augmentation Duty Program. Specific responsibilities are:â€¢
JBCHARLESTONI10-243 4 JUNE 2014                                                                3

     2.9.1. Determine and clearly define duties for each augmentee.
     2.9.2. Maintain a locally-devised database of all augmentation requirements and
     augmentee training status.
     2.9.3. Establish a training program. Track all required training and coordinate training
     with the augmentees' Unit Augmentation Coordinator. Notify supporting Unit
     Augmentation Coordinators and 628 ABW/CCC of training no-shows.
     2.9.4. Identify and fund required training, necessary equipment, uniform items (rain gear,

     belts, etc.).
     2.9.5. Coordinate with supporting Unit Augmentation Coordinators to replace
     augmentees who are departing for reassignment, separation, retirement, or deployment of
     90 days or more, as well as those who are medically disqualified. Supported units will
     maintain 100 percent augmentee capability at all times.
     2.9.6. Provide augmentees who successfully complete their tour of duty with
     documentation reflecting the status of their training, qualification, and/or certification.

     determined by the ARB, are filled at all times.
     2.10.2. Assign augmentees to supported units using the template at Attachment 5.
     2.10.3. Ensure personnel assigned to augmentee duty meet all eligibility requirements to
     perform the duty. Units will not assign personnel with permanent medical or other
     disqualifying conditions.
     2.10.4. Ensure personnel assigned as primary or alternate to a deployment tasking are not
     assigned to augmentee duty until all other eligible resources have been exhausted.
     Augmentee duties will not be grounds for shortfall/reclama of a deployment tasking.

        is emergency leave.
        2.10.8. Replace augmentees who are departing for reassignment, separation, retirement,
        or deployment of 90 days or more, as well as those who are medically disqualified.
        2.10.9. Immediately advise the Installation Augmentation Manager of any difficulties
        with filling augmentee requirements due to deployments or other mission requirements.
        2.10.10. Ensure augmentees return issued equipment/gear prior to reassignment,
        separation, retirement, or within 7 days after removal from augmentee duty.
        2.10.11. Develop and maintain an augmentee recall roster. Unit Augmentation
        Coordinators will be directed by the DJBC or 628 ABW/CCC to implement the recall
        roster.
3. Process and Procedures.
     3.1. Establishing and Implementing Augmentation Requirements.
        3.1.1. Augmentation is used primarily to support temporary, short-term workload surges
        during exercise, contingency, wartime, and emergency situations. Sustained use of
        augmentees will not be used to offset normal manpower shortfalls.
        3.1.2. Unit commanders will exhaust all military personnel and skilled/trained DoD
        civilian resources within their organization prior to seeking augmentation from other
        organizations.
        3.1.3. Units requesting to establish or eliminate augmentation requirements must gain
        approval from the ARB.
        3.1.4. Units will submit requests, using the template at Attachment 3 along with any
        supporting documentation, through their chain of command to the Installation
        Augmentation Manager.
        3.1.5. Requests for augmentation may be submitted at any time, but no later than the
        suspense established by the Installation Augmentation Manager prior to the next
        scheduled ARB meeting. The Chief, Manpower & Organization will review requests and
        present them at the next ARB meeting. The augmentation request process is outlined in
        the flow chart at Attachment 2.
        3.1.6. Requests for exemption from augmentation taskings may be submitted at any time,
        but no later than the suspense established by the Installation Augmentation Manager prior
        to the next scheduled ARB meeting. The Chief, Military Personnel will review requests
        and present them at the next ARB meeting. Units will submit requests, using the template
        at Attachment 4, through their chain of command to the Installation Augmentation
        Manager.
JBCHARLESTONI10-243 4 JUNE 2014                                                             5


  3.2. Augmentee Call-Up Procedures.
     3.2.1. When a supported unit deems it necessary to utilize augmentees, the unit
     commander will submit a request through their chain of command to the DJBC. The
     request will include the number of personnel required, beginning date, estimated
     duration, and justification.
     3.2.2. Upon approval, the DJBC or 628 ABW/CCC will notify supporting Unit
     Augmentation Coordinators and provide necessary tasking information. The supporting
     Unit Augmentation Coordinator will in tum notify their augmentees.
     3.2.3. If the supported unit does not request use of all allotted augmentees, the
     Installation Augmentation Manager will determine each supporting unit's fair-share
     tasking based on the percentage of tasked personnel.
     3.2.4. Upon notification of a recall, augmentees will report immediately to the supported
     unit for accountability. Only the DJBC may direct alternate reporting procedures.
     3.2.5. Augmentees not utilized by the supported unit will be returned immediately to the
     supporting unit and notify their Unit Augmentation Monitor. The supported unit will
     notify both the DJBC and supporting unit when unutilized augmentees are returned.
