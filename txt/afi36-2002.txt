This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-20, Accession of Air Force
Military Personnel. It tells how to enlist qualified individuals into the Regular Air Force
(RegAF) and the Delayed Entry Program (DEP) and how to: access Air Reserve Component
(ARC) members onto specified Extended Active Duty (EAD) tours; access ARC members who
apply for RegAF enlistment while on EAD; reenlist officers with a statutory entitlement, and
reenlist airmen removed from Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL). It provides
procedures for the Initial Enlistment Bonus (IEB) program. This publication applies to ARC
units and members. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) also applies to Air National Guard (ANG)
with exception of Chapter 1, Chapter 4, and Chapter 5. Attachment 3 applies to RegAF,
ARC, and ANG personnel to include applicants of these components. In collaboration with the
Chief of Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) and the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel, and Services (AF/A1) develops personnel
policy for Accession and Special Category Accession policy. This Air Force AFI may be
supplemented at any level; all supplements must be approved by the Human Resource
Management Strategic Board (HSB) prior to certification and approval. Refer questions or

     Designator (SPD) data are not available through the Defense Manpower Data Center
     (DMDC).
     1.3.2. The DMDC report, Project Capture, and separation documents regarding RE code or

         CONDITIONS THAT MAKE APPLICANTS INELIGIBLE TO ENLIST

A2.1. Ineligibility Conditions. Applicant is ineligible to enlist when one of the following
conditions exists (refer questionable cases to appropriate accession authority for respective
component):
   A2.1.1. Intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol and drugs at any time during enlistment
   processing or has been involved with narcotics, dangerous drugs, diagnosed as an alcoholic
   or alcohol abuser or who self-admits to alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or has had a positive
   Drug and Alcohol Test (DAT). Forward waivers of pre-service drug use or involvement for
   other than marijuana through appropriate component accession authorities. They will
   consider waivers only for a limited pre-service use of amphetamines, barbiturates or un-
   prescribed anabolic androgenic steroid usage. Marijuana usage after signing AF Form 2030,
   USAF Drug and Alcohol Abuse Certificate, makes the applicant ineligible for enlistment or
   waiver consideration. A positive DAT renders an applicant ineligible for waiver
   consideration. An applicant who completes treatment for alcoholism will be considered for
   waiver after 2 years alcohol free.
   A2.1.2. Has questionable moral character, history of antisocial behavior (including
   psychosis), frequent difficulties with law enforcement agencies, transsexualism and other
   gender identity disorders, exhibitionism transvestitism voyeurism, and other paraphilias.
   A2.1.3. Enlistment is not clearly consistent with national security interest according to AFI
   31-501, Personnel Security Management Program.
   A2.1.4. Conscientious objector, person with personal beliefs, convictions, or religious
   practices precluding unrestricted duties or assignments; received a presidential pardon for
   draft evasion.
       A2.1.4.1. Request for religious accommodation by any pre-accession applicant will not
       be granted. Instead, applicants will be briefed on the Air Force policy and procedures for
       seeking religious accommodation once they become members. Specifically, applicants
       will be briefed that every Airman has the right to request religious accommodation once
       they have been accessed into the Air Force. Religious accommodation requests are
       handled on a case-by-case basis at each assignment throughout the Airman's career. As
       such, a religious accommodation may be granted at one assignment but denied at another
       assignment. Every request will be fully considered by the appropriate authority;
       however, if the request is denied the Airman will be required to comply with Air Force
       standards. Following the briefing, the applicant's acknowledgment of the Air Force
       policy regarding religious accommodation requests will be recorded and maintained as
       part of the accession application.
   A2.1.5. A high school graduate (Tier 1) with an ASVAB AFQT score less than 36; a
   Covered Graduate, as defined under Section 532 of the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense
   Authorization Act, Public Law 112-81, that scores less than a 50 AFQT. EXCEPTION: For
   Tier 2, any test-based equivalency certificates (credential obtained solely by testing) with an
   AFQT less than 65. NOTE: Education credentials (Tiers) are defined by the Department of
   Defense.
30                                                                  AFI36-2002 7 APRIL 1999


     A2.1.5.1. A high school graduate (Tier 1) can be accessed with an AFQT of 31 or higher

     Force Enlisted Classification Directory.
     A2.1.5.2. Ninety-five percent or greater of all NPS enlistments must be high school
     graduates or higher (Tier 1).

  on some specified future date (includes those relieved from restraint on the condition of
  enlistment). (No waivers authorized.)
  A2.1.8. Civil or criminal charges filed or pending (includes those released from charges on
  condition of enlistment). In civil suit cases only, a person may enlist provided they obtain a

  This is not waiverable. Refer doubtful cases to HQ AFRS/RSO for eligibility determination.
  A2.1.11. On active duty or active duty for training with any branch of the United States
  Armed Forces. Acceptance into an Air Force commissioning or appointment program renders
  warrant officers and enlisted personnel from any branch of the United States Armed Forces
  eligible for enlistment. However, failure to complete the program renders the enlistee
  ineligible to remain in or revert to enlisted status in the Air Force. Reserve officers from any
  Guard or Reserve component not currently on EAD and who were only on EAD for training,
  may apply for nonprior service enlistment through AFRS. AFRS advises members they
  cannot hold a warrant officer or Reserve commission in an Armed Force other than the Air
  Force.
  A2.1.12. Has ever held a commission in any Regular or Reserve component. EXCEPTION:
  All warrant officers are eligible to enlist for the sole purpose of attending a

     exceptions and may apply for enlistment. HQ AFRS verifies eligibility (no further
     delegation authorized).
     A2.1.13.2. Regular and Reserve (non-rated) officers on active duty without statutory
     entitlement, eliminated from flying or technical training, with less than 2 years of active
     duty may apply for nonprior service enlistment through AFRS. These individuals do not

AFI36-2002 7 APRIL 1999                                                                     31

        A2.1.13.3.1. Interservice Reenlistment Code (IRC) of 4 or Interservice Separation
        Code (ISC) of 60 through 87. Consider ISC 87 case by case.
        A2.1.13.3.2. Air Force RE code 3S or 3V with an SPD code of MCA (accepted VSI)
        or MCB (accepted SSB).

        A2.1.13.3.4. RE code 2Q.
     A2.1.13.4. Consider waivers for the following (approval and disapproval authority
     delegated no lower than HQ AFRS/RSO level):
        A2.1.13.4.1. Separated with 5 or more days lost time.
        A2.1.13.4.2. Separated from a regular component in pay grade E-3 or lower after 24
        or more months TAFMS. Must have no other disqualifying factor.
        A2.1.13.4.3. Separated for physical condition during basic or technical training.
        Applicant must furnish proof the physical defect responsible for separation no longer
        exists and have HQ AETC Physical Standards Division (SGPS), certification of
        acceptability for enlistment.
        A2.1.13.4.4. Air Force RE code 3 or 4 (convert other service's narrative reason for
        discharge to an Air Force RE code.) Contact HQ AFPC/DPPAES for guidance in
        questionable cases.
        A2.1.13.4.5. Separated from OTS.
        A2.1.13.4.6. Prior service applicants who were discharged solely under 10 USC, 654,
        commonly known as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” or “DADT”, and its implementing
        regulations may apply to re-enter the Air Force. These applicants are evaluated
        according to the same criteria and requirements applicable to all prior-service
        members seeking re-entry into the Air Force. There is no preferential treatment for
        service members separated under DADT. The military requirements of the Air Force
        will continue to dictate re-accession criteria. The Air Force (AFRS/RSO) will waive
        re-entry codes/separation codes barring reenlistment that were based on separations
        under DADT.
            A2.1.13.4.6.1. In considering applicants for re-accession, the applicant’s previous
            performance and disciplinary record will be considered when determining
            suitability for a re-entry code/separation code waiver. However, the Air Force
            will not consider to the detriment of an applicant any separation that was solely
            under DADT. For example, former service members who were separated with an
            honorable discharge (or an uncharacterized discharge for those occurring during
            initial training), and who have a separation code in their records reflecting a
            separation under DADT (DoD discharge codes JB, RA, RB, RC), shall be
            considered for re-entry according to the most favorable re-entry classification.
32                                                                AFI36-2002 7 APRIL 1999

     An emancipated 17-year old may enlist with an approved parental consent waiver from
     the appropriate component authority.
         A2.1.16.1.1. RegAF approval authority is the local Recruiting Squadron Commander
         (RCS/CC)
     A2.1.16.2. For the RegAF Prior Service program, the applicant’s age must be less than
     established non-prior service age limit when reduced by member’s TAFMS. However; if
     applicant has previous satisfactory service in an Air Reserve Component (ARC) (verified
     by AF Form 526), age must first equal less than 39, when reduced by TAFMS and when
     further reduced by years of satisfactory service in the ARC, it must equal less than

     informed that dependents are not authorized to join the applicant until all TDY technical
     training school requirements are completed. Family Care Plans must incorporate
     provisions for TDY technical training school periods. For accession purposes the Air

AFI36-2002 7 APRIL 1999                                                                         35

                        APPLICANTS WITH A CONVICTION
                    OR ADVERSE ADJUDICATION OF AN OFFENSE

A3.1. Use the following information along with the Waiver Authority Matrix Table A3.1., and
the Uniform Guide List (UGL) of typical conduct offenses Table A3.2.to determine the proper
offense category classification and required conduct waiver or service eligibility determination
(SED) requirements for application convicted or adversely adjudicated of a moral conduct
offense:
   A3.1.1. Applicants with one or more convictions or adverse adjudications from paragraphs
   A3.2.1.1. (category 1), A3.2.1.2. (category 2) or A3.2.1.3 (category 3) in a lifetime require an
   approved conduct waiver of morals disqualification.
   A3.1.2. Applicants with two or more convictions or adverse adjudications from paragraphs
   A3.2.1.4. (category 4) or A3.2.1.5. (category 5) that demonstrate a pattern of misconduct,
   may be subject to a SED. SEDs are dependent upon the type and number of offenses as well
   as the period of time over which the offenses were committed. See Table A3.2. for proper
   determination.
   A3.1.3. DELETED
   A3.1.4. In evaluating an arrest record, information indicating acquittal, dropped charges,
   expunged record, case dismissal, or that the individual was the subject of “nolle prosequi”,
   does not negate the significance of the underlying conduct. Therefore, to protect the interest
   of the Air Force, base waivers and eligibility determinations on available information
   concerning a person’s conduct and actions rather than the legal outcome of a criminal
   proceeding:
       A3.1.4.1. These factors may mitigate disqualifying information. Consider them in the
       waiver process:
           A3.1.4.1.1. Immaturity attributable to the age of the individual at the time of the
           offense.
           A3.1.4.1.2. Circumstances surrounding the offense.
           A3.1.4.1.3. Isolated nature of the conduct.
           A3.1.4.1.4. Incident occurred in one's youth with no subsequent criminal conduct.
           A3.1.4.1.5. Temporary conditions contributed to the conduct, (such as parents'
           divorce, serious illness, or death in immediate family, etc.) with no subsequent
           criminal conduct.
   A3.1.5. HQ AFRS:
       A3.1.5.1. May approve or disapprove requests for waivers of these provisions.
       A3.1.5.2. May delegate this authority to AFRSQ/CC.
       A3.1.5.3. Determines category of offense in questionable cases.
36                                                                  AFI36-2002 7 APRIL 1999


  A3.1.6. A conviction is the act of finding a person guilty of a crime, offense, or other
  violation of the law by a court, judge, or other authorized adjudication authority and includes
  fines and forfeiture of bond in lieu of trial.
  A3.1.7. An adverse adjudication (adult or juvenile) is a finding, decision, sentence, or
  judgment, other than unconditionally dropped, dismissed, or acquitted. When the
  adjudicating authority places a condition or restraint that leads to dismissal, dropped charges,
  or acquittal, the adjudication is considered adverse:
     A3.1.7.1. An adjudicating authority is an official of a Federal, state, county, or local
     government body empowered to make findings or determinations concerning alleged
     criminal (adult or juvenile) offenses and establishes responsibility for commission of the
     offense. Responsibility for commission of the offense is established by a conviction or
     when action tantamount to a finding of guilty is directed by the official (e.g., entry into a
     diversionary program, probation, or revocation of probation). Adjudicating authorities
     include:
         A3.1.7.1.1. Judges.
         A3.1.7.1.2. Courts.
         A3.1.7.1.3. Magistrates.
         A3.1.7.1.4. Prosecutors.
         A3.1.7.1.5. Hearing officials.
         A3.1.7.1.6. Military commanders (Article 15 action or suspension of dependent
         privileges or similar actions).
         A3.1.7.1.7. Probation officers.
         A3.1.7.1.8. Parole officers or boards.
  A3.1.8. A member is not eligible to begin enlistment processing for 3 months following
  termination of parole, probation, suspended sentence, or any period of confinement for a
  conviction. EXCEPTION: Suspended sentences for minor traffic offenses and completion
  of community service.

A3.2. Uniform Guide List (UGL) of Typical Conduct Offenses:
    A3.2.1. Use Table A3.2. to classify moral offenses based on Air Force conduct offense
    categories. For moral offenses not listed in the UGL table, align the offense to the proper Air
    Force category based on the seriousness of the offense and the maximum possible
    confinement and or fine under local law. Use paragraphs A3.2.1.1. - A3.2.1.5. in conjunction
    with the UGL Table A3.1. to determine proper classification.
        A3.2.1.1. Category 1 Moral Offenses. In doubtful cases, treat violations of a similar
        nature of seriousness as a category 1 offense. A conviction or adverse adjudication of
        one or more of these offenses is disqualifying for entry into the Air Force. Refer to Table
        A3.1. for proper waiver approval authority.
        A3.2.1.2. Category 2 Moral Offenses. In doubtful cases, treat the offense as a category 2
        offense when the maximum possible confinement under local law exceeds one year.
        Conviction or adverse adjudication of one or more of these offenses is disqualifying for
        entry into the Air Force. Refer to Table A3.1. for proper waiver approval authority.
        A3.2.1.3. Category 3 Moral Offenses. In doubtful cases, treat the offenses as a category
        3 offense when the maximum possible confinement under local law exceeds 4 months but
        no more than one year (including boating, aviation and similar recreational vehicular
        offenses). Conviction or adverse adjudication of one or more of these offenses is
        disqualifying for entry into the Air Force. Refer to Table A3.1. for proper waiver
        approval authority.
        A3.2.1.4. Category 4 Moral Offenses. In doubtful cases, treat traffic violations serious by
        law enforcement agencies as category 4 offenses (including boating, aviation, and similar
        recreational vehicular offenses). In doubtful category 4, non-traffic cases, treat similar
        offenses as category 4 offenses when the maximum possible confinement under the local
        law is 4 months or less. Refer to Table A3.1. for proper waiver approval authority.
        A3.2.1.5. Category 5 Moral Offenses. In doubtful cases, treat offenses of a similar
        nature (including boating, aviation, and similar recreational vehicular offenses) and those
        traffic offenses treated as minor by local law enforcement agencies, as Category 5
        offenses. If the offense is for parking tickets, count and document only tickets written by
        law enforcement officers for parking in prohibited zones, regardless of location. Do not
        count or document any overtime parking tickets. Do not count any parking tickets issued
        by private security firms, campus police, etc. Refer to Table A3.1. for proper waiver
        approval authority.
