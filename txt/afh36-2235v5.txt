Instructional Technology – using technology to enhance the learning experience.
Whether through self-paced, computer-based instructional programs, or through video
teleconferencing technology to bring subject matter experts into the classroom, the
proper use of technology can greatly increase the effectiveness and efficiency of
instruction.

Instructional technology can be used to support traditional classroom instruction
(technology insertion) or it can be used to expand the reach of instruction through
distance learning, where instructors are physically separated from the learners and
where the learners may be separated from each other.

With increasing frequency, distance learning is becoming the instructional solution of
choice. Because distance learning usually employs multiple technologies, developing a
distance-learning program requires the active participation of numerous specialists.
These specialists make up the cross-functional team responsible for the analysis,
design, development, implementation and evaluation of the distance-learning program.
Each team member fulfills a unique function.

Instructional designers must become the guardians of educational integrity because the
distance learning development process involves critical hardware and software
AFH 36-2235             Volume 5             1 November 2002                                                         2


integration, and there is increasing involvement from other functional specialists. There
are a number of reasons for this.

The education and training community does not control many of the resources that are
employed during the development and implementation of a distance-learning course.

Those who control the distance learning technology assets have often sought to exploit
their technologies – to showcase new capabilities – sometimes without adequate regard
for the principles of education and training.

Technology cannot drive the learning experience; technology is simply the way in which
instructional content is transmitted to the learner. It can either facilitate learning or
impede learning. The instructional designer must ensure that the selected technology
complements the established objectives and provides the best instructional solution.

In order to assume this responsibility, instructional designers must understand the
technology options. They must understand the capabilities and limitations of each
technology and the impact it has on the learner and the learning environment. In order
to participate as an effective team member, instructional designers must fully appreciate
the expertise that each member of the team contributes to the final product. This
handbook is designed to address these issues and provide the guidance necessary to
encourage instructional designers to ask the right questions as technologies evolve.

This volume provides information and guidance for designers of instructional systems
on how and under what conditions to incorporate training technologies into the
Instructional System Development (ISD) process. This guidance addresses the use of
instructional technologies in both resident and non-resident instructional systems. This
handbook should be used in conjunction with MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting
handbooks.

Three key terms      Instructional Systems Development (ISD) is an adaptation of the
                     systems engineering process to the process of curriculum
                     development.

                             ISD is a systematic approach to developing instructional
                             materials by integrating the processes (phases) of
                             analysis, design, development, implementation, and
                             evaluation.
                             The ISD process has been traditionally used for the
                             development of individual-type instructional programs.

                     Technology Insertion is the use of appropriate instructional
                     technology in resident instructional programs.

                     Distance Learning is structured learning that takes place without
                     the physical presence of the instructor.

Introduction           This section identifies the instructional technologies that may be
                       selected for resident instructional programs or employed in the
                       distance-learning environment.


Instructional          Numerous technologies are available for delivering instruction.
technologies           Most often, these technologies are used in combination with each
                       other to meet education and training requirements at an
                       acceptable cost. The following table lists the instructional
                       technologies that can be utilized used in both the resident
                       classroom and for the non-resident distance learning process.

Benefits of          Instructional Technology (IT) is more than just applying
incorporating        information technology to the learning environment; it is making
instructional        use of technology to promote learning by creating interactive,
technology           structured, and integrated units of instruction. When
                     appropriately employed, IT can increase the effectiveness and
                     efficiency of instruction.

                     When inappropriately employed, the insertion of technology in
                     instructional courses can result in:

                              Ineffective instruction and substandard learning.
                              Increased learning time.
                              Excessive costs for course development, logistics, and
                              maintenance.
                              Increased personnel requirements.
                              Unacceptable changes in the training organization's
                              operating structure, functions, and resources.

                   To make appropriate instructional technology choices, apply a
                   disciplined process to selecting the training solution. Using the
                   Instructional Systems Development (ISD) process helps structure
                   the analysis and design processes to facilitate selecting the
                   selection of the most resource-effective media solution.

                   This means that instructional designers must understand the
                   benefits and costs associated with each technology option, they
                   must understand the learning needs of the students, and they
                   must understand the impact of the learning environment on the
                   selection of presentation media and course design.


The goal           Each instructional situation presents unique challenges. The goal
                   of this handbook is to familiarize the user with the instructional
                   technology options, the strengths and weaknesses of each, and
                   the techniques and processes associated with managing projects
                   that are based on the effective use of alternative media.

                   There is a wide array of techniques and processes. It is
                   important to recognize that each IT program is unique – each has

                               Section B
                          Technology Insertion

Application      While the instructor may or may not be present at the time the
                 student is actually using the instructional technology, technology
                 insertion applies only to the use of technology to support training
                 instructional programs conducted at the schoolhouse. That is,
                 instructional technologies can be integrated directly into a
                 traditional classroom or laboratory course of instruction, can be
                 used for remediation and self-study to reinforce learning in a
                 resident course, or can be used to augment or refresh training
                 received through a resident program.


Background       Technology insertion is not new. The use of language
                 laboratories where students use headphones to listen to foreign
                 language tapes and then repeat phrases into a microphone so
                 the instructor can monitor their progress represents one example
                 of technology insertion that has been employed for more than 30
                 years. A more recent example is the use of computer-generated
                 presentations to reinforce learning concepts.

                 Everything from flip charts to mock-ups to simulators can be used
                 to enhance traditional instruction. As technological options
                 evolve at an ever-increasing rate, project managers, instructional
                 designers, and instructors must understand how these
                 technologies work and how they can help or hinder the learning
                 process. These participants in the development process must
                 understand the roles now assumed (and sometimes funded) by
                 representatives of other organizations; they must understand the
                 infrastructure requirements and how to coordinate the resources
                 necessary to employ the new technologies effectively.


Benefits of      Research indicates that the benefits of technology insertion,
technology       appropriately applied, can include:
insertion              An increase in levels of interactivity with instructional
                       materials
                       An effective method of providing performance
                       measurement tools for assessing student progress and
                       mastery of learning objectives

Impact of        Technology insertion impacts instructional programs from
technology       planning the training project through implementation and
insertion        evaluation of the course of instruction. Quality technology
                 insertion decisions rely on a structured Instructional Systems
                 Development approach, solid project management, and a
                 thorough understanding of the impact of each media alternative –
                 the impact on learning, on instructional staff, on project
                 development and delivery, and on life cycle cost of the training
                 program.

                                   Distance Learning

Definition of          Distance learning is structured learning that takes place without
distance-learning      the physical presence of an instructor. The following key
                       attributes are essential for any Air Force DL program:

                               Physical distance between learner and instructor.
                               Academic institution or functional organization
                               sponsorship.
                               Part of a structured curriculum with stated objectives.
                               Two-way communication and feedback between sponsor
                               and learner.
                               Deployment outside the confines of the resident
                               schoolhouse.
                               Includes process to evaluate program effectiveness.


Background             Distance learning is not new; it has been an effective method of
                       instruction for more than 200 years.

                               The Boston Gazette ran ads for shorthand lessons by mail
                               in 1728.
                               Australia’s University of Queensland offered an external
                               degree program in the 1890’s.
                               Columbia University offered extension programs in the
                               1920’s, while other schools began using radio for
                               instructional purposes in the 1930’s.


Effectiveness of       There seems to be an assumption that unless a learner is in a
distance learning      classroom to receive face-to-face instruction, the quality of the
                       learning will be compromised. Exhaustive research
                       overwhelmingly suggests otherwise:

                               Analysis of more than 600 courses spanning more than 40
                               years proves there is no significant difference in learning
                               outcomes for courses offered at a distance when courses
                               are properly designed and the best medium is selected.
                               Learning outcomes often increase with distance learning
                               because the student is more actively engaged in the
                               learning process.

                                                                      Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5      1 November 2002                                        13




Effectiveness of       Thus, there is no direct correlation between face-to-face
distance learning      interactivity and student performance. What is important is the
(Continued)            quality of instruction, not location.

                       “The key to success in distance learning is the teacher. If the
                       teacher on the system is good, the technology itself can become
                       almost transparent. Conversely, no technology can overcome
                       poor teaching; poor teaching is actually exacerbated at a
                       distance.” – OTA’s Linking for Learning: A New Course for
                       Education


Application            Distance learning programs are packaged into units of instruction
                       and delivered to users at non-resident education and training
                       sites – such sites range from distance learning centers to
                       learners’ own homes. The instruction can be delivered to the
                       user by:
                              Satellite networks
                              Terrestrial networks (e.g., computer networks, telephone
                              lines, modems, cable TV)
                              Mail

                       There are two modes of delivery for distance learning instruction:
                             Synchronous instruction: consists of real-time interaction
                             and transmission of instruction, and requires simultaneous
                             participation of all students and the instructor.
                             Asynchronous instruction: consists of other than real-time
                             interaction and the transmission of “stored” instruction or
                             files that do not require participation of all students and
                             instructors at the same time.


Benefits               Existing resident methods for instructing large groups of
                       individuals generate student travel costs and overhead expenses
                       such as facility operating and maintenance costs. The primary
                       objectives of distance learning are to extend the learning
                       environment (instructor and/or instructional media) to the
                       students at their location or remote site, increase learning
                       opportunities, and ensure mission readiness in a cost-effective
                       manner. Downsizing and reductions in military budgets have

                                                                     Continued on next page

                      Air Force Distance Learning Points of Contact


DL organizations in    Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning
the Air Force          Distance Learning Office: The AFIADLO, located at Maxwell
                       AFB Gunter Annex, was established as the focal point within the
                       Air Force for implementation of distance learning policy and
                       emerging technology. As the hub for distance learning, AFIADL
                       the office provides policy and guidance, as well as consultation
                       and support for the planning and development of distance
                       learning programs.

                       2 AF: 2nd Air Force is tasked with developing and providing
                       operations (technical) training for the Air Force. 2 AF is actively
                       delivering distance-learning courses using print materials,
                       videotapes, Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), Interactive
                       Video Teletraining (IVT), and the Internet, as well as converting

                       satellite-based education and training network.

                       AFRC: The Air Force Reserves Command (AFRC) is a
                       proponent of distance learning since it can simplify meeting the
                       training and education needs of reservists. AFRC uses T-Net, a
                       two-way video satellite broadcast system.

                       ANG: The Air National Guard is also a big proponent of distance
                       learning for the same reasons as the Reserve. ANG operates
                       the Warrior Network that is identical to ATN and has more than

In this handbook …    In this handbook, the user is presented with guidance on the
                      processes and tools needed to make informed decisions about
                      instructional technology and distance learning and their
                      application to today’s learning instructional needs. While
                      distance learning is not a panacea, it is a viable means to expand
                      the impact of training instructional programs, increase readiness,
                      and develop and maintain critical skills.

                      Deciding to develop a DL course impacts the traditional
                      development processes. It requires designers to look again at
                      how information is organized. It requires special instructor skills
                      and constant attention to implementation issues. The following
                      chapters, which provide insight into the IT environment with
                      emphasis on distance learning, offer the project manager
                      guidance and best practices to support the IT planning process
                      and discuss each technology as it currently applies to distance
                      learning.

                      It is important to recognize that technology changes on an almost
                      daily basis. What was just a possibility three years ago is
                      standard practice today. This handbook is designed to provide
                      the user with the framework necessary to ask the right questions
                      as technologies advance and as the role of the instructional
                      developer evolves.

                        Overview of the ISD Process
                 Overview of Instructional Systems Development


Introduction        This section provides an overview of the ISD process and
                    addresses the use of ISD for IT projects. Detailed information on
                    the ISD process may be found in MIL-PRF-29612, Training Data
                    Products, and its supporting handbooks.


Analysis phase      The Analysis Phase is the process used to identify the critical
                    tasks that are required for job performance. It identifies and
                    defines those tasks for which education or training must be
                    accomplished.

                            Course entry requirements are defined (prior education,
                            training, and/or experience).
                            The target population and training environment are
                            defined.
                            Mission/job performance requirements are identified to
                            develop a task list.
                            Critical tasks are identified; education and/or training must
                            be accomplished for each critical task.
                            The performance standards, performance behavior,
                            conditions of behavior and performance measurement
                            standards are determined for each critical task.
                            The knowledge, skills, and attitudes (including judgment
                            and decision-making knowledge and skills) required to
                            perform each job task are identified.

                    The following flowchart, figure 1, describes the ISD Analysis
                    Phase.

Design phase                The Design Phase is based on the results of the Analysis Phase.

                                    Knowledge, skill, and attitude learning objectives are
                                    developed.
                                    Performance test items are developed.
                                    Existing instructional materials are reviewed for
                                    applicability.
                                    The instructional methods and media are selected.
                                    The Course of Instruction (phases, units, modules, and
                                    lessons) is designed.
                                    The Implementation Plan for the Course of Instruction is
                                    designed.

Evaluation phase      Evaluation is a continuous process that is integrated into each
                      phase of the ISD process. It starts in the analysis phase with the
                      formative evaluation of the development process and products
                      and continues for the life cycle of the instructional system.

                              It provides feedback used to modify the education
                              instructional or training program as necessary.
                              It identifies both intended and unintended outcomes so
                              that decision-makers can make necessary adjustments in
                              the instructional program.
                              It usually involves formal and informal processes that
                              measure the effectiveness of instruction, delivery systems,
                              and support functions.

                      There are three types of evaluation:

                              Formative
                              Summative
                              Operational


Formative             Provides information about the effectiveness of products and
evaluation            processes as they are being developed. Performed periodically
                      from initial ISD planning throughout the development phase; can
                      include small-group tryouts of instructional components; used to
                      validate design of individual components of the instructional
                      system for integration. Objective is to identify deficiencies early,
                      when revision is least expensive.


Summative             Provides information to determine the “summed effect” of
evaluation            instruction under operational conditions. Used to assess full
                      system integration and effectiveness of the individual
                      components; based on an operational tryout of the program
                      (normally 2 or 3 classes) using real student throughput and full
                      instructional system operation. Objective is to ensure that the
                      instructional system is fully integrated and achieves desired
                      outcomes.

Operational      Includes periodic internal and external evaluation of the
evaluation       instructional program to ensure graduates meet established
                 education and training requirements. Performed periodically from
                 completion of the operational tryout throughout the life of the
                 instructional system. Objective is continuous improvement and
                 maintenance of instructional effectiveness.


Summary          Formative evaluation occurs at each phase of the project and
                 usually involves both an internal review by the team as well as a
                 review and approval by the customer. Formative and summative
                 (try-out) evaluation processes can involve validation of the
                 instruction (conducting a beta test of the instruction) with sample
                 student groups as appropriate. The objective is to identify and
                 address problems before the training instructional program is fully
                 deployed. This can involve the redesign of faulty lessons,
                 resolution of technical problems, and the refinement of support
                 documentation.

                 The course owner usually conducts the operational evaluation of
                 instructional effectiveness to determine whether the instruction
                 accomplished its intended purpose.

                The ISD Process and Instructional Technology (IT)


Introduction           With the increasing use of advanced technologies over the past
                       15 years, emphasis has been placed on defining the costs and
                       benefits of technology options earlier in the ISD process. Instead
                       of waiting until the design phase to identify the optimum mix of
                       media for a given instructional program, the IT development team
                       will begin considering support and delivery options as it analyzes
                       the course requirements. This section addresses the special
                       considerations associated with the development and
                       implementation of training programs delivered by means of
                       instructional technology.


IT considerations      Phase 1: Analysis
in the analysis
phase                  The analysis phase is very complex. As you will see later in the
                       section on project management, and again in Chapter 4, most
                       project planning decisions are made during this phase. This is
                       when the customer requirements are clarified and defined and
                       plans are developed. Information is gathered through the needs
                       analysis, task analysis, media analysis, audience analysis,
                       infrastructure/ resource analysis, environmental analysis, cost
                       analysis and other sources and processes to enable the IT team
                       to design and develop instruction.

                       The primary focus of the analysis phase is to establish the
                       boundaries of the instructional program, including:

                       Requirements
                             Type of learning required.
                             Prerequisite knowledge and skill requirements
                             Requirements and optimum processes for student
                             practice.
                             Feedback requirements.
                             Student data file requirements.
                             Course data management requirements.

                                                                  Continued on the next page

                          Help functions.
                          Support materials.
                          Student tracking methods.

                    The IT team must evaluate the technical infrastructure and the
                    hardware and software options carefully.

                       The team will identify current and future hardware and
                       software requirements and resources (including access to
                       broadcast facilities, downlink locations, availability of adequate
                       computers, etc.) and the pros and cons of various instructional
                       technology options.

                       It is usually not worth it to develop an instructional program in
                       outdated software, just as it is usually not worth it to develop a
                       program that is so state-of-the-art that it relies on hardware
                       that is not available to the end users.

                    The IT team will examine the costs and benefits of each potential
                    training solution and will strive to identify that solution that will
                    deliver the greatest Return On Investment (ROI). That is, the
                    team must define the approach that, given all of the training
                    factors and constraints, will give the biggest “bang for the buck.”

                           Critical to the process of determining ROI is the accurate
                           calculation of the costs of employing the instructional
                           technology alternatives. The team will not be able to
                           choose intelligently among alternatives if the cost of each
                           alternative is not based on sound analysis. Chapter 4
                           identifies the cost factors that must be considered when
                           comparing instructional technologies.

                    During this phase, the project manager and IT team will conduct
                    the required DITIS and DAVIS searches, conduct COTS

                                                                 Continued on the next page

in the analysis        The project manager also implements the metrics program, the
phase (Continued)      quality control program, and project evaluation procedures.

                       The selection of the correct medium/media is critical and this
                       decision must be made it is during the Analysis Phase that this
                       decision must be made. Guidance on media identification,
                       planning, selection, and implementation are presented in this
                       handbook. Chapter 3 identifies the media alternatives; Chapter 4
                       addresses the advantages and disadvantages of each medium;
                       and the subsequent chapters discuss the use of the media
                       alternatives. But the media selection and planning processes
                       must be completed before the project moves into the Design
                       Phase.


IT considerations      Phase 2: Design
in the design
phase                          Because changes during the development and
                               implementation phases are costly, the development team
                               should use this phase to ensure all members of the project
                               understand what the resulting instructional program will
                               look like – before full scale development begins. The
                               design phase documents how the instruction will look and
                               function.
                               Given the approved approach to training, the project
                               manager should arrange for the required staff training
                               (identified in the project planning) to enable the team to
                               design and develop instruction for the selected media.
                               The project manager will document the instructional
                               strategy for customer review and approval. This is a high-
                               level description of the design, including the look and feel,
                               navigation, testing, etc. The customer will also review and
                               approve plans for managing student data files.
                               The team may create a prototype so the customer can
                               actually review the “look and feel” of the design.
                               Once the prototype and instructional strategy have been
                               approved, the team creates flowcharts and storyboards.
                               Flowcharts make it clear how the instructional and
                               administrative elements will connect and how to navigate
                               through the instruction.
                               Storyboards should include screen text, graphics,
                               audio/video scripts, branching instructions, and

phase (Continued)         (CMC) instructors should be developed here. Templates and
                          web page designs for Internet instruction should also be
                          developed at this point.

                          The customer’s role as reviewer is particularly critical during
                          IT design efforts.
                              The project manager should schedule walk-throughs and
                              review sessions where the team explains to the customer
                              and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) the decisions made
                              and materials developed.
                              The customer and SMEs have a responsibility to review
                              the design deliverables (instructional strategy documents,
                              flowcharts/ storyboard web page designs) thoroughly and
                              provide timely, specific, constructive feedback.

                       Remember that developing a prototype is a good way for the
                       customer to experience the team’s vision of how the instruction
                       should be presented. It can save valuable resources later. Be
                       sure to avoid scope creep during this phase.


Instructional          Phase 3: Development

considerations in      The length of the development phase depends on the complexity
the development        of the project and the accuracy and level of detail achieved during
phase
                       the design phase. Development activities include the pre-
                       production, production, and post-production of the content and
                       various instructional media elements including audio, video,
                       graphics, animations, photos, and coordination of team
                       resources.

                               Depending on the complexity, this phase can involve
                               graphic artists, producers, directors, editors, animators,
                               narrators, programmers, quality assurance personnel, etc.
                               all working at the same time to create the instructional

                               The customer should provide existing instructional media
                               such as photographs, videotapes, graphics, animation,
                               and illustrations. All final instructional media elements
                               must be reviewed and approved by the customer. At this
                               point, changes are costly.

the development             Therefore, the customer should designate one point of
phase (Continued)           contact to represent the collective point of view in any
                            situation.

                     During this phase, the development team should:

                            Assemble all of the instructional media elements described
                            on the storyboards into a fully functional application of
                            instructional technology. This is a tedious and exacting
                            process whether creating videotape, interactive
                            courseware, or presentation materials for the IVT
                            instructor.
                            Ensure the customer has the opportunity to review and
                            approve all instructional media elements. The main
                            purpose of these reviews is to make sure everything on
                            the storyboards is in the instruction and that there are no
                            discrepancies.
                            Develop the instruction in increments so the customer can
                            review each increment in progress as well as when
                            completed. The team must be vigilant in the area of
                            project scope, however, and not allow the customer to add
                            requirements at this point.
                            Plan for and document the quality control efforts during
                            this phase. Be sure to conduct a summative evaluation at
                            the end of the development phase to test IT products
                            (especially important for IMI and IBI).

                     requirements all combine to create special challenges when the
                     training is based on the use of instructional technologies.

phase (Continued)           Most instructors are comfortable with traditional media and
                            computer-based support materials. Even so, conduct a
                            pilot course where instructors integrate the chosen media
                            into the instructional program and develop an appropriate
                            pace of instruction.
                            During the pre-production phase for IVT, include
                            rehearsals for instructors with the studio staff. Coach them
                            on techniques such as maintaining eye contact with the
                            camera, setting the stage for the students (helping them
                            become comfortable with the use of the chosen media),
                            and establishing clear-cut rules, procedures, and
                            processes.

                                    organizations. Be sure to maintain communications
                                    with supporting organizations. The failure to
                                    coordinate effectively is never more obvious than
                                    during the implementation phase.
                                    Conduct final coordination with facilitators, field

phase                  technology is appropriate to the instructional content and all
                       students have access to the same technology. However, it is
                       important to establish that the chosen media is the appropriate
                       vehicle for the given instruction prior to implementation. An
                       analysis of student data files after implementation will be key in
                       determining the overall effectiveness of the IT program.

                       Formative evaluations should be used throughout the Analysis,
                       Design, and Development Phases to verify that the selected
                       media is effective in supporting the training learning objectives.
                       Summative and operational evaluations will be the joint
                       responsibility of the IT team, support organizations, and the
                       course owner. The IT team must define and collect appropriate
                       metrics data and forward necessary reports to senior
                       management as requested. See the next section for information
                       on metrics.

                       The following project management activities should be
                       accomplished during this iterative phase.

                               Monitor established milestones, budget expenditures, and
                               development progress against what was planned.
                               Compare estimated and actual ROI.
                               Review instructional content and materials for accuracy,
                               currency, and availability.
                               Monitor processes to measure the impact of instructional
                               technology on student performance and learning
                               outcomes.

                               problems, administrative barriers, efficiencies realized
                               (cost, labor, training time), and other metrics that could
                               contribute to lessons learned and quality improvement of
                               the instructional system.

                               Section B
                    Overview of Project Management

Introduction      The desired result of the ISD process is customer satisfaction –
                  which means the delivery of a cost-effective instructional program
                  that adequately meets the established learning need and is
                  provided to the right people at the right time. Project
                  management is the means by which all the planning, analysis,
                  development, implementation, and evaluation actions discussed
                  in the previous section are coordinated and controlled. This
                  section addresses first the planning that must take place before
                  the project even begins and then defines the general
                  management principles and processes associated with an
                  instructional systems development project.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 5       1 November 2002                                          33


                               Project Planning


Purpose          The Project Manager’s primary tool is the project plan – its proper
                 development and implementation are the keys to delivering a
                 quality instructional program. The project plan can take any one
                 of a variety of forms, from a formal deliverable to a folder that
                 contains the agreed-to plan of action and milestones. The
                 degree of formality is dependent on the scope and complexity of
                 the project.

                 Regardless of the form it takes, project planning information must
                 be documented — it is used to define the scope of the
                 development project (including deliverables), the resources
                 required to accomplish each phase of the project (including
                 personnel and costs), and the project schedule. In this
                 handbook, the term project plan refers to project planning
                 documentation – however formal or informal.

                 The project plan is the vehicle used to confirm senior
                 management and customer buy-in. It is worth the time it takes to
                 develop, not only because it structures the program, but also
                 because it serves as a convenient tool to make sure there is a
                 common understanding between the development team and the
                 customer about requirements, responsibilities, timelines, and
                 expectations.


Note:            The scope of the project plan depends on the scope of the
                 assigned tasking. If the scope of assigned tasking is limited to
                 defining the instructional alternatives before the customer
                 commits to the development effort, the scope of the project
                 planning might be limited to the Analysis Phase. Once the
                 customer has selected the solution (the desired approach) and
                 expanded the tasking to include the actual development of the
                 instructional program, the project plan is then updated to reflect
                 the entire instructional system development effort.

                                     The project plan is a tool.
                   It is up to the project manager to make it an effective tool.

Prepare to begin        The project manager begins by assembling all available data
                        about the project.

                                    What does the team have to produce and how is it going to
                                    get there?
                                    How will the team know it is on track and doing a good
                                    job?
                                    What resources are required to get the job done?
                                    What are the points along the way where the customer will
                                    participate in the process?
                                    Who needs to be involved and what are their
                                    responsibilities?
                                    What is the experience level of the team?

                        Each of these questions must be answered and documented
                        BEFORE the IT team gets authorization from senior management
                        to begin its work.


Define the project      There are six major steps associated with project definition.

                           Step                  Definition
                                1         Identify customer requirements.
                                2         Define the IT development process, from inputs to
                                          outputs of the development process.
                                3         Define and establish required support processes.
                                4         Define staffing and resource requirements
                                5         Develop a master schedule.
                                6         Obtain senior management buy-in.


Step 1: Identify        In order to complete the most critical step in any development
customer                process – defining what is required – it is essential that the
requirements            project manager correctly identify the primary customer. Who is it
                        that must ultimately be satisfied with the product? While there
                        are often several customers of instructional systems, the primary
                        customer is the person or organization that retains decision-
                        making authority. This usually is the training manager, course
                        director, program manager, or an instructor who works directly
                        with the career field functional managers.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        35




Identifying other       Other customers of the instructional system include the students,
customers               students’ supervisors, other individuals who will work with
                        students after they have completed their instruction, and the
                        subject matter experts working with the project. In addition,
                        senior-level managers, MAJCOMs, instructors, and support
                        personnel are customers of the project team. Customer feedback
                        throughout the life cycle of the instructional system is a critical
                        component of the quality assurance process.


Defining the            During the Analysis Phase, the requirements and views of each
customer’s needs        identified customer group must be solicited and defined – the
                        better defined the requirements, the better the chances of fulfilling
                        them successfully. It is impossible to design an adequate
                        instructional system without defining these requirements. The
                        data collected will feed the task, training situation, and media
                        analysis processes as described in MIL-PRF-29612 and its
                        supporting handbooks. Understanding the customer’s
                        requirements will help instructional designers determine the
                        instructional delivery media best suited to the training situation
                        and learning needs. Refer to Chapter 4 for a discussion of media
                        selection criteria.


Obtaining and           The ultimate goal is a satisfied customer. And a customer who
keeping customer        has helped make decisions along the way is far more likely to feel
“Buy-In”                invested in the final product. The project plan should be built
                        around customer reviews and feedback. If the customer
                        disagrees with the team’s solutions or ideas, it is better to find out
                        and make adjustments early in the process. Surprising the
                        customer is the surest road to failure – there is a chance s/he will
                        be satisfied – but there is a greater chance that the team did not
                        anticipate every decision the customer would have made.


Step 2: Define the      First, the project manager must think through the entire project
development             from the beginning through to delivery of the end product; it may
process                 be helpful to gather trusted advisors and conduct a brainstorming
                        session. Think of the ISD process – what does the team have to
                        do to get through the Analysis Phase? Refer to MIL-PRF-29612
                        and the supporting handbooks for a detailed description of the
                        ISD tasks the team will have to complete.

                                                                        Continued on next page

Step 2: Define the      List the steps, or tasks, required for each phase. Tailor the tasks
development             as appropriate to the scope of the project. Make sure the inputs
process                 and outputs of the process are clearly defined – and that the
(Continued)             products to be delivered to the customer are identified. Once the
                        list is completed, look at the whole list and make sure all tasks
                        are included and that they progress logically from one to the next.

                        For each task, identify the information in the following table:
                        Task Information          Description
                        Title/Name of the Keep It Short and Simple
                        task
                        Purpose of the    Clearly state the purpose of the task – what
                        task              is the value added to the project?

                        Steps necessary      These are subtasks and should be as
                        to achieve the       detailed as is useful. They should be
                        task                 descriptive enough to enable a team member
                                             to understand clearly what must be done and
                                             how it should be accomplished. There is no
                                             need for micro-management, but there is a
                                             requirement for clarity.

                                             Include In-Process Reviews (IPRs) with the

Step 3. Define and      There are a number of support processes that must be defined
establish required      before the planning process is completed. By defining the
support processes       requirements associated with quality assurance and metrics
                        programs early in the planning process, the project manager
                        ensures that such processes are an integral part of the program
                        and that necessary resources are allocated.


Establish a quality     Quality assurance is the organized creation of beneficial change
assurance program       to the process of designing and developing products, whether an
                        instructional program or an aircraft. The objective of quality
                        assurance is to foster improvement in the process and products,
                        as they are being designed and developed rather than waiting
                        until after they are implemented. It has become a primary
                        function of Project Management.

                        Each phase of the ISD process is designed to force project
                        managers and designers to ask the right questions to help focus

                                                                        Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5         1 November 2002                                         38




Establish a quality   on the effectiveness of the instructional system – to force them to
assurance program     ask whether some aspect of the system could be improved.
(Continued)           Customer satisfaction is the number one goal; and customer
                      satisfaction translates into meeting instructional requirements in
                      the most effective and efficient manner possible.

                      Continuous improvement of Air Force instructional programs is
                      essential to the readiness of our forces. With decreasing
                      manpower and budgets, instructional designers must find more
                      effective and efficient ways to maintain the skills of Air Force
                      personnel. A proficient project manager will make quality
                      assurance an integral part of the instructional system life cycle
                      management process (from inception through retirement).


Develop quality       The Quality Control (QC) process, part of the quality assurance
control procedures    program, must be an integral part of the project. The QC
                      procedures should be updated throughout the project to ensure
                      that lessons learned in one part of the project are applied to work
                      remaining to be accomplished. Include the following in the QC
                      procedures:

                             Establish a review and approval process to make sure that
                             all products meet quality standards. A form documenting a
                             deliverable’s progress through the QC process should be
                             developed and retained with the deliverable files.
                             The review and approval form should be filled out and
                             attached to each product associated with a lesson. As the
                             product is reviewed and approved, the approving authority
                             should sign the document. The document should be
                             complete for each product associated with the lesson. The
                             primary author should date the form to tell the reviewer
                             when the review must be completed. The form should not
                             be signed until all suggested corrections are made,
                             checked, and approved. Disapproved products should be
                             returned to the author for correction.
                             QC is the collective responsibility of the entire
                             development team. Each member should be assigned
                             specific review and approval duties.
                             Make sure the quality control steps for each task are
                             included in the project planning.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       39




Develop project      Establish the means by which project progress will be measured.
metrics              Some organizations have established reporting processes that
                     dictate the data the project manager needs to collect, analyze,
                     and present to senior management and the customer. Metrics
                     and reporting requirements for DL projects have been defined by
                     the AFIADLO. The project manager should investigate current
                     requirements before establishing and integrating a metrics
                     program into the project.


Track costs          Make sure you have a process to collect and track costs
                     associated with the project. You will have to estimate costs prior
                     to initiating an IT project and monitor actual costs associated with
                     project development. More information on cost analysis and cost
                     models is included in Chapter 4.


Step 4. Define       The required skill levels for each task were defined during the
staffing and         initial step in this process. They indicate the type of expertise
resource             needed for the project team. The required implementation date
requirements         directly affects the number of people required. Given enough
                     time, one highly skilled person could probably develop an entire
                     IT program. However, there is usually a point at which assigning
                     more people to a task does little or nothing to accelerate the
                     schedule. Therefore, scheduling constraints must be identified
                     early in the process. Be prepared to recommend contract and
                     outsourcing options if in-house resources are scarce.

                     Given the tasks, the skill requirements, and the schedule, identify
                     the numbers of people required to accomplish each task. Don’t
                     forget to identify the staffing requirements for life-cycle
                     maintenance of the course after the IT product is implemented.
                     Sometimes senior management will require that staffing
                     requirements be expressed in hours, other times they require that
                     staffing be expressed as FTEs (Full Time Equivalents). The
                     bottom line is that the project manager must determine how many
                     people and what skill mix is required to accomplish each task.

                     The project manager will map out a staffing requirements chart,
                     which shows when the various staffing resources are required to
                     support the established schedule.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                      40




Refine team            Once all of the tasks are analyzed to define staffing requirements,
composition            it is good practice to back up and look at the staffing plan as a
                       whole. Review the tasks, schedule, and staffing plan. Look for
                       ways to realize efficiencies.

                               Can tasks be staggered more effectively to make better
                               use of staff?
                               Are there coordination or support functions that have been
                               overlooked?

                       The challenge is to optimize staffing resources – to have enough
                       staff so that the work can be accomplished without driving
                       everyone over the edge, but to tailor the process and staffing
                       carefully enough so that team members are not sitting around
                       waiting for others to finish their tasks.


Define IT team         With staffing requirements defined, identify the general roles and
positions and          responsibilities of each position. Team member position
responsibilities       descriptions may be modified to accommodate the individual
                       strengths and weaknesses of team members as the development
                       team evolves.

                       The project plan is also the place to explain how the staffing
                       resources will be organized. Subteams should be identified and
                       associated responsibilities defined.

                       More information on IT Team composition is included in
                       Section C.


Identify resource      Identify other resources needed for the project. Be sure to
requirements           include facilities and equipment requirements, needed software
                       and development tools, and services or resources needed from
                       support organizations.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       41




Step 5. Develop a      The project manager must identify any scheduling or time
master schedule        constraints that impact the staffing and resource requirements.
                       Include any events that will affect the development schedule.
                       Often, there is a target date by which the instructional program
                       must be delivered (e.g., for an equipment maintenance-training
                       program, the training schedule might be driven by the delivery of
                       the new equipment system to the initial installation site).

                       Working back from the required delivery date, define the
                       schedule for each task. Some tasks can be done concurrently
                       while others are dependent (when the results of one task must be
                       available before another task can begin). Include the review and
                       approval cycles for each deliverable.

                       Based on the length of time it will take to accomplish each task,
                       identify the start and end dates. This is usually developed using
                       a scheduling software package, but can be accomplished
                       manually on graph paper.

                       When the project schedule is drafted, examine it carefully and
                       make sure it makes sense. Make adjustments based on revised
                       task sequencing and dependencies. Software tools can be used
                       to develop GANTT or PERT charts that reflect task sequence and
                       dependency.


Incorporate            Insert staffing and resource requirements data into the schedule.
staffing and           This is a critical component of the project plan. The master
resource               schedule should give a clear overview of what needs to be
requirements           accomplished, when it will be accomplished, who is responsible
                       for accomplishing each task, and when the customer and SMEs
                       will participate in the process. Validate and adjust as necessary
                       the staffing resources assigned to each task.


Step 6: Obtain         The project manager must ensure that managers and customers
senior                 understand the scope of the project and the impact it will have on
management             manpower, budgets, and schedules. The best way to ensure
buy-in                 customer and managerial support is to obtain their approval of
                       the project plan. The first step in getting buy-in is to establish a
                       reasoned, well-planned view of the proposed project.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       42




Assemble the      Assemble the data to tell a solid story. Include the following:
project plan
                     What does the team have to produce and how is it going to
                     get there?
                        Task list
                        Deliverables
                        Life-cycle support
                        Development team structure

                     How will the team know it is on track and doing a good job?
                       Master schedule (GANTT or PERT charts)
                       Internal evaluation procedures/Quality assurance program
                       In-process reviews with the customer
                       Project metrics

                     What resources are required to get the job done?
                       Staffing
                       Facilities/Equipment/Networks
                       Software/Development tools

                      What are the points along the way where the customer will
                      participate in the process?
                        Review and Approval Cycles
                        In-Process Reviews

                     Who needs to be involved and what are their responsibilities?
                       Coordination with other organizations/agencies
                       Upper management responsibilities
                       Customer/SMEs

                  Remember that this information can be compiled into a formal
                  Project Plan, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) chart,
                  listed in an MOA/MOU with the customer, or summarized in a
                  briefing for senior management. In any event, the project
                  manager and the development team will use the planning
                  documentation on a daily basis – its form should support that
                  purpose.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 5       1 November 2002                                     43




Management         The project manager may be required to submit the project
“buy-in”           planning documentation for internal review and approval before it
                   is formally reviewed with the customer. It is the project
                   manager’s responsibility to ensure that all senior management
                   questions are adequately addressed.

                   Keeping management informed is the key to success. Submit
                   both formal and informal reports to senior management to make
                   sure they know how hard the project team is working, how well
                   the project is being managed, how pleased the customer is.

                   But don’t hide bad news. Don’t let issues grow until they are full-
                   blown problems. Define the problem carefully and develop a plan
                   of action for addressing it. Explain the risks and costs and
                   explain why this approach is the best way to solve the complete
                   problem.

                   It is important to recognize that the morale of the entire project
                   team can be deeply affected by the way management views the
                   project. Get senior management involved early and then
                   maintain the dialog. Let them know the project team values their
                   advice and support.


Commitment of      Obtaining resources frequently requires endorsement or approval
resources          of senior management. It is prudent project management to
                   involve senior management early, to identify project support
                   requirements early and clearly, and to keep senior management
                   informed about issues before they become problems. The
                   course owner or customer can often help identify (and emphasize
                   to senior management the importance of) support resource
                   requirements.

                   Identify and obtain senior-level management endorsement or
                   approval for:
                       Purchasing hardware, software, or curriculum materials.
                       Training for the project team.
                       Facility resources.
                       Manpower and support personnel.
                           Selection, training, and assignment of personnel.

Summary of            The following list summarizes the planning activities
project planning      accomplished by the project manager. It provides some
activities            reminders and key points to consider while developing and
                      managing the project plan.

                      Analyze Requirements
                        Validate the instructional need.
                        Analyze alternative media solutions to the instructional
                        problem; conduct cost/benefit and ROI analyses to define the
                        optimum IT solution. Identify the recommended solution in the
                        project planning documentation. (See Chapter 4).
                        Identify management constraints (including cost and schedule
                        constraints) that could affect development and implementation
                        of the instructional system.
                        Plan for system resource requirements including funding,
                        equipment, personnel, facilities, and maintenance. Plan to
                        monitor resource utilization throughout the project cycle and
                        track project costs.

                      Develop Strategies
                        Develop and document the management strategy for the
                        development, implementation, and life cycle support of the
                        instructional system.
                        Develop a POA&M for each phase of the project to reflect all
                        associated tasks and the related task performance schedule.
                        Identify and establish liaison with related support
                        organizations (e.g., faculty development, information
                        management, and facilities).
                        Establish a metrics program. Determine what data will be
                        collected, who the recipient of the data will be, how often it
                        needs to be collected, data sources, and what the purpose of
                        the data is (what it will be used for). Allocate resources for
                        metrics program design and implementation as well as data
                        collection and processing.
                        Ensure the project planning documentation incorporates an
                        appropriate quality assurance program to include formative,
                        summative, and operational evaluations.
                        Ensure project-planning documentation reflects on-going
                        customer involvement in the design, development, and
                        implementation of the training instructional program through
                        periodic reviews and working sessions.

                                                                   Continued on next page

Summary of            Staffing
project planning          Identify staffing requirements and establish project team
activities                membership; ensure appropriate cross-functional
(Continued)               representation (e.g., subject matter experts, user group
                          representatives, instructional designers, graphic artists,
                          evaluation specialists, and technical writers). Plan for any
                          additional staff training, if necessary. (See next section on
                          Instructional Technology Teams).
                          Define team operating guidelines and clarify roles and
                          responsibilities. Monitor the team to ensure all members
                          fulfill his/her/their responsibilities.
                          Make recommendations for contracting out the project if in-
                          house resources are inadequate to meet the need in the
                          specified timeframe.
                          Plan for the certification of instructors and instructors’
                          supervisors, site and subject matter facilitators, and
                          continuation training programs to ensure continued
                          qualification of the instructional staff.

                      Implementation
                         Obtain senior management and customer approval to
                         implement the project plan. Keep them in the loop
                         throughout the project.
                         Implement the plan and manage the ISD process.
                         Provide briefings on the status of the project and adherence
                         to the project plan.
                         Avoid scope creep. Do not allow the customers or a creative
                         development team to add unnecessary bells and whistles or
                         to broaden the scope of the project without solid justification.
                         When things change (as they always do), assess the impact
                         on scheduling and budgets. Do not incorporate the change
                         until required contractual actions have been completed.
                         Once management has approved the change, adjust the
                         project plan accordingly.

                      development team to the unique features of the project. This
                      section also provides suggestions for getting the IT development
                      team organized and off to a solid start.


IT team               The development organization should have a core management
                      team that serves to organize and coordinate all IT resources
                      regardless of the type of IT project. The IT Team comprises key
                      members who ensure the following essential functions are
                      established and coordinated (some members may oversee more
                      than one function).

                   IT Development Team Roles and Responsibilities


Define functions      In the project definition phase, the project manager identified the
and                   staffing requirements for the specific IT project. Now a
responsibilities      development team must be put together.

                      Each development team comprises members who perform
                      different functions. They come from academic, technical,
                      support, contract organizations, etc. to ensure a systems
                      approach to project development and execution.

                      A team member’s assigned responsibilities should be based on
                      his/her individual area(s) of expertise related to the type of
                      instructional technology used in the project. Some members may
                      perform more than one function. If the project is large is scope,
                      several people may be required to perform the same function.

                      Whatever the team composition, the project manager must
                      ensure that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. Only
                      then can subteams and team members begin to function
                      effectively and be held accountable.

                      These functions are a guide. Based on available manpower,
                      some team members may fulfill multiple functions.

                      The following paragraphs identify the special skill sets that will be
                      required to develop and implement various instructional
                      technology programs. These descriptions are provided as a
                      checklist for the project manager as s/he refines the composition
                      of the development team. The use of these resources may be
                      coordinated through the IT Team.

                               Specialized Skill Sets


Special skills      Depending on the IT employed, the development team will
                    require specialized expertise. The following charts identify the
                    key skills required for each of the technologies addressed in this
                    handbook. Multiple skills may be provided by an individual,
                    depending on the scope of the IT project and the skill set of the
                    individual.

                         Support Functions and Organizations


Introduction           The development of an instructional program often requires the
                       support of other organizations. Table 10 lists the major functional
                       groups and organizations with which the project team may need
                       to interface. It is important that the IT development team utilize
                       experts from these areas as appropriate. The use of these
                       resources is also coordinated through the IT Team.

                       Establishing The IT Development Team


Introduction          The master schedule has been developed. The skill set
                      requirements have been defined. The roles of all project team
                      members have been clearly delineated. Senior management and
                      the customer understand and concur with the project plan. It is
                      now time to assemble the development team, share information
                      on the project, obtain support tools, and define staff training
                      requirements. In brief, the development team must get ready to
                      implement the project plan. This section includes guidance for
                      establishing and preparing the project team.


Implement staff       The key to determining team members’ training requirements is
training              to examine the background of each team member. If members
requirements          do not have experience with the specific technology and/or tools
                      being used on the project, they are likely to need some training.
                      For example, before beginning the design phase for IVT develop-
                      ment, instructors, instructional designers, and instructional
                      developers should attend the video teletraining/teleseminar
                      course.

                      The project manager should develop a list of recommended staff
                      training and review it with each team member – the best source
                      of information in this case is the individual team member. The
                      cost of staff training must be factored into the overall project
                      budget.


Conduct the           The project manager should have met with each member of the
kick-off meeting      development team to clarify roles and responsibilities and define
                      training requirements. The purpose of the kick-off meeting is to
                      assemble the team and begin the process of integrating the team
                      resources.

                      In order to perform effectively, the members of the IT
                      development team must:

                          Include and instructor skilled in the given technology.
                          Know the subject (SME participation is critical).
                          Know what is expected of the team as a group as well as the
                          nature and scope of each individual’s responsibilities.

                                                                    Continued on next page

(Continued)               Know how products will look and function within the user
                          organization or DL environment.

                      The development team members will need copies of documents
                      that explain how they are supposed to do their jobs. They should
                      also receive documents that are required to develop the training
                      program. These documents include the following:

                          MOU with customer
                          Project planning documents
                          Development process outline
                          Quality control procedures
                          Support tools and documentation (e.g., hardware/software
                          and user's manuals)

                      The kick-off meeting is the time to review the project planning

                      Note: It takes time to build an effective team. The project
                      manager might consider using a trained facilitator to orchestrate
                      the kick-off meeting. The facilitator could help the team define its
                      goals, ground rules, and essential team processes.

                      the customer and the development team members. The
                      customer has an opportunity to discuss his/her view of the project
                      and to express any concerns about pressures or constraints. The

                                  Section D
                    Distance Learning Project Management

Introduction          The management of a Distance Learning (DL) project requires all
                      of the diligence described in the previous sections on project
                      management. However, there are special considerations
                      associated with DL, and the project manager must ensure that all
                      of these factors are reflected in project planning documentation.
                      This section describes those peculiar aspects of DL that must be
                      considered when planning the project and allocating resources. It
                      also addresses the metrics associated with assessing the
                      effectiveness of the DL program and special issues associated
                      with the conversion of conventional training programs to DL
                      format.


What’s different      DL simply means that the student and instructor are separated.
                      Virtually any media can be employed for DL – correspondence
                      courses can use paper or computer-based training, an instructor
                      using IVT can employ videographs, videos, or audiotapes for
                      reinforcement, etc. The development of a DL training program
                      must be based on the selection of the media appropriate to the
                      instructional objectives and training environment. Chapters 5
                      through 9 details the special considerations associated with the
                      selection and use of the various instructional technologies.

                      When planning to implement a DL program, the development
                      team must be sensitized to the DL environment; learning
                      strategies appropriate to that environment must be incorporated
                      into the program. For example, the students must be allowed to
                      become comfortable with the delivery medium. The instructors
                      must learn to make the most of the instructional technologies – it
                      takes practice to talk to the camera and teach with little, if any,
                      immediate student feedback.

                      A solid understanding of the DL learning environment is a critical
                      component of the DL project manager’s tool kit.

                       presentation requires new instructional strategies and additional
                       preparation time. The planning phase of DL project management
                       must be used to identify and define all obvious and hidden costs
                       and resource requirements. The project manager should be
                       versed in instructional technology options and their use in the DL
                       environment.

Meeting students’      In order to enhance the effectiveness of a DL program, it is
needs                  important to understand the challenges students face in the DL
                       environment. Mechanisms for interactivity can be built into the
                       training program to facilitate student receptiveness to learning –
                       this will result in increased training effectiveness. The program
                       manager must be sensitive to the need to budget time for
                       ensuring that student considerations are adequately incorporated
                       into the training program.

                       To function effectively, students must become comfortable with
                       the nature of teaching and learning at a distance. The selected
                       delivery system should be the one that will best motivate and
                       meet the needs of the students, in terms of both content and
                       preferred learning styles.

                       When planning the DL training program, a process must be
                       established to help students resolve the technical problems that
                       will arise. The process should reflect a focus on joint problem
                       solving, not placing blame for the occasional technical difficulty.
                       Time and resources must be allocated for developing these
                       student-interface processes.

Meeting                 Some media require live instructors. Factoring the needs of the
instructors’ needs      instructors into the IT program also has implications for the
                        planning, design, development, and implementation of DL
                        instruction. For the most part, effective distance teaching
                        requires the enhancement of existing skills rather than developing
                        new abilities. However, there are some considerations that will
                        help make the instructors more effective as described in Table
                        12.

Improving            Using effective interaction and feedback strategies will enable the
interaction and      instructor to identify and meet individual student needs and
feedback             provide a forum for suggesting course improvements. When
                     planning and budgeting for the evaluation program, the program
                     manager should be aware of the expanded role that feedback
                     plays in the DL environment – it not only provides information to
                     the course developers but can also provide a means for the
                     student to remain “connected” to the learning situation.

                     Suggested techniques for facilitating student involvement in the
                     learning process are listed below. These techniques do not apply
                     to all situations. The appropriate feedback mechanisms for a
                     given instructional program will be defined during the analysis
                     and design phases.

                     Early Interactions
                         Use pre-class study questions and advance organizers to
                         encourage critical thinking and informed participation on the
                         part of all learners. Realize that it will take time to improve
                         poor communication patterns.
                         Early in the course, require students to contact the instructor
                         and interact among themselves via electronic mail, so they
                         become comfortable with the process. Maintaining and
                         sharing electronic journal entries can be very effective toward
                         this end.
                         Arrange telephone office hours using a toll-free number. Set
                         evening office hours if most of the students work during the
                         day or are distributed widely over several time zones.
                         Integrate a variety of delivery systems for interaction and
                         feedback, including one-on-one and conference calls, fax, E-
                         mail, video, and computer conferencing.

                     During Learning
                        Contact each site (or student) every week if possible,
                        especially early in the course.
                        Use pre-stamped and addressed postcards, out-of-class
                        phone conferences, and e-mail for feedback regarding course
                        content, relevancy, pace, delivery problems, and instructional
                        concerns.

                                                                   Continued on next page

feedback                 progress and other concerns. Have students submit journal
(Continued)              entries frequently.
                         Use an on-site facilitator to stimulate interaction when distant
                         students are hesitant to ask questions or participate. In
                         addition, the facilitator can act as your on-site "eyes and
                         ears".
                         Call on individual students to ensure that all participants have
                         ample opportunity to interact. At the same time, politely but
                         firmly discourage individual students or sites from
                         monopolizing class time.
                         Make detailed comments on written assignments, referring to
                         additional sources for supplementary information. Return
                         assignments without delay, using fax or electronic mail, if
                         practical.

Coordination              Before initiating and fielding a DL project, be sure to
requirements for          coordinate with all appropriate organizations and agencies.
DL projects
                          Senior headquarters and MAJCOM must approve the project
                          and provide funding, manpower, and other support if needed.

                          The Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning
                          Distance Learning Office (AFIADL) will ensure there is no
                          negative impact on infrastructure. AFIADLO should know
                          project requirements as soon as possible to help size the
                          infrastructure and fund infrastructure expansion if necessary.

                          Notify field level personnel and DL site managers in plenty of
                          time so they can schedule facilities and staff, and be
                          prepared to facilitate the new course.

                          Notify the National Guard and Reserve Command so that
                          they can take advantage of expanded instructional
                          opportunities for their members.

                          Notify other services that may want to participate in a joint
                          project.

                          Notify the ATN Program Manager if the new course will be
                          delivered using ATN.

                          Coordinate with the AFIADL Extension Course Institute if the
                          new course will be distributed through that organization.

                          Coordinate with Testing Centers as appropriate to help with
                          proctored testing.

              Standard Distance Learning Course Conversion Process


Purpose               The purpose of the Standard Course Conversion Process is to
                      ensure each schoolhouse follows standard procedures based on
                      the principles of Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and best
                      practices when converting resident courses to DL. A project
                      manager who employs the Instructional Technology Development
                      Process and the Project Management Process for DL defined in
                      this chapter will be following the basic process. The following
                      additional techniques and guidelines apply to the unique
                      considerations associated with converting training materials to a
                      DL presentation format.


Assumptions for       There are several important assumptions to bear in mind when
converting resident   considering conversion of a resident course to DL:
courses to DL
                          It is assumed that a course and an approved curriculum
                          already exist in resident format. ISD has been applied
                          previously. Course documentation is available for review.
                          Not all courses are good candidates for DL. A curriculum
                          analysis and media feasibility analysis must be performed.
                          The main reason to convert a course to DL is to make quality
                          education and training opportunities available to learners in
                          the most cost-effective manner.
                          A comparative cost analysis using standard procedures and
                          formulas will indicate the expected ROI for course
                          conversions. This will indicate whether or not a conversion
                          project is cost-effective in the long term.
                          It is possible to use DL to shorten the length of a resident
                          school by using DL for portions of the course. Instruction
                          may be delivered in a DL format as a prerequisite or as
                          follow-on to a resident course.
                          DL project management is essentially the same as that used
                          for IT development and should be coordinated and monitored
                          by the appropriate instructional systems design professional
                          acting as the project manager
                          All of the warnings and techniques associated with DL project
                          development must be considered during the conversion
                          process. These were identified earlier in this section. The
                          course must be converted to the DL environment, not just
                          reformatted for application of other media.

                                                                   Continued on next page

Assumptions for         The curriculum will be redesigned and configured to take
converting resident     advantage of IT. Think about the course in different ways
courses to DL           and organize objectives into modules if possible. As
(Continued)             curriculum is redesigned for life-long learning and in support
                        of ADL, this will be necessary.
                        Use a mix or combination of media, if necessary, to deliver a
                        course in DL.
                        To form modules, prioritize and cluster and sequence
                        objectives based on the types of learning, levels of learning –
                        knowledge, skills, and attitudes – and the required levels of
                        interactivity.
                        Validate instructional technology selection. Ensure selected
                        media can support required levels of learning and levels of
                        interactivity and that the technical and support infrastructure
                        is robust enough for your project.

                                Section A
                             Traditional Media

Introduction      The next paragraphs explain the definition and description of the
                  following traditional media:

                  Print
                  Slides
                  Audiotape
                  Videotape
                  Audioconferencing
                  Television and cable
                  Models and mock-ups


Print             Definition: Print media consists of paper-based text and
                  graphics materials.

                  Description: Print materials include documents such as books,
                  manuals, syllabi, training guides, brochures, programmed text,
                  photographic prints, and photocopies. These documents usually
                  contain text, diagrams, pictures, or line drawings. These
                  materials may stand-alone or serve as ancillary material that
                  accompanies other instructional media.


Slides            Definition: Slides are static photographic images of text and/or
                  graphics that can be displayed by means of a slide projector or
                  integrated into a computer-based program.

                  Description: Slides are usually used in combination with other
                  media, such as self-study guides and/or audiotapes, or are used
                  to support instructor-led training. When integrated into a
                  computer-based program, photographic or graphic images can be
                  used to support training concepts.


Audiotape         Definition: Audiotape consists of sounds that are recorded on
                  electronically readable tape using a digital or analog mode.

                  Description: The most common type of audiotape used for
                  instruction is the audiocassette tape that can provide up to 120
                  minutes of audio recording. Workbooks or readings are usually
                  used to complement audio materials.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       83




Videotape           Definition: Videotape is a magnetic tape that can record and
                    play back audio and video. It can also hold electrical signals
                    used in editing and in interactive video applications.

                    Description: The most common type of videotape used in the
                    classroom is the one-half inch, Video Home System (VHS)
                    videocassette tape. The standard T-120 VHS tape can provide
                    up to two 2 hours of recording in the standard play (SP) mode,
                    four 4 hours in the long play (LP) mode, or six 6 hours in the
                    extended play (EP) mode. Study guides are usually used to
                    support video-based training.


Audioconferencing   Definition: An audioconference is simply a meeting where
                    people are connected by audio, such as the telephone.
                    Audioconferencing is a structured audioconference used for
                    instruction with specific learning outcomes. When media
                    supports audioconferencing, it is called audiographics
                    conferencing.

                    Description: Interactive audioconferencing can be as simple as
                    an interview between the instructor and learner, or as complex as
                    a panel discussion with many sites and learners. Participants in
                    a typical conference call use a speakerphone connected through
                    an audiobridging system, which allows for multiple callers.
                    Depending upon the system used to make the connection, up to
                    240 sites can be connected simultaneously. Audio media in use
                    today include the radio and real audio over the Web.


Television and      Definition: In the context of training, television is a device used
cable               to present audio and visual instructional information to students at
                    remote sites. The use of cable television expands the number of
                    channels available for training instruction.

                    Description: Instructional television is used as a vehicle for
                    distance learning and in support of resident instruction. It may be
                    used as a synchronous medium used to present programmed
                    instruction at specific times. However, through the use of
                    videotape recorders, programmed instruction can be videotaped
                    and viewed in an asynchronous mode.

Models and       Definition: 3-D devices that replicate some component (or the
mock-ups         entirety) of the system being studied to increase realism and
                 provide students with an opportunity to study specific aspects of
                 the system and/or perform related operation/maintenance tasks.

                 Description: Models and mock-ups can range from a plastic
                 cross-section of the human skull, to support medical training
                 instruction to a cutaway of a diesel engine. Their complexity
                 depends on the nature and criticality of the training tasks
                 supported. They are often used when it is impractical to make an
                 entire system available for training instruction or when only a
                 portion of the system is the subject of training instruction.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5      1 November 2002                                          85



                              Section B
                   Computer-Mediated Communications

Introduction        The next paragraphs explain the definition and description of the
                    following computer-mediated communications:

                    Audiographics
                    Computer-mediated conferencing / collaborative computing


Audiographics       Definition: Audiographics is a term that has typically been used
                    to describe two-way computer data and two-way audio
                    communications using computer and telephone networks.
                    Description: Audiographics combines audioconferencing with
                    computer data presentation capabilities, supporting both voice
                    and data transmissions to participating sites. The computer is
                    used for distributing and sharing data such as text and graphics.
                    The instructor normally has the communications lines open for an
                    audio conference, while transmitting on-screen presentations to
                    all student monitors.


Computer-           Definition: Computer-mediated conferencing (also referred to as
mediated            collaborative computing) is essentially a text-based computer
conferencing /      conferencing system with limited graphics capabilities depending
collaborative       upon the amount of available bandwidth and the processing
computing           power of each participant computer.

                    Description: Asynchronous computer-mediated conferencing
                    provides instructor-student and student-student discussions and
                    interaction using e-mail and bulletin board systems. The
                    computer provides the primary means for exchanging messages
                    and dialogue, and for accessing information.

                    Real-time, or synchronous, computer-mediated conferencing is
                    rapidly evolving due to multimedia teleconferencing standards.
                    These standards address Real-Time Data Conferencing (T.120),
                    ISDN Videoconferencing (CH. 320), Audiovisual communication
                    over LANs (H. 323) and High Quality Video and Audio over
                    telephone modem connections (H. 324). T.120 allows for sharing
                    of applications, data, and voice over single line

                                                                  Continued on next page

                                   Section C
                       Interactive Multimedia Instruction

Definition            Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) is a term applied to a
                      group of predominantly interactive, electronically delivered
                      training instruction and training instruction-support products.


Description           Text, audio, video, and graphics are commonly used in IMI
                      products and other digital electronic products used in the delivery
                      of instruction. IMI can be presented as a stand-alone, self-paced
                      program, an instructor-led presentation, or a program to support
                      on-the-job training or personal performance enhancement.


Interactive           Definition: ICW is computer-controlled courseware that relies on
Courseware (ICW)      student input to determine the pace, sequence, and content of
                      training delivery. ICW is also referred to as Computer-Based
                      Instruction (CBI) and Computer-Based Training (CBT).

                      Description: ICW can link and present a combination of media
                      including, but not limited to, programmed instruction, videotapes,
                      slides, film, text, graphics, digital audio, animation, and full-motion
                      video to enhance the learning process.


Intelligent           Definition: ICAI is a type of ICW that includes an intelligent tutor
Computer Assisted     that provides an interactive learning environment, diagnoses
Instruction (ICAI)    student errors, and individualizes instruction based on student
                      responses.

                      Description: ICAI, sometimes referred to as Intelligent Tutoring
                      Systems (ITS), incorporates expert knowledge into an
                      instructional model designed to emulate the behavior of an
                      experienced teacher. ICAI systems can present challenging
                      scenarios, monitor and evaluate student actions, provide
                      feedback in response to student actions, respond to requests for
                      information, provide hints, and tailor the training program based
                      on a student’s demonstrated strengths and weaknesses. Some
                      development systems (XAIDA) are also considered under the
                      ICAI umbrella.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5       1 November 2002                                          88




Electronic           Definition: An EPSS or JPA is an integrated, on-demand,
Performance          processor-based performance aid that enables the user to gain
Support System       rapid on-line access to large amounts of information about a
(EPSS) /Job          specific task area. EPSSs are frequently employed to provide
Performance Aid
                     on-line assistance to individuals so they can perform their job
(JPA)
                     tasks with minimal support and intervention by others. An on-line
                     help system for a word processing system is an example of an
                     EPSS.

                     Description: EPSSs can be used to support training instruction
                     or actual task performance. On-the-job, they provide immediate
                     access to integrated information and expert consultation. A
                     maintenance technician, for example, might use an EPSS/JPA to
                     help troubleshoot a system problem, either as part of or after
                     completing formal training instruction. As life-long learning gains
                     acceptance, EPSS will play an increasingly important role.

                     EPSSs are also known as Interactive Performance Systems
                     (IPS), Performance Support Systems (PSS), Performance
                     Support Tools (PST), and On-line Help Systems.


Computer             Definition: Computer simulation is an artificially generated
simulation           representation of reality that provides an interactive educational
                     or training experience. It is typically based on the actual job
                     environment. It allows the learner to practice procedures and
                     solve problems in life-like situations. War-gaming simulation to
                     teach combat decision-making is an example of this instructional
                     approach.

                     Description: Simulations are effective when teaching hazardous
                     tasks and decision-making skills or when costs of hands-on-
                     training are prohibited. Computer simulations allow learners to
                     try alternative solutions to a problem without worrying about
                     physical consequences. Computer simulations vary widely in
                     sophistication; they can be presented as games, as on-line
                     replications of real job situations, or as full-motion, video-
                     enhanced trainers (e.g., flight simulators).

Overview                IVT consists of:
                        Interactive Television (ITV) (one-way video; 2-way audio)
                        Video Teleconferencing (VTC) (2-way video; 2-way audio)

                        Two types of IVT video imagery can be delivered to students at
                        the local sites:
                        Pre-produced moving images with audio (e.g., film and
                        videotape)
                        Real-time moving images combined with audio conferencing


Interactive Video       Definition: IVT provides for one- or two-way video, and two-way
Teletraining (IVT)      audio telecommunications between the instructor and students
                        over broadcast television networks (satellite and/or terrestrial)
                        and telephone networks. It comprises both Interactive Television
                        and Video teleconferencing.


Interactive             Definition: IVT technology that employs one-way video with two-
Television (ITV)        way audio communications is called Interactive Television or ITV.
                        ITV is known commercially as Business Television.

                        Description: ITV provides one-way, site-to-site or site-to-
                        multiple site transmission of audio and video instruction from a
                        studio or broadcast classroom. This is done via an uplink to ITV
                        classrooms at downlink receive sites equipped with television
                        monitors and student response units. The audioconferencing
                        units provide audio feedback via telephone networks.

Video                 Definition: IVT technology that employs two-way video and
Teleconferencing      audio communications and is called Video Teleconferencing or
(VTC)                 VTC. VTC is also referred to as video teletraining (VTT) and
                      videoconferencing.

                      Description: VTC provides two-way site-to-site or site-to-
                      multiple site video and audio instruction, simultaneously
                      transmitted over the satellite television network from the
                      studio/VTC classrooms. Typically, a VTC classroom is equipped
                      with two monitors that can selectively display the individual
                      speaking, other sites, or supporting graphics, etc., as desired.

Introduction          Table 14 identifies the current status of IVT networks.
                      Throughout the DoD, several satellite network systems can be
                      used to support IVT instruction. Following are descriptions of the
                      existing DoD IVT networks.

     Network                                       Description
                      ATN is a satellite-based delivery system that supports one-way
Air Technology        video and two-way audio communications.
Network (ATN)             There are four active duty uplink facilities and 72 downlink
                          facilities at Air Force bases throughout the United States. A
                          fifth studio is planned for Randolph Air Force Base.
                          When it becomes cost-effective, bases in the Pacific will be
                          connected to ATN.
                      The Air National Guard (ANG) uses the Warrior Network satellite
ANG Warrior           delivery ITV system to provide part of the required Enlisted
Network               Professional Military Education (EPME) course of instruction.
                      The Warrior Network:
                          Has 3 broadcast studios and 208 downlink sites throughout
                          the United States.
                          Uses the same satellite system as SEN and ATN, and is
                          completely compatible.
                      The US Army SEN network matches the US Air Force ITV
Satellite Education   network and uses the same satellite.
Network (SEN)             SEN uses four broadcast sites at Fort Lee, VA, and has 79
                          downlink sites.
                          SEN is completely interoperable with the ATN network.
                      The US Army Training and Doctrine Command’s (TRADOC) T-
T-Net                 Net is a terrestrial-based, near full-motion, two-way video and
                      two-way audio teleconferencing system.
                          T-Net is used to reach 118 Army sites, as well as 47 Air
                          Force Reserve (AFRC) downlink sites throughout the country.
                          T-Net operates from a different satellite system than the ATN.
                          ATN can connect to and transmit over T-Net using special
                          arrangements through SEN.
                          The Total Army Distance Learning Program includes a plan
                          to expand network capability to over 500 sites.

                                                                    Continued on next page

                          Internet-Based Instruction

Overview          Definition: Internet-Based Instruction (IBI) is instruction that
                  makes use of internet technologies and provides a platform for
                  the integration and distribution of multimedia instructional
                  components.

                  Description: IBI is the term used to encompass a full range of
                  instruction and data provided over the Internet/WWW – from
                  simple text-based files and applications, to interactive multimedia
                  instruction and virtual conferencing. IBI consists of digital text,
                  audio, video, and graphics, and makes use of Internet
                  technologies such as:
                      Usenet and listserv
                      File Transfer Protocol
                      E-mail
                      Threaded discussion
                      Chat room
                      Bulletin board
                      TCP/IP browsers
                      Browser plug-ins
                      HTML
                      Virtual shared white boards

                  IBI provides a platform that allows for the integration and
                  distribution of multimedia instructional components.


Types of IBI      There are three general types of IBI:
instruction
                  Text. This is the basic type of IBI, which consists primarily of
                  text-based files and tutorial instruction (with limited graphics).
                  Most text instruction is asynchronous (not real-time) and ancillary
                  to other modes of instruction. Text-based IBI can be effective for
                  dissemination of information and research applications.

                  Multimedia. This type of IBI is similar to ICW in that it is generally
                  self-paced (allowing for student control and pacing), interactive,
                  and uses multimedia for presentation of the instructional material
                  on a PC. However, unlike stand-alone

                                                                  Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        94




Types of IBI         ICW, multimedia IBI uses the Internet/WWW to deliver the
instruction          instruction on-line and IBI incorporates the uses of graphical
(Continued)          browsers such as Netscape Navigator™ and Microsoft
                     Explorer™. These browsers provide a friendly familiar user
                     interface when used with multimedia instructional materials.

                         Multimedia IBI. This type of IBI is similar to ICW in that it is
                         generally self-paced (allowing for student control and pacing),
                         interactive, and uses multimedia for presentation of the
                         instructional material on a PC. However, unlike stand-alone
                         ICW, multimedia IBI uses the Internet/WWW to deliver the
                         instruction on-line.

                     Virtual conferencing. Virtual conferencing, also referred to as
                     collaborative conferencing, is a term that applies to the
                     application and integration of all synchronous and asynchronous
                     “chat” modes for instructional purposes. It may be integrated with
                     other instructional and support IBI technologies into a multiple
                     media, virtual “classroom” environment.


Delivery of IBI      IBI is delivered via the Internet/WWW and can be accessed using
                     web browsers and bundled plug-ins controls. IBI also uses
                     transport protocols and provides hypertext links to WWW pages
                     and files. IBI uses the source language for WWW “pages”:
                     Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) (a special formatting
                     language that tells the web browser how to display the delivered
                     content), which is the source language for WWW “pages”. HTML
                     is a special formatting language that tells the web browser how to
                     display the delivered content.


Transport            Below are some of the key standard protocols for IBI that allow
protocols            different computers to communicate with each other include:

                         TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a
                         network protocol designed for alphanumeric data
                         transmission.
                         UDP (Universal Data Packet) protocol sacrifices lost data in
                         favor of maintaining a continuous flow. UDP can dynamically
                         adjust data output to the client’s minute-to-minute reception
                         bandwidth.

                                                                    Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235    Volume 5        1 November 2002                                            95




Transport              FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to access
protocols              and download files that are stored on a remote computer.
(Continued)            HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) is a client/server-based
                       protocol used to create hypertext links in WWW documents; a
                       necessity for any document display on the Web.
                       SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used by
                       Internet mail programs that allows the client to talk to the
                       server and exchange messages.


WWW technologies   Some of the key WWW technologies that are employed for IBI
                   include:

                   Digital video and audio files. Audio and video images are
                   converted to a digital file format or real-time streaming format that
                   can be stored, copied, transmitted, or broadcast over the
                   Internet/WWW. Digital video and audio can be played back on a
                   computer.

                   Coder/Decoder (Codec). An encoding process that compresses
                   data into a file that requires only 1/2 to 1/200 of the original
                   storage space. Compression minimizes the space a computer
                   needs to represent the data in a file, and allows files to be stored
                   and transmitted more efficiently.

                   Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). VMRL has become
                   the standard format for distributing 3-dimensional images over
                   the Internet/WWW. It is a text-based language used by
                   developers to implement interactive 3D graphics/objects and
                   multimedia content. The international standard is VRML 2.0 is an
                   international standard.


Emerging           XML. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a much more
standards          powerful language than HTML, but will be able to work with it.
                   For DoD and the Air Force, it will become important for entering
                   metadata into HTML-based documents. This will make it
                   possible to quickly find precisely what you are searching for and
                   will also be essential for automating the management of course
                   and student data.

                                                                   Continued on next page

Emerging          DHTML. Dynamic HTML is not so much a language as it is a
standards         combination of Java Script, Cascading Style Sheets, and
(Continued)       distributed object model (DOM). It will allow the manipulation of
                  text and objects on the Web page after it is displayed. Microsoft
                  and Netscape are not entirely compatible in how they support
                  DHTML. However, there are sites on the Internet that offer
                  guidance and tips on developing pages that will display correctly
                  in both of these browsers.

                  Java. Java is a programming language that allows the creation of
                  small, independent applications (applets) that can perform
                  operations on the server or on the client machine. With Java on
                  the client's machine, it is possible to create interactive web
                  pages, and to provide the user with applications to the user that
                  are not his/heron the client's machine. There are ongoing
                  security issues with Java, but these may eventually be overcome.

                  Java Script. Java Script is not the same as the Java language. It
                  does, but will allow you to perform operations to create interactive
                  web pages like you can with as with Java, as well as perform

CMI Type:              ADL is a DoD initiative to promote widespread collaboration,
Advanced               exploit Internet technologies, develop next generation learning
Distributed            technologies and create reusable content, and lower costs, with
Learning (ADL) and     object-based tools. ADL will rely on an Instructional Management
instructional          System (IMS) to tag and manage the learning objects produced
management
                       as a result of ADL. One of the goals is to develop an automated
system project
                       management system that will perform CMI functions by keying on
                       the IMS indexing.

                       IMS is a non-proprietary, Internet-based Instructional
                       Management System that provides the means to customize and
                       manage the instructional process and to integrate content from
                       multiple publishers in distributed or virtual learning environments.

                       The IMS Project is developing and promoting open specifications
                       for facilitating on-line activities such as locating and using
                       educational content, tracking learner progress, reporting learner
                       performance, and exchanging student records between
                       administrative systems. These specifications will increase the
                       range of distributed learning opportunities and they will promote
                       the creativity and productivity of both teachers and learners in this
                       new environment.

                                       Overview


Purpose              This chapter presents a standard set of criteria that can be
                     applied to any instructional medium to evaluate the relative
                     effectiveness of the medium. It then applies the criteria to each
                     instructional medium presented to determine the advantages and
                     disadvantages resulting from its use. The chapter concludes with
                     a presentation of a process for selecting instructional media when
                     migrating existing resident instruction to an instructional
                     technology or distance learning format.

Potential                 Each medium is examined in terms of its potential applications –
applications              when it is most appropriate to use the given medium to support
                          instruction. In those cases where there are conditions under
                          which the given media would not be effective, the conditions are
                          noted.


Cost/benefit              Cost/benefit analysis is being used with increasing frequency to
considerations            help define whether a proposed approach to instruction is worth
                          the projected costs. Later in this chapter, the user will find
                          detailed discussion on cost models and processes. In this
                          section, the relative costs and benefits of each medium are
                          discussed. In addition, the estimated compression rate and
                          development ratios are identified. The areas covered are
                          compression rate and development hours.


Compression rate          Presented as a percentage, the compression rate is the figure
                          used to estimate the number of hours of instruction required to
                          conduct an existing resident course if converted to the given
                          technology.

                          For example – The estimated compression rate for courses
                          converted to ICW is 35%. That is, the course duration for a
                          resident course would be reduced by 35% if converted to ICW. If
                          you are converting a 40-hour resident course to ICW, you would
                          use the following formula to compute instructional hours:

                                  40 hrs. resident instruction x 35% compression rate =
                                                    14 hours reduction
                                            40 hrs. – 14 hrs. = 26 hrs. ICW

                          Thus, you can expect to accomplish a 40-hour traditional course
                          in 26 hours of instruction if the course is converted to ICW format.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        105




Development            Presented as three ratios indicating the number of man- hours
hours                  per hour of instruction for an IT program of low/moderate/high
                       complexity.

                       For example – The factors for ICW are estimated at 50/265/700
                       man-hours of development per hour of compressed instruction.
                       Therefore, if a 26-hour course of low complexity is being
                       developed, you would use the following formula to calculate
                       development hours:

                                     26 hours compressed instruction x
                                50 hours development per hour of instruction =
                                    1,300 man-hours of development time

                       If it is a complex course, it may take an estimated 18,200 hours
                       for development.


Cost/benefit           The compression rates and development hours are estimates
considerations         only—they are based on Air Force and industry experience. The
                       development times are based on the time it takes education and
A word of caution      training personnel—the IT development team—to complete the
                       ISD process and field new instruction. It does not take into
                       account the task analysis process that is conducted by a career
                       field nor does it take into account the ongoing operational
                       evaluation or life cycle management of a course of instruction.
                       The development times do not account for man-hours provided at
                       remote sites in support of DL programs.

                       The low-end estimates assume a best case scenario with a
                       simple topic and experienced personnel with good knowledge of
                       content and tools. The high-end estimates imply that the topic is
                       abstract or complex and developers have limited knowledge of
                       the content and lack experience with development tools. The
                       middle number represents the most likely estimate based on Air
                       Force experience.

                       The more technically sophisticated the medium, the greater the
                       need for highly skilled instructional designers and technologists.
                       So it is not only the complexity of the course material that must
                       be accommodated, but also the availability of a skilled
                       development team.

                                                                      Continued on next page

                        Criteria Applied to Print Medium

Introduction          The following table applies the criteria to the use of print as the
                      primary instructional medium.

Potential               Consider using print when:
applications
                            The task to be taught follows a set procedure and steps are
                            easy to follow.
                            Written materials are required for later reference.
                            Self-study is an option.
                            Ease of use is crucial.
                            Equipment limitations exist.
                            Close supervision and interaction are either not required or
                            not available.
                            When dollars are limited.


Print cost/benefit      Considerations: Print materials are relatively inexpensive to
considerations          produce compared with other media such as satellite/computer-
                        based instruction. Cost considerations include:
                            Number of requirements (student/trainee throughput).
                            Student location and distribution requirements.
                            Complexity of the required instruction and format (color
                            graphics, drawings, diagrams, photographs, etc., will
                            generally consume more time and resources).
                            Projected content changes and revision requirements.

                        Compression rate: It is estimated that a distance learning print-
                        based course (e.g., a correspondence course) will reduce the
                        instructional time required to cover the same material in a
                        resident course by 25%.

                        Estimated development time: Use the following development
                        estimates (per hour of compressed instruction) (includes editing):

                          Criteria Applied to Videotapes

Introduction          Videotape-based training presents information to the student
                      through visual and auditory sensory channels. The more varied
                      the means of delivery, the more effective the communication.
                      Instructional video builds on the old cliché that “a picture is worth
                      a thousand words.” The following table applies the criteria to the
                      use of videotape as the primary instructional medium.

Potential           Consider using instructional videotapes when:
applications
                        Audio/visual presentations are important for clarity.
                        Visual realism is necessary to accomplish learning objectives.
                        Self-paced instruction or independent study is an option.
                        Content is stable (no changes for at least a year).
                        Interaction with or observation of performance by, an
                        instructor is not required.


Videotape           Video production can be expensive, time consuming, and
cost/benefit        technically demanding depending on how it will be produced (i.e.,
considerations      an in-house effort or professionally produced).

                          Criteria Applied to Audiotapes

Introduction          Audiotapes are used much like print, but instead of reading the
                      content, the student listens to it using a tape player. Audiotapes
                      can be used effectively for student learning, especially when
                      combined with other instructional media. The following table
                      applies the criteria to the use of audiotapes as the primary
                      instructional medium.

Potential            Consider using instructional audioconferencing when:
applications
                         Student feedback and remediation are required.
                         Site visits with subject matter experts cannot be arranged.
                         Short courses/Tutorial type lessons are used.
                         “Live” or synchronous communication is needed.
                         Interviews/group discussion is required.
                         Used in conjunction with other media.
                         Student-instructor and student-student interaction is required.

                     Audioconferencing is not appropriate for training tasks that
                     require development and/or application of psychomotor skills.

Limitations      There are relatively few drawbacks to using interactive
                 audioconferencing. Most can be addressed in the design
                 process. Limitations include the following:

                     Is synchronous. Forces learners to meet at a specific date
                     and time
                     No visual feedback. Can be a barrier for learners that
                     process information visually; also requires more
                     concentration
                     Can be impersonal. Can make some participants feel
                     isolated since they can’t see non non-verbal cues or body
                     language
                     Requires advance planning. Must be planned in advance
                     to provide any handouts; thus, difficult to establish a
                     conference on short notice
                     Limited number of students. While it can be connected to
                     hundreds, is more effective if size is limited to ensure there is
                     interaction
                     Potential equipment costs. Potential additional costs to
                     consider include devices that may be required for larger
                     groups, such as speakerphones, microphones, or response
                     units, and an audio bridge to interconnect multiple phone
                     lines and control noise.

                 Compression rate: It is estimated that a distance learning
                 audioconference-based course will reduce the instructional time
                 required to cover the same material in a resident course by 25%.

                 Estimated development time: Use the following development
                 estimates (per hour of compressed instruction) (includes
                 production):

Introduction         Audiographic conferencing combines computers and audio
                     communications. Usually, this involves the use of PCs (to
                     support computer-to-computer conferencing) and telephones so
                     that students can interact with the computer presentation while
                     consulting by telephone with the instructor, other students, and/or
                     experts. The following table applies the criteria to the use of

                    Computer-mediated conferencing also includes synchronous
                    communications conducted by means of computers. Pop-up mail
                    is a simple example of real-time (synchronous) computer
                    conferencing.

                    It is important to recognize that while computer-mediated
                    conferencing used to mean communication by written word,
                    technological advances and the use of collaborative technologies
                    have blurred the dividing line between computer-mediated
                    conferencing and other forms of electronic video and audio
                    conferencing, such as virtual conferencing.

Potential               Computer-mediated conferencing traces its history to more than
applications            20 years ago when it was first created for instruction. Since then,
                        its use has blossomed to hundreds of institutions using it for
                        continuing education, graduate courses and supplemental
                        programs. Computer-mediated conferencing is most effective in
                        the following situations:

                            Short courses.
                            Courses designed to promote higher order learning such as
                            analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
                            Group discussion is required – seminars and talks.
                            Courses requiring cooperative learning or group learning.
                            Courses requiring written products.
                            Ideal for course where learners are encouraged to share their
                            own personal experiences.

                    As part of an overall course of study, computer-mediated
                    conferencing may be used to establish a bulletin board which
                    could be accessed by students and others, whether
                    geographically separated or not. Correspondence with experts,
                    posting of web sites for research, and sharing of development
                    projects are facilitated through computer-mediated conferencing.

                         the Web.
                         Can be impersonal. Can make some participants feel
                         isolated since they cannot see non non-verbal cues or body

       Criteria Applied to Interactive Multimedia Instruction (ICW)

Overview             The Interactive Multimedia Instructional technologies addressed
                     in this section are: Interactive Courseware (ICW); Intelligent
                     Computer Assisted Instruction (ICAI); Electronic Performance
                     Support System (EPSS); Job Performance Aid (JPA); and
                     Computer Simulation.

                     The following table applies the criteria to the use of interactive
                     courseware (ICW) as the primary instructional medium. ICW is
                     usually employed as a self-paced, asynchronous form of
                     instruction. An ICW-based course may be distributed
                     electronically, by disk, or (as technology is improving) may be

                          Course content is relatively stable (no more than 25% change
                          per year).
                          Course content contains some affective and psychomotor
                          skills.
                          Self-paced instruction is an option.
                          Safety is a factor – ICW simulations offer a non-threatening,
                          safe practice environment.
                          Large numbers of widely dispersed students must be trained.

considerations        performance support system, a three-dimensional simulation, or a
                      linear presentation requires experienced instructional designers
                      and developers.

                      ICW development can be relatively costly if the computer
                      hardware, instructional networks, and support are not already in
                      place. However, the potential decrease in training time is 35%.

                      Compression rate: It is estimated that a distance learning ICW-
                      based course will reduce the instructional time required to cover
                      the same material in a resident course by 35%.

                      Estimated development time: Use the following development
                      estimates (per hour of compressed instruction):

                        Low Complexity       Moderate Complexity      High Complexity

                      actions and tailors the course of instruction accordingly. Because
                      of the analysis required to anticipate student responses and the
                      additional programming required to make the ICW “intelligent”
                      course content must be stable and courseware developers must

Potential                ICAI provides an excellent medium for instruction and
applications             performance measurement of:
                             Problem solving cognitive skills (the highest level of
                             knowledge).
                             Diagnostic and troubleshooting skills (Judgment and
                             Decision-Making Knowledge and Skills).

                         It is also excellent for remediation as feedback is immediate and,
                         depending on the sophistication of the system, the system will
                         automatically take the student through various approaches to a
                         given concept until student responses indicate that the student
                         has mastered it.


ICAI cost / benefit      ICAI systems have the potential to instruct, diagnose, evaluate,
considerations           and individualize instruction and remediation. However,
                         development is generally labor intensive and requires unique
                         skills/expertise.

                         Because of the expense involved in development of expert
                         systems, they are usually reserved for teaching high-risk
                         knowledge and decision-making skills. Such training may be an
                         appropriate and cost-effective way to prepare military personnel
                         for major military exercises, for example. ICAI is also used to
                         develop skills that cannot be practiced during field or laboratory
                         exercises (e.g., handling of nuclear material). In this case, the
                         cost/benefit analysis would have to examine what the cost will be
                         if the target population does not get this type of training.

                         Compression rate: It is estimated that a distance learning ICAI-
                         based course will reduce the instructional time required to cover
                         the same material in a resident course by 35%.

                         Estimated development time: It could take 2-4 years to
                         develop, test, and refine an expert instructional system. Use the
                         following development estimates as minimums (per hour of

                         minimal support and intervention by others; they are designed to
                         support performance of specific job skills. They may be
                         incorporated into formal training programs to help students learn
                         how to use them effectively on the job, but are most often
                         developed to support on-the-job skill development. EPSSs/JPAs
                         are typically single-purpose tools used during actual operations to

                          There is a need to reduce formal training time; effective

                  Criteria Applied to Computer Simulation

Overview            Computer simulation techniques allow the learner to practice
                    procedures and solve problems in a life-like, safe learning
                    environment. While these techniques can be employed using
                    print or other non-electronic media, this examination of the
                    technology assumes the use of computers as part of the
                    simulation process. The following table applies the criteria to the
                    use of computer simulation as the primary instructional medium.

                   to reduce the desired learning objectives to
                   algorithms that capture real-world events.
                   Software is complex and generally costly to
                   develop and test – significant prototyping and
                   testing of the instructional simulation program
                   are required.

                   less flexible since participants must start/interact
                   at the same time. Because simulation training is
                   normally accomplished in real-time, the student
                   has less control of the sequence and pacing of
                   the presentation.

Simulation          Simulation provides very effective instruction and training in
cost/benefit        complex skills that would otherwise require actual performance of
considerations      those skills in the operational environment. A significant cost
                    savings may be realized if simulation is used vice operational
                    equipment.

                    Cost varies significantly depending on the fidelity of the
                    simulation and the delivery equipment required (training device).
                    Since high (physical) fidelity simulation comes at a considerable
                    cost, it must be determined how closely the simulation needs to
                    duplicate the real performance tasks.

                    Development requires careful scripting; talent must often be hired
                    for the final narration.

                    Compression rate: It is estimated that a distance learning
                    simulation based course will reduce the instructional time
                    required to cover the same material in a resident course by 35%.

                    Estimated development time: Use the following development
                    estimates (per hour of compressed instruction):

                      Low Complexity       Moderate Complexity      High Complexity
                            250 hours              600 hours         1,000+ hours

           Criteria Applied to Interactive Video Teletraining (IVT)

Overview             Interactive Video Teletraining (IVT) comprises two technologies:
                     Interactive Television (ITV) and Video Teleconferencing (VTC).
                     The following table applies the criteria to the use of ITV as the
                     primary instructional medium. ITV provides one-way, site-to-site,
                     or site-to-multiple site, transmission of audio and video instruction
                     from a studio classroom to distance learning classrooms
                     equipped with television monitors and student response units.

     Criteria                        Application to ITV                   Effectiveness
Developmental      Requires advanced production planning,                        -
Effort             coordination, and development efforts. Requires
                   training for instructors.
Convenience of     Live lessons are scheduled only at specific times             +/-
Instruction        and because ITV broadcasts are accomplished
                   in real-time, the student has little control of the
                   timing, sequence, and pacing of the instruction.
                   Success is also contingent on a host of
                   technologies working without problems.
                   Transmission/reception problems can interfere
                   with flow of instruction. Has the advantage of
                   distance learning in that the student does not
                   have to travel to the training site whereat which
                   the training is being conducted.
Student Motivation Can provide a cost-effective means for                         +

                   instruction to large number of students at widely
                   dispersed locations. Allows instructors to
                   communicate visually and be seen by students
                   at remote locations.
Equipment/Support Requires special satellite uplink/downlink and                  +
Requirements       production equipment. Requires the availability
                   of studio facilities and student access to ITV
                   classrooms. Facilitator training and technical
                   support are required to ensure efficient and
                   effective operations.

                                                                     Continued on next page

              Criteria Applied to Video Teleconferencing (VTC)

Overview             Video Teleconferencing (VTC) provides two-way, site-to-site, or
                     site-to-multiple site video and audio instruction, simultaneously
                     transmitted over satellite or terrestrial lines. The following table
                     applies the criteria to the use of VTC as the primary instructional
                     medium.

     Criteria                       Application to VTC                     Effectiveness
Developmental      Requires more advanced planning, preparation,                  -
Effort             organization and coordination than ITV.
Convenience of     Live lessons are scheduled only at specific                   +/-
Instruction        times, and because VTC broadcasts are
                   accomplished in real-time, the student has little
                   control of the timing, sequence and pacing of the
                   instruction. Success is also contingent on even
                   more technologies working without problems.
                   Transmission/reception problems can interfere

Potential             Consider using IVT technologies when:
applications             Many iterations of the same course are planned and
                         projected travel costs for attendees are substantial.
                         There is an emergency training requirement to train a large
                         number of geographically separated people in a short period
                         of time.
                         A subject matter expert will conduct special or one-time
                         training instruction and attendees are geographically
                         separated – or subject matter expert cannot be physically
                         present.
                         ITV applications are suitable for large audiences when there
                         is no requirement for the instructor to observe student
                         performance.
                         VTC is suitable for applications involving a limited number of
                         sites or limited student enrollments.

IVT cost/benefit      Since VTC lessons increase satellite uplink/bandwidth
considerations        requirements, equipment, and support costs, the necessity of
                      two-way video communication for delivery of instruction and
                      accomplishment of learning objectives must be considered. Also,
                      scrambling of the IVT transmission will require additional
                      equipment, personnel, and increase costs.

                      The use of existing networks and facilities or the ability to lease
                      networks and facilities can drive the decision to use ITV instead
                      of VTC. Air Force users should leverage the existing ATN,
                      Warrior Network, and GEWTN infrastructure.

                      Compression rate: It is estimated that a distance learning IVT-
                      based course will reduce the instructional time required to cover
                      the same material in a resident course by 20-30%.

                      Estimated development time: Use the following development
                      estimates (per hour of compressed instruction) (excludes
                      rehearsals and broadcasts):

                      discussions and interactions. Life cycle instructor
                      requirements may be reduced by converting
                      course to text or multimedia format. Virtual
                      conferencing may increase instructor life cycle
                      requirements.

                                  Support Technology

Introduction            By definition, support technologies are used to support, or
                        augment, instructional programs. They may be integrated into
                        the instructional program or be used in conjunction with other
                        technologies as separate components of the instructional
                        program. In this section, each support technology is examined in
                        terms of its strengths and weaknesses when employed to support
                        the other technologies used as the primary means of delivering
                        training.


Electronic testing      The strengths and weaknesses of electronic testing are
                        summarized as follows:


Electronic testing      Electronic testing strengths include:
strengths                   Automates the testing process and eliminates the task of
                            manually tabulating, recording, and assessing the test
                            results.
                            Provides for random selection of test items and creation of
                            individualized tests.
                            When properly designed, developed, and employed,
                            electronic testing can instruct, as well as evaluate.
                            High level of student interaction with test content is possible.
                            Provides immediate feedback on student performance –
                            provides immediate test results.
                            Provides for electronic storage and retrieval of test data
                            which facilitates timely updates/revisions and better version
                            control.
                            Reduces future time and effort required to administer and
                            manage the testing.
                            Can be employed as standalone support tool or integrated
                            into a computer-based instructional program.


Electronic testing      Electronic testing weaknesses include:
weaknesses
                            Requires some planning and coordination to effectively
                            design, develop, and integrate electronic testing capabilities
                            into an instructional program.
                            Requires reliable and secure access to a properly configured
                            computer.

                                                                        Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235          Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        143




Electronic testing          Security is an issue. Verification is required to ensure that
weaknesses                  the individual taking the test is indeed the student. An
(Continued)                 instructor, facilitator, or proctor is usually required to verify
                            student identification and monitor the testing.
                            Formal testing is normally a structured activity requiring
                            students to participate at a specific time and location.
                            Some degree of computer literacy and training will normally
                            be required for instructors and students to ensure they can
                            effectively use of the instructional media for testing purposes.


CMI                     The strengths and weaknesses of computer-managed instruction
                        (CMI) are summarized as follows:


CMI strengths           CMI strengths include:
                           Reduces instructor time required for development and
                           management of class data.
                           Can provide timely feedback on student status and
                           performance (progress reports are easily produced).
                           Reduces time and effort required for student administration
                           and management.
                           Generally transparent to the student.
                           Usually embedded in ICW; no special development or
                           delivery equipment required.
                           Revision capability usually built into CMI software; updates
                           accomplished with relative ease.
                           Greatly facilitates data collection and management relative to
                           the instructional program (numbers of students trained,
                           location of trainees, attrition rates, etc.)


CMI weaknesses          CMI weaknesses include:
                           Requires some planning and coordination to design, develop,
                           and integrate CMI capabilities effectively into an instructional
                           program.
                           Requires development software (though usually embedded in
                           authoring systems) and skilled developers.
                           Some degree of computer literacy and training will normally
                           be required for instructors and students to access CMI data.
                           When used with other than ICW, separate equipment may be
                           required.

Electronic help      The strengths and weaknesses of the Electronic Help Desk are
desk                 summarized as follows:


Electronic help      Electronic help desk strengths include:
desk strengths
                         Provides quick response to student inquiries, increasing
                         sense of interaction.
                         If purely electronic, there is minimal cost once established.
                         Easy way to provide reference materials to students –
                         prevents having to e-mail materials to individuals; enables
                         students to answer their own questions.


Electronic help      Electronic help desk weaknesses include:
desk weaknesses
                         Mechanisms must be established to address all user
                         contacts, either through direct response or through referrals.
                         Help desks must be staffed with knowledgeable people; there
                         may be a requirement for extended hours to support students
                         of distance learning programs who are in different time zones
                         or who may be studying during non-business hours.
                         If student responses are not addressed in a timely manner,
                         student interest could be negatively affected.
                         Maintaining the help desk and ensuring help desk staff have
                         complete and accurate information requires planning and
                         coordination.
                         The student-to-help desk support personnel ratio must be
                         calculated realistically. Like instructors who are expected to
                         respond to hundreds of e-mails while teaching a regular
                         course load, help desk personnel can be inundated with
                         requests – the end result is poor quality service.
                         For purely electronic help desks, an effective search engine
                         may be required to facilitate student research on a help topic.


Electronic           The strengths and weaknesses of electronic publications,
publications         including interactive electronic technical manuals (IETMs), are
                     summarized as follows:
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5        1 November 2002                                      145




Electronic           Electronic publications strengths include:
publications
strengths                Enables the user to gain rapid access to large amounts of
                         information on demand during training or at the work site.
                         When properly designed, developed, and employed, IETMs
                         provide search capabilities that can instruct as well as
                         provide information.
                         Hypertext can be incorporated to facilitate linking to related
                         sections internal to the IETM, or, if employed on Internet-
                         capable system, to related websites on the Internet.
                         Reduces instructor/expert support requirements. Allows
                         users to access necessary information and perform tasks
                         with a minimum amount of external intervention or training.
                         High level of user interaction and branching with the IETM
                         support system content is possible.
                         Generally, user-friendly. Some training will normally be
                         required for instructors and students to ensure they can
                         effectively access and use the available information.
                         Can be employed separately (portable), or integrated into the
                         instructional system (can become an effective Job
                         Performance Aid).


Electronic           Electronic publications weaknesses include:
publications
weaknesses               The time, resources, and effort required to develop an IETM
                         vary depending on the complexity and content of the
                         application. Careful planning, coordination, and support will
                         be required to fully integrate IETM into an instructional
                         system.
                         Requires IETM delivery device/computer availability at each
                         work site/station for user access.
                         Revisions are usually costly; best used for stable designs. It
                         is feasible to accomplish minor database/technical
                         information updates in a relatively short period of time if
                         required.


Electronic support   The strengths and weaknesses of e-mail, electronic bulletin
                     boards (EBB), and fax conferencing are summarized as follows:
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        146




E-mail strengths      E-mail strengths include:

                          Facilitates individualized student-instructor communications
                          in a distance learning environment.
                          Can be used to communicate with students before they
                          attend a resident course of instruction (to lessen course time
                          spent on administrative matters).
                          User-friendly; requires minimal user training.


E-mail weaknesses     E-mail weaknesses include:

                          Can require a significant amount of instructor time if total
                          student population is large. Instructor support may be
                          required to handle communications in a timely manner.
                          E-mail is vulnerable to failure.


EBB strengths         EBB strengths include:

                          Facilitates announcements to all participants (e.g.,
                          assignments; conferencing times/locations; responses to
                          frequently asked questions).
                          Not time-dependent; users can access information at any
                          time.
                          After initial set-up, requires little preparation.
                          Minimal computer literacy required to access and employ
                          EBB.


EBB weaknesses        EBB weaknesses include:

                          Requires technical support for set-up and administration of
                          EBB (e.g., adding new users).
                          EBBs can be filled with junk mail; limits on posting access
                          rights may be required.
                          Security is an issue – unless encrypted, virtually anything
                          placed on the internet can be accessed by others.

Fax conferencing      Fax conferencing strengths include:
strengths
                          Facilitates transfer of technical data; useful when supporting
                          audio and/or video conferencing.
                          Equipment requirements are minimal.
                          User-friendly requires minimal user training.


Fax conferencing      Fax conferencing weaknesses include:
weaknesses
                          Faxing to multiple sites can interrupt flow of interactive
                          conferences.
                          Quality of faxed copy is highly variable.
                          Requires access to fax machine.


Voice mail            The strengths and weaknesses of voice mail are summarized as
                      follows:


Voice mail            Voice mail strengths include:
strengths
                          Minimal set-up and maintenance.
                          Provides inexpensive vehicle for asynchronous
                          communications between instructors and students in support
                          of DL or resident instruction.
                          User-friendly requires minimal user training.
                          Capable of screening and routing incoming student calls.


Voice mail            Voice mail weaknesses include:
weaknesses                Voice mail capacity may be limited; student frustration could
                          be a problem if prevented from leaving messages due to
                          capacity limits.
                          Like e-mail, voice mail can require a significant amount of
                          management on the part of the instructor or administrative
                          personnel if student population is large.
                          While voice messages can be archived, there is usually a
                          capacity limit – there is no communication trail to document
                          commitments/expectations or other decisions reached.
                          Computer-based voice mail requires special equipment and
                          software – not yet widely used.

                             Section C
              Curriculum Analysis and Media Feasibility

Overview         This section describes the steps for conducting a curriculum and
                 media feasibility analysis – the analytical process of identifying
                 and prioritizing media based on their capability to accomplish
                 instructional goals. The process incorporates several phases:

                     Review of learning objectives and levels of learning.
                     Identification of instructional modules that appropriately group
                     objectives into manageable chunks of instruction.
                     Assessment of the importance of instructional design
                     characteristics and strategies.
                     Comparative analysis of the capability of various media to
                     satisfactorily fulfill the instructional design characteristics.

                 The media feasibility analysis is designed for use by the IT
                 project manager/instructional designer with ultimate responsibility
                 for conducting a front-end analysis (FEA). It must be completed
                 in conjunction with the course manager or primary customer
                 capable of providing course and student data.
                 The purpose of this analysis, when combined with an initial
                 resource and infrastructure analysis and a comparative cost
                 analysis, is to identify viable, cost-effective technology options.


Background       The media feasibility process begins only after the needs
                 analysis, task analysis, and objectives and tests have been
                 accomplished. A needs assessment is completed by the
                 training/course manager, or in some cases by a career field
                 functional manager, to identify appropriate solutions to defined
                 problems. If the needs assessment identified a training problem
                 or an educational deficiency, then a task analysis (educational
                 elements refer to this as an instructional requirements analysis) is
                 performed to define the content of what should be taught. This
                 leads to defining specifically what a learner will do with the
                 content by clearly writing learning objectives and tests. At this
                 point, a media feasibility analysis should be performed.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 5      1 November 2002                                      150




Task analysis      The Task Analysis identifies the types of learning, i.e., the
                   Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA), that are required for a
                   new IT-based lesson. KSAs are the human performance factors
                   that are required to perform a job task:

                      Knowledge is what an individual needs to know before
                      performing a procedure under normal conditions. This is the
                      ability to recognize and state facts, rules, procedures,
                      discriminations, and problem solutions that are related to the
                      performance of normal procedures. Knowledge must be
                      retained in long-term memory (cognitively internalized) prior to
                      performance of job tasks (educational elements refer to this
                      as cognitive activities).
                      Skills are what an individual physically needs to be able to do
                      in performing a procedure under normal conditions. These
                      are the physical abilities or actions that are associated with
                      the performance of normal procedures (educational elements
                      refer to this as behavioral activities).
                      Attitudes are the Judgment and Decision-Making (JDM)
                      Knowledge and Skills that an individual needs to apply in
                      response to abnormal or emergency condition cues
                      encountered during the performance of normal procedures.
                      Attitudes encompass Situational Awareness Knowledge and
                      Resource Management Skills (countermeasures) for abnormal
                      and emergency conditions (educational elements refer to this
                      as affective activities).

                   The Learning Analysis defines the Levels of Learning for each
                   KSA identified during the Task Analysis process.

                       The KSA levels of learning represent a hierarchy of learning
                       behaviors from simple to complex.
                       With each level of learning, there are associated action verbs
                       that describe the learning behavior.
                       The associated action verb and the performance standard for
                       each KSA learning behavior are determined, and the KSA
                       learning objectives with learning conditions, behavior, and
                       performance standards are documented.
                       An outline of instruction is developed for each learning
                       objective, and the learning objectives are sequenced into
                       modules of instruction.

Curriculum and          The five steps involved with Curriculum and Learning Objective
learning objective      Analysis are:
analysis steps
                        Step 1: Identify a particular “piece of instruction” that you will
                        analyze. This piece of instruction may range from a section of a
                        course, to an entire course, to a group of related courses.

                        Step 2: Collect all related instructional documents and the
                        outline of instruction. Review the objectives to ensure they are
                        clearly written and describe a specific learning outcome.

                        Step 3: Identify each objective by KSA type based on the
                        behavioral action verb (MIL-PRF-29612 and supporting
                        handbooks; AFH 36-2235, Vol. 10).

                        Step 4: Determine the level of learning and the level of
                        interactivity for each KSA learning objective (MIL-PRF-29612 and
                        supporting handbooks; AFH 36-2235, Vol. 10).

                        Step 5: Review the instructional methodologies used to teach
                        each learning objective in the current course (AFH 36-2235, Vol.
                        10).


Identification of       Step 1: Organize the objectives into manageable modules or
instructional           chunks of instruction. Resequence the objectives if necessary.
modules steps           The following criteria may help you define a module:

                            Group by types of objectives – knowledge, skill, or attitude.
                            Group optional or supplemental content not required by all
                            students.
                            Group content that is self-contained and could be exported
                            independent of the rest of the course.
                            Group segments of instruction that are managed or taught by
                            different departments or whose personnel do not have full
                            knowledge of the requirements of the other blocks of
                            instruction.
                            Group rapidly changing content that will require frequent
                            updates.

                                                                       Continued on next page

                           Course materials are subject to frequent changes.
                           Guest speakers from outside the command are used.
                           External guest speakers are used.
                           Extensive student research is required.
                           Small student-to-instructor ratios are required.
                           Extensive student interaction with instructional materials is
                           required.
                           A long period of time is required to learn the objective.
                           Real-time, one-on-one instructor observation of the student is
                           required to ensure mastery of a skill objective.
                           Copyright restrictions.
                           Course materials are classified secret or higher.


Media feasibility      After defining the modules and determining the learning
steps                  objectives that are to be migrated to an instructional technology
                       format, perform the following media feasibility steps for each
                       module:

                       Step 1: Determine the Importance Factor for each of the
                       following instructional design characteristics that are required to
                       meet the learning objectives associated with a module. Ask:
                       “how important is it that the medium selected be able to
                       accommodate each characteristic.” Rate each characteristic on a
                       scale of 0 (least important) to 5 (most important):

                                                                     Continued on next page

Media feasibility      Step 4. Identify potential media. The media receiving the
steps (Continued)      highest Total Scores are potential tools for conversion of resident
                       instruction. This selection process is not a final decision for
                       migration of learning objectives to instructional technology, or for
                       selection of a particular type of media.

                           Review the data, and take a hard look at the characteristics
                           that were rated as a “4” or “5” Importance Factor. Ensure
                           that the characteristics merit a high Importance Factor.
                           Consider only those distances learning media with the
                           highest Total Scores that are capable of satisfying your
                           critical Importance Factor characteristics and learning
                           objectives.

                                  Section D
               Infrastructure and Resource Feasibility Analysis

Introduction            There are several very important questions that must be
                        answered before the decision is made to actually convert existing
                        courses, or course modules, to distance learning instruction, or
                        before the decision is made to insert technology into the resident
                        program. You must also look at infrastructure and resource
                        requirements.

                        This feasibility analysis is not intended to be a complete
                        instructional technology resource analysis. Additional detailed
                        information will be required for Front End Analysis (FEA). It will,
                        however, give decision-makers an estimate of the relative
                        magnitude of a project and whether or not conversion to
                        instructional technology or distance learning is “do-able” with
                        existing resources. If existing resources are not available, initiate
                        steps to fund and acquire them.


Infrastructure and      Consider the following:
resource issues
                        How critical is the conversion project to mission readiness?

                           Includes a review of the intended goals of the project and an
                           understanding of whether the project is being undertaken
                           because it is mission critical, (resources must be allocated) or
                           to save money (resources will be allocated only if return on
                           investment is favorable), for example.

                        What resources are required to deliver the instruction in its
                        current format and what are the current costs?

                           Consider all categories of resources to include instructor and
                           student personnel costs, and other direct and indirect costs.
                           The next section on cost analysis lists the primary resource
                           categories.

                        Is the technical infrastructure in place to support the
                        implementation of the project?

                                                                        Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235          Volume 5       1 November 2002                                         161




Infrastructure and         Determine if instructional systems are available for the
resource issues            development and delivery of IT courseware. Will students
(Continued)                have adequate access to the system? If it is feasible to use
                           more than one media for a project, select the one that has a
                           robust infrastructure already in place; or be prepared to fund
                           and perhaps build, the required architecture.

                        Is the organizational, administrative, and technical support
                        structure adequate to ensure successful implementation of the
                        project?

                           This is usually not a big problem if the project involves
                           technology insertion in the resident program but may be very
                           problematic in the DL environment. Includes everything from
                           a consideration of student registration procedures to DL site
                           personnel who will help facilitate the project in the field. (See
                           section D, Chapter 2).

                        Is manpower available and trained to perform all ISD functions

                            Comparative Cost Analysis

Overview              Before making a final selection of instructional media, it is
                      important to determine if the potential benefits accrued by
                      distance learning or technology insertion outweigh the potential
                      costs, or whether the instruction will be cost-effective and provide
                      an acceptable Return On Investment (ROI).

                      The purpose of a cost analysis is to provide the necessary
                      information to facilitate and improve the evaluation and decision-
                      making processes. Therefore, it is important that an accurate
                      and comprehensive analysis of cost/benefit data be
                      accomplished. This section provides:

                          An overview of the concepts involved in cost analysis.
                          The typical cost and benefit factors considered in the
                          analysis.

                          appropriate cost model.

                      There are automated cost analysis tools available that can be
                      used to assist decision-makers. Refer to the AFIADLO Web site
                      (http://www.maxwell.af.mil/afiadl/ http://www.au.af.mil/afdlo) for
                      the most current cost analysis information and references.


Basic cost analysis   The focus of the cost analysis and the basic approach taken will
approaches            depend on what you intend to assess. If you are assessing
                      whether training is working, or if training solves a problem, then
                      you must assess the outcomes. If you are assessing how to
                      reduce training costs, or the most efficient way to conduct
                      training, then you must assess elements other than outcomes.
                      The two general types of cost analyses are:

                          Cost/benefit analysis. Cost/benefit analysis is used when
                          decision-makers need to understand the full impact of an
                          alternative, not only the financial costs of the alternative, but
                          also qualitative costs and benefits. This approach to
                          decision-making is used when the objective is to select that
                          instructional alternative which presents the “best value” – and
                          this may result in the selection of other than the lowest cost

                                                                      Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5         1 November 2002                                         164




Basic cost analysis      alternative. When comparing alternative approaches to
approaches               training, a cost/benefit analysis is often performed for each
(Continued)              alternative and then the results are compared.

                         Cost-effectiveness analysis. This analysis is used when
                         cost is the major decision factor. Compares the costs of two
                         or more instructional alternatives to determine whether the
                         selected medium can reduce costs, or is the most efficient
                         method of instruction. For instance, does a move to
                         interactive media training save time and money?


Cost modeling         Effective cost analysis relies on the implementation of carefully
definition            constructed financial models of training. A model defines:

                          The variables involved in calculating the cost of training.
                          The relationship of those variables to one another.
                          The assumptions being made.

                      Variables might include labor, materials, equipment, facilities, and
                      travel expenses.

                      A model places the variables in an equation to represent training
                      costs. For example:

                      TC = L + M + E + F + T

                      Where (TC) training costs are the sum of the (L) labor, (M)
                      materials, (E) equipment, (F) facilities, and (T) travel.

                      A model dictates what data is to be collected. That is, it
                      determines what costs are to be measured.


Cost factors          A valid cost analysis must be complete. All costs involved in all
                      aspects of design, development, evaluation, and implementation
                      of the training must be included. Both the one-time “start-up”
                      costs and recurring operational costs need to be considered in
                      the analysis. Thus, the first step in conducting any type of cost
                      analysis is to identify all the costs that must be defined (figuring

                                                                      Continued on next page

Cost factors      out the actual costs for each cost category comes next). When
(Continued)       determining the cost categories, remember that these costs will
                  have to be defined for each alternative being analyzed. The
                  typical cost factors include:

                     Hardware and Software Costs: computer systems,
                     production equipment, training equipment, programming and
                     application software, etc.

                     Network/Telecommunications Costs: telecommunications
                     costs/fees as applicable to include access/user costs for
                     satellite and terrestrial networks.

                     Instructional Material Costs: purchase, production, and
                     distribution costs for courseware and other instructional
                     materials.

                     Personnel Costs: manpower costs for instructors, facilitators,
                     instructional developers, programmers, technicians,
                     maintainers, administrators, participant’s time spent in
                     training, etc., as applicable.

                     Maintenance Costs: repair, upgrade, and replacement of
                     equipment, and the revision and maintenance of courseware.

                     Travel and Per Diem Costs: travel to/from the schoolhouse
                     or training site.

                     Other Support Costs: administrative, contract, overhead,
                     facilities, etc.

                     Training Attendance Costs: participant’s time spent in
                     training; lost productivity or cost of replacing the individual
                     while in training.
                     Instructor Costs: Instructor’s time spent in training, lost
                     productivity or cost of replacing the individual while in training.

                     Other Instructional Development Costs: Non-personnel
                     resources used during the design and development of the
                     training materials.

                                                                   Continued on next page

Cost factors          Course Metrics: Expected course life; course length;
(Continued)           number of students in each class; number of times the
                      course is to be presented; number of instructors per class

                      Others: Opportunity costs (lost sales); production and
                      materials cost; development and evaluation time.


Benefits          Measuring the direct benefits or results of the instruction is a
                  more complex task since some benefits may be difficult to
                  quantify. The objective is to attach a cost or quantitative value to
                  each benefit – and each benefit must be derived from the
                  instructional alternative being examined. That is, there may be
                  other factors that contribute to a given benefit; the analyst must
                  isolate and measure only the effects of training. Typical benefits
                  to consider include:

                     Reduced training time: Reductions may be realized in
                     facility, personnel, and TDY costs, as well as less
                     nonproductive/lost time while student is in training.

                     Reduced material costs: Potential cost savings for revision,
                     distribution, and maintenance of instructional
                     materials/courseware in electronic format versus printed or
                     “hard copy” materials.

                     Improved on-the-job safety: Translates into fewer accidents
                     and increased productivity.

                     Improved job performance: Less time to
                     perform/accomplish tasks, increased
                     productivity/efficiency/quality of work, or improved
                     management/command/supervision/decision-making ability,
                     amount of positive versus negative feedback from “clients”,
                     changes in employee morale and motivation.

                     Reduced manpower requirements: Potential manpower
                     savings as a result of increased efficiency or productivity, less
                     supervision required, etc.

                                                                 Continued on next page

Benefits                  Reduced equipment requirement: Simulation training may
(Continued)               reduce the need, impact, or expense of allocating actual
                          equipment to train hands-on skills.

                          Higher equipment operational availability: Fewer
                          operator/maintainer errors, safety incidents/accidents, etc.,
                          may result in lower maintenance requirements and
                          equipment/system downtime.


Cost/benefit        There are many different types of cost/benefit models available,
models              from basic models, to very specific models tailored for a particular
                    type of training situation. The choice of the model is dictated by
                    the purpose of the assessment. Three of the most common
                    types of general cost models are:

                          Resource requirements model (additive model)
                          Life cycle model
                          ROI model


Resource            In general, the resource requirements model identifies the
requirements        associated costs over a specified time period. This type of model
model               (see example below) can be used to sum up the costs of a
                    particular instructional system during the various phases of
                    development for comparison with the costs of using other
                    instructional media. One matrix is developed for each medium or
                    approach being considered. The matrices are compared and
                    provide data to support selection of one alternative.

Life cycle model        The life cycle cost model identifies the cost of the instructional
                        system over its useful life. This type of model looks at the initial
                        start-up costs for implementation and the recurring costs of a
                        particular instructional system based on the projected life cycle.
                        The initial start-up costs for technology-based instructional
                        systems are generally high as compared to the traditional
                        classroom lecture costs. However, when these initial costs are
                        amortized (start-up cost spread over the number of life cycle
                        years) and combined with the lower recurring costs, the actual
                        operating cost over the life cycle period is usually much less,
                        particularly when calculated as cost per student. That is, as the
                        number of students trained increases, the cost of training each
                        student decreases. The following diagram demonstrates this
                        principle.


Life cycle cost of      In the following diagram, “A” represents a small technology-based
instructional           instructional program while “B” represents the same program
programs                developed as a traditional lecture-based resident instructional
                        program. In this case, we are looking at the cost per student. At
                        about 380 students, the cost per student is the same for each
                        alternative. After that point, the cost of alternative “A” is less per
                        student. Cost savings are realized by introducing technology if
                        more than 380 students are to be trained.

                                                                        Continued on next page

Investment (ROI)                       system in terms of a ratio of benefits versus costs. The ROI
model                                  model could be applied for various instructional systems to
                                       determine the media with the highest ROI. For example if:

                                           ROI = (value of benefits – cost of instruction) / cost of
                                                 instruction

                                                                                           Continued on next page

Return Of           When comparing one system with a determined value of benefits
Investment (ROI)    of $2,000 and a cost of $500, and another system with a value of
model (Continued)   $1,500 and a cost of $1,000, the corresponding ROIs would be
                    as follows:

                    (1)     ROI: (2000 – 500) / 500 = 3

                    (2)     ROI: (3000 – 1500) / 1500 = 1

                    In this example, system (1) is more cost-effective.


Conducting the      The general steps associated with conducting a cost analysis are
cost analysis       depicted below. Although it shows a linear series of steps, the
                    actual analysis process may very well end up to be an iterative,
                    ongoing process – many of the steps are performed concurrently
                    and feed into one another as the application of processes and
                    estimation techniques are refined. Teamwork is essential to
                    effective cost analysis – the more expertise there is when
                    estimating costs and benefits, the better the chances of
                    establishing realistic cost comparisons.

                    Step 1. Determine the type of analysis to be conducted – what
                    kind of results expected? (Refer to AFIADLO website
                    (http://www.maxwell.af.mil/afiadl/) for cost analysis guidance.)

                          Cost/Benefit – compare and contrast costs and benefits of
                          proposed alternative approaches to training.
                          Cost-effectiveness – cost comparison of alternative
                          systems/media.

                    Step 2. Identify cost factors and benefits or results that will be
                    measured.

                    Determine what it is that you want to measure – what factors do
                    you want to compare? Consider the availability of the information
                    for each system/medium considered and document assumptions
                    made.

                                                                    Continued on next page

                        ROI model
                        Other model(s)

                    Step 4. Collect data and ensure data is valid.

                    This can be the most time consuming part of the cost analysis
                    process. If you are comparing the cost of instructor-led resident
                    instruction to the cost of technology-based instruction, make sure
                    you understand what is included in the cost figures maintained for
                    resident instruction. Know what is meant by cost per student day,
                    or cost per graduate, etc. For example, are the cost of facilities
                    and manpower included in these cost figures? Be sure you
                    compare the same cost factors and DOCUMENT ALL
                    ASSUMPTIONS.

                    Step 5. Apply data to the model.

                    Step 6. Determine and assess the results.

                             Media Selection

Overview        After a Media Feasibility Analysis, Infrastructure/Resource
                Feasibility Analysis and Cost Analysis have been accomplished,
                perform a reality check on the media selected, and make a final
                media selection/recommendation.


Issues          Cost and learning effective media selection requires a formal
                decision process. Refer to Chapter 2 for information on the project
                management process.

                The personnel required to accomplish a Media Feasibility Analysis
                are not the same as the personnel required to accomplish a Cost
                Analysis. Refer to Chapter 2 for information on team composition
                and coordination with other organizations.

                     Final media selection occurs only after a Media Feasibility
                     Analysis, Infrastructure/Resource Feasibility Analysis and a
                     Cost Analysis have been accomplished.

                     The final decision to convert a course or a module of
                     instruction to an IT format is made by the course or training
                     manager (or primary customer) based upon the results of the
                     analyses and the recommendation of the instructional
                     designer or project manager.


Next steps      The Project Manager/Instructional Designer documents and reports
                findings to the primary customer. If the decision is made to
                proceed with in-house development, the Instructional Technology
                development team is assigned and a Memorandum of Agreement
                (MOA) or a project plan is negotiated with the customer according
                to the process described in Chapter 2. At this point, the IT
                development team will update DITIS/DAVIS database if appropriate
                to the selected medium, and initiate the project folder along with
                man-hour data collection and life-cycle management.

Front-end analysis   Developing courseware requires a front-end analysis tailored to the
                     chosen instructional technology. Chapters 5-9 describe some of
                     the analysis issues pertinent to each media. A highly effective tool

                                     Print Materials
                                 Analysis Considerations


Why use print          Most current instruction is still accomplished primarily or in
materials?             conjunction with printed documents and materials. Print
                       materials will always have an important role in the delivery of
                       instruction.

                       Print materials serve as a basis for student learning by providing
                       information, facts, examples, and explanations. Examples of
                       print items include placards, flip charts, illustrated booklets, and
                       photographs. Print is also highly transportable and suitable for
                       self-instruction by students at any location. Technologies are
                       emerging that facilitate the production of materials by course
                       developers.


When to use print      Print materials can be used to deliver:
materials
                           An entire course of instruction that is based on cognitive
                           (knowledge) learning objectives (i.e., correspondence
                           courses).
                           Combined with other instructional technologies as collateral
                           material for any type of course.

                       Since print materials are passive in nature and can only provide
                       knowledge-based instruction, they would not be appropriate as
                       the primary media for accomplishing learning objectives that
                       require performance skills or a high level of interactivity and
                       communication with others. Print instruction is most effective
                       when it is integrated with other types of media and instruction.

                       General applications of print materials include:

                           Study Guides
                           Textbooks
                           Manuals, Workbooks, and outlines
                           Instructor/student guides
                           Documents
                           Illustrated booklets/handouts

                                                                       Continued on next page

Print resource         It is important to identify and assess the print resource
requirements and       requirements and constraints. This will help to determine the
constraints            feasibility of using print instruction, and whether or not the print
                       materials should be produced in-house.

                           Equipment. Minimum required equipment would include a
                           PC (with a word processing/desktop publishing application),
                           high quality laser printer, and a collating copy machine.
                           Optional: Color-capable printer and copier.
                           Facilities. As a minimum, an office would be required with
                           the minimum equipment to produce the instruction.
                           Funding. Is there a budget? This factor will determine if
                           outsourcing is an option.
                           Personnel. Minimum recommended personnel would
                           include a Subject Matter Expert (SME), writer, editor, and
                           publisher. These would not necessarily be different
                           individuals. In some situations, they may be one and the
                           same person.
                           Time. Is there a time limit? Since the potential requirement
                           exists for the development and production of complete
                           textbooks, manuals, etc., which can be complex and time
                           consuming, time is a significant factor. Large in-house print
                           production efforts usually take longer than anticipated.


In-house               With the current availability of powerful, user-friendly desktop
development or         publishing software, the capability to produce professional-
outsource?             looking print materials is now available to any user. However, to
                       produce professional-quality print materials, special designing,
                       writing, editing and publishing skills are still required. Therefore,
                       if quality is an issue and funding is available, consider using
                       professional publishing personnel.

                       For most applications, well-written print materials developed in-
                       house will effectively meet instructional requirements. The only

                                                                        Continued on next page

In-house            outside assistance that may be required is the reproduction of
development or      copies for distribution. However, for the larger and more complex
outsource?          instructional textbooks and manuals, a significant amount of time
                    and effort will be required to complete the task. This may
                    necessitate outsourcing some or all of the effort if unit personnel
                    will not have the time to produce the materials in-house.

                    At times, a “mix” of in-house developed materials and external
                    resources (i.e., stock photography) can be used to produce high
                    quality materials.

Determine the        Determine the specific knowledge and attitude objectives that
objectives           must be achieved. Decide what it is you want to do and
                     accomplish with the print materials.


Determine what       Determine whether the print materials will be developed as the
approach to use      primary instructional media, or used as collateral instruction for
                     other media.

                     Based on how the print instruction will be used, determine what
                     type of print materials should be employed to meet the specific
                     learning objectives (e.g., textbook, workbook, and student
                     guide)?


Design strategy      Determine the design strategy. Because print instruction is
                     mostly self-directed and self-paced, the print materials should be
                     designed to motivate, stimulate, and hold the attention and
                     interest of the student.

                     Determine what type of test and evaluation methods should be
                     used to measure the students’ comprehension of the instruction
                     provided. AF HDBK 36-2235, Volume 12, Test and
                     Measurement Handbook, provides general guidance.


General design       Before designing the print materials, you should be aware of the
guidelines           students’ reading skills and knowledge level of the subject
                     material. Consider the following guidelines when designing print
                     materials:

                         The print instruction should facilitate creative thinking,
                         encourage self-instruction, maximize interaction, and provide
                         a means for self-assessment.
                         The print instruction should be performance-oriented – it
                         should tell the students what they need to know and what to
                         do.
                         The print instruction should use the full presentation
                         capabilities of print materials (pictures, diagrams, graphics,
                         color and text).

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5        1 November 2002                                     180




General design           The print instruction should be provided in manageable
guidelines               chunks.
(Continued)              The print instruction should correlate with other media
                         instruction provided.


What to do           For effective design, use:

                     Writing:
                         Plain conversational English.
                         The active voice and personal pronouns.
                         Short sentences.
                         A logical sequence for paragraphs and sentences (e.g.,
                         general then specific, right ways then wrong ways,
                         advantages then disadvantages).
                         Questions that focus on student understanding to help them
                         identify important material and make the desired inferences.
                         Humor constructively to improve student retention and
                         interest.

                     Visuals:
                        Examples and illustrations to link the familiar with the
                        unfamiliar.
                        Pictures to show spatial relationships and object form.
                        The same format throughout – be consistent.
                        Eye-pleasing layout with lots of “white space.”


What not to do       Design considerations should avoid:

                         Irrelevant information and verbosity.
                         Compound sentences.
                         Complex and difficult words.
                         Double negatives.
                         Jargon.
                         Gender terms.


Develop an outline   Determine how the content will be organized and structured
                     based on the objectives and purpose of the instruction. Then
                     develop an outline of the material to be covered before you start
                     working on any of the content.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 5      1 November 2002                                   181




Get approval      Once you have developed an outline, you should probably get the
                  necessary coordination, evaluation, and approval of the outline
                  and design strategy before proceeding.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5        1 November 2002                                       182


                             Development Considerations


Where to go for      The following Internet sites can be accessed to obtain information
guidance             on AF and AETC publications, handbooks, instructions, etc., that
                     provide guidance related to the development of documentation.

                             http://afpubs.hq.af.mil
                             http://www.aetc.af.mil/m/

                     You will also need to consult any applicable MAJCOM,
                     Numbered Air Force, and local unit publications for guidance.

                     If the print materials will be used as the primary instructional
                     media for a correspondence type course, you should contact
                     AFIADLECI for initial guidance and reference information.


Gathering            The amount of time and effort that will be required to research the
information          subject and gather the required information will most likely
                     depend on the type(s) of print materials being developed
                     (textbook, workbook, study guide, lesson outline, etc.). This is
                     the key function in development process; so make sure sufficient
                     time is planned and allocated to do this.

                     If you are not the SME, then you will be working with a SME
                     during the development of the instruction. The SME is usually
                     the primary source of information. However, solicit inputs and
                     information from other sources such as the training manager,
                     technical experts, the other services, and DoD agencies as
                     applicable. Also, review any existing courseware and
                     technical/training materials.


Develop a draft      If you are writing the instruction yourself and you are not
                     somewhat proficient in using a PC or word processing
                     application, then you are already in trouble! Plan ahead and
                     obtain any necessary support or training.

                     While developing the draft, keep focused on the specific learning
                     objectives and make sure the content is relevant and useful.
                     Develop test questions and evaluation tools that will effectively

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5      1 November 2002                                        183




Develop a draft      measure the students’ knowledge of the required material,
(Continued)          provide feedback, and meet the specific learning objectives.

                     When the initial draft is complete, you may want to consider
                     conducting an internal review prior to the formal review and
                     coordination process. For an internal review, get as many eyes
                     as possible to look at the material. If feasible, include
                     disinterested third party people who do not have a stake in the
                     product.


Final review,        Conduct a summative evaluation and make any necessary
editing, and         changes or edits to the material. If the preceding analysis,
approval             design, and development processes were accomplished properly,
                     then very few changes will probably be required at this stage in
                     the game. Finally, go and get approval.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5        1 November 2002                                         184


                             Implementation Considerations


Print copy           Determine if unit reproduction support or contract services are
reproduction         already available to accomplish this task. If they are not, you will
                     need to determine if the capability exists to reproduce the print
                     materials in-house, and whether it would be cost-effective to do
                     so. A high quality laser printer will normally be required to
                     produce a camera-ready master copy of the printed materials for
                     reproduction. Also, a high speed collating copy machine should
                     be used if the multiple copies will be made in-house to minimize
                     the time and effort required.

                     If color copies are required, access to a color printer and copier
                     will be required unless commercial support is used.


Electronic copy      Most units have established procedures, standards, and/or
reproduction         methods for the format and electronic reproduction of courseware
                     materials. You will need to check with the unit administration or
                     training personnel for information.

                     Many print shops are now capable of generating print materials
                     from electronic files. Consult with your print shop before
                     formatting and laying out the materials. The print shop may
                     designate required formats for text, graphics, and other items.
                     They may also recommend the best way to organize the
                     document into a master file and sub files.


Distribution         Once again, most units have established procedures and
                     methods for the distribution of formal courseware materials,
                     including electronic versions. Assuming that you will not be
                     responsible for the actual distribution of the materials, you should
                     still make sure, as a minimum, that the distribution list is current.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5        1 November 2002                                        185


                              Evaluation Considerations


Evaluation of print   As with other instructional technologies, the evaluation process
instruction           for print instruction consists of a formative, summative, and
                      operational evaluation. If the print materials were developed as
                      supporting instruction for other instructional media, then these
                      materials should be evaluated as part of the primary
                      lesson/course evaluation.

                      The distance learning evaluation metrics are described in
                      Chapter 2. The general guidelines for evaluations are contained
                      in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting handbooks.

                      This section addresses the special considerations for conducting
                      evaluations of print materials when developed as the primary
                      instructional medium.


Formative             The formative evaluation begins in the analysis phase and
evaluation            continues through the development phase of the ISD process.
                      During the initial phases of development, the primary focus would
                      be on the technical accuracy of the learning objectives, content,
                      and test items.

                      Once draft versions of the materials are developed, individual and
                      small group tryouts of the instruction can be accomplished.
                      General areas to evaluate include:

                          Instructional material organization, structure, and format.
                          Content accuracy, relevancy, currency, effectiveness,
                          completeness, spelling, and grammar.
                          Use, clarity, and effectiveness of pictures, graphics,
                          diagrams, test questions, etc.
                          Student comprehension and accomplishment of the learning
                          objectives.

                      Results of these evaluations are used to revise and finalize the
                      print materials.


Summative             The operational tryouts for the summative evaluation of the print
evaluation            instruction should be conducted at various sites.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 5      1 November 2002                                        186




Operational      The operational evaluation is an ongoing process that is
evaluation       accomplished after the formative and summative evaluations.
                 This evaluation is based on internal and external feedback data
                 such as:

                     Instructor/facilitator comments (internal)
                     Student critiques (internal)
                     Test results (internal)
                     Inspection and evaluation reports (external)

                 To ensure the quality of the instruction is maintained, conduct
                 these evaluations on a regular basis. There is always room for
                 improvement.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 5         1 November 2002                                          187

                                      Videotape
                               Analysis Considerations


When to use          In general, videotape would be appropriate for any instruction that
videotape            requires visual communication with the student (visual cues,
                     motion, actions, etc.). Videotape presentations can enhance, and
                     help clarify, the instruction provided. It is an effective medium to
                     use to reach large, widely distributed audiences.

                     Videotapes can be used:

                         To support or reinforce other instruction by providing visual
                         demonstrations of tasks, and showing actual equipment,
                         locations, people, etc.
                         To deliver instruction from instructors, technical experts, etc.,
                         that is not always available for live presentations at the
                         various sites.
                         When consistency/standardization of the instruction is
                         required at all sites.

                     If videotapes are used alone as the primary instructional media,
                     there is no guarantee that any learning will take place. For
                     videotapes to be effective, other collateral instructional materials
                     and activities should be used to reinforce the videotape
                     instruction.


Videotape resource   It is important to identify and assess the videotape resource
requirements and     requirements and constraints. This will help to determine the
constraints          feasibility of using videotape instruction, and whether or not the
                     video production capability exists in-house.

                         Equipment. Minimum required equipment would include
                         video camera(s), video cassette/tape recorder, TV monitor,
                         tripod, lighting equipment, microphones, and headphones.
                         Facilities. Can the taping be accomplished on site, or will a
                         production studio be required? If a production studio will be
                         used, is there one available in-house (e.g., IVT studio), or will
                         a studio need to be rented?

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5       1 November 2002                                           188

constraints              Personnel. This is a variable factor that may need to be
(Continued)              limited based on available resources. Assuming that
                         professional personnel are used, the production team may
                         include a production manager, producer, director, editor,
                         casting director, cast, camera crew, lighting/sound
                         technicians, stagehands, makeup person, and various other
                         assistants as desired.
                         Time. Is there a time limit? Since video production can be
                         complex and time consuming, time is a significant factor. In-
                         house video productions almost always take longer than
                         anticipated or planned.


In-house             The production of professional quality videotapes requires years
development or       of experience. If quality is an issue and funding is available,
outsource?           consider using only professional production personnel. On the
                     other hand, considering that the most important factor from an
                     instructional standpoint is the content, a well-written script and a
                     home video camera may fit the bill. Obviously, the answer will
                     probably lie somewhere between these two. In any event, some
                     or all of the effort may need to be outsourced if the required
                     production resources are not available in-house.


Is videotape         A good cost-effectiveness analysis will provide the answer.
cost-effective?      However, assuming that the videotape will in fact meet the
                     required learning objectives, the initial cost, student throughput,
                     and content stability will probably be the key factors in this
                     determination. Therefore, make sure this data is accurate and
                     valid.

                               Design Considerations


Preproduction        The design phase, or preproduction phase, encompasses all of
                     the planning, design, and development that occurs prior to the
                     actual filming.


Determine the        Determining the specific objectives or purpose of the videotape is
objectives           critical since all of the following efforts will be based on meeting
                     those objectives. Decide what it is you want to do and
                     accomplish with the videotape instruction. It may be necessary to
                     limit the scope or purpose in order to effectively cover the
                     required subject/topic in the time allotted.


Determine what       Solicit ideas and inputs from others to help decide what approach
approach to use      to take. There are many different approaches or presentation
                     formats that can be used to deliver the instruction such as:

                         Lecture
                         Demonstration
                         Dramatization
                         Interview or group discussion
                         Game or talk show
                         Question and answer
                         Event walk-through

                     Determine what type of test and evaluation methods should be
                     used to measure the students’ comprehension of the instruction
                     provided. AF HDBK 36-2235, Volume 12, Test and
                     Measurement Handbook, provides general guidance.


General design       When designing the instruction, keep focused on the objectives of
guidelines           the videotape. Following are some general design guidelines:

                         Plan to keep the program or program segment as short as
                         possible. Long videotaped programs will lose effectiveness
                         since it is difficult to maintain the student’s attention and
                         interest. Ten minutes or less would be optimum.

                                                                    Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       190




General design            As with briefings and other presentations, limit your program
guidelines                or program segment to three major points if possible.
(Continued)               Plan and design collateral activities that will require student
                          actions or performance of tasks (i.e., hands-on activities).
                          Employ the full presentation capabilities of video by using
                          audio, real-time events, still/moving pictures, slow/fast
                          motion, animation, color, and text.
                          Determine what supporting materials will be required (e.g.,
                          outlines, readings, quizzes), and how they will be used
                          (before, during, or after).
                          Plan some type of follow-on activities to reinforce the
                          instruction provided such as group discussions, assignments,
                          quizzes, etc.


Develop a script      The script provides the outline and guide for producing the video.
                      Make sure it communicates exactly what you want said and done.

                      The script should:
                          Focus on the objectives.
                          Communicate and reinforce the major points.
                          Deliver the instruction in a coherent and logical sequence.
                          Be written in plain and simple conversational English.
                          Remember the object here is to ensure the students
                          understand what is said – not to impress them with your
                          command of the English language!

                      Bottom line: Writing a good script takes time and practice.


Develop               The storyboards are used to convey visual ideas and concepts.
storyboards           For videotape instruction, they need to show the sequence of the
                      visual shots with the corresponding dialogue.

                      The general guidelines provided in Chapter 8 for developing IVT
                      storyboards can also be applied to videotapes.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 5        1 November 2002                                        191




Determine who and   Two other planning decisions will need to made:
where to film
                    Who to shoot. That is, are you going to use real people or
                    professional actors?
                        Actors know the drill, but you will pay for their expertise.
                        In most cases, real people will do if they are carefully
                        selected (i.e., ensure that they are not only good speakers,
                        but credible speakers).

                    Where to shoot (if not already determined). Will the filming be
                    done on location or in a production studio?
                       On location provides realism, including all the real noise,
                       lighting problems, distractions, etc., that will need to be dealt
                       with for the shoot.
                       Studio settings are more controlled which will reduce the time
                       required to complete the shoot. However, this will probably
                       be more costly if a studio has to be rented.


Get approval        Make sure you know what the approval process/protocol is, and
                    get the necessary approval before proceeding. The storyboards
                    can be used in the review and approval process to get the “go-
                    ahead” before committing the resources and starting the actual
                    production.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        192


                                Development Considerations


Production              The development phase, or production phase, involves the last
                        minute preparations for the shoot, and the actual shoot itself. If a
                        professional production team is used, many of the following
                        preparation and filming considerations will not be concerns or
                        issues. They are provided as information for inexperienced
                        personnel and in-house productions.


Audio preparations      Make sure that appropriate microphones will be used:

                            Determine what type (unidirectional, bi-directional, or omni-
                            directional) and kind of microphones (floor/table stand,
                            hanging, camera, lavaliere, handheld, wireless, etc.) are
                            available for use.
                            Select which type(s) and kind(s) of microphones will be used.
                            If possible, test the microphone(s) on location to check audio
                            levels and background noise.


Video preparations      Determine how many cameras will be required and/or used:

                            In most situations, only one camera (VHS, VHS-C, Beta, or
                            Hi-8) will be necessary. The taping can be planned to
                            continue uninterrupted during the production, with the editing
                            performed after the shoot.
                            More than one camera should be considered if an event that
                            will be taped cannot be recreated or repeated.


Final preparations      The use of a production and equipment checklist will help to
for the filming         ensure smooth execution of the shoot. Below are some of the
                        things you should do prior to the shoot:

                            Distribute the scripts.
                            Notify the cast members; notify the production crew.
                            Confirm studio arrangements (if applicable).
                            Visit and assess the on location shoot site (if applicable).
                            Ensure all production equipment is or will be on hand.

                                                                        Continued on next page

Final preparations          Ensure all set props, instructional materials, cue cards (if
for the filming             applicable), etc., are or will be on hand.
(Continued)                 Have contingency plans – Murphy’s Law is alive and well!
                            Schedule and conduct “script reading” rehearsal(s) with the
                            cast.
                            Consider conducting a dry run for the more complex
                            productions prior to the actual shoot.


Conducting the          With good storyboards, a well-written script, proper preparation,
filming                 and a knowledgeable director, the actual production should
                        proceed as planned with minimal problems.

                        Video tips:

                            Be aware of copyright laws when compiling videotapes,
                            recording from public broadcasts, and providing multiple
                            copies for student access. Obtain permission from copyright
                            owners when producing videotapes that contain sound,
                            pictures, and segments from other productions.
                            Have all “on-camera” talent sign appropriate releases
                            To keep viewers oriented, use the “far-shot, medium-shot,
                            close-up-shot” sequence or “zoom-in” approach when
                            showing an object.
                            Avoid “quick” or moving camera shots. Each time the camera
                            focuses on a new object, the viewers should be given
                            sufficient time to be able to see and comprehend what it is
                            that you are showing them.

                        When setting up the individual shots or segments, make sure
                        adequate lighting is provided so that the viewers will be able to
                        recognize what is being shown. The basic lighting triangle set up
                        depicted below, is one lighting method that can be used.

                                                                      Continued on next page

Editing the tape      Basic editing involves reviewing all of the videotape, selecting
                      which shots will be used, and combining the selected segments
                      in the desired sequence. If the entire program was already taped
                      in the proper sequence, only minor editing should be required.
                      Otherwise, a minimum of two videotape recorders and monitors,
                      with a video controller linking the two recorders would be
                      recommended to do the editing in-house.

                      Editing video using a PC is an option, but this would require
                      additional video hardware (for digital/analog conversions),
                      software, and expertise, which will be more costly.

                      “Voice Over” and narration can be added along with music during
                      the editing phase. The use of photographs and other graphics
                      can greatly enhance the “message” of the video ( i.e., Ken Burns’
                      use of photographs, narration and music in his Civil War series).

                      New blank videotape should be used to make a master tape from
                      the original. Add any desired narration and transitions between
                      the segments to complete the instructional tape.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5        1 November 2002                                      195


                               Implementation Considerations


Tape reproduction      Each time a tape is copied, the image quality of the tape is
                       reduced. Since the master tape is a copy of the original
                       production tape, it is a second-generation tape. Any duplicate
                       master tape that is made as a precaution, would be a third
                       generation tape.

                       When the videotape copies are made for distribution (normally in
                       VHS format), you should consider using the second generation
                       versus third generation master tape as the duplicating master.
                       Although there is some risk involved, the quality of the
                       reproduced tapes will be greater.

                       In any case, you should review one of the final distribution copies
                       so you are aware of what the students will see.


Tape distribution      Ensure that the distribution copies of the videotape have the
                       version number or date printed on the label. This will help the
                       end users in making sure they have the most current version of
                       the tape when revisions are made.

                       You should also maintain an updated copy of the videotape
                       distribution list even though you may not be responsible for the
                       actual distribution. This list can be used as a reference for future
                       distribution of revisions and instructional materials.


Emerging               Generally, the videotape in use today is analog video. Digital
technologies           video is becoming more readily available. Examples of digital
                       video include laser disks, and the new DVD systems. Digital
                       video maintains better clarity when reproduced than does analog
                       video. Digital video is also more readily distributed over
                       computer networks than is analog video.

                       Pattern recognition software is enabling the searching of video
                       presentations for specific tapes or segments.

                           Evaluation Considerations


Evaluation of      As with other instructional technologies, the evaluation process
videotape          for videotape instruction consists of a formative, summative, and
instruction        operational evaluation. If the videotape was developed as
                   supporting instruction in conjunction with other instructional
                   media, the evaluations may be conducted as part of the
                   evaluation for the primary medium.

                   The distance learning evaluation metrics are described in
                   Chapter 2. The general guidelines for evaluations are contained
                   in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting handbooks.

                   This section addresses the special considerations for conducting
                   evaluations of videotape instruction.


Formative          The formative evaluation begins in the analysis phase and
evaluation         continues through the development phase of the ISD process.
                   Since developmental versions (e.g., alpha and beta versions) of
                   videotape programs are not usually produced, as is the case with
                   computer-based programs, a validation of the video instruction
                   would not be possible prior to the actual production of the
                   videotape. However, a technical accuracy review of the
                   objectives, storyboards and script can be conducted.

                   Following production of the videotape, individual and small group
                   tryouts of the edited master tape can be accomplished. If
                   deficiencies or problems are identified and cannot be corrected
                   by additional editing, another shoot may be necessary.


Summative          The operational tryouts for the summative evaluation of
evaluation         instructional videotapes should be conducted at various sites.

                   If the videotape was designed for use as supporting material, it
                   may also be necessary to present the primary instructional
                   material for the evaluation. This would allow the video instruction
                   to be viewed within the proper context, which will provide more
                   meaningful and valid results.

Operational      The operational evaluation is an ongoing process that is
evaluation       accomplished after the formative and summative evaluations.
                 This evaluation is based on internal and external feedback data
                 such as:

                     Instructor/facilitator comments (internal)
                     Student critiques (internal)
                     Test results (internal)
                     Inspection and evaluation reports (external)

                 As with the summative evaluation, the videotape should be
                 viewed along with the primary instruction it was designed to
                 support. Also, it may be difficult to isolate and determine the
                 actual effectiveness of the videotape instruction from test results,
                 unless the material tested was only provided in the videotape.

                                 Audiotape
                           Analysis Considerations


Why use          Audiotape can be used to reproduce real life instructional events
audiotape?       such as lectures, tutorials, seminars, and conference
                 presentations.

                 Audiotape can provide one-way aural communication between
                 the instructor and student. The spoken word is often a richer
                 information source than the printed word.

                 Audiotapes are also highly transportable and suitable for self-
                 instruction by students at any location.


When to use      Audiotape can be:
audiotape
                     Used to deliver short course of instruction that is based on
                     cognitive (knowledge) learning objectives or verbal skills (i.e.,
                     correspondence and language courses).
                     Combined with other instructional technologies as collateral
                     material for any type of course.

                 Other applications of audiotape include:

                     Recordings of real life events. For example, lectures,
                     presentations, guest speakers, and meetings.
                     Interviews. For example, experts and specialists for
                     elements of instruction.
                     Procedures or sequences. Verbal descriptions of procedures
                     or sequences that are part on a course of instruction.
                     Recordings. For example, music and information sources
                     with a strong aural content.

                 Since audiotapes are passive in nature, they would not be
                 appropriate as the primary media for accomplishing learning
                 objectives that require performance skills or a high level of
                 interactivity and communication with others. Audiotape
                 instruction is most effective when it is integrated with other types
                 of media and instruction.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5       1 November 2002                                           199




Audiotape             It is important to identify and assess the audiotape resource
resource              requirements and constraints. This will help to determine the
requirements and      feasibility of using audiotape instruction, and whether or not the
constraints           audiotapes should be produced in-house. The most common
                      type of audiotape used for instruction is the cassette tape. This is
                      the only type of tape that will be addressed in this section.

                          Equipment. Minimum required equipment would include a
                          cassette tape recorder and player, microphone, and speakers
                          or headphones for playback.
                          Facilities. A recording studio or “soundproof” room equipped
                          with a cassette tape recorder to produce the taped
                          instruction.
                          Funding. Is there a budget? This factor will determine if
                          outsourcing is an option.
                          Personnel. Minimum personnel would include a SME, writer,
                          narrator, and sound technician (if applicable). These would
                          not necessarily be different individuals. In some situations,
                          they may be one and the same person.
                          Time. Is there a time limit? Although good audiotapes will
                          still take some time to produce, they generally require less
                          time than the other traditional media, with the possible
                          exception of audioconferencing. Most of the time required is
                          in the development of the script.


In-house              Unless the taped instruction will be very short, you should
development or        consider producing the tape in a sound studio with the proper
outsource?            equipment (in-house, rented, or contract). Anything less than
                      professional quality sound can distract the student from
                      concentrating on what is being said. Even though the student
                      can replay the tape, the net effect of constant distractions is not
                      only less effective learning taking place, but lower student
                      motivation and interest.

                      Almost equally important, is the quality of the narration. Using
                      professional narrators, although more costly, will usually require
                      less recording and editing time (i.e., fewer retakes and less
                      “cutting”), and be more cost-effective. If a professional narrator is
                      not an option, it will be important to use someone who is
                      articulate and has a pleasant, neutral voice. Everyone has

                                                                      Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        200




In-house             probably listened to voice recordings of non-professional actors
development or       on radio or television commercials that sound unnatural (read
outsource?           from a prompter) or are hard to listen to because of the person’s
(Continued)          voice tone, pitch, accent, pronunciation of words, etc. Now
                     imagine trying to listen to an hour of that type of voice recording –
                     enough said.


Are audiotapes       In most cases where audio recordings can be used to accomplish
cost-effective?      the objective, cassette tapes will generally be very cost-effective.
                     This assumes of course, a stable content environment. As
                     computer digital audio technology continues to advance and the
                     cost of CD recording continues to decrease, audio CDs are
                     becoming a viable alternative medium for instruction.

                               Design Considerations


Determine the        Determine the specific knowledge and attitude objectives that
objectives           must be achieved. Decide what it is you want to do and
                     accomplish with the print materials.


Determine what       Determine whether the audiotape will be developed as the
approach to use      primary instructional media, or used as collateral instruction for
                     other media.

                     Based on how the audiotape will be used, determine what
                     approach will be used There are several approaches or
                     presentation formats that can be used to deliver the instruction
                     such as lectures, interviews, or in conjunction with programmed
                     text.

                     Determine what type of test and evaluation methods should be
                     used to measure the students’ comprehension of the instruction
                     provided. AF HDBK 36-2235, Volume 12, Test and
                     Measurement Handbook, provides general guidance.


General design       When designing the instruction, keep focused on the objectives of
guidelines           the audiotape. Following are some general design guidelines:

                         Plan to keep the program or program segment as short as
                         possible. Long audio programs will lose effectiveness since it
                         is difficult to maintain the student’s attention and interest.
                         As with briefings and other presentations, limit your lecture
                         program or program segment to three major points if
                         possible.
                         Plan and design collateral activities that will require student
                         actions or performance of tasks (i.e., hands-on activities or
                         exercises).
                         Use music and sound effects only to provide context,
                         reinforce or reintroduce a theme, or capture, guide and hold
                         attention.
                         Determine what supporting materials, if any, will be required
                         (e.g., outlines, quizzes, handouts with pictures, graphics, text,
                         etc.), and how they will be used (before, during, or after). As
                         a minimum, use supplemental materials for objects,
                         procedures, etc., that are difficult to describe in words.

                                                                     Continued on next page

General design            Plan follow-on activities to reinforce the instruction provided
guidelines                such as group discussions, assignments, quizzes, etc.
(Continued)


Develop a script      The script provides the outline and guide for producing the tape.
                      Make sure it communicates exactly what you want said and done.

                      The script should:

                          Focus on the objectives.
                          Communicate and reinforce the major points.
                          Deliver the instruction in a coherent and logical sequence.
                          Be written in plain conversational English.
                          Identify when music, sound effects, and pauses are to be
                          used.

                      When describing objects, procedures etc., without supporting
                      visual materials, select words and examples that paint pictures
                      and link the familiar with the unfamiliar.

                      Bottom line: Writing a good script takes time and practice.


Determine who         Two other planning decisions will need to made:
and where to
record                Who to record. That is, are you going to use real people or
                      professional narrators? If real people are used, make sure they
                      are good speakers.

                      Where to record (if not already determined). Will the recording
                      be done in a sound studio or at some other location?

                          If selecting a location other than a studio, make sure the site
                          is as “sound-proof” as possible (i.e., free from background
                          noises such as phones, paging systems, cars, aircraft,
                          people, heating/air conditioning units, etc.)
                          Studio settings are more controlled and will reduce the
                          possibility of having to re-record segments.


Get approval          The script or taped rehearsals can be used in the review and
                      approval process to get the “go-ahead” before committing studio
                      resources for the actual recording.

                                Development Considerations


Preparing for the       If a professional sound recording studio and technician are used,
recording               many of the following audio preparations and considerations will
                        not be concerns or issues. They are provided as information for
                        inexperienced personnel and in-house productions.


Audio preparations      Determine what type of recording equipment will be used:

                            Studio recording equipment.
                            Audiocassette recorder.
                            PC with audio recording hardware and software, and
                            adequate hard drive space (example: 650 MB required for 72
                            minutes of CD audio).

                        If using a PC, make sure there will be someone available who is
                        knowledgeable in capturing, recording, and editing the sound
                        recording on the PC.

                        Make sure that an appropriate microphone will be used:

                            Determine how many microphones will be required.
                            Determine what type (unidirectional, bi-directional, or
                            omnidirectional) and kind of microphone (table stand,
                            handheld, etc.) is available for use.
                            Select which type(s) and kind(s) of microphones will be used.
                            If possible, test the microphone(s) with the recording
                            equipment at the recording site to check audio levels and
                            background noise.


Final preparations      The use of a production and equipment checklist will help to
for the recording       ensure smooth execution of the recording session. Below are
                        some of the things you should do prior to the taping.

                            Distribute the scripts.
                            Notify the narrator(s).
                            Notify the studio and sound technicians (if applicable).
                            Visit and assess the recording site (if other than the studio).
                            Ensure all recording equipment is or will be on hand.

                                                                        Continued on next page

Final preparations          Ensure all music/sound effect tapes (if applicable) are or will
for the recording           be on hand.
(Continued)                 Have contingency plans – Murphy’s Law is alive and well!
                            Schedule and conduct rehearsal(s) with the narrator(s).


Conducting the          With a well-written script, proper equipment, and prior
recording               preparation, the actual recording should proceed with minimal
                        problems.

                        Recording tips:

                            Use as few microphones as possible. Each microphone used
                            adds noise to the system.
                            If there is only one microphone, and two or more narrators
                            with different voice levels, adjust their positions either closer
                            or farther from the microphone to maintain a proper sound
                            balance.
                            After each audio segment, keep the tape going for a short
                            period of time to provide “blank” tape segments that can be
                            used during editing if required to “splice-in” pauses with the
                            same background ambiance.
                            Use live sound effects and music if possible during the
                            recording rather than trying to add them later.
                            Be aware of copyright laws when recording. Obtain
                            permission from copyright owners when producing
                            audiotapes that contain music and sound segments from
                            other productions or sources.


Editing the tape        If the entire program was already taped in the proper sequence
                        with all the desired sound effects included, only minor editing
                        should be required. Anything more than minor editing should be
                        done by specialists since it will normally require special
                        equipment and expertise.

                               Implementation Considerations


Tape reproduction      Qualified personnel should also do audiotape reproduction with
                       the proper equipment. You should review one of the final
                       distribution copies so you are aware of what the students will
                       actually hear.


Tape distribution      Ensure that the distribution copies of the audiotape have the
                       version number or date printed on the label. This will help the
                       end users in making sure they have the most current version of
                       the tape when revisions are made.

                       You should also maintain an updated copy of the distribution list
                       even though you may not be responsible for the actual
                       distribution. This list can be used as a reference for future
                       distribution of revisions and instructional materials.


Emerging               Digital audio is enabling the distribution of audio (live and
technologies           recorded) over computer networks.

                       Pattern recognition software is enabling searching of audio
                       presentations for specific topics and segments.

                           Evaluation Considerations


Evaluation of      The evaluation process for audiotape instruction consists of a
audiotape          formative, summative, and operational evaluation. If the
instruction        audiotape was developed as supporting instruction in conjunction
                   with other instructional media, the evaluations may be conducted
                   as part of the evaluation for the primary medium.

                   The distance learning evaluation metrics are described in
                   Chapter 2. The general guidelines for evaluations are contained
                   in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting handbooks.

                   This section addresses the special considerations for conducting
                   evaluations of audiotape instruction.


Formative          The formative evaluation begins in the analysis phase and
evaluation         continues through the development phase of the ISD process.
                   Since developmental versions (e.g., alpha and beta versions) of
                   audiotape programs are not usually produced, as is the case with
                   computer-based programs, a validation of the audio instruction
                   would not be possible prior to the actual production of the
                   audiotape. However, a technical accuracy review of the
                   objectives and script can be conducted.

                   Following production of the audiotape, individual and small group
                   tryouts of the edited master tape can be accomplished. If
                   deficiencies or problems are identified and cannot be corrected
                   by additional editing, another audio recording session may be
                   necessary.


Summative          The operational tryouts for the summative evaluation of
evaluation         instructional audiotapes should be conducted at various sites.

                   If the audiotape is designed as supporting material, it may also be
                   necessary to present the primary instructional material for the
                   evaluation. This would allow the audio instruction to be reviewed
                   within the proper context, which will provide more meaningful and
                   valid results.

                   Results of these evaluations are used to revise and finalize the
                   audiotape instruction.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5        1 November 2002                                        207




Operational          The operational evaluation is an ongoing process that is
evaluation           accomplished after the formative and summative evaluations.
                     This evaluation is based on internal and external feedback data
                     such as:
                         Instructor/facilitator comments (internal)
                         Student critiques (internal)
                         Test results (internal)
                         Inspection and evaluation reports (external)

                     As with the summative evaluation, the audiotape should be
                     reviewed along with the primary instruction it was designed to
                     support. Also, it may be difficult to isolate and determine the
                     actual effectiveness of the audiotape instruction from test results,
                     unless the material tested was only provided in the audiotape.


General evaluation   The following are typical evaluation criteria for audiotape
criteria             instruction:

                     Voice quality:                     Volume settings:
                        Naturalness and                    Absence of peaks and
                        spontaneity                        drops
                        Articulation                       Appropriate microphone
                        Pitch                              placement

                     Music:                             Ambient noise:
                       Did it enhance or detract          Absence of background
                       from narration?                    noise/distractions
                       Was the amount and
                       length appropriate?              Editing:
                                                           Absence of noticeable
                     Sound effects:                        audio ‘cuts’ or dubbing
                       Did it enhance or detract
                       from narration?                  Sequence/format:
                                                          Logical sequence and
                     Pacing:                              format of instruction
                       Smoothness of flow

                                                           guide, and hold attention?
                                                           Were the objectives met?

                             Analysis Considerations


Why use audio-      Traditional audioconferencing using the telephone system and
conferencing?       audio bridging capabilities is a simple, flexible, interactive
                    instructional delivery system. Since the telephone is widely
                    available, the instructor can reach students at almost any
                    location. Military use of audioconferencing is particularly cost-
                    effective if DoD telephone networks are used.


When to use         Audioconferencing can be used:
audioconferencing      When real-time discussion, interaction, and feedback are
                       required.
                       To reduce the students’ sense of isolation and distance.
                       To provide instruction from experts at other locations.

                    Audioconferencing instruction is most effective when combined
                    with other types of media.


Audioconferencing   In order to determine the feasibility of using audioconferencing as
resource            an instructional medium, you must identify and assess the
requirements and    resource requirements and constraints. Although
constraints         audioconferencing can also be accomplished using computer
                    networks, this section only addresses audioconferencing using
                    the public telephone system.

                        Equipment. Minimum required equipment would include a
                        telephone with audio bridging capability and a speakerphone
                        system for larger groups.
                        Facilities. No special facilities are required.
                        Funding. Additional funding would be required for long
                        distance calling fees if the DoD telephone network (DSN)
                        would not be used.
                        Personnel. Other than the participants, moderators may be
                        required.
                        Time. Comparatively, development times per hour of
                        audioconferencing instruction, will normally be less than other
                        media.

                               Design Considerations


Determine the        Determine the purpose of the audioconference and the specific
objectives           learning objectives that must be achieved. Decide what it is you
                     want to do and accomplish with the audioconference.


Determine what       Audioconferencing can be conducted using only audio
approach to use      communications between the participants, or combined with other
                     instructional media such as print materials (text, pictures,
                     graphics, etc.), videos, and fax machines. Based on how the
                     audioconferencing will be conducted, several instructional
                     approaches can be employed to include:

                         Lectures
                         Interviews
                         Guest speaker presentations
                         Student presentations
                         Group discussions or debates
                         Question and answer sessions

                     Determine what type of test and evaluation methods should be
                     used to measure the students’ comprehension of the instruction
                     provided. AF HDBK 36-2235, Volume 12, Test and
                     Measurement Handbook, provides general guidance.


General design       The challenge of designing an effective interactive
guidelines           audioconferencing course is to balance the strengths of the
                     medium with its limitations. The greatest strength of interactive
                     audioconferencing is its capability for interactivity; its major
                     limitation is the absence of visual communication. To exploit its
                     strength, design sessions that are interactive as described below.
                     To minimize the limitations of visual cues, provide supplementary
                     print materials in advance and ‘humanize’ the session by making
                     the learners feel welcome.

                     Simultaneous use of WWW/Intranets and other computer
                     networks can provide “live” video of participants and other images
                     and data.

                                                                   Continued on next page

                        Limit sessions to 2 hours.
                        Schedule a break after 50-60 minutes of instruction.
                        Limit key concepts to 3-5 per hour.
                        Limit number of participants to maximize interaction; rule of
                        thumb is 15-20 students.

                            Development Considerations


Development         When developing audioconference instruction, consider the
techniques          following general techniques:

                        Develop a lesson plan or ‘script’ of the planned session.
                        Divide the content into 10-15 minute presentation segments.
                        Connect new information with previous information.
                        Plan/schedule breaks after 50-60 minutes of instruction.
                        Alternate lectures with student interaction activities such as
                        student presentations, role-playing exercises, brainstorming,
                        question/answer, etc.
                        Include activities in the course syllabus/agenda that
                        encourage independent study and student-to-student
                        interaction.
                        Develop outlines and handouts for use during the session.
                        Develop quizzes or exercises to assess student
                        comprehension of material.


Pre-conference      Develop a read-ahead package for the students that contains:
package
                        Welcome letter(s) with the instructor’s biography and picture.
                        Class roster with background information about each student.
                        Course syllabus, agenda, ground rules and protocols.
                        Readings, assignments, and bibliography.
                        Handouts with graphics, charts, pictures, etc., that can be
                        used during the session.
                        Points of contact and instructions on how to connect to the
                        conference call with phone numbers for technical assistance
                        if disconnected.
                        Critique forms.

                    Place read ahead materials on the Web (in addition to snail mail).
                    Conduct an orientation conference call prior to the first scheduled
                    session to help acquaint learners with the medium.

                        Review phone protocol.
                        Ask learners to introduce themselves.
                        Encourage participants to use a speakerphone or headset so
                        that their hands will be free to take notes or to do exercises.

                                                                  Continued on next page

                           Implementation Considerations


Conducting an       Conduct an orientation audioconference prior to the first
orientation         scheduled session to help acquaint students with the medium
session             and procedures. During this orientation:

                        Introduce yourself and advise the students on how they
                        should address you.
                        Ask the students to introduce themselves.
                        Discuss what to do and who to contact if they experience any

                        Review the protocol for asking questions and making
                        comments. Students should preface any comments with their
                        name and location.
                        Review any other audioconference ground rules or etiquette
                        as applicable.
                        Discuss the use of the audioconference equipment.
                        Encourage students to use a speakerphone or headset so
                        that their hands will be free to take notes or to do exercises
                        during the sessions.

                        Acknowledge and welcome any latecomers.

                    Use the following techniques when conducting an
                    audioconferencing session:

                        Speak in a normal conversational tone, and slow enough to
                        be understood.
                        Vary the pace of the session to maintain interest and energy.
                        Engage students in discussions, debates, role-playing, etc.
                        Do not let one person monopolize the time.

                                                                  Continued on next page

                            Evaluation Considerations


Evaluation of       The evaluation process for audioconferencing instruction consists
audioconferencing   of a formative, summative, and operational evaluation. If the
instruction         audioconferencing instruction was developed to support other
                    primary instructional media, then the instruction should be
                    evaluated as part of the primary lesson/course evaluation.

                    The distance learning evaluation metrics are described in
                    Chapter 2. The general guidelines for evaluations are contained
                    in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting handbooks.

                    This section addresses the special considerations for conducting
                    evaluations of audioconferences when developed as the primary
                    instructional medium.


Formative           The formative evaluation begins in the analysis phase and
evaluation          continues through the development phase of the ISD process.
                    During the initial phases of development, the primary focus would
                    be on the technical accuracy of the learning objectives, content,
                    and test items.

                    An initial evaluation of the lesson plan/script should be
                    accomplished. Once a ‘draft’ version of the audioconferencing
                    session is developed, plan and conduct individual and small
                    group tryouts of the instruction. General areas to evaluate
                    include:
                         Instructional session organization, structure, presentation,
                         and format.
                         Instructor knowledge, presentation and delivery techniques,
                         and effectiveness.
                         Instructional content clarity, accuracy, relevancy, currency,
                         effectiveness, and completeness.
                         Use, clarity, relevancy, and effectiveness of supporting
                         instructional materials (e.g., text, pictures, graphics,
                         diagrams, quizzes, etc.).
                         Effectiveness of interactive student activities.
                         Availability, use, reliability, and effectiveness of
                         audioconference system equipment.
                         Availability and effectiveness of technical support.
                         Student comprehension and accomplishment of the learning
                         objectives.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        216




Summative        The operational tryouts for the summative evaluation of the
evaluation       audioconferencing instruction should be conducted with several
                 of the applicable sites participating at the same time.

                 Results of these evaluations are used to revise and finalize the
                 audioconferencing instruction.


Operational      The operational evaluation is an ongoing process that is
evaluation       accomplished after the formative and summative evaluations.
                 This evaluation is based on internal and external feedback data
                 such as:

                     Instructor/facilitator comments (internal)
                     Student critiques (internal)
                     Test results (internal)
                     Inspection and evaluation reports (external)

                 To ensure the quality of the instruction is maintained, conduct
                 these evaluations on a regular basis. There is always room for
                 improvement.

                COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION
                                     Overview


Introduction       This chapter describes ISD considerations for the analysis,
                   design, development, implementation, and evaluation of
                   Computer-Mediated Communication. Computer-Mediated
                   Communication enables individuals, groups, and organizations to
                   maintain continuous communications and information exchanges.
                   Computer-Mediated Communication expands access to human
                   and information resources. Two of the Computer-Mediated
                   Communication applications that can greatly impact distance
                   learning are audiographics and computer-mediated conferencing.

                               Analysis Considerations


Why use               Audiographics provides real-time communication and interaction.
audiographics?        Audiographic participants can audioconference using the
                      telephone system, as well as share instructional materials
                      simultaneously using computer networks. (Audiographics can
                      also be accomplished to some degree by combining the phone
                      system, fax machine, and hard copy delivery systems).
                      Audiographics is usually considered to involve simultaneous
                      transmission of audio and graphic information across a
                      telecommunications network.


When to use           Audiographics can be used:
audiographics
                          When real-time discussion and feedback are required.
                          When collaboration is required on documents, assignments,
                          projects, etc.
                          To provide instruction from experts at other remote sites.
                          To reduce the students’ sense of isolation and distance.


Audiographics         To determine the feasibility of using audiographics as an
resource              instructional medium, you must identify and assess the resource
requirements and      requirements and constraints. Audiographics is similar to
constraints           audioconferencing in that it uses the telephone system. Although
                      limited audiographic instruction can also be accomplished using
                      only computer networks, this type of audiographics is not
                      included in this section.

                          Equipment. Minimum required equipment for each
                          participant or group would include a networked computer,
                          telephone with audio bridging capability, and a speakerphone
                          system for larger groups.
                          Facilities. Facility requirements for participating sites would
                          include reliable network access to Internet/Intranet/Electronic
                          Bulletin Board System (BBS).

                                                                    Continued on next page

Audiographics             Funding. Funding may be required for PCs, software, and
resource                  network systems/access if they are not already in place at all
requirements and          participating sites. Additional funding is also required for long

                          Personnel. Other than the participants, a moderator /
                          facilitator may sometimes be required.
                          Time. As with audioconferencing, development time- per-
                          hour of audiographic instruction, will normally be less than
                          other media.


Is audiographics      If existing DoD telephone networks and computers with
cost-effective?       Internet/Intranet/BBS access are used, audiographics can be
                      very cost-effective as an instructional delivery system. If
                      networked computers are not available at all sites, then the cost-
                      effectiveness of the instruction would depend primarily on the
                      total effort and cost required installing the necessary systems.

                                Design Considerations


Determine the        Determine the purpose of the audiographic instruction and the
objectives           specific learning objectives that must be achieved. Decide what it
                     is you want to do and accomplish with this instructional medium.


Determine what       Audiographics can be conducted using only audio
approach to use      communications between the participants, or combined with
                     networked computers and other instructional media such as print
                     materials (text, pictures, graphics, etc.), videos, and fax
                     machines. Based on how the audiographics session will be
                     conducted, several instructional approaches can be employed to
                     include:

                         Lectures
                         Interviews
                         Guest speaker presentations
                         Student presentations
                         On-line group collaborative activities
                         Group discussions or debates
                         Question and answer sessions

                     Determine what type of test and evaluation methods should be
                     used to measure the students’ comprehension of the instruction
                     provided. AF HDBK 36-2235, Volume 12, Test and
                     Measurement Handbook, provides general guidance.


General design       The same general guidelines provided for audioconferencing,
guidelines           also apply to audiographics since the primary instructional
                     component of both is two-way audio. The only significant
                     difference between the two is the supporting media technologies
                     that are used to deliver other instructional materials.

                     The design of audiographic instruction should draw upon the
                     greatest strength of audiographics - that is the capability for
                     students to see and share the same computer file or document
                     on their individual PCs. This facilitates a high level of interactivity
                     and collaboration among the students.

                                                                      Continued on next page

                        Provide students with the opportunity to set their own goals
                        and objectives.
                        Encourage the practical application of content, and relate
                        subject matter to student's needs and job tasks.
                        Instruction and learning at a distance takes more time. Be
                        realistic in the amount of content presented, and the
                        assignments given.

Development        When developing audiographic instruction, consider the following
techniques         general techniques:

                       Develop a lesson plan or ‘script’ of the planned session.
                       Divide the content into 10-15 minute presentation segments.
                       Connect new information with previous information.
                       Plan/schedule breaks after 50 minutes of instruction.
                       Alternate lectures with interactive student interaction activities
                       such as student presentations, on-line group exercises, case
                       studies, question/answer, etc.
                       Include activities in the course syllabus/agenda that
                       encourage independent study and student-to-student
                       interaction.
                       Develop outlines and handouts for use during the session.
                       Develop quizzes or exercises to assess student
                       comprehension of material.


Audiographics      Develop a read-ahead package for the students that contains:
pre-session
package                Welcome letter(s) with the instructor’s biography and picture.
                       Class roster with background information about each student.
                       Course syllabus, agenda, ground rules, and protocols.
                       Readings, assignments, and bibliography.
                       Handouts, CD-ROMs, diskettes, graphics, charts, pictures,
                       etc., that can be used during the session.
                       Points of contact and instructions on how to connect to the
                       conference call and network server, with phone numbers for
                       technical assistance if disconnected.
                       Critique forms (if not provided on-line).

                   Plan to mail the packages early so the students will have them 1-
                   2 weeks prior to the audiographics session.

session            During this orientation:

                       Introduce yourself and advise the students on how they
                       should address you.
                       Ask the students to introduce themselves.
                       Discuss what to do and who to contact if they experience any
                       problems.
                       Review the protocol for asking questions and making
                       comments. Students should preface any comments with their
                       name and location.
                       Review the procedures and protocol for collaborating on
                       shared applications.
                       Review any other ground rules or etiquette as applicable.
                       Discuss the use of the audioconferencing and computer
                       network systems. Encourage students to use a
                       speakerphone or headset so that their hands will be free to
                       take notes or work on the computer during the sessions.
                       For practice, have the students bring up a pre-selected
                       ‘demo’ file from the Web/FTP site, CD-ROM, or diskette
                       provided in the pre-session package (if applicable).
                       Bring up a file for all to share as a demonstration, and allow
                       time for everyone to manipulate the data to practice using the
                       system.

                       As students join in, confirm that they have established a
                       connection to the designated audiographics server.
                       Remind students to mute their speakerphones as
                       appropriate.
                       At the scheduled time, either take attendance using a simple
                       roll call or accomplish this electronically.
                       Review the agenda on-line if possible, and clearly state the
                       purpose of the session.
                       Acknowledge and welcome any latecomers.

                       Do not let one person monopolize the audio or on-line time.
                       Ask questions and direct them at individual students when
                       possible.
                       Allow 10-15 seconds after asking a question before

                       Do a mid-way evaluation to ensure students’ requirements
                       are being met. You can also have students measure their
                       own progress through self-assessment items such as study
                       questions, checklists and self-tests.
                       Allow time for questions and answers at the end. Encourage
                       students to also telephone, or E-mail you and/or each other
                       with questions and comments.
                       If collaboration among students is a goal, devise activities or
                       projects that require use of the telephone and/or E-mail.

                           Evaluation Considerations


Evaluation of      The evaluation process for audiographics instruction consists of a
audiographics      formative, summative, and operational evaluation. If the
instruction        audiographics instruction was developed to support other primary
                   instructional media, then the instruction should be evaluated as
                   part of the primary lesson/course evaluation.

                   The distance learning evaluation metrics are described in
                   Chapter 2. The general guidelines for evaluations are contained
                   in MIL-PRF-29612 and supporting handbooks.

                   This section addresses the special considerations for conducting
                   evaluations of audiographics sessions when developed as the
                   primary instructional medium.


Formative          The formative evaluation begins in the analysis phase and
evaluation         continues through the development phase of the ISD process.
                   During the initial phases of development, the primary focus would
                   be on the technical accuracy of the learning objectives, content,
                   and test items.

                   An initial evaluation of the lesson plan/script should be
                   accomplished. Once a ‘draft’ version of the audiographics
                   session is developed, plan and conduct individual and small
                   group tryouts of the instruction can be accomplished. General
                   areas to evaluate include:

                       Instructional session organization, structure, presentation,
                       and format.
                       Instructor knowledge, presentation and delivery techniques,
                       and effectiveness.
                       Instructional content clarity, accuracy, relevancy, currency,
                       effectiveness, and completeness.
                       Use, clarity, relevancy, and effectiveness of supporting
                       instructional materials (e.g., text, pictures, graphics,
                       diagrams, quizzes, etc.).
                       Effectiveness of interactive student activities.
                       Availability, ease of use, reliability, and effectiveness of
                       audioconference system and equipment.

                                                                 Continued on next page

                     Student comprehension and accomplishment of the learning
                     objectives.


Summative        The operational tryouts for the summative evaluation of the
evaluation       audiographics instruction should be conducted with several of the
                 applicable sites participating at the same time.

                 Results of these evaluations are used to revise and finalize the
                 instruction.


Operational      The operational evaluation is an ongoing process that is
evaluation       accomplished after the formative and summative evaluations.
                 This evaluation is based on internal and external feedback data
                 such as:

                     Instructor/facilitator comments (internal)
                     Student critiques (internal)
                     Test results (internal)
                     Inspection and evaluation reports (external)

                 To ensure the quality of the instruction is maintained, conduct
                 these evaluations on a regular basis. There is always room for
                 improvement.

                     Computer-Mediated Conferencing
                             Analysis Considerations


Why use computer-   Computer-mediated conferencing can range from simple E-mail
mediated            discussion between two people to list servers to sophisticated
conferencing?       groupware programs like FirstClass or Lotus Notes which allow
                    discussion among dozens of participants. Computer-mediated
                    conferencing involves two types of interaction: (1) interaction
                    between the learner and the material content; (2) interaction with
                    others about the course material. Computer-mediated
                    conferencing enables messages to be automatically sorted into
                    pre-selected categories or “conferences” which can be followed
                    as discussion “threads.” Computer-mediated conferencing
                    products often include functions allowing instructors to see who
                    has read a certain message. Computer-mediated conferencing
                    can be done “live” via chat rooms (computer-mediated
                    conferencing software often includes real-time chat via text
                    and/or audio), or it can be conducted as an asynchronous
                    learning experience via E-mail or the threaded discussions.
                    Computer-mediated conferencing helps to develop student
                    independence and a self-directed approach to the instruction.

                    New developments in the area of computer-mediated
                    conferencing include:

                        Groupware: includes E-mail and shared databases.
                        Synchronous communication: real-time communications
                        involving voice and video images.
                        Audio mail and Video mail: similar to E-mail but the
                        messages are audio messages and or video messages.


When to use         Computer-mediated conferencing is most appropriate for:

                        information.

                        A means of correspondence between instructors and
                        students.
                        Threaded discussions and group instruction.

                                                                  Continued on next page

Computer-             To determine the feasibility of using computer-mediated

requirements and      determine if it will meet requirements.
constraints
                          Equipment. Minimum required equipment for each
                          participant would include a properly configured computer with
                          access to Internet/Intranet or other telecommunications
                          system.
                          Facilities. No specific facility requirements other than
                          student access to a facility with the required equipment.
                          Funding. Funding may be required for PCs, software, and
                          network systems if they are not already in place at all
                          participating sites. Additional funding may also be required
                          for network access and services if not presently available.
                          Personnel. Technical support personnel would be required
                          to maintain the computer-mediated conferencing system (in-
                          house or contract). Also, assess user computer skills to
                          determine if that will be a constraint, and whether training will
                          be required. Instructor personnel may require the assistance
                          of others to respond to E-mails; the administrative burden of
                          individualized communications placed on instructor staff must
                          be factored into instructor requirements.
                          Time. If the computer/network system is not already in
                          place, a significant amount of lead-time will be required. If
                          the computer/network system exists, then time required for a
                          computer-mediated conferencing system should not be a
                          constraint.

                     medium.


Determine what       There are five types of computer-mediated conferencing
approach to use      interaction that will need to be considered in determining the
                     approach to be taken in the design and development of
                     computer-mediated conferencing:

                         Learner and instructor
                         Learner to learner
                         Instructor with content

considerations       communication, teaching, and learning strategies to make it feel
                     and function like a traditional classroom. That’s quite a challenge
                     given that most computer-mediated conferencing learners are not
                     likely ever to meet one another in person and the fact they will
                     only communicate through a personal computer. The challenge
                     for the designer is to transform the desktop computer into a
                     virtual classroom. Use the following to increase the effectiveness
                     of learning via computer-mediated conferencing.

                        Do a thorough needs analysis at the beginning to determine
                        learner needs; is computer-mediated conferencing
                        appropriate for application for the learner needs?

                        Identify appropriate learning objectives

                                                                    Continued on next page

General computer-   The design of computer-mediated conferencing applications
mediated            should support the following general functions:
conferencing
functions           To allow students:
                        Access course information and materials.
                        Exchange information and ideas with others.
                        Ask/answer questions.
                        Work on assignments alone or collaborate with others.

                    To allow instructors to:
                           Administer and manage course information and materials.
                           Distribute student assignments and provide feedback.
                           Communicate with the students.
                           Facilitate interaction and collaboration on instruction
                           provided.


E-mail design       The E-mail application would not be specifically designed and
features and        developed. If an E-mail system is not already in place or
capabilities        available on each PC to be used, then a COTS E-mail application
                    may need to be selected for use by some of the individuals. In
                    most cases, this selection would be based on personal
                    preferences unless one is provided or dictated. The most popular
                    E-mail applications available today, all have similar features and
                    capabilities. Any of these client applications would most likely be
                    acceptable for use.

General bulletin      Bulletin boards should be designed to provide information and
board design          encourage student interaction. They should:
guidelines
                          Allow instructors to post course information such as
                          schedules, assignments, reference information and sources,
                          etc.
                          Allow instructors to provide files containing courseware and
                          other instructional materials that can be downloaded by the
                          students.
                          Provide access control on appropriate root directories,
                          system files, etc.
                          Establish discussion groups that allow students to read what
                          others have written, and respond to the author publicly or
                          privately.
                          Allow students to post new ideas, opinions, or requests to the
                          discussion group.
                          Allow students to sort discussion group messages by date,
                          author, subject, or topic.
                          Provide a knowledge base with general information,
                          frequently asked questions (FAQ), etc., that can be searched
                          using keywords or phrases.
                          Provide links to other important sites and reference sources.

                            Development Considerations


E-mail              In preparing for sending out E-mail, consider accomplishing the
development         following:

                        Create forwarding accounts (mailing lists) for individual
                        classes or groups.
                        Create E-mail form letters or “templates” that can be re-used
                        for normal, recurring correspondence and course
                        administration.


Bulletin board      Determine first what computer will be used as the server, and
development         whether it has the capacity to support the planned computer-
                    mediated conferencing applications and functions. Once you’ve
                    identified the server, develop the content that will be posted or
                    accessed on the bulletin board, to include:

                        General course information such as objectives, requirements,
                        schedule, etc.
                        Student assignments, required readings, tests, reference
                        materials, etc.
                        Class rosters with student names, background information, E-
                        mail addresses, etc.
                        Discussion groups and topics that will be used for the course.
                        Technical support information, points of contact, links, etc.
                        Resource list with sources of information and links to
                        electronic libraries and other appropriate sites.
                        Electronic evaluation and feedback forms.


General             Consider the following when working with general development
development         guidelines:
guidelines
                        Need to state up-front that a student’s grade is directly
                        related to his/her participation.
                        Must personalize or humanize this high tech instructional
                        approach.
                        Make personal contact with the learner via letter or phone call
                        before the course begins.

                                                                  Continued on next page

General             Create an orientation program:
development            Agenda.
guidelines             Course syllabus.
(Continued)            Readings.
                       Handouts; incorporate graphics, charts, pictures, etc., that
                       can be used during the session.
                       Assignments.
                       Class roster with background information about each
                       participant.
                       Bibliography.
                       Instructor biography with a picture.
                       Instructions on how to get connected.
                       Ground rules.
                       Phone number for technical assistance.
                       Evaluation form.
                       Mail out so learners will have the packet 1-2 weeks in
                       advance of the first session.

                    Provide a tutorial on how to use the software prior to the first
                    class.

                    Post a “How to Take an On-Line Course” on a Web site.

                    Encourage learners to develop their own learning strategy:
                       Establish a study pattern.
                       Aggressively seek clarification and feedback.
                       Become comfortable with the technology.
                       Manage information overload.
                       Decide on when and how often to contribute.


Other user       Develop handouts or other appropriate materials that provide
information      computer-mediated conferencing procedures and protocol, as
                 well as information on how to use the applications. Include this
                 type of information in the FAQ section or a separate section of
                 the bulletin board.

                             Implementation Considerations


E-mail and bulletin   Consider the following actions when implementing the computer-
board                 mediated conferencing applications:
considerations
                          Assign user names and passwords to the students if not
                          already done.
                          Review all resource lists and links provided in the bulletin
                          board and update them as required.
                          Send out a welcome “test” message to all students that
                          requires a reply.
                          Initiate and conduct a group discussion as an orientation for
                          students, and ensure all students participate.
                          Give students assignments that will require the use of E-mail
                          and the bulletin board.
                          Monitor all discussion groups, intervening only if necessary.
                          Provide timely feedback and responses to student questions,
                          test results, etc.


Implementation        Consider the following to help ensure effective computer-
                      mediated instruction or programs:

                      How to Begin
                         Begin course with introductions to help create a friendly
                         learning environment.
                         Consider establishing a buddy system where learners are
                         partnered with other learners.
                         Ask learners for their personal goals or objectives for the
                         class.

                      On-line Ground Rules
                        Explain on-line ‘netiquette.’
                            Keywords. Use keywords in E-mail subject line for easy
                            reference.
                            One-message, one-topic rule. Discuss only one idea in
                            each message supported by examples.
                            Short messages. No one wants to read a 500-word E-
                            mail, so shorter is better. Try 2-3 short messages rather
                            than 1 long one.

                                                                    Continued on next page

Implementation              Typos. For discussion E-mails, do not worry about typos
(Continued)                 or grammar errors. Forgive others’ typos by focusing on
                            what they are saying, and not format.
                            Tone. Watch the tone of your E-mails by writing in a
                            conversational style, as if you were there in person. Use
                            “emoticons” to express your emotions.

                    Your Role as Guide
                       Remember role of instructor has changed to one whose
                       primary role is to guide and support the learning process.
                       Promote peer learning by encouraging participation and
                       asking as many questions as you answer.
                       Allow time for learners to learn.
                       Reinforce positive behavior; correct inappropriate behavior.
                       Insist on retaining original messages when responding to
                       someone via E-mail.
                       Do not lecture and avoid an authoritarian style.

                    Effective Strategies
                        Model appropriate interaction and facilitation techniques to
                        the learners.
                        Announce theme of each thread and the agenda for it.
                        Keep the discussion on track by weaving together various
                        discussion threads and course components.
                        Set reasonable time limits for responses realizing that not all
                        learners have daily access to the Web.
                        Be timely in responses.
                        Present opposite views.
                        Seek learner feedback.
                           Ask direct questions.
                           Conduct polls.
                           Tie discussion to participants’ comments made earlier.
                           Compliment participants.

                    How to Wrap-up and Follow-up
                       Conclude threads clearly, so there is no doubt you are
                       moving on.
                       Use technical support.
                       Remind participants to submit their evaluations.

                             Evaluation Considerations


Evaluation of       The evaluation process for E-mail and bulletin board applications
computer-mediated   would normally be accomplished as part of the evaluation of the
conferencing        primary instructional media. The distance learning evaluation
                    metrics are described in Chapter 2. The general guidelines for
                    evaluations are contained in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting
                    handbooks.

                    This section addresses the special considerations for conducting
                    evaluations of computer-mediated conferencing when developed
                    as a collateral instructional media.


Computer-           As part of the evaluation and quality improvement process, on-
mediated            line electronic student critique forms and automatic E-mail
conferencing        “comment” links provided on the bulletin board can be used to
evaluation          provide timely feedback to instructor. Following are general
considerations      areas to consider in the evaluation of computer-mediated
                    conferencing:

                    Technical:
                       Availability and reliability of computer-mediated conferencing
                       computers.
                       Network access and reliability.
                       Availability and effectiveness of technical support.
                       Computer-mediated conferencing server access and
                       reliability.

                    E-mail:
                       E-mail client application (functionality, reliability, etc.)
                       Instructor use and application.

                  ISD CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTERACTIVE
                        MULTIMEDIA INSTRUCTION
                                        Overview


Introduction          The specific ISD analysis, design, development, implementation,
                      and evaluation processes for Interactive Multimedia Instruction
                      (IMI) are described in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting
                      handbooks.

                      This chapter addresses special ISD considerations for the
                      application of IMI technologies in delivering instruction. Although
                      the design and application of each IMI product may be somewhat
                      different, the common factor throughout all of these IMI
                      technologies is the integration of multiple media elements (text,
                      audio, video, graphics, etc.) into a single application. The ISD
                      considerations provided in this chapter apply to IMI as an entire
                      group of multimedia applications with specific differences
                      mentioned in each stage.


What is IMI?          As indicated in Chapters 3 and 4, IMI consists of various
                      computer-based training and training support technologies that
                      can be used individually, or in combination with each other.
                      These include the following:

                          Interactive Courseware
                          Computer-Based Instruction/Computer-Based Training
                          Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction
                          Electronic Support Systems/Job Performance Aids
                          Computer Simulation


General               IMI technologies can be inserted in local resident programs, as
applications of IMI   well as applied in the distance learning environment. Although
technologies          the only real distinguishing factor between the two applications of
                      IMI is the physical separation of the instructor or courseware from
                      the students, there are differences in the way certain types of
                      distance learning IMI are accessed, delivered, and accomplished
                      by the students.

                                                                    Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        241




General                    IMI insertion in resident programs. The typical or traditional
applications of IMI        resident IMI course consists of instructor-led and self-paced
technologies               instruction accomplished primarily in a “stand-alone” mode.
(Continued)                Normally, the IMI program files are either downloaded and
                           installed on the user’s workstation, or accessed from a disk
                           drive (e.g., floppy, CD-ROM, DVD) or LAN server.

                           IMI applied in non-resident programs. Distance learning IMI
                           can either be delivered in the same stand-alone manner as
                           described for resident programs, or accessed from a distant
                           server over the Internet/Intranet and accomplished on-line.


IMI delivery           Use of the on-line access method for IMI has been limited to wide
constraints            bandwidth LANs/WANs with sufficient transmission capacity to
                       deliver true multimedia instruction without presentation delays or
                       disruptions. Because of present bandwidth and transmission
                       constraints, most distance learning IMI courses cannot be
                       effectively accomplished on-line over the commercial
                       Internet/WWW. These constraints have led to the design and
                       development of “hybrid” IMI courses that only require some of the
                       courseware program or support files to be transmitted over the
                       network system.


Hybrid IMI             In general, a hybrid IMI course is one that uses more than one
distance learning      medium or technology to access and deliver the instruction. That
applications           is, the courseware files may not all be “packaged” together and
                       reside in one location or medium.

                       Described below are two of the general types of on-line hybrid
                       courses:

                           One type of hybrid is a course where the main program files
                           reside and run on a distant server. The larger support data
                           files (e.g., graphic and video files) are accessed directly from
                           a separate high capacity storage device such as the user’s
                           hard drive, CD-ROM, DVD, etc. This minimizes the
                           bandwidth requirements and constraints of transmitting the
                           entire course content over the Internet/Intranet.

                                                                       Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       242




Hybrid IMI                 Another type of hybrid is a course where most, if not all of the
distance learning          program and support files are either downloaded onto the
applications               user’s hard drive or accessed from a CD-ROM, DVD, etc.
(Continued)                The course is accomplished on-line, and the Internet/Intranet
                           connection is used to link to a distant server that provides
                           automatic file updates for the course as it is accomplished.
                           These course content updates are “transparent” to the user.


IMI versus IBI         For the purposes of this handbook, a distinction is made between
                       distance learning IMI and Internet Based Instruction (IBI).
                       Presently, the differences in the design, development, and
                       implementation of true IMI versus IBI (i.e., Web-based HTML
                       courseware) are significant enough to warrant discussing the two
                       separately. ISD considerations for IBI are provided in Chapter 9.


Focus of this          The primary focus of this chapter is on the ISD process for IMI
chapter                applied in a distance learning environment. Although the general
                       ISD process for stand-alone IMI in resident and non-resident
                       courses are essentially the same, there are some design and
                       development differences that need to be considered for distance
                       learning IMI.

                       Refer to MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting handbooks for
                       specific ISD information on IMI.

                              Analysis Considerations

Why use IMI?          As stated in MIL-HDBK-29612-3, “Interactive Multimedia
                      Instruction may be a suitable instructional media delivery system
                      for many training objectives. Thanks to the rapid development of
                      computer technology, it is now possible to create, at a reasonable
                      price, new ways of designing and developing educational and
                      training materials. Today, computers can be used to deliver
                      interactive, competency-based, individualized, multimedia
                      instruction. Interactive Multimedia Instruction can tailor instruction
                      to the individual student’s needs, be deployable, reach a greater
                      audience, and provide ‘just-in-time’ instruction.”


When to use IMI       IMI can be used:

                          When there are a large number of students distributed
                          throughout multiple locations and a backlog of students
                          exists.
                          When accomplishment of the learning objectives requires
                          continuous practice, or problem-solving and decision-making
                          knowledge and skills.
                          When the students vary in experience, learning style, and skill
                          level.
                          When students need to learn in a non-threatening
                          environment
                          To allow students to practice a skill on an expensive piece of
                          equipment and potentially hazardous or high-risk activities
                          that cannot be accomplished using actual equipment.


IMI requirements      It is important to identify and assess the IMI resource
and constraints       requirements and constraints. This will help to determine the
                      feasibility of developing IMI for distance learning.

                          Equipment. The hardware requirements and considerations
                          would be as specified in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting
                          handbooks. In addition, a network system with
                          Internet/Intranet access will be required if the IMI will be
                          delivered and/or accomplished on-line.
                          Facilities. No special facilities are required.

                                                                      Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       245




IMI requirements          Funding. Is there a budget? This may affect the complexity
and constraints           and amount of IMI selected, and whether some or all of the
(Continued)               development effort can be outsourced.

                          Personnel. The recommended project management and IMI
                          team personnel are identified in Chapter 2. Identifying the
                          minimum personnel required will be necessary to determine
                          in-house support capability. Again, expertise may vary
                          depending on the complexity of the application such as in
                          intelligent tutoring agents, and simulation.

                          Time. Is there a time limit? Depending on the type (e.g.,
                          ICAI) and amount (hours) of IMI to be developed, significant
                          lead-time may be required and could be a constraint.


In-house              There are many factors to consider in making this decision.
development or        However, the most significant factors are most likely to be the
outsource?            capability and availability of in-house resources to support the
                      design, development, and maintenance of the required
                      courseware. Courses incorporating instructional technologies
                      such as expert systems, complex animations, professional
                      recordings, and simulations are usually good candidate courses
                      for outsourcing due to the unique skills and expertise required.
                      Additional considerations in determination of whether the
                      development of the course should be outsourced are
                      technological upgrades, content updates, and maintenance.


Is IMI                A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis would need to be
cost-effective?       conducted to determine this. The development of IMI for distance
                      learning will in many cases be cost-effective, particularly for large
                      established programs that have high student throughput and
                      stable course content. More importantly, the risk associated with
                      not using simulated environments is much greater than the
                      investment in the technology.

                                   Section B
                             Design Considerations

Determine the        As with any instructional course, it is important to determine the
objectives           specific learning objectives to be accomplished, and what it is you
                     want to do and accomplish with the IMI. The learning objectives
                     will drive the selection of the type and design of the distance
                     learning instruction.


Determine what       This will be a key decision in the design process for distance
approach to use      learning IMI since the mix of multimedia is dependent on what can
                     be delivered in a timely and cost-efficient manner as well as the
                     teaching methodology. The key considerations in the selection of
                     a delivery approach for IMI courses include:

                         Number of students and the frequency of the course offering.
                         Geographical dispersion of students and training sites.
                         Content stability and frequency of required revisions.
                         Courseware configuration control and management.
                         Network system capabilities and connectivity.
                         Client computer configuration and capabilities.

                     As discussed earlier, there are two delivery approaches that can
                     be taken when considering interactive courseware, EPSS, Job
                     Performance Aids, and simulation:

                         Stand-alone IMI that is delivered off-line either through the
                         IMI program files being either downloaded and installed on
                         the user’s workstation (which required greater storage
                         capacity), or accessed from a disk drive (e.g., floppy, CD-
                         ROM, DVD) or LAN server.

                         IMI that is delivered on-line over the Internet/Intranet. This
                         would require a wide bandwidth network, unless a hybrid
                         course is developed. Although the hybrid approach may not
                         necessarily be a desirable or practical option for delivery of

                         How will student progress be tracked and performance be

                                Section C
                        Development Considerations

Special             The actual development of Interactive Multimedia Instruction for
considerations      non-resident courses would not be much different than for
                    resident courses. However, there are some special
                    considerations for distance learning IMI:
                        For the development of on-line courses, the lowest delivery
                        platform client computer configuration and Internet/Intranet
                        connectivity will need to be determined at all potential sites.
                        For example, developers should be cautious when producing
                        an IMI course with a video segment that uses MPEG
                        compression that requires a special video card for play back.
                        Technically, there are certain limitations on the capacities of
                        different sized servers where courseware can be stored and
                        accessed by students. This is particularly applicable to
                        simulation courseware. The maximum number of students
                        that will be taking an on-line course at the same time will
                        need to be determined to identify server requirements.
                        The development of hybrid courseware is more complex and
                        will require special programming efforts. Proper software and
                        hardware configuration control and documentation will be
                        important.
                        Some remote student training may be required in PC
                        operations, network or courseware access procedures, and
                        other fundamental computer skills. Additional student
                        materials such as instructional handouts, guides, or a tutorial
                        computer program for these students will need to be
                        developed in coordination with the production of the
                        interactive courseware, EPSS, or simulation course.
                        During the development phase for IMI courseware,
                        instructional designers and developers should consider the
                        reuse of media components such as video, audio, animation,
                        and graphics. Cataloging and using previously developed
                        modules or digitized segments of multimedia will save
                        development time and reduce costs.
                        Compatibility with existing databases — IMI courseware
                        needs to be developed in coordination with existing student
                        management systems. The designing the tracking and
                        access systems as well as integrating of these student’s data
                        can become a significant programming effort.

                                Section D
                       Implementation Considerations

Implementation      Fielding the interactive multimedia instruction distance learning
                    course requires a comprehensive amount of functional planning
                    for management, administration, and support. The number of
                    students and training sites involved will impact the level of effort
                    in each of these functional areas.


Management          The importance of active management of the implementation
function            process cannot be overemphasized for implementing interactive
                    multimedia, EPSS, job performance aids, and simulation courses.
                    Critical functions include organizing, scheduling, communicating,
                    and coordinating IMI implementation. These functions involve
                    database management, local management of distance learning
                    students, site operations, and equipment as well as the IMI
                    product and lifecycle management itself.


Administration      Administrative procedures and processes should be in place for
function            both students and hardware/software at all sites. Student
                    registration, processing, tracking, and assistance just as important
                    for interactive courseware, EPSS, and simulation Courses as
                    traditional or IBI courses. Other administrative functions include
                    resource scheduling, routine/preventive maintenance, and
                    equipment refreshment/upgrades.


Support             Particularly for on-line distance learning instruction, technical and
function            maintenance support must be readily available to maintain
                    continuous computer and network system operation for reliable
                    student access. The students’ motivation and interest level,
                    which are more crucial in a distance learning environment, will be
                    enhanced the more “seamless” and “transparent” the instruction
                    is.

                               Evaluation Considerations

Evaluation of IMI      As with other IMI courseware, the evaluation process would
instruction            consist of a formative, summative, and operational evaluation.
                       The evaluation procedures would be much the same for all IMI.

                       The distance learning evaluation metrics are described in
                       Chapter 2. The general guidelines for IMI evaluations are
                       contained in MIL-PRF-29612 and its supporting handbooks.

                       This section addresses the special considerations for conducting
                       evaluations of IMI distance learning instruction.


Formative              The formative evaluation begins in the analysis phase and
evaluation             continues through the development phase of the ISD process.
(Beta testing          The primary difference in the IMI validation process for distance
Phase I)               learning would be the manner in which the individual and small
                       group beta testing are conducted for on-line IMI instruction. It is
                       best to conduct these evaluations at the remote sites in the actual
                       environment that the course will be delivered. Selection of the
                       least capable site would be preferred to fully “test” the delivery of
                       the instruction under less than favorable conditions.


Summative              The operational testing for the summative evaluation should also

Phase II)              on-line courses with all sites participating at the same time to
                       “exercise” the server and the performance of the IMI on the
                       system.


Operational            The operational evaluation is an ongoing process that is
evaluation             accomplished after the formative and summative evaluations.
                       This evaluation is based on internal and external feedback data
                       such as:

                           Instructor/facilitator comments (internal)
                           Student critiques (internal)

                                                                        Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235   Volume 5       1 November 2002                                          252




Operational          Test results (internal)
evaluation           Inspection and evaluation reports (external)
(Continued)
                 This operational evaluation process requires the following
                 procedures:

                     What information needs to be collected: performance,
                     effectiveness, etc.
                     How the information will be gathered: on-line, printed
                     questionnaires, etc.
                     How it should be stored and formatted for analysis: servers,
                     databases, etc.
                     How and who should analyze: ISD team, managers,
                     instructors, etc.

                 For on-line IMI courses, computer/network system access and
                 reliability will need to be carefully assessed since these factors
                 significantly impact the effectiveness of the distance learning
                 program.


General IMI      Some general areas to consider in the evaluation of IMI distance
evaluation       learning instruction are:

                     Course content – organization, relevancy, clarity, quality,
                     currency, etc.
                     Course materials – adequacy, availability, effectiveness,
                     currency, etc.
                     Instructional methods/media – effectiveness, quantity, and
                     quality of interaction.
                     Instructional equipment – availability, reliability, user
                     friendliness, etc.
                     Internet/Intranet network – access, speed, reliability, etc.
                     Instructor support – necessity, availability, effectiveness, etc.
                     Proctor support – usefulness, availability, effectiveness, etc.
                     Technical/maintenance support – access, availability,
                     timeliness, effectiveness, etc.
                     Administrative support – usefulness, adequacy, availability,
                     etc.

                        Chapter 8
  ISD CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTERACTIVE VIDEO TELETRAINING
         AND INTERACTIVE TELEVISION INSTRUCTION
                                      Overview


Introduction        There are differences in the application of the course planning,
                    design, production, and postproduction processes for IVT
                    courses. This chapter describes the ISD considerations for the
                    analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation of
                    Interactive Video Teletraining (IVT).


One-way versus      During the analysis and design process, it must be decided if the
two-way video       course can be delivered using one-way video, or if two-way video
                    is required for the effective accomplishment of the learning
                    objectives. This needs to be determined since:

                        Satellite uplink capability is not available at most remote
                        training sites.
                        Two-way video instruction is much more costly.

                    The Air Force currently provides only one-way video/two-way
                    audio, or Interactive Television (ITV), instruction. As such, the
                    primary focus of this chapter is on ITV instruction. Special ISD
                    considerations for VTC lessons are addressed separately in
                    Section E of this chapter.

                          Selecting the ITV Course


Selecting        In order to determine if a course of instruction or a segment of a
the course       course of instruction is a candidate for ITV, complete the
                 following steps:

                     Perform media analysis to determine whether a course of
                     instruction or a segment of a course of instruction is a
                     suitable candidate for ITV based on the learning objectives.
                     Perform a cost analysis comparing costs of alternative
                     methods with the estimated costs of ITV delivery.
                     Identify estimated offsets and/or expected educational or
                     training benefits to be derived from conversion of the course
                     of instruction—this is known as Return on Investment (ROI).
                     Identify the team responsible for developing the course of
                     instruction for ITV.
                     Identify the instructor(s) for presentation of the course of
                     instruction, and evaluation of student performance.
                     Identify and secure approval/participation of functional
                     managers and guest presenters
                     Identify administrative procedures, and secure administrative
                     support.
                     Ensure a DITIS search has been done to avoid duplication of
                     instructional development.

                                    Analysis and Design


Entertainment           ITV instruction differs from television entertainment.
versus instruction
                            Emphasis is on instructional content not video production.
                            Visual presentations enhance the instructional content.
                            Presentation is interactive, not passive.


Why planning is         ITV instruction differs from traditional classroom instruction.
essential
                            In classroom instruction, the instructor provides information,
                            distributes course materials, operates presentation
                            equipment (audiovisual and computer-based), personally
                            interacts with the students, and is solely responsible for the
                            presentation of instruction.
                            In ITV instruction, the instructor must rely on a team of
                            technical experts to produce (broadcast) the instruction.
                            The video crew is a support group of television experts; the
                            instructor is the content expert.
                            The instructor must convey a plan of instruction to the video
                            crew.
                            Lesson plans that worked in the traditional classroom will not
                            necessarily work for ITV. The ITV team may have to
                            reconfigure instruction for the medium and use different
                            instructional strategies.

                        Instructor Preparation for an ITV Course


Instructor             Effectively teaching an ITV lesson requires preparation.
preparation
                           Specific training is required prior to developing and
                           presenting an ITV lesson.
                           Instructors need an opportunity to practice effective ITV
                           techniques.

                       Instructors should have a thorough understanding of the ISD
                       process as presented in AF Handbook 36-2534, Instructional
                       System Development. Use of the ISD process will ensure:

                           Development of instruction based on criterion-referenced
                           education and training (job performance) requirements.
                           Sound instructional design and management decisions.
                           Graduates acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes
                           (KSAs) to perform a job.


The affective          In any classroom situation, there is a strong relationship between
component of           attitudes and behaviors displayed by an instructor, and the
distance learning      attitudes and classroom behaviors shown by the students.

                           ITV instruction does not provide observable one-on-one
                           student-teacher classroom relationships.
                           ITV instruction does not provide the ability to observe student
                           non-verbal cues.

                       Maintaining student interest in distance learning is a challenge for
                       the instructor. The instructor must employ variety, interaction,
                       and involvement to maintain student interest. Instructors can
                       mitigate the affective deficiencies of distance learning by:

                           Asking frequent in-depth questions (Key is to interact early
                           and often and ask direct questions)
                           Fostering interactive discussions.
                           Using teaching interviews with recognized experts.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 5       1 November 2002                                      258




Team approach      An effective distance learning course requires a closely
                   coordinated effort by a number of people working as a team.

                   Curriculum / Instructional Designer:

                       It is essential for an individual who understands the ISD
                       process to work with the instructor and SME to develop the
                       course.
                       Not all courses can be delivered by distance learning. After
                       careful analysis, the designer may find only part of a course
                       is appropriate for delivery via ITV.
                       A curriculum designer must be involved because a resident
                       course usually does not work effectively via distance learning
                       using the same format and learning materials.

                   Instructors and Administrative Support:

                       Instructors must take an active part in the administration of a
                       distance learning course.
                       Instructors must have a class roster for each site receiving
                       the broadcast.
                       Students must have required handouts and materials at each
                       site prior to the broadcast.
                       The training manager, scheduler and/or instructor must
                       coordinate procedures to determine who is in class for each
                       session.
                       The instructor must establish a process for student evaluation
                       (i.e., grading tests, getting tests from students to the
                       instructor, and back to the students).
                       The training manager/scheduler, and/or instructor must
                       determine a proper time for delivery of the course, taking into
                       account various time zones.

                   On-site Facilitators, Monitors, or DL POCs:

                       A designated person must be available at each remote
                       distance learning classroom to assist with administrative and
                       technical issues.
                       The classroom must be prepared prior to each broadcast.
                       Multimedia delivery technology equipment and student
                       instructional materials must be available for the students.

                                                                 Continued on next page

Team approach          Site facilitators are responsible for letting the instructor know
(Continued)            who is in attendance for a given session or period.

                   Instructional or Subject-matter Facilitators:

                       Instructional facilitators help conduct instruction at the remote
                       sites.
                       Special training may be required for instructional facilitators.

                   Technical Support:

                       Coordination between studio production crew (technical
                       support personnel) and the instructor is essential.
                       Special camera angles and shots, technical advice on
                       appearance, movements, and limitations should be discussed
                       in advance of the broadcast.
                       The director can give advice to make presentations more
                       professional and enhance overall delivery, ensure a smooth
                       transition of camera shots from the presenter to the visual
                       aids, and make the technology transparent to the student.

                   Visual Aid Support:

                       Due to limitations on print size and lines of text, more visuals
                       will be needed for a distance learning course than for a
                       traditional classroom course.
                       Work with visual experts to ensure the clarity and
                       effectiveness of visual aids. Pay particular attention to colors.
                       Colors that are acceptable in a typical classroom presentation
                       may not pass the “groan” test when broadcast!


Communication      Distance learning students are usually more critical, and
skills             television is less forgiving of communication mistakes.
                   Instructors need to consider two areas of communication skills:

                   Verbal Communication:

                       Clarity of speech and enunciation are more important for ITV
                       than they are in a live classroom.
                       Changes in volume and unconscious sounds are more
                       distracting to students.

                                                                   Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235          Volume 5       1 November 2002                                          260




Communication               Grammar and vocabulary are more important for ITV.
skills (Continued)          Effective questioning skills are critical for ITV. Allow brief
                            periods of silence after asking a question to give students
                            time to answer.

                        Non-Verbal Communication:

                            Eye contact is an important non-verbal behavior in the studio
                            environment. Instructors must maintain direct eye contact
                            with the camera.
                            The instructor should look at, and talk to, the camera. The
                            instructor must appear to talk to the remote site students
                            directly.
                            Minimize looking at the monitor that provides a view of what
                            is being broadcast to remote sites when it is not collocated
                            with the camera.
                            The instructor must maintain appropriate eye contact with
                            students in the studio classroom and at remote sites.
                            The natural tendency when teaching live classroom students
                            and remote site students at the same time is to have most of
                            the interaction and eye contact with the live classroom
                            students instead of the camera.
                            Instructors must make an effort to overcome this tendency, or
                            the involvement of the remote site students may be limited.
                            Facial expressions of the instructor are very clear to remote
                            site students.
                            Movement of the instructor is an important non-verbal
                            behavior. Excessive movement is a distracter. Hand
                            gestures can be a distracter. Be aware of movement
                            limitations. Watch the monitor to ensure movement and
                            gestures are not “off camera”.
                            Listening skills are an important non-verbal behavior. Listen
                            attentively to student questions and responses. Ensure
                            students at remote sites understand questions and responses
                            by repeating or paraphrasing and asking direct questions.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                         261


                                    Audience Analysis


Understanding the      Planning a curriculum requires the following:
target audience            Understanding the learner.
                           Understanding the intended relationship between courses.
                           Understanding how the learners will use the courses.

                       An effective curriculum requires a detailed understanding of the
                       target audience. This is a sampling of questions used during an
                       audience analysis:

                           Why is the instruction needed?
                           What are the specific needs of the target audience?
                           What external data verify the need?
                           What factors led to the instructional need?
                           What past experiences indicate that the instruction being
                           planned can effectively meet this need?
                           What are the ages, cultural backgrounds, interests, and
                           educational levels of the students?
                           How will the audience apply the KSAs gained in the course,
                           and how are they sequenced with other courses?


Impact of ITV on       Target audience analysis considerations for ITV also include the
audience analysis      following:
                            How familiar are the students with the various
                            telecommunication instructional methods and delivery
                            systems under consideration?
                            Will students other than the primary target audience be
                            allowed to participate in the ITV course?
                            How will the expanded ITV audience differ from the primary
                            audience?
                            Where are the students located?
                            Do all students have access to a satellite downlink site?
                            Will TDY to a downlink site be required for some students?
                            Will overseas students participate, and if so, how?
                            Will there be a studio audience at the uplink site in addition to
                            the remote students at the downlink sites?
                            How large an audience will the uplink and downlink sites
                            accommodate?
                            Are there special training conditions such as weekend
                            broadcasts for the ANG and AFRC?

                             Learning Objective Analysis


Review learning      Individual course KSA learning objectives must be developed
objectives           based on the:

                         Educational and training requirements previously defined.
                         Audience analysis previously conducted.

                     Well-developed KSA learning objectives will ensure that the
                     course topics are instructed in a logical and sequential order.
                     When reviewing learning objectives:

                         Note whether any objectives require special laboratory or
                         research facilities, or equipment. Identify alternate sources at
                         remote sites. If alternatives do not exist, the learning
                         objectives may need revision.
                         Note whether any objectives require instructor observation of
                         student performance. The objectives may require special
                         two-way video or use of a facilitator.

                     One of the goals is to select instructional strategies that will
                     enhance the learning objectives.


Instructional        There are several important instructional strategies to keep in
strategies           mind:

                         ITV is a visual medium that should be fully exploited for
                         effective instruction.
                         Subject matter facilitators may be used to enable mastery of
                         performance and group activities at the remote sites.
                         Interactivity must be planned to ensure student involvement
                         in the learning process. Design some type of interactive
                         event every 7-10 minutes.

                     Student familiarity and comfort in the DL environment must be
                     maintained.

Scheduling and      Consider the following items for determining the scope and
resource            sequencing of lessons in a course of instruction:
considerations
                        Availability of instructors and guest speakers.
                        Availability of students and attendees.
                        Schedule students by ability or experience groups.
                        Consider student fatigue factor for viewing video
                        presentations.
                        Ensure access to rooms equipped for video/audio reception.
                        Determine the estimated number of students to receive
                        instruction. Repeated deliveries of lessons may be required.
                        Determine the number of sites for delivery of instruction.
                        Repeated deliveries of lessons to remote sites may be
                        required.
                        Determine the difficulty of lesson content. Allow enough time
                        for the lesson knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be absorbed
                        by the students.

                                     Summary


Summary of ITV      Perform the following steps during ITV Analysis:
analysis
                        Review the reason for using the ITV mode of instruction.
                        Review who the target audience is.
                        Review the learning objectives.
                        Review whether the ITV lessons are to be used for initial
                        instruction, remedial instruction, refresher instruction, job
                        certification, or job upgrade instruction.
                        Review the lessons that are to be taught using other media.
                        Review the satellite broadcast timing limitations and any
                        resource limitations.
                        Determine the type of broadcast setup (studio production or
                        instructor controlled approach)
                        Select an instructor to deliver the instruction and provide
                        training in effective communications skills for ITV.
                        Identify scope and sequence of material and generate a
                        tentative schedule.
                        Determine whether to deliver the material over a series of
                        short broadcasts (i.e., for 2 hours on Monday, Wednesday,
                        and Friday) or to present the instruction in one large block
                        (i.e., 6 hours on Monday).

                                          Design


Designing              There are several instructional protocols for ITV that must be
instructional          considered during the design phase, and firmly established at the
protocols for the      beginning of each course. These protocols may need to be
ITV environment        incorporated in the script:

                           Schedule Protocols: Identify the dates and times for ITV
                           classes. Delineate live broadcast hours from other activities
                           at the remote sites.

                           Attendance Protocols: Establish a system to take
                           attendance, and to ensure students attend class. Determine
                           if the presenter will do a roll call from the host or uplink
                           facility.

                           Break Protocols: Plan breaks in advance. Determine break
                           time and frequency.
                              Consider different time zones, and adjust break schedule
                              accordingly.
                              Schedule frequent breaks to avoid student fatigue.

                          Student Interaction Protocols: Determine if students can ask
                          questions at any time or only at specific times.
                             Determine how questions will be asked and answered.
                             Determine if questions will be generated and answered
                             using audio, computer-generated text, E-mail, or Fax.
                             Establish protocols for asking questions and response
                             times to deal with questions.

                          Response Systems Protocols: Decide when students will
                          receive instruction on the use of response systems at the
                          downlink sites.
                             Ensure students know how to use response systems.
                             Establish protocols for use of audio, computer-generated
                             text, E-mail, or Fax communication.

                          Student Project Reporting Protocols: Determine how students
                          will make reports using audio, computer-generated text, E-
                          mail, or fax transmissions.
                              Determine how students will share information between
                              remote sites.

                                                                     Continued on next page

                          exactly what images are required, and exactly how the
                          images are to be incorporated and distributed in the ITV
                          lesson.
                          Use common cues in the script to prompt the director for all
                          movements, transitions, visuals, etc. that the instructor wants
                          to present.

Steps for            Complete the following steps to develop lesson plan scripts and
completing lesson    storyboards after the audience has been identified, and the scope
plan development     and sequence of the course of instruction has been determined.

                          Determine the type of script format and the script elements to
                          include.
                          Prepare the script with appropriate markings and proof it
                          carefully.
                          Develop storyboards for each teaching point to include
                          visuals, production notes, and narration. Include instructional
                          protocols, questions, transitions, and summaries.
                          Follow all guidelines related to the use of copyright material.


Script purposes      A well-written script will provide the ITV instructor with information
                     that is required to conduct and guide an instructional lesson. The
                     script will:

                          Sequence the primary lesson topics.
                          Provide guidance to the entire studio crew.
                          Be incorporated into a teleprompter, as desired.


Script types         There are four types of scripts described below:

                     1.   Verbatim Script
                     2.   Outline Script
                     3.   Keyword Script
                     4.   Combination Script


1. Verbatim script   The characteristics are:
                        Every word spoken by the instructor is written down.
                        Contains specific cues for graphics, wording, movement,
                        questions, etc.

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                      269




1. Verbatim script         Customarily used with a teleprompter.
   (Continued)             Beneficial if specific key wording is to be used.
                           Useful for new Interactive Video Teletraining (ITV) instructors.
                           Interpretive reading (conversational dialog) of the script is
                           required to avoid uninteresting presentations.
                           A true verbatim script does not allow for much spontaneous
                           discussion or development of ideas.
                           The instructor should include time for interactive discussion
                           periods.
                           Minimal coordination between instructor and studio
                           production crew.


2. Outline script      The characteristics are:

                           Each specific word is not written down.
                           Usually, only the opening and closing remarks are listed.
                           The rest of the script is in an outline format.
                           The sequence of information is pre-established.
                           The instructor is free to develop sentence structure to support
                           teaching points.
                           Require the instructor to be very knowledgeable of the
                           subject being taught.
                           Close coordination with the director and studio production
                           crew is required.


3. Keyword script      The characteristics are:

                           Not a good type of script for the instructor to use.
                           Requires the instructor to be extremely knowledgeable of
                           subject matter.
                           Primary use is for studio technicians who can use instructor-
                           generated key words as cues for performing actions, or
                           presenting graphics, etc.
                           Extensive coordination between the instructor and studio
                           production crew prior to rehearsing lesson presentation is
                           required.
                           Adequate for broadcasting studio setup.
                           More effective if combined with other script formats to
                           achieve maximum instructor performance.

4. Combination       The characteristics are:
   script
                         Closely resembles a typical lesson plan.
                         Combines Verbatim, Keyword, and Outline formats, and
                         enables the instructor to present a thoroughly planned
                         lesson.
                         Most versatile script type.
                         Coordination between the instructor and studio production
                         crew prior to rehearsing lesson presentation may be greatly
                         reduced.
                         Requires more instructor planning time than the other types
                         of scripts.


Script               A lesson script should contain everything that a well-designed
characteristics      resident lesson plan contains, and more. Ensure that the
                     following elements are included:

                         Learning objectives and methods for communicating them.
                         An Introduction, Body, and Conclusion.
                            The Introduction contains motivational statements, visual
                            images, and usually a Verbatim Script.
                            The Body lists the main and supporting teaching points,
                            and contains both Outline and Verbatim Scripts.
                            The Conclusion repeats the major teaching points, and
                            emphasizes the teaching points that are most difficult for
                            the students.
                        Interim Summaries that are a mini conclusion of teaching

                        Scripts and visual media.
                        Transitions to inform the students at remote sites of the
                        continuance of new information, and to enable the students to
                        acknowledge the changes in lesson events.

ITV script       Script Marking:
development
                     Use symbols or cues to highlight important teaching points in
                     the script.
                     Use lines to separate different topics.
                     Use clear, precise, and consistent marking throughout the
                     script.

                 Script Proofing:

                     Print a hardcopy of the script and proofread it for intent and
                     effective topical coverage.
                     Rework the script as required.

                              Developing Storyboards


Storyboard use      Storyboards are used to convey visual ideas and concepts.

                        Coordinate the lesson plan text with associated visuals.
                        Cards or sheets can be organized into different sequences.
                        Usually setup on videotape or on a computer, which allows
                        the storyboard to be scrolled up or down, highlighted.
                        Storyboard images setup on a videotape must allow minimum
                        viewing times for each image.


Storyboard          The three main sections of the storyboard to consider when
composition         developing ITV lesson plans are:

                    Visual Section:

                        Visualize the teaching points by drawing, sketching or
                        illustrating the visual images that will be seen in the final
                        screens.
                        Usually accomplished using a graphic format.

                    Production Notes:

                        Describe where, when, what, and how the visual subject
                        teaching points will be used.
                        Contain the name of the visual subject teaching points.
                        Contains the video shooting, timing, and display
                        requirements, audio production and timing requirements for
                        each visual subject teaching point.

                    Narration: The narration supports, and is secondary to the visual
                    images.

                        Describe and enhance the teaching points.
                        ITV storyboards may not contain the complete lesson plan
                        narration.
                        Teleprompter scripts, verbatim scripts, content outline scripts,
                        or keyword scripts may be used.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        273




Develop visual        Visual materials should have the following characteristics:
materials
                         Visual materials should fit the setting, support the message,
                         and heighten audience attention.
                         Visual materials should be pictorial. Key points and
                         supporting materials should be expressed using expressive or
                         vivid photos, graphs, charts, illustrations, animations, and
                         simulations.
                         Visual materials should be colorful. Color induces responses
                         and appeals to emotions. Colors can promote attention,
                         evoke moods, create desire, and generate a favorable
                         response.
                         Visual materials should be creative. Creative visuals will have
                         more impact, and gain more attention.


Visual materials      ITV visuals must pass three tests:
tests
                          Aspect Ratio: A television monitor screen has an aspect ratio
                          that is three units high and four units wide. Visuals displayed
                          on the screen must correspond to this aspect ratio.
                          Safe Area: Visuals in the correct three by four aspect ratio,
                          with a one-to-one pixel aspect ratio (i.e., computer graphics),
                          will require additional space when presented on a television
                          monitor. A television monitor has a one-to three pixel aspect
                          ratio that makes a one-to-one pixel aspect ratio image bleed
                          off the television screen unless the image is sized correctly
                          for display on a television monitor.
                          Contrast: Television cameras handle colors in the middle of
                          the spectrum better than colors at the ends of the spectrum,
                          such as black and white.


ITV visual            Use the following general rules for designing effective visuals:
materials
preparation               Write the Words First. Develop the message, the headlines,
                          and the outline with key points. Consider the key points in
                          the outline that need special emphasis.
                          Keep It Short and Simple (KISS). Design no more than one
                          main idea per visual.
                          Keep It Large and Legible (KILL). Use only 7 lines per visual,
                          including the title.

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5       1 November 2002                                        274




ITV visual                Use the Six by Six Rule: 6 lines per visual; 6 words per line.
materials                 Use a simple typeface no smaller than 18 points for
preparation               transparencies.
(Continued)               Use Descriptive Titles. Visual titles should summarize the
                          points to be made on the visual.
                          Decide on a Basic Design. Use the same colors, type styles,
                          and graphics throughout a presentation to show a continuing
                          relationship.
                          Proof the Visuals. Use others to proof for incorrect data or
                          spelling errors.
                          Proof received visuals. Proof as they will appear at receive
                          sites. Visuals sometimes take on a different appearance
                          after conversion from digital to analog. If this is not possible,
                          view videotape of broadcast.
                          Allow Enough Time. Good, quality graphics take time to
                          develop.


Using color           Tips for using color:

                          Color combinations that look good on a computer monitor will
                          not always look good on a television monitor.
                          Use different background colors to introduce new sections of
                          the presentation, to change a mood, or to call attention to
                          important transitions.
                          Use light colors against dark backgrounds and vice versa.
                          Avoid bright red, magenta, and some blue colors that tend to
                          get lost in the background.
                          A solid background will enable text, graphics, and graphs to
                          stand out. Special effects can add visual appeal.
                          Use visuals with more images, and less words.
                          Use words to label, highlight, and summarize.
                          Yellow and white text bold with shading work well.


Types of ITV          Types of ITV visual materials include:
visual materials         Camera Art or Hard Graphics. Must be large enough, and
                         pass the contrast and aspect ratio tests. Are usually
                         prepared prior to the live presentation, rather than using a
                         camera to shoot them “live” during the presentation. May
                         also be shown during the broadcast using a visualizer.

                                                                      Continued on next page

Types of ITV              Computer-Generated Graphics. Computers are used to
visual materials          create animated, still, and modeled images and text using
(Continued)               templates with correct aspect ratios and safe areas.

                          Character Generator (CG). Used to create words and
                          numbers in a variety of sizes and colors for display on the
                          television monitor. Can be a stand-alone device, or a
                          component of a computer graphics system.

                          Full Animation Systems. Sophisticated computers that can
                          reproduce any type of animated, still, or modeled image;
                          create unlimited motion; add shading; specify the angle and
                          intensity of the light source; and give a two-dimensional
                          drawing depth and three-dimensional effects.

                          Still-Store. Captures a still image from any type of video
                          source and stores the image as a still image. Provides
                          random access to still images, with numbered frames.
                          Images are displayed on the television monitor by calling up
                          the frame number.

                          Ultimatte or Chroma Key. Allows the presenter to interact
                          with the displayed images. Electronically finds a particular
                          color frequency in the television picture, usually green or
                          blue, and removes it from the image being broadcast.
                          Anything green or blue becomes invisible. For example, if
                          the wall behind the presenter is green, Ultimatte removes the
                          wall. The wall can be replaced in the broadcast image with
                          another background video image. The presenter (who
                          cannot be wearing green) is visible in front of the new image.

                          Roll-Ins (video clips). Pre-produced videotapes that are shot
                          to videotape by a live camera and edited for desired scenes
                          and length of display prior to the live broadcast.

                                     Section C
                                ITV Implementation

The TV studio         ITV classes may take place in a video production facility (TV
                      studio), or in an ITV broadcast classroom. The TV studio should
                      be equipped with:

                      Room Features
                         Metal framework on the ceiling, from which lights can be
                         suspended for illumination of the set below.
                         Curved wall painted in a solid color that can also be used as
                         a backdrop.
                         Studio doors large enough to provide access for large training
                         support equipment.
                         Draperies in a solid color, that can be used as a backdrop.
                         Clocks. Timing is important and instructors must avoid dead
                         time while on-the-air.

                      Equipment
                         One to four analog or digital TV cameras on wheels or wall-
                         mounted.
                         Analog or digital television monitors.
                         Computers with monitors and Internet access.
                         Projection or digitizing systems for transparencies, slides,
                         graphics, solid objects, etc., capable of projecting images on
                         screens or monitors.
                         Fax machine for student roster, submitting questions or
                         course materials, etc.
                         Furniture for use in sets.

                      The production facility should be staffed with production
                      personnel such as camera operators, stage manager, technical
                      assistants, etc. as may be necessary for the production.


The control room      The control room is the heart of the ITV production facility and
                      should normally contain:

                          All equipment for transmission of ITV broadcast and the
                          appropriate crew to ensure a successful broadcast.

                                                                     Continued on next page

The control room          A director or videographer, linked to a key personnel
(Continued)               instructor by microphones, headsets, and earphones.
                          Several analog or digital TV monitors.
                          Large electronic control panels for management of equipment
                          and personnel.
                          Videotape and audiotape players.

                      Each of the television monitors in the control room displays a
                      specific video output. Each camera on the studio floor is tied
                      electronically to the control room so that the director can monitor
                      what each camera is recording. Other video or computer
                      monitors are used to display:

                          Analog or digital graphics.
                          Scripts, animations, and computer simulations.
                          Digital and analog videotape lesson segments.
                          Prerecorded lesson segments.
                          The image that is being transmitted to students at remote
                          sites.


ITV equipment         The following devices are commonly used during ITV production.
                      Instructors should become familiar with all of the
                      equipment/devices used during the production.

                      Microphones
                         Lavaliere or clip-on microphones: Designed to pick up the
                         voice of one person, and clipped to the clothing of the
                         presenter.
                         Tabletop microphones: These are important if students are
                         present in a studio classroom. These microphones permit
                         questions to be transmitted to students at the remote or
                         downlink sites. Students at downlink sites often use “push-to-
                         talk” tabletop microphones to talk to the instructor and to
                         other sites.

                      Video Components
                         Cameras: Usually, three cameras are used.
                            One camera is used to shoot graphics. It can be mounted
                            in the ceiling, in a lectern, or in a visualizer.

                                                                     Continued on next page

                                   Preproduction Phase


Preproduction           The ITV preproduction phase involves the following activities:
activities
                           Conducting preproduction conferences.
                           Developing television platform skills.
                           Conducting rehearsals.
                           Production preparations.


Preproduction           The instructor, studio director, and graphics designer must meet
conferences             to discuss and coordinate the sequencing of the various
                        instructional media elements of the distance learning course.

                           Decide whether, when, and how the ITV components are to
                           be broadcast.
                           Determine the development times and resources required to
                           develop and integrate the ITV course.


Develop ITV skills      ITV is a visual medium, and instructor presentation skills are very
                        important aspects of instructing using this medium. It is strongly
                        recommended that instructors and developers attend a course to
                        learn ITV techniques. Rehearsals and “dry-runs” should be
                        accomplished by the instructor to hone verbal and nonverbal
                        presentation skills, and practice using the equipment.


Conduct                 Rehearsals will allow the instructor and production team to work
rehearsals              out the broadcast details to include the exact presentation
                        sequence/timing, camera shots, supporting graphics/display
                        requirements, etc. Videotape rehearsals for review.


Production              Below are just a few of the considerations and preparations that
preparations            may need to be accomplished prior to the actual production (use
                        checklist if available).
                           Ensure the production and remote site facilities have been
                           reserved and are still available.
                           Ensure the remote sites have all the necessary instructional
                           materials.

                                                                       Continued on next page

                                   Production Phase


The broadcast         The Production phase is actual on-air time, when the lesson is
                      being broadcast by the instructor and received at all downlink
                      sites. Videotape the broadcast and conduct a debriefing with the
                      production team after the production.

                                  Section D
                                ITV Evaluation

Overview           Evaluation usually refers to anything that occurs after
                   implementation, such as evaluation of the effectiveness of the
                   ITV course of instruction, including assessment of the learning
                   outcomes, instructional skills, and studio services.

                       Evaluation is the last phase of the ISD process.
                       Effective evaluation requires a continuous feedback process.
                       Evaluation identifies both intended and unintended outcomes
                       so that decision-makers can make necessary adjustments in
                       the instructional program.
                       Evaluation usually involves formal and informal processes
                       that measure the effectiveness of instruction and support
                       functions.
                       There are unique evaluation requirements for ITV and
                       distance learning courses of instruction.
                       The quality control procedures described in Chapter 2 are
                       part of the evaluation process for ITV courses of instruction.
                       Evaluation of ITV, and the required documentation, is based
                       on the distance learning metrics described in Chapter 2.


Formative and      The formative and summative evaluations provide a feedback
summative          mechanism that allows for adjustments and modifications of
evaluation         strategies being used to assure achievement of program goals
                   and objectives. They include:

                      Evaluation of Internal Processes: Look at how well the
                      process worked. Was ISD followed? Did the team work well?
                      Were policies followed? Was required documentation
                      maintained? Were general quality control (QC) procedures
                      followed?

                      Design/Development Criteria for ITV: Were the proper
                      procedures and design techniques followed? Did the team
                      members follow the QC procedures in the design and
                      development of the courseware?


                                                                 Continued on next page

Formative and            Validity and Beta Testing Prior to Release: This is to ensure
summative                instruction works prior to wholesale implementation. For ITV,
evaluation               this involves pre-production coordination, rehearsals, and
(Continued)              feedback from the field for the initial broadcast.
                         Monitor Technical Production: The technical and studio
                         production staff must continuously monitor the output signal
                         as well as return audio during a production. Testing of
                         equipment must occur prior to broadcast time and must be
                         factored into the ITV schedule. The production crew must be
                         able to work with site monitors or POCs to fix technical
                         problems that occur during production.


Formative             Formative evaluation is a continuous feedback mechanism that

evaluation             The Operational Evaluation is conducted throughout the life cycle
                       of the course. It indicates the on-going level of success.
                       Operational evaluations will show trends over time and should
                       help differentiate between an isolated incident and potential
                       system/program failure. As with all DL programs, ITV Evaluation
                       is based on DL Metrics in Chapter 2 and includes:

                           Instructional Effectiveness
                           Costs

                           Administrative Efficiency/Operational Effectiveness
                           Customer Satisfaction


Instructional          Instructional effectiveness includes the following:
effectiveness               The instructor, along with the course director or training
                            manager, is responsible for determining if students achieved
                            the desired learning outcomes. This is usually accomplished
                            through some form of testing or course completion data.

                                                                       Continued on next page

Instructional           An important indicator of effectiveness is how well the
effectiveness           instructor and any subject matter facilitators performed in the
(Continued)             ITV environment. Measurement of the effectiveness of these
                        people is usually accomplished through student critiques of
                        the instructional program and feedback from peer or
                        supervisory evaluations as well as site POCs. Also, ITV
                        producers/directors are a source of feedback. Student
                        critiques of ITV instructional effectiveness should provide
                        feedback on:
                             Content
                             Relevancy of material.
                             Level of student-instructor and student-student
                             interactivity.
                             Effectiveness of instructor presentation techniques.
                             Instructor knowledge of subject matter.
                             Overall technical quality of presentation.
                             Quality of the learning environment at the remote sites.


Costs                Costs are kept in accordance with DL Metrics in Chapter 2.


Technical / system   Technical / system reliability includes the following:
reliability
                         The production/engineering and ITV studio (uplink) crews are
                         primarily responsible for monitoring technical and ITV system
                         reliability.

                         Site POCs must report any technical difficulties at the remote
                         sites. The production/engineering crew must determine if the
                         problems are system or site related. These difficulties are
                         documented and reported to the ATN program manager as
                         directed. Documentation should include:
                            System/studio utilization.

                       Special Considerations for VTC
                                     Overview


VTC versus ITV      The most significant difference between ITV and VTC is the two-
                    way video capability of VTC instruction. A VTC system provides
                    visual communications between the participating sites. Any VTC
                    classrooms that are networked to ITV sites would still be limited
                    to one-way (receive-only) video. Also, there are budgeting
                    limitations for VTC systems, therefore, the number of sites that
                    can be conferenced-in at one time is limited.

                    Much of the ISD process for VTC is the same as for ITV
                    instruction. This section addresses some of the special
                    considerations or processes involved in the analysis, design,
                    development, implementation, and evaluation of a VTC course
                    that is not covered under the ITV sections.

                                        Analysis


Is two-way            To help determine if two-way video instruction is required, the
video required?       following questions can be asked as part of the decision process:

                          Is an instructor required to present the instruction?
                          Do the students need to see the instructor?
                          Is the desired learning objective a skill objective that requires
                          the demonstration and performance of a task?
                          Does the instructor need to observe the students’ actions,
                          performance, progress, or interaction in the accomplishment
                          of the task? If so, does the instructor need to observe the
                          student in real-time?
                          Can student performance be adequately seen through a VTC
                          camera?
                          Can subject matter facilitators at the local sites fulfill the
                          requirement to observe student task performance?
                          Are there other instructors, SMEs, or guest speakers at any
                          of the participating sites that are required to present some of
                          the instruction?


Is VTC feasible?      If two-way video is determined to be required, then the following
                      questions can be asked to determine if VTC is a viable option for
                      delivery of instruction:

                          How many sites will be participating?
                          Is it required that all sites participate at same time? Can the
                          instruction be presented to different sites at different times?
                          How will the fact that each participating site may only be able
                          to view one other site affect the presentation and instruction?
                          How many students will be at each participating site?
                          Will each individual student be required to be observed?
                          Do all the participating sites have adequate equipment and
                          trained personnel to operate the equipment?
                          Do all the participating sites have compatible
                          connections/capability?
                          Are there any other delivery options or methods of instruction
                          available to accomplish the desired learning objective?
                          Will VTC instruction be cost effective?

                           The production capabilities and limitations of the other sites

                        Schedule and conduct rehearsals with other production sites.
                        Ensure students at each site are familiar with the production
                        equipment and presentations procedures as applicable.
                        Conduct two-way video/audio checks with each site prior to

     ISD CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTERNET-BASED INSTRUCTION
                                     Overview


Introduction       This chapter describes ISD considerations for the analysis,
                   design, development, implementation, and evaluation of Internet-
                   Based Instruction (IBI).


What is IBI?       As described in Chapter 3, IBI encompasses the range of
                   instruction and data provided on-line over the Internet/WWW –
                   from simple text-based files and applications to interactive
                   multimedia instruction.

                   Note: A stand-alone course that is downloaded via the
                   Internet/WWW (from an FTP or web site) to an individual PC and
                   accomplished solely off-line by learners, is not classified as IBI
                   within the context of this chapter.

Current           If learners are geographically separated so that distance and time
capabilities      zones are a barrier to using other alternatives (such as resident
                  training, VTCs and audioconferences), and if learners have
                  access to adequate computer equipment and the Internet, the
                  instructional solution of choice may well be IBI. A skilled
                  developer can change content on the Internet quickly, which
                  means that IBI may be highly appropriate for dynamic course
                  content. Depending on the structure of the course, learners can
                  see which students are on line; they can converse in chat rooms
                  or forums; they can communicate with instructional staff in both
                  synchronous and asynchronous modes. Designers can employ a
                  wide variety of techniques to lead learners through the course
                  content, provide opportunities for interaction, and reinforce
                  learning objectives. Special skills are required to design a quality
                  IBI course, but authoring systems and instructional aids are
                  available to facilitate IBI development.

                  The future capabilities and instructional potential of IBI are
                  significant. Technology is revolutionizing IBI and is changing the
                  way we look at distance learning. Advances in computer network
                  technology, compression algorithms, streaming technologies, and
                  improvements in bandwidth will permit virtually unrestricted
                  access to instructional materials stored in various, non-
                  centralized locations on demand, enabling learning to occur
                  independent of time and distance.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5      1 November 2002                                        295




Current constraints   Technical constraints such as the capabilities of learners’ PCs
                      (modem speed, etc.), bandwidth availability, and network
                      interfaces limit the speed that data can be transmitted and
                      received over the Internet/WWW. This equates to transmission
                      delays and “slow-loading” web pages, particularly when the
                      pages are complex in structure and/or content.

                      Bandwidth is an issue in three areas: on each Air Force base,
                      between bases, and between the DoD Defense Information
                      Services Network (DISN) backbone and the Internet.

                          Base blueprints are being enhanced to reflect the growing
                          reliance on connectivity and to prepare for access to an
                          upgraded DoD backbone.
                          Bandwidth impinges primarily on the level of technical
                          sophistication one can employ from a central server that is
                          accessed by the user community.
                          Vendors are offering audio and video streaming technologies
                          to mitigate the bandwidth problem, but these typically employ
                          small video windows at frame rates less than the rate at
                          which somewhat smooth video is attained.
                          Many base LAN policies currently prohibit streaming; this
                          impacts design considerations.


Before you begin      Using the latest development tools, course providers can develop
                      and deploy web-based instruction with increasing speed.
                      However, the potential for the proliferation of uncoordinated
                      variations of web-based courses throughout the Air Force is a
                      point of major concern.

                      Before initiating an IBI project, research current development
                      tools and assess their applicability. In addition, consult the
                      AFIADL homepage (http://www.maxwell.af.mil/afiadl/) for current
                      guidance on the use of IBI, and for information concerning
                      hardware and software standards, operating systems standards,
                      and database management requirements.

                                    IBI Analysis

Introduction         The analysis process for IBI is similar to the process described in
                     Chapter 7 for IMI. Both of these instructional technologies can
                     support self-paced and self-directed interactive instruction. IBI is
                     also similar to CMC in that both can support instructor-led or
                     group-paced conferencing and collaboration. The differences lie
                     in their application and delivery method.


When to use IBI      Consider using IBI when:
                        There are large numbers of learners distributed over diverse
                        time zones and duty locations.
                        Learners cannot travel to the training site or be absent from
                        their duty station for extended periods.
                        Availability of instructors with subject matter expertise is
                        limited.
                        “Hands-on” training is not required. IBI is good for knowledge
                        and attitude objectives, but has limited application for motor
                        skill objectives.
                        “Just-in-time” training is needed.
                        On-demand instruction is required.
                        Instruction needs to be platform independent (not limited to
                        Windows, Mac, Unix, etc., environment).
                        Frequent updates or revisions are required in the course
                        materials.


Other                Other general considerations for IBI include:
considerations
                     Time for IBI course preparation:
                        Some types of IBI can be set up quickly if required.
                        On-line conferences require only the time it takes to inform
                        participants.
                        Simple WWW pages can be created in only slightly more time
                        than text document. However, it may require an instructor to
                        be on-line for an extended period of time once the conference
                        begins.

                     Cost of IBI course preparation:

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5       1 November 2002                                          297




Other                     Some supporting IBI can be implemented at very little
considerations            additional cost if pre-existing resources for E-mail, chat room,
(Continued)               etc., are used.
                          Can also be costly if IBI applications require a high-end,
                          server with a fast network connection in order to run.


Is IBI cost-          The cost-effectiveness of any media is dependent on its fit with
effective?            the instructional objectives and training environment. If the
                      learner population is widely dispersed geographically so that
                      several time zones are involved, the course content is fairly
                      straight forward, and the objectives can be achieved without
                      hands-on instruction, IBI can be a very cost-effective solution. If
                      the material is complex, students are collocated, and/or hands-on
                      training is required, IBI will not only not be the most cost-effective,
                      but it is likely that the instructional objectives will not be realized.

                      Both direct and indirect costs must be considered in the analysis
                      process. In addition, all constraints must be examined for cost
                      impact. For example, if near term funding is extremely limited, a
                      phased approach to training may be used, with IBI as the ultimate
                      delivery media. Cost analysis will include:

                          Training cost/cost avoidance: Will the expected IBI cost
                          savings offset the development costs?
                          Course life cycle cost: Will development and maintenance
                          costs be offset during the expected life of the IBI course?
                          Return on Investment: Is the expected ROI acceptable?
                          (Refer to Chapter 4.)


Defining the          The three critical tasks of the analysis phase are the definition of
training              the learning population, the definition of the instructional
development /         objectives, and the definition of the learning environment. Who is
delivery options      the target group? What is the learning environment? What are
                      the objectives of the instruction? What tools do learners have
                      available? The better these variables are defined, the more
                      accurately the development/delivery options can be analyzed for
                      suitability and cost-effectiveness.


IBI feasibility       The following table provides some considerations for determining
                      the feasibility of IBI:

Develop the plan        Depending on the role IBI will play in the course (informational,
                        supplemental, dependent, or fully webbed), define IBI resource
                        requirements and constraints. Refer to Chapter 2 for planning
                        and management factors to be considered. Depending on the
                        requirements and constraints defined, consider options; define
                        the alternatives for obtaining required resources (e.g., use of
                        advanced development tools may eliminate the requirement for
                        skilled programmer).

                                   IBI Design

Introduction       The design of the IBI project is dependent on a host of issues that
                   must be defined. Bandwidth availability, infrastructure,
                   development and delivery tools and browsers, delivery standards,
                   security issues, user configuration requirements, user access,
                   student tracking, scalability requirements – these are some of the
                   factors that must be examined. Some of these will have been
                   defined during the analysis phase. Others will be defined as the
                   design process begins. Be sure to contact the Base Network
                   Communications Center (BNCC) and check the AFIADL Home
                   Page (http://www.maxwell.af.mil/afiadl/) for the most up-to-date
                   guidance.

                   This section discusses instructional strategies and methods, key
                   design considerations, and constraints for IBI delivered in a
                   synchronous and/or asynchronous mode.


Design the         During this phase, the instructional designers will refine the
instructional      instructional approach and define the instructional design
strategy           (organization and presentation of content to meet desired
                   learning objectives).

                   It is useful to have a both a subject matter expert and a
                   representative of the learner population participate in the design
                   phase (refer to Chapter 2 for a list of IBI development team roles
                   and responsibilities). As the instructional objectives are
                   examined, each of these players can provide valuable insight on
                   the optimum use of Internet resources. A few of the factors to
                   consider:

                       Hardware and software requirements for development and
                       delivery.
                       Whether and how chat rooms should be constructed.
                       How instructor/learner and learner/learner discussions will be
                       conducted.
                       How and when learners will receive feedback.
                       For a synchronous course, whether and which portions of the
                       course should be asynchronous (and vice versa).
                       How learner achievement will be assessed.

                                                                   Continued on next page

Design the IBI      The following table describes a few of the structural options
structure           associated with IBI design. Again, the designer must decide how
                    best to use the technology – how best to draw or lead the learner
                    through the instruction.

                                      This mode is best when the designer wants

                    Hierarchies       one portion of the site. More than a single
                    Attached          path can lead through a given portion of the
                                      site. Other portions of the site are not
                                      accessible within paths of a particular
                                      portion, though they are accessible from the
                                      uppermost page within that portion’s

                                      portions of the site is only possible from the
                                      upper most page in the hierarchy (e.g. the
                                      Home Page or the Administration page).
                                      This could, in effect, divide the site into four
                                      or five smaller sites such that they are
                                      independent of each other with access
                                      controlled by an administrator.

                                            paths interconnected with each other from
                                            which students can explore. Web mode is
                                            not effective for a testing situation, since in
                                            testing you would want the user to follow a
                                            particular path through a battery of tests, or
                                            when linear instruction is intended,
                                            progressing through a set of instructional
                                            modules from beginning to end.
                              Table 34 Structural Options Associated with IBI Design


Define structure      IBI may include photographs, videos, audio tracks, and
and content of        embedded graphics. The design phase is the time to define the
support media         role support media will play in the IBI program. This is also the
                      time to do trade-offs among the support media alternatives to
                      define the most cost-effective way of achieving the instructional
                      objectives.


Technical             Some technical information that will need to be obtained to
considerations        identify limitations that may be placed on IBI design include:

                      Connectivity
                         What type of connection to the Internet does the delivery
                         computer have? Is a dial-in provider, such as an Internet
                         Service Provider (ISP) to be used?
                         Will a fast Ethernet connection, ISDN line, T-1 or ATM
                         connection be available?
                         What are the connection data transfer rates upstream and
                         downstream?
                         What standards and protocols apply (technical standards
                         such as authoring software, file name conventions,
                         connectivity protocols, bandwidth limitations, security and
                         user access control, etc.)?

                                                                       Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5       1 November 2002                                         304




                     Computer Capability
                        What type of computer will accommodate the delivery of the
                        IBI based on the selected browsers?
                        What computer or server will house the courseware?
                        Which web browser, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape,
                        will be used? Which version will the design be mapped to?
                        What plug-ins will be required?

                     Other Considerations
                        How many students will be accessing the IBI at a given time
                        and for how long?
                        What security provisions are required for collection and
                        management of Privacy Act data?

                     The design of IBI graphics and files will generally be limited by
                     the lowest, or least capable, student access method and
                     computer configuration (web browser version).

                     It is important to note that highly interactive multimedia IBI with
                     extensive graphics, animations, simulations, and video is not yet
                     a realistic option due primarily to available bandwidth limitations.
                     Currently, IBI can only effectively imitate IMI through the use of
                     HTML hyperlinks to other files and pages with limited graphics,
                     sound, and motion video.

                     However, as network infrastructure, bandwidth, and
                     hardware/software support capabilities continue to improve and
                     expand, multimedia IBI (e.g., video, animation, audiographics)
                     becomes more attractive as an instructional alternative.
                     However, until transmission and bandwidth issues are resolved,
                     the design process for IBI must factor its limitations into the
                     instructional program.


Refine the plan      The project plan should be refined to reflect the decisions made
                     and approved during the design phase. In addition, the
                     instructional designers should have prepared a design document
                     that will guide the development team through the next phase.

                                  IBI Development

Introduction          The primary focus during the development phase should be on
                      developing the instructional program based on the decision made
                      during the design phase. During the development phase, the
                      instructional developers must constantly evaluate the materials to
                      ensure they are not building in technical complexity that could
                      compromise the success of the program. That is, attention must
                      always be paid to the both the technical capabilities and the
                      limitations of IBI.

                      This section provides technical considerations and helpful hints
                      for the development of IBI programs.

                           Design a template for presentation of the instruction (pre-
                           positioned and coded navigation controls, repeating screen
                           elements, etc.)

                                                                    Continued on next page

                          students.
                          Define student access and password procedures.
                          Define technical support structure and requirements (e.g.,
                          help lines that are available for users who may not be familiar
                          with this mode of instruction).
                          Establish evaluation strategies.
                          Develop tests and exams and define associated security and
                          administration procedures.
                          Define metrics and data collection/tracking procedures (e.g.,

                          Establish requirements and procedures for archiving student
                          materials.


Basic IBI             Regardless of the type of IBI, the following components should be
components            part of an on-line IBI product: the Home page, Identifiers and
                      Help, Critical course data, Tools, and Page features.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5         1 November 2002                                          307




Home page              This is the first page that a student will see after accessing the
                       course.

                       Home Page Design
                          It should be simple and should avoid large, complicated
                          graphics.
                          At a minimum, it should display the course number and title,
                          and name and location of the school/unit.
                          It may contain a main menu with all major sections listed with
                          hyperlinks to each section, or you may choose a hierarchical
                          menu in which the main menu leads to sub-menus with
                          further links. Limit the number of sub-menus to three if
                          possible.
                          Choose sequential pages in which the homepage scrolls
                          down sequentially.
                          Choose the linear selection model in which buttons are
                          marked on a line that represents different stages or time
                          periods along a continuum.

                       Introduction: List on the home page any greetings, credits, date
                       of last update, and other pertinent data.

Critical course data   Depending on the size and purpose of your IBI project, list these
                       things on separate pages:

                       Course Components
                          Course overview
                          Course objectives
                          Class syllabus and outlines
                          Course requirements and prerequisites
                          Course schedule

                       Assignments and Tests: Be sure to include a section that lists
                       student assignments, required readings, criteria for grading, due
                       dates, and penalties for late work. Include all information relating
                       to tests and grading procedures. Give a sample test, and provide
                       download capability.


Tools                  How to Learn and Protocols: Include an explanation on how to
                       learn on-line and how to navigate through the course.
                           Point out major differences associated with this new mode of
                           learning.
                           Clearly state the roles and responsibilities of the instructor
                           and students.
                           Clarify the rules of engagement for on-line communication.

                       Administrative Information: List any requirements and
                       protocols relating to how students gain access to support
                       personnel for information related to enrollments, completion
                       dates, disenrollments, etc. Provide links to appropriate
                       administrative officers and to relevant institutional policies.

                       Procedures for Student Advising and E-mail Addresses of
                       Instructional Personnel: Be sure to tell students how they can
                       get advice and instructional help.

                       Glossary of New Terminology: Define all new terms. Key
                       words can be linked to these definitions throughout the course via
                       hypertext.

                       Supplemental Resources List: List relevant resources and
                       where to locate them.

Page features       Biographical Sketches of Instructional Personnel: Include
                    biographies of all key personnel who may be interacting with the
                    students. Invite learners to include brief biographical sketches;
                    provide instructions on how to do this. (Note: It is better to have
                    learners enter their own information to protect Privacy Act
                    information.)

                    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Pages: Posting frequently
                    asked questions and their answers will cut down on the number
                    of spontaneous questions asked.

                    Course Evaluation and Feedback Forms: Give students an
                    opportunity to evaluate the course and to give feedback during
                    the course.

                    Size of Text/Audio/Video/Graphic Files: Inform users of the
                    approximate file size, and how long downloads will take.

                    Time of Day/Traffic on Net: Inform users of the best time of day
                    (least traffic) to use the Internet.


Additional IBI      In addition to the basic IBI components, other on-line features
components          might be incorporated into a virtual “classroom”. Procedures
                    need to be established during the development phase.

                    On-line Interaction: Make sure students have a way to
                    communicate on-line. The following modes can be used:

                        One-to-one can be used for confidential communications
                        between individual students and the instructor or when two
                        students need to have a private conversation.
                        One-to-many is similar to the traditional lecture approach and
                        works for lecture style presentation.
                        Many-to-one is a special feature that allows students to
                        access experts around the world in a conferencing session,
                        or by posting their questions.
                        Many-to-many is a discussion group forum such as bulletin
                        boards or conferencing areas and is described below.
                        Asynchronous conferencing can become difficult to follow if
                        too many people are interacting.

                                                                   Continued on next page

Additional IBI      Conferencing: Chat room, bulletin board, E-mail and several
components          COTS products provide mechanisms to features for students to
(Continued)         post information and to raise or respond to topic-related
                    questions.

                        Software used for this will list the date and time of each
                        comment, the name (or cyber nickname) of the student
                        making each comment.
                        Chat room or bulletin board discussions can be threaded (i.e.,
                        tied to each other electronically so that related conversations
                        are linked), electronically archived for analysis, and printed.
                        If synchronous on-line conferencing is used, the software will
                        indicate when a student enters the conference so all
                        participants can see who is present in the forum.
                        Limit the number of people who can participate in a
                        synchronous conference so that the discussions do not
                        become unruly.

                    On-line Library and Web Resources for Reference Materials:
                    Include electronic or on-line access to topical areas and
                    hyperlinks to relevant on-line resources.

                    Directory of Other Students: Because these methods of IBI
                    involve student-to-student interaction, each student should know
                    who is registered for the course and how to get in touch with
                    other students.

                    Student Evaluation/Testing: Any IBI course should incorporate
                    some form of knowledge testing. On-line testing using Web page
                    forms to provide fill-in-the-blank, short answer, multiple-choice,
                    and true-false questions is one possible method for evaluating
                    students. However, security of test material and test results, and
                    student authentication are issues that would need to be
                    addressed if a proctor is not available to monitor the student
                    testing.

Helpful hints for      The following helpful hints and support strategies are provided for
instructional          IBI instructional designers/developers:
designers
                       Design Issues
                          Divide the learning event into smaller segments and use
                          various types of technology to meet the different learning
                          goals.
                          Design instructional content for readability, navigability, and
                          interaction, all of which affect learner retention.
                          Use frames only if necessary since they increase complexity
                          and apparent load time.
                          Image maps provide a graphical interface for
                          navigation/hyperlinks, but they must be used wisely since the
                          transfer/load time is longer.

                       Development Techniques
                          Use standardized templates, and keep screens simple and
                          uncluttered.
                          Use forms creatively to provide active learning and interaction
                          (feedback, quizzes/testing, interface to databases, etc.)
                          Avoid using fixed width tables.
                          Make documents easy to print (consider distributing lengthy
                          documents in printed format to avoid shifting the cost and
                          burden of printing to the user/unit).
                          Check all URLs to ensure they are current and that they do
                          not contain any objectionable material.
                          TEST EVERYTHING!!!!


Use of color           Tips for using color:

                           Use color sparingly and consistently.
                           Use color for contrast and to highlight specific words.
                           Avoid clashing colors. Soft backgrounds with sharp
                           contrasting text usually work best.
                           Select a text color that will be legible when printed. Then test
                           it.

Use of text            Tips for text:

                           Use no more than three different font sizes on a page.
                           Flush left margins are better than centered text.
                           Do not display text that disappears after a certain amount of
                           time.
                           Use lists instead of paragraphs to cut down on text.
                           Avoid special effects (blinking, flashing, or moving text)
                           unless desired for emphasis, or to gain attention.
                           Use natural dialogue and a spell checker.


Use of graphics /      Tips for graphics/images:
images
                           For optimization, use the JPEG file format for high color
                           photographs and the GIF file format for 8-bit images, if
                           possible.
                           Use thumbnail images with links to larger files, if possible.
                           Use images for functional reasons such as for navigation,
                           clarification, or identification, not to entertain the learner.
                           Use smaller graphics when possible to speed up download
                           time.

Use of video      Some tips for producing quality video files or streaming video for
                  the Internet are:

                      Do not indiscriminately use videos produced for TV monitors.
                      Net video reduces resolution significantly. What looks good
                      on a TV may look bad on the net. Produce or re-edit Net
                      videos from scratch. Test them prior to use to ensure quality.
                      Make titles big. Avoid shots with small details. Type is
                      difficult to read with low resolution and small frame sizes.
                      Use close-ups to enhance detail in important areas.
                      Avoid lengthy headshots. Lip synchronization may be a
                      problem. Avoid tight close-ups. Text may obscure part of the
                      image.
                      Use smaller frame sizes for video to enable as fast a frame-
                      per-second rate as possible.
                      Make video sequences as short as possible.
                      Open and close video sequences with high quality still
                      frames.
                      Use many illustrative cutaways. If the video slows down, the
                      cutaways will look like still frames instead of long dissolves or
                      wipes.
                      Use fewer colors in video graphic screens and animations.
                      For graphics, use a 16-color palette and avoid shading,
                      transparencies, and textures.
                      Use the highest quality camera available, preferably a digital
                      video camcorder, and edit digitally (digital in, and digital out).
                      The better the source, the better the end result.
                      When creating primary .AVI or MPEG files from videotape
                      masters, create several versions with different audio bit rates
                      prior to recording for the Web. This will help in the selection
                      of that format for the .AVI file that provides the best
                      compromise between music and voice.
                      Most streaming video encoders work best with
                      uncompressed .AVI source files.

                                    Test and retest everything –
                                  there is no substitute for quality.

                                    Section D
                               IBI Implementation

Introduction        Once the IBI course is on-line and operational, it is important to
                    ensure that the instructional system continues to receive the
                    necessary support and maintenance. Both internal and external
                    evaluations should be conducted regularly to ensure effective
                    instruction and cost-efficient operations are maintained.

                    Implementation functions include:

                        Management
                        Administration
                        Support
                        Delivery
                        Conduct of Instruction


Management          Management of the instructional system does not end with the
function            implementation of the IBI course of instruction. The continued
                    planning, organizing, coordinating, evaluating, and reporting
                    activities are the shared responsibility of all the individuals directly
                    involved with the IBI course. Active management of a distance
                    learning course versus a traditional resident course is more
                    critical because of the distributed and dynamic nature of the
                    instruction and resources.


Administration      Administrative support is an essential component of a successful
function            IBI program. The support staff (at both individual DL sites and at
                    the IBI administrative center) performs this function. The
                    development of the administrative processes and procedures was
                    accomplished during the development phase. Implementation
                    requires the careful coordination of those processes and
                    procedures, including:

                        Student management (registration, processing, data tracking,
                        etc.)
                        Administrative records and reports
                        Personnel support (personnel records, processing, etc.)

                                                                      Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                       315




Administration             Resource scheduling and tracking (students, equipment
function                   utilization, etc.)
(Continued)                Database management.

                       Note: Course administration takes on new dimensions when
                       delivering courses over the Internet. Developers are advised to
                       contact AFDLO for guidance on establishing appropriate
                       processes and procedures on this subject.


Support function       An IBI course cannot be effectively delivered or maintained
                       unless technical, maintenance, and training support are available.
                       As stated in the previous section, the requirements, processes,
                       and procedures should have been developed and tested during
                       the development phase. The support functions include:

                           Maintaining facilities and equipment.
                           Supplying equipment and instructional course materials.
                           Providing services such as network engineering, courseware
                           revision and maintenance, publication, etc.


Helpful hints for      The following are helpful hints and support strategies for IBI
instructors            instructors:

                       Planning
                          Be aware that students have different learning and
                          communication styles.
                          Remember that students must take responsibility and an
                          active role in the learning process.
                          Plan to introduce the students to the IBI process. Make sure
                          they understand how the course will be administered and
                          what protocols will be used.
                          To compensate for the lack of cues that indicate feelings and
                          emotions, adopt a set of symbols to convey emotions.
                          Establish electronic and telephone office hours as required to
                          assist students.

                                                                      Continued on next page

Helpful hints for      Materials
instructors               Distribute class announcements through E-mail or post in a
(Continued)               special area on the bulletin board.
                          Use pre-class study assignments, questions, and guides to
                          prepare students for interactive or collaborative on-line
                          lessons. Encourage discussion and interaction.
                          Put lecture notes on-line for student reference.
                          Provide a range of approved universal resource locators
                          (URLs) or hot links for supplemental reading and research.
                          Prepare case studies and make separate pages for each.
                          Use a traditional case study with open-ended questions built
                          into the body. Students would answer the questions by filling
                          in blanks in scrolling text files. Both the questions and the
                          answers would appear within the case file.

                       Interactivity
                           Divide students into groups and have them discuss case
                           studies, a conference, and publish on-line reports.
                           Set up a student group to serve the function of the “student
                           lounge”. On-line students can interact without the instructor
                           looking in.
                           Encourage brainstorming in a small-group setting by opening
                           up a separate conference area and invite students to come
                           up with solutions to particular problems or to generate ideas
                           and proposals.
                           For on-line collaboration among members of a large group, it
                           is important to focus the group (and keep them focused) on a
                           particular problem or set of issues.
                           Humanize the process. Make sure students have access to a
                           real live human tutor. Personally, welcome each student to
                           the on-line class.
                           Assign specific research tasks to students either individually
                           or in groups. Students can present reports online or publish
                           their reports on their own web pages.
                           Provide timely feedback via E-mail, fax, phone, etc.,
                           regarding performance on tests, assignments, and projects to
                           help motivate the student.
                           Recruit other SMEs and interesting personalities to lecture
                           on-line or to have discussions with the students.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5       1 November 2002                                      317




Delivery function      Instructors. The effectiveness and success of a distance
                       learning program are dependent primarily upon the instructors
                       who manage and deliver the instruction. The instructors must
                       adapt to a learner-centered instructional environment and change
                       from their traditional role as a teacher to become more of a
                       facilitator, guide, consultant, resource provider, and learning team
                       member. Therefore, instructors must be able to:

                           Understand the needs of the remotely located students.
                           Be sensitive to the different learning styles and adapt the
                           instruction.
                           Effectively function as a facilitator and content provider.
                           Understand the delivery technology and effectively use the
                           equipment.
                           Be prepared to spend more time on learner support that one
                           would for a traditional course; responding to learners’ e-mails,
                           participating in chat rooms, and providing individualized
                           guidance can consume a great deal of time.

                       Delivery System. Operating and maintaining the instructional
                       delivery system is another key function. The most critical
                       component is the computer network system, which is the primary
                       instructional link or bridge to the student.

                       The student (and instructor) must be proficient with the computer
                       equipment, and have reliable network access and connections. If
                       required, computer training must be provided to minimize the
                       occurrence of “operator errors.”

                       Note: Technological advances now permit access to the Internet
                       by means of television that is PC independent. As technology
                       evolves, the impact of interface and capacity issues will
                       decrease.

                                IBI Evaluation

Introduction      Evaluation is the last phase in the ISD process. As with other
                  instructional technologies, the evaluation process for IBI consists
                  of a formative, summative, and operational evaluation (refer to
                  Chapter 2). This section addresses the special considerations for
                  conducting IBI evaluations.


Formative         The formative evaluation begins in the analysis phase and
evaluation        continues through the development phase of the ISD process.
                  Because IBI learners are usually remote from any direct support
                  structure, formative evaluation of the course takes on absolutely
                  critical importance.

                                   The rule is: test and retest.
                                     And then test again.


Summative         The primary purpose of the summative evaluation is to determine
evaluation        whether the IBI course achieves the established objectives. In
                  the case of IBI, this assessment also includes an evaluation of
                  the effectiveness of the delivery system and support processes.

                  It must be noted that IBI courses present unique challenges for
                  those preparing a summative evaluation program. A limited
                  access site should be established so that impartial
                  representatives of the learner population can access the course
                  and perform the required activities. Structured feed back forms
                  can be developed to help the sample learners focus and
                  comment on specific aspects of the course. The feedback
                  received from the sample learners is used to identify problems
                  and take corrective actions prior to implementation of the course.


Operational       Operational evaluation is an ongoing process that accomplished
evaluation        after the formative and summative evaluations. This evaluation is
                  based on internal and external feedback data such as:
                      Instructor/facilitator comments (internal)
                      Student critiques (internal)

                                                                   Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235      Volume 5         1 November 2002                                        319




Operational               Results of embedded data collection systems (metrics to
evaluation                assess reliability of hardware/software, and to collect data
(Continued)               such as student connect time, time spent in course-
                          established chat rooms, etc.)
                          Test results (internal)
                          Inspection and evaluation reports (external)

                      Results of such assessments are considered during course
                      update cycles.


Areas of evaluation   Design the evaluations to get both positive and negative
                      feedback. Some general areas to consider in evaluating the
                      delivery of the IBI course are:

                          Course content – organization, relevancy, clarity, quality,
                          currency, etc.
                          Course materials – adequacy, availability, effectiveness,
                          currency, etc.
                          Instructional methods/media – effectiveness, interaction
                          quantity/quality, etc.
                          Instructional equipment – availability, reliability, ease of use,
                          etc.
                          Internet/Intranet network – access, speed, reliability, etc.
                          Instructor support – necessity, availability, effectiveness, etc.
                          Technical support – access, availability, timeliness,
                          effectiveness, etc.
                          Administrative support – usefulness, adequacy, availability,
                          etc.


Evaluation            Various collection strategies can be employed to gather IBI
strategies            evaluation data:

                          Written questionnaires/critiques/tests that can be mailed or
                          faxed.
                          Electronic questionnaires/critiques/tests that can be
                          accomplished on-line.
                          E-mail/bulletin board correspondence.
                          Audio conferences.
                          Telephone interviews.

                           SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY

Introduction      This chapter provides general considerations for the incorporation
                  of support technologies into IMI, IBI, and IVT instruction. These
                  support technologies can be used in conjunction with the other
                  instructional media to enhance instruction.

                  The ISD process for IMI, IBI, and IVT resident and non-resident
                  instruction should include the selection and application of these
                  supporting instructional technologies.

                            Electronic Testing

Electronic       Electronic testing is a support technology for IMI, IBI, and IVT that
testing          can be used to gather information from learners and assess their
                 progress before, during, and after the learning process. By
                 considering electronic testing during the ISD process, instruc-
                 tional designers can add electronic testing to find out what
                 learners know, how well are they learning during the course, and
                 assess what they have learned. These tests can be embedded
                 within the instructional material and/or distributed electronically
                 via email, bulletin boards, student response units, an intranet, or
                 the Internet/WWW.

                 Applications for electronic testing can be used to:

                 Access Learning
                    Distribute quizzes, tests, and surveys for study aids,
                    diagnostic tests, pre-course skills assessments, and course
                    evaluations.
                    Administer practice, pre-configured, and competency testing
                    Administer equipment and system knowledge exams and
                    certifications
                    Determine learner needs and attitudes through
                    questionnaires
                    Assess staff members' readiness for certain courses.

                 Provide Feedback
                    Provide interactive and instant feedback and responses to
                    learners
                    Show learners an analysis of all answers with the percentage
                    of learners choosing each answer.
                    Show test scores for all learners who have taken the test
                    Create self-administered teaching materials
                    Arrange jumps or links to other tests

Types of questions   Instructional designers can create and design various types of
                     questions electronically. Some of these formats include:

                         Multiple choice, in which the learners select one choice from
                         multiple answers.
                         Multiple response, which is similar to multiple choice, except
                         learners are not limited to choosing one response; they can
                         select none, one, or more of the choices offered.
                         Text questions, where the learner answers by typing a
                         designated amount of text. The instructional designer should
                         define what is right or wrong in advance by entering a list of
                         acceptable answers. Text questions allow learners to ask
                         questions without prompting possible solutions. This
                         question type also works well when soliciting short opinions
                         or suggestions on a particular subject.
                         Selection questions, where a series of statements are
                         presented and the learners can select from a number of
                         items and answers. This question type is ideal for designing
                         matching questions, ranking questions, or to present a series
                         of yes/no, true/false, or other simple multiple choice
                         questions on the same screen.


Security             Special consideration should be given to security issues for
                     electronic testing.

                         Questions and answers should be password protected.
                         Answers should only be accepted if a password is entered
                         correctly. When using web-based testing, these answers
                         should be held in map files separate from the HTML files the
                         learners see.

                                      Section B
                            Electronic Management Tools

Electronic              Electronic management tools are computer programs that can aid
management tools        in the instructional process. These tools can be used as:

                            Decision support aids.
                            Job aids.
                            Tools to support the conduct and administration of instruction.

                        Two specific types of electronic management tools used to
                        support courses are:

                            Computer-Managed Instruction (CMI)
                            Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI)


Integration of CMI      CMI can be integrated in IMI and IBI courseware and perform the
                        following course administration and management functions:

                            Scheduling of training.
                            Recording and tracking individual and group performance
                            data.
                            Providing information on performance trends over time.

                        Automated CMI functions assist the instructor in managing
                        instruction:
                             Manage the development of course structures and curricula
                             rapidly and flexibly.
                             Provide for management of testing and evaluation of student
                             performance and progress.
                             Register and enroll large numbers of learners easily with their
                             associated demographic data.
                             Administer and track student progress in curricula for training
                             administrators.
                             Ease the difficulty of student access, enrollment, and
                             monitoring of their personal training.
                             Provide for automatically collecting and managing student
                             data and eliminating the need for manual data entry.
                             Allow user choice and flexibility through system openness.
                             Provide rapid and direct feedback to learners, administrators,
                             operating managers.

Integration of CAI      CAI can be developed to aid in the delivery of classroom
                        instruction, and can provide for the storage and retrieval of
                        information for both the instructor and student.

                        When integrated with a network system of instructor and student
                        stations in a classroom, the instructor can manage and control
                        the training environment by:

                            Observing each student station, and the performance of
                            individual learners. For example, student responses to
                            instructor-generated questions, questions from individual
                            learners to the instructor, student performance on collective
                            exercises, student performance on individual tests, exercises,
                            and problem scenarios, etc.
                            Controlling student functions, such as access to courseware,
                            tests, other student stations, access to reference materials,
                            etc.
                            Providing assistance to learners from the instructor station.
                            For example, providing real-time help, remediation
                            courseware, tutorial instruction, etc.
                            Accessing other electronic media for display in the classroom
                            environment such as Electronic Performance Support
                            Systems (EPSS), and Interactive Electronic Technical
                            Manuals (IETM).

                        CAI systems can be used to provide:

                         assigned to operating activities.
                         CAI can provide an instructor with the capability to access
                         IETMs, and other forms of digital instructional materials.

                     CAI may consist of only an instructor workstation that supports
                     automated development and delivery, or may be a full suite of
                     student workstations networked to the instructor station.

                         CAI provides the instructor with an efficient means for
                         developing and displaying personal course annotations,
                         including related graphics, videos, and other multimedia.

                         presentation of the course materials, student study, and
                         monitoring student activities are controlled from the instructor
                         workstation.

                              Electronic Publications

Electronic            An electronic publication is a document prepared in a digital form
publications          for display to an end user. Two examples of electronic
                      publications are electronic guides and Interactive Electronic
                      Technical Manuals (IETM).

                      Electronic Guides. Electronic Guides are automated electronic
                      versions of training guides that can be developed to replace the
                      traditional paper-based training guides. Electronic guides can be
                      maintained in a computer-based file, or on a CD-ROM, on the
                      Web, or other electronic medium.

                          Data can be retrieved for instruction in the classroom, in a
                          learning center, or during on-the job training.
                          Data can be provided during performance of a job as an
                          Electronic Job Aid.

                      To develop an automated guide to aid instruction, ask the
                      following questions:
                           What guides are appropriate for automation of instructional
                           presentations?
                           How can the materials be automated most effectively and
                           efficiently?
                           Are there software tools available to support the
                           development?
                           What are the anticipated benefits of this development?
                           What impact will this development have on student
                           performance?
                           What are the requirements for staff support and training?

                         Learners and instructors can use bulletin boards to post
                         messages, and participate in or instigate class “discussions.”
                         Messages can be sent to a designated location on a bulletin
                         board, allowing designated class or group members to easily
                         locate them.
                         Instructors can use bulletin boards to post schedules and
                         assignments, and notify learners of any changes.

      THE ADVANCED DISTRIBUTED LEARNING (ADL) INITIATIVE
                                         Overview


Introduction          This chapter discusses the implications of the ADL initiative for
                      design, development, and deployment of instruction.


What is Advanced      ADL is an initiative launched in November, 1997, by the
Distributed           Department of Defense (DoD) and the White House Office of
Learning (ADL)?       Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The purpose of the
                      Initiative is to provide access to high quality cost-effective training
                      and education that can be tailored to the individual, and made
                      available anywhere and any time it is required.

                      ADL is a collaborative public/private partnership involving the
                      broader education and training community. It provides a common
                      framework for developing, administering, and using distributed
                      learning content and tools.

                      While ADL does involve a form of Distance Learning (DL), it is
                      more narrowly focused on technology-based methods for
                      enabling access to content on-demand, and developing
                      standards for reusable learning objects that are interoperable
                      across Learning Management System (LMS) platforms.

                      Although ADL is not restricted to IBI, the Internet and networks
                      based on Internet/WWW standards are envisioned as the primary
                      means for providing access to ADL instructional content.
                      Therefor, the information presented in Chapter 9 applies
                      generally to ADL as well.

                      This Chapter will focus on the key ADL concept of reusable
                      learning objects and the implications of that concept for
                      instructional analysis, design, development, and deployment.

                          systems that can dynamically assemble content to meet
                          individual needs.


Current constraints   COTS development tools and LMS products are only beginning
                      to implement the SCORM guidelines. Some lower-level technical
                      issues affecting interoperability remain to be fully resolved.


Before you begin      Search the ADL Home Page and related DoD and Air Force links
                      to discover the current state of ADL implementation. This is a
                      rapidly changing environment. New Internet/WWW standards
                      and advances in technology will affect the direction of ADL-
                      related development.

                               ADL Background

ADL Sharable        The ADL Initiative Partnership has published the Sharable
Courseware Object   Courseware Object Reference Model (SCORM). SCORM
Reference Model     presents a set of guidelines that describe an approach to
(SCORM)             developing instruction based on sharable courseware objects.
                    These interrelated specifications define a Web-based (IBI)
                    learning content model that meets DoD’s high level requirements
                    for ADL:

                       Accessibility: the ability to access instructional components
                       from one remote location and deliver them to many other
                       locations;
                       Interoperability: the ability to use instructional components
                       developed in one location with one set of tools or platform in
                       another location with a different set of tools or platform (note:
                       there are multiple levels of interoperability);
                       Durability: instructional components that do not require
                       redesign or re-coding to operate when base technology
                       changes;
                       Reusability: the design of instructional components so that
                       it can be incorporated into multiple applications.

                    To meet these requirements, ADL assumes an Internet/WWW-
                    based infrastructure where content is delivered to a platform-
                    neutral browser. The reference model defines a generalized
                    Learning Management System (LMS) that is capable of launching
                    and communicating with courseware objects, and transferring
                    whole courses from one LMS environment to another.

                    SCORM defines a course as consisting of the following elements:

                       Shareable Courseware Objects (SCOs): Content consists
                       of collections of SCOs. The lowest level (atomic) SCO is
                       called an Assignable Unit (AU). An AU is an executable
                       “chunk” of instruction that can be launched by a LMS and
                       exchange data with it. AUs are organized into Block of
                       various levels (module, unit, lesson, etc.), and can be of any
                       size, but smaller is better.

                                                                   Continued on next page

ADL Sharable            Course Structure Format (CSF): The CSF consists of an
Courseware Object       Extensible Markup Language (XML) representation of course
Reference Model         structure (relationships and sequencing of AUs and Block),
(SCORM)                 and references to all the course elements (content, metadata
(Continued)             records, and raw media) required to move an entire course
                        in-tact from one LMS to another.
                        Run Time Environment (RTE): The SCORM RTE specifies
                        the launch protocol used by a LMS to execute an AU, and a
                        common application programming interface (API) and data
                        model to enable data exchange between the LMS and AU.
                        Within the RTE, an LMS can provide student history and
                        profile data to any SCORM-compliant learning application
                        (AU), and an AU can move student-tracking data to any
                        compliant LMS during execution.
                        Metadata: As the SCORM guidelines are implemented in
                        both the public and private sectors, very large and continually
                        growing repositories of courses, content (AUs and Block),
                        and raw media will rapidly develop. Locating the specific
                        learning resources needed among these widely distributed
                        databases could be a real challenge. The solution is to “wrap
                        metadata around” (i.e. associate with) all these objects. In
                        this context, metadata provides standardized descriptions of
                        entire course “packages,” content objects, and raw media.
                        SCORM incorporates the IEEE Learning Technology
                        Standardization Committee Learning Object Metadata (P-
                        1484-12) standard along with the EDUCAUSE Instructional
                        Management System (IMS) metadata implementation in
                        XML.

                    The RTE insures data interchange and interoperability among
                    content objects and LMSs. The CSF provides interoperability for
                    entire courses across all compliant LMSs. Metadata records
                    facilitate the identification and location of specific learning
                    resources regardless of where they reside on the network, and
                    contribute greatly to the reusability of the objects they describe.

                    By searching on metadata, developers can locate existing media
                    to re-purpose into new content. Training managers and even
                    learners can locate individual “chunks” of content that can be
                    used for performance support or refresher training, or put
                    together into a personalized course tailored to the learners
                    needs. This capability will enable the development of adaptive
                    learning systems that can assemble tailored courses on the fly.

                                  Section B
                          ADL Implications for Design

Introduction      The intention of the ADL Initiative is to break full instructional
                  courses down into smaller components known as Assignable
                  Units (AUs). AUs then become self-contained units of information
                  that are given keyword and search information known as
                  metadata tags. The AUs are then placed in a large digital
                  repository, or database, that will be made available to
                  instructional developers. Developers can then search the
                  information, read metadata tag descriptions, and construct
                  lessons using available AUs.

                  Ideally, AUs should be small, self-contained units of instruction.
                  Each AU should cover no more than one or two clearly stated
                  objectives. The instructional design process should analyze
                  content into these individual components. The Course Structure
                  Format (CSF) specifies the intended course-level relationships
                  among AUs. This approach results in maximum reusability, and
                  supports the flexible use of content for providing on-demand
                  performance support and personalized courses.


Benefits          The primary benefits of Assignable Units are:

                     Reusability. The greatest benefit of breaking down
                     instructional information into AUs is the ability of instructional
                     designers and developers to reuse information. Information
                     that has been previously developed can be captured and
                     included in new courses where applicable. This eliminates the
                     need for designers to research and develop instruction that
                     already exists. This not only reduces development time, but
                     development costs as well.

                     Just-In-Time Training. When full libraries of AUs have been
                     developed, designers can create timely instruction for
                     unexpected military contingencies. Because of the dynamic
                     nature of world military operations, military personnel may
                     need training for operations with which they are unfamiliar.
                     Operations specific instruction can be quickly developed and
                     delivered to military personnel for just-in-time training.

                                                                  Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235        Volume 5        1 November 2002                                        338




Benefits                   Differing Learning Styles. Learners possess varying
(Continued)                learning styles that may necessitate different presentation
                           strategies. Using AUs, lessons can be developed that present
                           information in different sequences, in greater or less detail,
                           and with more or fewer examples. This allows users with
                           different learning styles receive the most efficient and effective
                           instruction available.

                           Self-Structured Learning. With AUs available to learners,
                           students, where applicable, can have the opportunity to pick
                           and choose what instructional segments they can skip and
                           what instructional segments they need to cover. This allows
                           learners to maximize their training time by examining only the
                           information they haven’t learned and not the information they
                           already possess.


Assignable Unit       According to Robert Gagné, effective lessons can be constructed
(AU) Composition      if the following nine events are followed:

                      1.   Gain Attention
                      2.   Inform Learner of Objectives
                      3.   Stimulate Recall of prior learning
                      4.   Present Stimulus Material
                      5.   Provide Learner Guidance
                      6.   Elicit Performance
                      7.   Provide Feedback
                      8.   Assess Performance
                      9.   Enhance Retention and Transfer

                      With the advent of Assignable Units, information cannot be
                      chunked in such a grandiose way. However, lessons that follow
                      this general structure can be constructed from AUs. Examining
                      Gagné’s nine events, it is discovered that certain events logically
                      coincide. By combining events, three categories of AUs can be
                      created.

Categories of AUs      The following table describes the combined instructional events.

    Unit               Event                             Explanation
                                  Informational Assignable Units contain the bulk of the
Informational       2. Inform     presentation information necessary for instruction.
                    Learner of    The objective is directly linked to the information that
                    Objectives    supports the objective, which, in turn, is directly linked
                                  to the assessment that evaluates mastery of the
                    4. Present    objective. It is important that these events remain
                    Stimulus      connected. Without a direct link between the three
                    Material      events, information presented may not match the
                                  objective, making objective mastery impossible to
                    8. Assess     correctly assess.
                    Performance
                                  Informational AUs may be further categorized (see
                                  the following table).
                                  Example Assignable Units contain all illustrative
Example             5. Provide    examples and non-examples. Although examples and
                    Learner       non-examples are directly linked to the presentation
                    Guidance      information, the Example AU is kept separate
                                  because different presentation and learning styles
                                  may necessitate more or fewer examples and non-
                                  examples.
                                  Practice Assignable Units contain the practice items

                                  AUs, Practice AUs are directly linked to their
                    7. Provide    corresponding Informational AUs. Practice AUs are

                                  styles may necessitate more or less practice and
                                  feedback.

Informational AUs        Informational AUs can be further broken down by information
                         type. The following table presents the Informational AU types
                         using established Instructional Design terms.

Additional events      Not all of Gagné’s nine events have been covered this AU
                       classification system. This is not because these steps have been
                       deemed useless. This is because these steps are unique to each
                       assembly of Assignable Units and most likely will not be reused.
                       Therefore, these steps cannot be classified as Assignable Units.
                       They are, however, extremely important in the development of
                       instruction. These three remaining steps are presented in the
                       table on the following page. It is recommended that after a
                       developer has compiled Assignable Units into a lesson or
                       lessons, the developer author these events as necessary.

                                      specific to the Informational AU, it is, in fact,
                                      unique to the lesson. The lesson flow may
                                      dictate a specific attention-gaining device. Also,
                                      a thematic approach may be used when more
                                      than one lesson is constructed. In this case,
                                      attention-gaining devises should be similar from
                                      lesson to lesson.
                                      This step is presented so learners may construct
3. Stimulate Recall of Prior Learning an informational schema; the information they
                                      are about to receive is in some way linked to the
                                      information they have already received.
                                      Because Informational AUs can be grouped in
                                      any order and in any fashion, the transitions
                                      between AUs will differ. Transitions must be
                                      created for each unique grouping of AUs and
                                      lessons.
                                      This step is also presented in the effort to build

                                      step will be unique to particular lesson

                   ADL Implications for Development

Introduction      The development process for ADL courseware involves:

                      Building each AU, either as an encapsulated executable or
                      XML structure that links to each media object;

                      Defining all the metadata elements that describe that AU;

                      Implementing the RTE APIs and data model to communicate
                      with a LMS; and,

                      Defining the course-level relationships among AUs, and links
                      all the related course elements.

                  Aspects of this process unique to ADL SCORM are described
                  below.


Metadata          Metadata is the information that describes and labels Assignable
composition       Units. It allows developers to quickly search and locate pertinent,
                  existing AUs for use in new instruction. It is recommended that
                  developers use the Information Management System (IMS)
                  standards for metadata creation. The following describes the
                  major groups of metadata tags.

                  General
                  General metadata includes the AU title, language, description,
                  and keywords.

                  Lifecycle
                  Lifecycle metadata includes the AU version number, build status,
                  and build date.

                  MetaMetadata
                  MetaMetadata includes the AU catalog entry and contributors.

                  Technical
                  Technical metadata includes the AU file format, size, location,
                  and requirements.

                                                                 Continued on next page

Metadata              Educational
composition           Educational metadata includes the AU interactivity type and level,
(Continued)           learning resource type, context, and target audience information.

                      Rights
                      Rights metadata includes the AU copyright information.

                      Relation
                      Relation metadata includes the relationship between this
                      resource and other targeted resources, if any.

                      Annotation
                      Annotation metadata includes the AU author and publish date.

                      Classification
                      Classification metadata includes the AU purpose and taxonomy.


AU construction       Extensible Markup Language (XML) is the construction tool of
                      choice for implementing AUs and CMI systems. XML is a
                      standard mark-up language that uses tags that represent
                      elements to which attributes can be applied. The instructional
                      content is linked from a database and placed between the
                      attribute tags. The attributes specified by the tags are then
                      applied to the content for visual and organizational purposes.

                      The XML language also gives developers the ability to nest
                      attribute tags within other attribute tags. This allows multiple
                      attributes to be applied to the content. This also allows separate
                      AUs to be placed and organized in the same document. XML files
                      can then be imported from and exported to other CMI systems.
                      This allows developers to keep the organization of the lesson the
                      same, regardless of the CMI system used. The XML code will
                      also contain the metadata tags that help describe and organize
                      content information as well as define course structure and ensure
                      interoperability.


SCORM Course          The purpose of an XML document is to lay out the design and
Structure Format      structure of course content as well as modularize segments of
(CSF)                 content. The SCORM Course Structure Format is an XML

                                                                    Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235         Volume 5      1 November 2002                                       344




SCORM Course           document that defines course structure and points to all the
Structure Format       course elements, AUs, metadata, and raw media. Once the XML
(CSF) (Continued)      document segments the information, the AUs can be stored in a
                       database for later use. By using the XML language, the course
                       material becomes interoperable, allowing AUs to be combined
                       with other AUs regardless of operating system.

                       The XML code does not contain any instruction in itself. Instead,
                       it points the way to specific AUs and defines the relationships
                       among them. The following is and example of XML code that
                       points to an AU.

AUs in an Learning     The implementation for the interchange between AUs and a LMS
Management             doesn’t deviate from the model that AICC/IEEE have already
System (LMS)           established in the figure below.

                       The LMS allows access to the databases, repositories and
                       servers that house the course content and can be implemented
                       numerous ways. The standards of ODBC are encouraged for
                       database implementation and allow for LMS systems to be
                       swapped using the same databases.

                       When the AU is incorporated into a Computer Managed
                       Instruction (CMI) system, the AU must accept and deliver values
                       and identifiers. An AU is presented with “public” functions that

                                                                     Continued on next page

System (LMS)         CMI system and the learner.

                     The chart shows the content server on the top interacting with the
                     student computer on the bottom. Content information is passed
                     from the server to the student machine through a Web browser.
                     Any student input is collected through the API adapter and
                     delivered to learning server. The adapter facilitates the
                     communication between the CMI and the learner and has two
                     potential approaches for implementation:

                     HTTP based Protocol
                         The CMI launches the AU sending it two important values: A
                         Session ID and URL to a CGI/ASP/Servelet that will receive
                         tracking data from the AU.

                                                                    Continued on next page

AUs in an Learning      The AU will use this session ID to return student-tracking data
Management              directly to the URL of the adapter and will continue to send
System (LMS)            information until an Exit command is encountered.
(Continued)
                     API Based Communication
                        AUs are armed with standard JavaScript functions that “find”
                        the CMI API. All communication with the CMI continues
                        through a series of JavaScript functions embedded in the AU
                        content

                     The API, defined as part of the SCORM Run Time Environment,
                     is the meat of the implementation and commonly uses Java
                     servelets to implement the persistent communication with the
                     server.

expanded to four uplink sites at Wright-Patterson, Maxwell, Sheppard, and Keesler Air
Force bases with more than 80 downlink receive sites typically located at base
education offices and 5 sites within AFRC. The system uses 1-way video, 2-way audio
over a compressed digital video signal, along with a terrestrial audioconferencing
system that permits interaction with all participants. Combined with ANG’s Warrior
Network, the Air Force can reach almost 300 sites within the US and Europe.

Analog Information, such as video and audio, that is recorded and stored in a
continuously variable form similar to its source: information that is not digital.

Appended Systems Embedded Training systems appended, or strapped on to
operational equipment.

Asynchronous Transmission that does not occur simultaneously with the audio and
video associated with the broadcast. Computer Based Training (CBT) and traditional
correspondence courses would be considered to operate in the asynchronous mode.

Audio Bridge Specialized equipment that permits several telephone lines to be joined
together in a conference call.

Audioconferencing Instruction delivered by two-way voice communication.

Audioconferencing Unit A stand-alone microphone that provides a means for
students to provide verbal feedback to the instructor.

Audio Conferencing System (ACS) ACS uses ordinary phone lines for transmitting
voice for multi-point, synchronous interaction. It allows for a free and open exchange
AFH 36-2235       Volume 5        1 November 2002                                       355


instructor-to-student and student-to-student. The ACS includes microphones, and a
speaker and sound mixer unit, and is the interactive part of interactive video teletraining.

Audiographics Two-way audio and two-way computer data exchange.

Bandwidth Capacity of a communications channel. The frequency width needed to
transmit a communications signal without excessive distortion. The more information
contained in a signal, the more bandwidth it requires for distortion-free transmission. For
digital transmission, generally measured in kilobits (Kbps) or megabits per second
(Mbps). The higher the compression, the greater the loss of resolution and fluidity of
motion. But, the higher the compression, the lower the bandwidth requirements, and
consequently, the lower the cost of transmission.

C-Band A type of satellite transmission with less path loss than other satellite
standards such as Ku-Band. C-Band, however, requires a relatively large antenna.
C-Band frequencies are shared with terrestrial microwave transmissions, which cause
interference with weaker satellite signals.

Coaxial Cable System Thinnet (10 Base T2) cable, similar to TV cable. 10 Base T-5
is a thicker cable that permits computers to be farther apart.

CODEC Coding-decoding equipment used to convert and compress analog video
signals into a digital format for two-way video transmission, then convert them back to
analog signal upon reaching their destination. CODECs may also be configured as
send-only and receive-only, and be used to transfer a terrestrial signal to a broadcast
satellite, or vice versa.

Collective Training Training conducted with a team, crew, or group.

Compressed Digital Video (CDV) Compressed Digital Video (CDV) is a signal coding
technology used to compress the bandwidth required for the transmission of video
images by eliminating redundant information within or between video frames; also called
data compression, bandwidth compression, or bit rate reduction. The higher the
compression, the lower the bit transmission rate. Terrestrial VTC network (desktop to
large-screen monitors) use a variety of compression rates beginning at 56 Kbps (low
resolution, less than full motion) to 1.5Mbps (intermittently full-motion, broadcast-quality
video. Satellite broadcast systems allow for the use of full-motion, broadcast-quality
video. It is common to see rates of transmission of 3 to 20 Mbps. ATN uses 3.3 or 6.6
Mbps. This compression rate gives full-motion with a resolution quality that is very
nearly that of normal analog broadcasting. At 3.3 Mbps, you may notice some image
skipping when there is a lot of motion. While most ATN broadcasting is done at 3.3
Mbps, ATN can broadcast at 6.6 Mbps when it is necessary to eliminate all such
skipping. The costs of transmission, however, double for 6.6 Mbps.
