Field Explosive Training Range. All base and tenant agencies engaged in range operations are
responsible for compliance with this publication and applicable procedures. The Privacy Act of
1974 applies to this instruction. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard.

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Agencies must
use TNT equivalencies to calculate Net Explosive Weight. A table of TNT equivalencies can be
found on Attachment 7 of this document. Agencies are no longer required to provide 1
SOCES/CED with their unit explosive operating instructions. This document outlines all
authorized procedures on the Hurlburt Field Explosive Training Range. Abbreviations and
acronyms have been added.

1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. The 1 SOCES/CED Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Flight controls access to the
     range.      All agencies will schedule the range via unit email at
     1SOCES.CEDEOD@HURLBURT.af.mil and contact 1 SOCES/CED operations section at
     (850) 884-7193 to preclude scheduling conflicts.
     1.2. Other agencies, military or federal services that frequently (more than once a year)
     performs explosive operations on Hurlburt Field are required to implement a support
     agreement IAW DODI 4000.19, Interservice and Intergovernmental Support. This
     requirement applies to using the Hurlburt Field EOD demolition range. All requests for one-
     time or emergency use will be routed through the Wing Explosive Safety office to the 1
     SOW/CC for approval.
     1.3. Agencies utilizing the Hurlburt Field Explosive Training Range must provide 1
     SOCES/CED with the following: a sequence of events, to include a listing of all munitions
     to be used during the range operation for approval (Attachment 3), an Operational Risk
     Management assessment (Attachment 4), and Explosives Operations Order (OPORD)
     (Attachment 5).
     1.4. Agencies must sign out a range gate key and radio from 1 SOCES/CED operations. 1
     SOCES/CED does not provide flags or other required equipment unless agencies coordinate
     with 1 SOCES/CED operations section. Units using the range to conduct explosive
     operations with all categories of explosives will review this operating instruction annually.
     Units not in compliance will be unable to sign for use of the Hurlburt Field Explosive
     Training Range. Units accept responsibility and compliance with procedures upon signing
     for the range.
     1.5. All agencies will restrict movement and operations to the approved and cleared
     demolitions area, cleared and maintained access roads, and the identified bunker/training
     area. Movement and operations in wooded areas is prohibited. These restrictions are based on
     a Memorandum of Agreement between the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
     and Hurlburt Field. The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that the wetland area
     surrounding the Hurlburt Field Explosive Training Range will be protected from any form of
     future development or human disturbance that would degrade its ecological value.
     1.6. The Hurlburt Field Explosive Training Range is only permitted for the use of demolition
     training, or emergency disposal of hazardous munitions (EOD only). This area is not defined
     as an “Active range”, or a “Military range”. The use of small arms ammunition is not
     authorized on the Hurlburt Field Explosive Training Range. Expended or unused munitions
     that are not recovered and disposed of properly are considered a solid waste under the 40
     CFR Parts 260 thru 266 and 270--Military Munitions Rule. Violation of this policy will
     result in fines imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Resource
     Conservation and Recovery Act.
     1.7. The senior explosive demolition qualified individual on the range will assume the duties
     of the Range Safety Officer (RSO) or a designated qualified person. The RSO is responsible
     for overall safety on the range.

3. Personnel Limits.
   3.1. A minimum of two explosive demolition qualified personnel are required for any
   explosive operation.
   3.2. When transporting explosives the maximum number of personnel shall not exceed the

   5.1. The Hurlburt Field Explosive Training Range is located west of the Hurlburt Field
   Munitions Storage Area, MGRS 16R EU 25547 65888 (Datum WGS84). All demolition
   shots will be placed in the center of the range between the markers.
   5.2. All training vehicles, inert ordnance items and the robotics training facility located on
   the range are for EOD use only.

   6.2. During emergency disposal operations involving fragment producing munitions (EOD
   only), post guards to deny access to Eglin Range Road 253. Guards will be posted at the
   intersection of Road 668 and 253 (MGRS 16R EU 24755 65392) and at the second bridge
   reached by traveling north on Road 253 (MGRS 16R EU 25515 67080).

                        TNT EQUIVALENCY CALCULATIONS

Table A7.1. TNT Equivalency Table.
     Explosive              TNT        Equivalent
                            Weight
     Composition B          1.16

     Composition C-4        1.37

     TNT                    1.00

A7.1. Above are explosives commonly used on the Explosive Training range. If other
explosives are to be utilized that are not listed, contact 1 SOCES/CED Operations Section for
TNT Equivalency weights.
   A7.1.1. Items such as Military M1 Dynamite which have a TNT equivalency less than 1.00
   will still be calculated using a TNT equivalency of 1.00. Never calculate intentional
   detonations using less than 1.00 TNT equivalency.
A7.2. Calculations.
   A7.2.1. Below is an example of how to calculate TNT Equivalency:
10 Blocks of Composition C-4. Each block of C-4 weighs 1.25 pounds (NEW). C-4 has a TNT
equivalency of 1.37 pounds. 10(blocks of C-4)*1.25=12.5 pounds (NEW)
12.5(pounds NEW)*1.37(TNT Equivalency)=17.125 pounds (NEW TNT Equivalency)
