SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and should be reviewed in its entirety. This
document was originally a supplement to the AFMCI 64-110. The intent of this FAM
Instruction is to standardize the First Article process at Robins Air Force Base (RAFB). In order
to accomplish this, a RAFB Instruction for the First Article Management process was created.
This instruction provides step by step instructions on the First Article Management Process. The

1. POLICY.
     1.1. Authority: AFMCI 64-110 First Article Management
     1.2. Scope. This operating instruction defines some guidelines for requiring a First Article
     Test (FAT). This OI documents the roles, responsibilities, process actions, and establishes a
     standard process flow for the FAT process at RAFB. The Operating Instruction (OI)
     documents the process flow from initiation of an AMC/AMSC Screening Analysis
     Worksheet (SAW) process in PRPS through the disposal of the First Article (FA) exhibit. It
     is intended that this OI provide the means and visibility to effectively manage the First
     Article Process so that the performance specified in Attachment 6 can be achieved or
     exceeded.
2. FAT Purpose. A FAT is used to verify that all engineering, design and specification
requirements are correctly understood, verified, and recorded. The FAT process is expensive
and should not be used to qualify a product (that is, to determine its suitability for a given use or
application), nor as a technique to measure production quality. Rather, a first article inspection
should only be used to assess a producer's ability to manufacture an item in conformance with
the data package.
     2.1. FAT Guidelines. Since the FAT process is expensive the following are some general
     guidelines of when to require a first article test.
ROBINSAFBI64-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 3


       2.1.1. When the contractor has not previously furnished the product (or similar product)
       to the Government
       2.1.2. The item has incurred changes since the contractor previously furnished the part
       2.1.3. The contractor has not manufactured within the previous three years
       2.1.4. Problems developed during the parts life cycle when the contractor last supplied
       the part
       2.1.5. The product is being purchased with a performance specification
       2.1.6. The first article will be used as a manufacturing standard
   2.2. FIRST ARTICLE TEST PROCESS FLOWCHART. Please refer to the Standard
   Work Guide, Attachment 2, for further guidance.

Figure 4. Pre-Solicitation Chart.




       3.1.1. The Pre-Solicitation phase begins when a buy requirement is received through
       PRPS or the DLA 339 system (Block 1A or Block 1B) and ends when a First Article
       (FA) determination has been made and all accompanying documentation has been
       returned to the source (Block 11A or 11B). The accompanying documentation may
       include but not be limited to the following:
       AFMC Form 260 First Article Requirements
       DD 1423 Contract Data Requirements List
       Cost Estimate Worksheet
       Test Plan
       Marked Drawings
       Engineering Data List (EDL)
       AFMC Form 761/Screening Analysis Worksheet (SAW)
       3.1.2. The First Article Test (FAT) plan shall be completed during the pre-solicitation
       pre-award phase. In addition, a test plan repository will be established for test plans.
       Specifically, the FAT Plan will be created, uploaded and saved into the TMACS
       repository. As a note, the contractor is responsible for the FA meeting the requirements
       in the data package and the government has the right to test/ensure the FA is in
       compliance with the data package, without any restrictions imposed.
       3.1.3. Additionally, if there are multiple qualified sources and no business case for
       full/open competition requiring a first article, then the Acquisition Method Code (AMC)
ROBINSAFBI64-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                           7


      may be coded as limited competition with no first article. For efficiency, the engineer
      may review the documentation first to ensure the proper AMC, then forwarded to
      screening for a recommended code. As a caveat, unless there is an exception anything
      other than full and open completion has to be justified.

   3.2. ORGANIC TESTING. This phase begins with the notification of contract award
   (Block 12) and ends with the Test Facility waiting for the FA arrival (Block 17).
      3.2.1. CONTRACTOR TESTING. This phase begins with the receipt of the contractor
      Test Plan (Block 13B) and ends when the FAM sends a letter to the Contracting Officer
      and updates TMACS (Block 15C).

Figure 6. Receipt of FA Exhibit Chart.




     3.3. ORGANIC or ORGANIC/CONTRACTOR TESTING. This phase begins with the
     receipt of the FA exhibit and its accompanying documentation (Block 18) and concludes
     with the disposal of the FA exhibit (Block 31).
        3.3.1. CONTRACTOR TESTING. This phase begins with the receipt of the FA test
        report (Block 25B) and concludes with DLA being billed for engineering evaluation
        hours (Block 30).
4. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
     4.1. FIRST ARTICLE MANAGER (FAM). The FAM is responsible for managing all
     actions, activities, and processes associated with FA requirements as defined in reference
     policies, AF Instructions, and regulatory guidance. In addition to these responsibilities, the
     FAM is the single point of contact for the following FA activities:
        4.1.1. Provide assistance in obtaining the necessary support at the government/contractor
        facility responsible for the first article inspection.
        4.1.2. All activities associated with processing documentation that supports procurement
        actions which require FA validation.
        4.1.3. Processing of First Article package.

Terms
Conditional Approval— First articles with minor deficiencies may be approved under the
condition that the deficiencies are corrected prior to production. Deficiencies must be so minor
in nature that they will not affect the form, fit, or function of the item/system if not corrected.
Conditional approval is discouraged unless it is in the government’s best interest.
First Article— A preproduction model, initial production sample, test sample, first lot, pilot lot,
or pilot model. For purposes of this instruction this definition is limited to sub-assemblies, piece
parts or items below end item indenture. In addition, some commercial acquisitions procured
utilizing the procedures of FAR 12, Commercial Acquisitions will be considered first article
items.
First Article Test (FAT)— A complete, independent, and documented physical and functional
inspection process to verify that prescribed production methods have produced an acceptable
item as specified by engineering drawings, planning, purchase order, engineering specifications,
and/or other applicable design documents.
First Article Testing and Approval—Testing and evaluating the first article for conformance
with a qualified technical data package or specified contract requirements before or in the initial
stage of production.

Block 12: Notice of Contract Award

   1. DLA Procurement
      The DLA FAT POC receives a DLA/WR-ALC FAT monthly report from DSCR, DSCC,
      DSCP which identifies the NSN and contract number awarded the previous month. The
      DLA FAT POC forwards the report to the contracting officer who will determine the
      appropriate ESA/FAM by using any of the following systems:

              D043
              EIS
              Haystack

      After receiving the report, the FAMs will obtain a copy of the contract to determine the
      due in date for the FA exhibit. The RSE will build the FA test plan in the test plan library
      in TMACS. As a note, if the FA test plans were kept in a repository such as TMACS, it
      could greatly reduce process flow days to provide notification to the FAM and RSE of a
      first article’s shipment 30 days in advance so that they could review the test plans in
      advance of the first articles arrival to verify the test plan is still valid/correct. This action
      would eliminate (or minimize) first articles waiting on test plans at the organic test
      facility. Additionally, this action would provide reassurance on the test plan for those first
      articles that take one to two years to deliver by giving the engineer time to review the test
      plan if they were not the original developer of it. For destructive testing requirements,
      the RSE should determine if an item should be unassembled, depainted, etc. This will
      save time and testing cost.

   2. Local Procurement

       At the beginning of each month, the WR-ALC FAT POC runs a report which identifies
       the NSN and contract numbers that have been awarded the previous month. The
       Complex FAT POC forwards the report to the center Focal Point who will forward the
       report to the appropriate ESA/FAM.
