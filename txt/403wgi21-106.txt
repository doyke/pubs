SUMMARY OF CHANGES

OPR changed from 403 AMXS/MXA to 403 MXG/MXQ. Omitted all outdated
GMS/ASIMIS references and added new DTADS Terminology.
1. Procedures:
   1.1. Debriefing will be accomplished in a centralized location in Building 4221 (AMXS
   debrief Rm. 141). Dedicated Data Transfer and Diagnostic System (DTADS) Personal
   Computers are in place, along with aircrew and maintenance debrief checklists, (see
   attachments 2 and 3).
 2                                                          403WGI21-106 3 DECEMBER 2013


     1.2. Aircraft Landing Code ALPHA 2 and ALPHA 3 are required to be formally debriefed
     after every flight. Aircraft landing ALPHA 1 will be formally debriefed at the end of the
     flying period, or if there is a maintenance event on maintenance message page.
     1.3. (Exception) When an aircraft arrives during non-duty hours, debrief functions will be
     accomplished at the beginning of the next duty day. If aircraft lands after hours with an
     impoundment condition, the aircraft will be sealed and secured with no maintenance actions
     taken, and QA will complete impoundment process at beginning of shift.
2. Prior to Landing Responsibilities:
     2.1. Thirty minutes prior to termination of flight or as soon as UHF or VHF contact can be
     established, the flight crew will call the 403d WG Command Post (403d WG/CP) and
     provide an alpha status identifying any system malfunctions. The 403d WG/CP will provide
     the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) with the aircraft ALPHA status for relay to the
     flight line expeditors and/or Production Superintendent. MOC will notify required specialists
     to report to debrief.
3. After Landing Responsibilities:
     3.1. The Aircrew will ensure (face-to-face) debrief with maintenance personnel. If a formal
     debrief is required (SEE para 1.2) and transportation is not available for the aircrew, the
     expeditor will provide transportation to and from the Debrief facility. Aircrew will document
     all discrepancies and exceedances in the 781A forms, and provide a detailed description of
     aircraft discrepancies to the specialists and crew chief. Ensure original 781 is used to debrief
     aircraft times and a copy is provided to the debrief section. Crew members will complete the
     aircrew debrief checklist. All aircraft weights for airdrops will be annotated in the 781A, and
     identified to the debriefer. Aircrew will remain in the debrief section until DTADS Debrief
     Processing is complete in order to validate Nuisance Faults that are revealed on the Debrief
     Report when required. Exception: ERCC flights will leave the aircraft forms on the aircraft
     until the completion of the ERCC training sortie. Upon completion of the first sortie, the
     Aircraft Commander will provide the original 781 to the Debrief Section to record aircraft
     times. The Aircraft Commander for the second half of the ERCC sortie is responsible for
     attending the debrief function.
     3.2. The Crew Chief will check the maintenance message page for any maintenance events
     that would require a formal debrief prior to the Aircraft Commander leaving the aircraft.
     They will ensure 781H is fully documented as well as the 781A if airdrops were
     accomplished during mission or flight. They will also ensure that all aircraft forms, fuel
     cards, RMM cards and associated documentation are delivered to debrief section
     immediately after landing and assist with debrief as required.
     3.3. The Debriefer will manage and oversee the debrief process. Ensure the aircraft is
     landed with the proper status code in G081and enter all valid discrepancies into GO81. Use
     original 781 to input and audit flying hours to ensure accuracy of the data, and retain a copy
     for maintenance records. Ensure all times entered are in ZULU time.
        3.3.1. Debrief section will use the Data Transfer and Diagnostic System (DTADS)
        Personal Computer – Ground Maintenance Program (PC-GMP) to perform aircraft
        debriefings IAW TO 1C-130J-2-45JG-30-1.
403WGI21-106 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  3


      3.3.2. Ensure Aircrew completes debrief checklist.
      3.3.3. Ensure forms are properly documented and completed to include AFTO Form 781,
      781A and 781H. Properly annotate all repeat/recurring discrepancies in red caps in the
      781A forms.
      3.3.4. Ensure an AMC IMT 278 is completed for all debriefs.
      3.3.5. 403d Abort/Incident sheet will be used to document bird strike/abort and incident
      reporting. Ensure the appropriate 403d MXG quick reaction checklist is followed for all
      Dropped Objects, Aborts, In-flight Emergencies and Impoundments.
      3.3.6. Review AFTO Form 781A discrepancies thoroughly with the flight crew using the
      DTADS generated Debrief Report IAW C-130J-00FR-00-1, 1C-130J-00-FR-00-2 and
      1C-130J-00-FR-00-3, to ensure accuracy of all fault codes.
      3.3.7. When GO81 Information System is not operational, the debriefer will hand write
      all discrepancies on AMC IMT 278/AFTO 349 for input when MIS is restored.
      3.3.8. Notify MOC of aircraft status changes.
4. Post-Debrief:
   4.1. Debriefer will remove aircraft fuel receipts after cross country missions and hand carry
   to the financial management office.
5. Deployed debriefing procedures:
   5.1. In the event debrief cannot be accomplished while deployed, the senior deployed
   Maintenance officer/NCO ensures debriefing documents are completed. AMC IMT 278 and
   AFTO Form 781 will be faxed back to home station at ext. 597-8484 after every debrief, or
   as soon as possible.
   5.2. Pulled forms will be filed separately for review upon return to home station.
