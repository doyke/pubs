This instruction establishes the criteria for determining when Civil Engineer Squadron (CES)
will activate and deactivate the heating and air conditioning system in industrial facilities and
living quarters (dormitories and family housing). Secondly, this instruction establishes the
authorized temperature ranges for all base facilities. Adhering to the temperature ranges will
result in conserving electricity and natural gas, thereby reducing the cost of these utilities for the
base. This instruction also identifies those facilities that, due to operational necessity, are
exempted from the normal criteria for having heating or cooling systems and temperature ranges.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a total rewrite of Laughlin Air Force Base Instruction 32-1005 and must be
completely reviewed. It redefines roles and responsibilities at all levels; it states the goals which
the enforcement of “No heat – No Cool” (NHNC) will help obtain; and updates the NHNC
exempted facilities.

1. Background:
     1.1. Per Executive Order 13514, Laughlin AFB must reduce electrical and natural gas
     consumption by 3 percent each year. Heating and cooling account for a major portion of the
     electricity and gas consumed by the base.
     1.2. This instruction addresses two key components of energy conservation. One is to
     maintain thermostats at a prescribed temperature and the other is to temporarily turn off
     chillers and boilers during the “No heat – No Cool” (NHNC) period. NHNC occurs in the
     Spring and Fall when temperatures are mild enough that neither cooling nor heating is
     required. The NHNC program has been used by DoD and the USAF for many years and it is
     integral to saving energy.
2. Responsibilities
     2.1. The 47 FTW/CC is responsible for approving the list of the facilities exempt from this
     instruction.
     2.2. The 47 MSG/CC is responsible for:
        2.2.1. Directing the date to initiate and conclude NHNC.
        2.2.2. Making adjustments, as the mission requires, to NHNC implementation due to
        weather anomalies.
     2.3. The 47 CES/CEAO (Base Energy Manager) is responsible for:
        2.3.1. Monitoring the weather forecasts during the Spring/Fall transition seasons and
        comparing those forecasts to the criteria for initiation and conclusion of the NHNC
        periods.
        2.3.2. Recommending to the 47 MSG/CC when to initiate and conclude the NHNC
        periods.
        2.3.3. Preparing announcements for distribution announcing when the base initiates and
        concludes NHNC.
        2.3.4. Spot checking facilities to verify compliance with this instruction.
        2.3.5. Annually reviewing the list of facilities on the exemption list and presenting
        proposed changes to the Energy Management Steering Group (EMSG) for
        recommendation to the
47 FTW/CC for approval.
        2.3.6. Recommending to the 47 MSG/CC alternative actions during weather anomalies.
     2.4. The Group Senior Facility Manager is responsible for:
        2.4.1. Informing their facility managers (who shall inform the facility occupants) of the
        established temperature ranges for the air conditioning and heating seasons.
        2.4.2. Informing their facility managers at the start and end of the NHNC season to
        activate/deactivate locally controlled heating and cooling systems.
        2.4.3. Maintaining memorandums of authorization for personal space heaters. The exact
        number of space heaters must be approved in writing for specific locations within the
LAUGHLINAFBI32-1005 5 JUNE 2012                                                             3


      facility. The memorandum will include a diagram showing location and number as an
      attachment. The memorandum must be signed by the Squadron/Unit Commander and
      coordinated through the Fire Department, Safety and Base Energy Manager.
      2.4.4. Spot checking their facilities for compliance with this Instruction.
      2.4.5. Submitting a request to the Base Energy Manager for inclusion/removal of a
      facility from the exemption list when necessary.
3. Cooling Season
   3.1. The 47 CES shall recommend activation of air conditioning systems when the
   temperature is forecasted to have highs above 80° Fahrenheit or lows above 68° Fahrenheit
   for three consecutive days. This will end the Spring NHNC period and begin the cooling
   season.
   3.2. During the cooling season, facility managers must check that thermostats are correctly
   set.
      3.2.1. Administrative and shop spaces are to be kept at of 78° Fahrenheit when occupied
      and 84° Fahrenheit when not occupied. “Not occupied” refers to non duty hours nights
      and weekends.
      3.2.2. Warehouse and hangar bays are not to be cooled.
   3.3. The 47 CES shall deactivate air conditioning systems when the extended forecast (five
   days) shows three or more consecutive days with lows below 55° Fahrenheit and no high
   temperature above 80° Fahrenheit. This will begin the Fall NHNC period.
4. Heating Season
   4.1. The 47 CES shall recommend activation of heating systems when the low is forecasted
   below 50° Fahrenheit and the high is forecasted below 68° Fahrenheit for four consecutive
   days. This ends the Fall NHNC period and begins the heating season.
   4.2. During the heating season facility managers must check that thermostats are correctly
   set.
      4.2.1. Administration spaces are to be kept at a maximum of 68° Fahrenheit when
      occupied. When unoccupied, such as after duty hours or weekends, thermostats should
      be set to 50° Fahrenheit.
      4.2.2. Shop spaces are to be kept at a maximum of 65° Fahrenheit when occupied and a
      maximum of 50° Fahrenheit when unoccupied.
      4.2.3. Warehouse and hangar bays with heating capability are to be kept at a maximum
      of 60° Fahrenheit when occupied.
   4.3. The 47 CES shall recommend deactivation of heating systems when the five day
   forecast predicts three or more days with high temperatures above 68° Fahrenheit and low
   temperatures above 45° Fahrenheit . This begins the Spring NHNC period.
5. Exempted Facilities
   5.1. The Base Energy Manager maintains the exemption list. Requests for exemption should
   be submitted in letter format to the Base Energy Manager. The letter should contain the
 4                                                     LAUGHLINAFBI32-1005 5 JUNE 2012


     regulation requiring a temperature and the specific area. An excerpt of the applicable
     regulation should be
attached. The Base Energy Manager will compare the request to the criteria in paragraph 5.2.
He or she will then make a recommendation to the Wing Commander at the next EMSG
meeting. The exemption list is found in Attachment 2.
     5.2. Entire facilities are not normally exempt. Rooms qualify for exemption if they meet one
     of the following criteria:
        5.2.1. Sleeping Quarters
        5.2.2. Enclosed Network/Communications Rooms
        5.2.3. Technical Order or AFI requirement
        5.2.4. Fitness Center
     5.3. Rooms on the exemption list will not be subject to either the cooling or heating
     restrictions of the NHNC period. Commonly, rooms are just exempt for cooling. This is
     because some facilities are just exempt due to equipment cooling requirements.
     5.4. It should be noted that some facilities, although exempt, cannot provide heating and
     cooling simultaneously due to system construction. In this case, if a facility is transitioned
     from heating to cooling, but temperatures are cool in the morning, heat will not be available
     because the mechanical equipment was physically switched to cooling.
     5.5. Dormitory, VQ, UOQ Duplex and Privatized Housing:
        5.5.1. Dormitory, VQ and UOQ Duplex residents have individual room temperature
        controls. Residents are asked to comply with the established temperatures. For heating,
        maintain thermostat at 68° Fahrenheit. For cooling, maintain the thermostat at 78°
        Fahrenheit. Doors and windows should be closed when heating and cooling the
        residence.
        5.5.2. Residents of privatized housing are asked to keep doors and windows closed
        when heating and cooling the residences.
6. Recommending Changes to Cooling/Heating Policy:
     6.1. Cooling/Heating Policy is managed by Emergency Management Steering Group
     (EMSG). The 47 FTW/CC is responsible for approving the list of the facilities exempt from
     this instruction. Recommended changes to Cooling/Heating Policy should be submitted in
     letter format to the Base Energy Manager. Requests for exemption should contain the
     regulation requiring a temperature and the specific area. An excerpt of the applicable
     regulation should be attached. The Base Energy Manager will compare the request to the
     criteria in paragraph 5.2. He or she will then make a recommendation to the Wing
     Commander at the next EMSG meeting held annually.
