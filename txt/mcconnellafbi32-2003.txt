1. Objective. The objective of the installation Fire Prevention Program is to eliminate the
potential causes of fire, prevent loss of life, injuries, and property damage, and to protect the
environment should fire occur. Accomplishing these objectives is vital if the mission is to
continue without delay due to fire. Loss of government property will result in an unnecessary
use of funds and costly delays that could seriously hinder our national defense efforts. To reach
these objectives, it is necessary to reduce unsafe practices and conditions. This is done through
the education of all personnel, command support at all levels, and enforcement of unsafe
practices. Therefore, fire prevention and fire safety will not be compromised for any reason.
2. Authority.
   2.1. Installation Commander. The 22d Air Refueling Wing (ARW) Commander is
   responsible for fire protection at MAFB and exercises primary responsibility through the
   Base Fire Marshal.
   2.2. Base Fire Marshal. The Base Civil Engineer, Commander, 22d Civil Engineer
   Squadron, is the staff officer designated as the Base Fire Marshal, serves as an advisor to the
   22 ARW Commander on fire protection matters and supervises the Fire Emergency Services
   Flight. The Base Fire Marshal is the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) and is authorized to
   direct stoppage of operations or processes considered to be a fire or explosive hazard.
   2.3. Fire Chief. The Fire Chief is the Fire Emergency Services Flight Chief and is
   responsible to the Base Fire Marshal for establishing and managing an effective fire
   protection and prevention program outlined in AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services
   Program. Through the Assistant Fire Chief for Fire Prevention, the Fire Chief develops and
   administers the installation Fire Prevention Program.
   2.4. The Fire Chief or Senior Fire Officer has full authority over all fire suppression and
   rescue operations. The senior fire official may commandeer any available vehicle,
   equipment, materials or personnel for use as necessary for prompt control of a fire.
   2.5. Fire Prevention Office. The Fire Prevention Office performs facility inspections and
   advises unit commanders, facility managers and supervisors of hazards and fire safety
4                                              MCCONNELLAFBI32-2003 11 MARCH 2010

       possible. If the fire hazard or condition poses an imminent danger, prompt action will be
       taken to eliminate or reduce the danger. When the hazard involves an operation or
       process that must be stopped and action is not taken to do so, the Fire Chief, Fire
       Marshal, 22 ARW Safety Office and the functional manager concerned will be notified to
       observe and resolve the hazardous condition. If the problem cannot be resolved, the 22d
       Mission Support Group Commander and appropriate functional group commander will be
       notified. The 22 ARW Commander will be advised of the hazardous operation that
       remains unresolved.
       4.2.3. Risk assessment codes (RAC) and fire safety deficiencies (FSD) will be assigned
       to fire hazards and deficiencies in accordance with AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational
       and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection and Health Program.
       4.2.4. The AF Form 218, Facility Fire Prevention/Protection Record will be used to
       document all fire prevention visits. When significant findings are identified, the
       inspector will initiate an AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report. The fire inspector
       will annotate the form with the fire hazards or deficiencies noted during the assessment
       and the corrective actions required to eliminate them, including references to the
       governing standard and interim control measures. This form also provides a tracking
       mechanism to follow up on corrective actions.
       4.2.5. The AF Form 1487 will be delivered to the facility manager or the alternate. The
       facility managers or alternates are responsible for initiating corrective actions within their
       authority and responsibility, by following the corrective actions annotated on the form.
       The facility will start immediate correction of fire hazards or fire safety deficiencies.
       Any RAC 1, 2, or 3 hazard not corrected within 30 days will be annotated on an AF Form
       3, USAF Hazard Abatement Plan, in accordance with AFI 91-301.
       4.2.6. AF Form 1487 identifying hazards or deficiencies which require submission of an
       AF Form 332, will be submitted to 22 CES Customer Service for corrective action. The
       AF Form 332 should show full justification with references.
       4.2.7. On the back of the AF Form 1487, the facility manager will annotate the corrective
       actions taken and the date they were implemented. This includes AF Form 332 and work
       order control numbers.

       4.2.8. The facility manager will ensure that the unit commander reviews the form and
       signs the appropriate block on the back of the form.
       4.2.9. The facility managers will keep a copy of the completed form for their records and
       return the original to the Fire Prevention Office. The form shall be returned before the
       suspense date listed on the front of the form in block 5.
       4.2.10. If facility managers require additional time to initiate corrective action, they can
       request extensions to the suspense date from the Fire Prevention Office.
       4.2.11. Facility managers are required to track the completion of work required to correct
       deficiencies. Some corrections will take long periods of time.
       4.2.12. For situations presenting an imminent danger, the hazard is first isolated and an
       AF Form 1487 will be issued. The fire inspector will provide a copy to the supervisor in
       charge and a copy will be delivered to the unit commander.
           4.2.12.1. The operation may be terminated and the facility may be closed until an
           assessment by the Fire Chief and/or Fire Marshal or their representative is made
           regarding the safety of the situation.

6. Fire/Emergency Evacuation Procedures.
     6.1. Immediate and accurate reporting of a fire or emergency is essential to minimize fire
     vehicle response time. Any person discovering a fire or potential fire or emergency situation
     must report it immediately to the base fire department. This includes any fire whether it
     burned itself out or was extinguished without the aid of the base fire department.
     6.2. Fire/Emergency Reporting Telephone Numbers. Report all fires or emergencies to the
     base fire department by dialing 911.
     6.3. Fire/Emergency Evacuation Procedures.
        6.3.1. Sound the alarm, both mechanically and verbally. In buildings equipped with fire
        alarm systems, activate the nearest fire alarm pull station. In buildings not equipped with
        fire alarm systems, sound the alarm verbally by yelling “FIRE, FIRE, FIRE.”
        6.3.2. Call the base fire department by dialing 911. When reporting a fire or emergency,
        give your name and telephone number, location or address of the emergency and type of
        fire or emergency. Remain on the telephone as long as it is safe. DO NOT HANG UP
        until released by the base fire department operator. If you are in danger tell the operator
        that you will call again when you are at a safe location and ensure you call the operator
        back.
            6.3.2.1. NOTE: If you dial 911 from a cell phone, your call goes to the Sedgwick
            County Emergency Dispatcher. You will need to need to notify the operator that you
            are located on McConnell AFB.
        6.3.3. Ensure all personnel evacuate the facility by the most direct route and assemble at
        a designated area at least 75 feet from the facility. If time allows, close all doors,
        windows, secure safes and shut off unnecessary equipment. This deters the spread of fire
        and reduces possible injury to other personnel. Ensure that accountability is taken for all
        personnel who were inside the facility. Never reenter an evacuated facility.
        6.3.4. Extinguish the fire, if possible, using fire extinguishers on fires that have just
        started or are small in size. If the fire is uncontrollable, abandon firefighting efforts and
        evacuate the building. Do not become trapped and always maintain a clear egress path to
        safety.
        6.3.5. Designate at least one individual outside of the building to direct the base fire
        department to the location of the fire or emergency.
     6.4. False Fire Reporting. Any person(s) involved in malicious or deliberate transmission of
     false information pertaining to a fire or emergency, including falsely initiating a base fire
MCCONNELLAFBI32-2003 11 MARCH 2010                                                              11
