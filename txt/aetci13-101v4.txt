                                           TRAINING

2.1 Training Concepts and Procedures.
      2.1.1. CSI training programs are diverse due to the wide range of missions the CSIs
      support and the varying degree of experience and currency of each new CSI.
   2.1.2. Prerequisites. Experience as a rated military aviator (pilot) is critical to the successful
   completion of assigned duties. Previous experience as an instructor in fighter aircraft is
   highly desirable.
   2.1.3. The following training programs are built around the baseline CSI, they may be
   expanded when a new CSI is less experienced or has a prolonged lapse in currencies.
   Annotate all events with an “ADD” suffix if inserting additional training events. (T-3) As
   well, each program may be shortened for a highly experienced CSI with recent currency.
   Annotate the training record with “Previously Complied With (PCW)” for ground training
   events or “Proficiency Advanced (PA)” for positional events when a CSI’s performance
   warrants. (T-3) The CSI Flight Commander is the approval authority for any of the above
   training program modifications. (T-3)
2.2. CSI Training Programs.
   2.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). IQT has two components, Full Mission Trainer
   (FMT) upgrade and IOS upgrade, which are detailed in a single HQ AETC-approved
   syllabus. The ACS/CC will approve a tailored training program derived from the IQT
   syllabus for each new CSI based on the new CSI’s experience and proficiency. (T-3) Except
   in unusual circumstances, candidates undergoing IQT will receive academic and FMT
   instruction with a minimum of interruption, and complete training within the time specified
   by the syllabus. (T-3)
      2.2.1.1. On completion of the FMT portion of IQT, the CSI will be qualified as an F-15
      simulator pilot (wingman). On completion of the IOS qualification, the CSI will be
      qualified as a CSI and can execute and provide instruction on all ABM/F-15 FMT
      missions.
      2.2.1.2. Prerequisites. Personnel selected to become CSIs will be highly experienced,
      previously qualified instructor pilots in a military fighter aircraft (F-15, F-16, F-22, F-35,
      F-18). (T-3)
      2.2.1.3. Academic Training. Academic training will be IAW the HQ AETC approved
      IQT syllabus, and will be tailored to the individual's background and experience. (T-2)
      2.2.1.4. CSI candidates in IQT will train under the supervision of an ICSI until
      completing the qualification evaluation. (T-2)The CSI course syllabus mission objectives
      and tasks are minimum requirements for qualification.
   2.2.2. Buddy Simulator Instructor Program (BSI). After completion of the IOS checkout, the
   new CSI will be assigned to a highly qualified ICSI (per the CSI Flight Commander) who
   will monitor the new instructor's performance and provide guidance in all areas of job
   requirements. (T-3)
8                                                                AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


       2.2.2.1. The SQ/CC will review completed BSI program documentation and certify
       instructors on an AF Form 4348. (T-3)
       2.2.2.2. The SQ/CC may waive the BSI program for any CSI who has previously
       completed a Buddy Instructor Pilot/BSI program in the same MDS aircraft or simulator.
    2.2.3. Flight Lead Upgrade Training (FLUG). On completion of FLUG, the CSI can be
    qualified as a 2-ship and/or a 4-ship flight lead. The Squadron Commander will approve a
    tailored training program derived from the unit FLUG program for each new CSI based on
    their experience and proficiency. (T-3)
    2.2.4. Academic Instruction (AI). Academic training is specifically defined in each formal
    syllabus and must be presented by a qualified AI. (T-2) The CSI Flight Commander will
    approve CSI entry into AI upgrade training. (T-3)
       2.2.4.1. Prerequisites. The CSI must have completed the FMT track of the IQT syllabus.
       (T-3)
       2.2.4.2. Academic Training. All CSIs instructors selected to become AIs must be
       qualified IAW AETCI 36-2604 before conducting any academic training. (T-2) BMIT
       Track1 satisfies CSI AI qualification requirements.
    2.2.5. F-22 Replication. On completion of this training, the CSI will be certified as a
    wingman and/or 2-ship flight lead on UABM syllabus F-22 missions and also to run these
    missions from the IOS. (T-3) The Squadron Commander will approve a tailored training
    program derived from the unit F-22 upgrade program for each new CSI based the CSI’s
    experience and proficiency. (T-3)
       2.2.5.1. There are three phases of training: F-22 wingman upgrade, F-22 flight lead
       upgrade, and F-22 IOS operator.
       2.2.5.2. Prerequisites. The CSI Flight Commander will ensure appropriate clearances are
       received prior to any F-22 replication training. (T-3) F-22 upgrade missions (wingman,
       IOS and FLUG) may occur simultaneously with F-15 upgrades if the CSI has the
       necessary clearances.
       2.2.5.3. FMT Training. CSIs in F-22 training will train under the supervision of an ICSI.
       (T-3) The unit prescribed F-22 replication missions are the minimum requirements for
       qualification.
    2.2.6. Instructor CSI (ICSI). CSIs who demonstrate superior expertise can be selected to be
    an ICSI. An ICSI can conduct qualification training for new CSIs in the FMT and on the IOS
    and conduct F-22 replication and FI academic briefs. ICSIs will also lead the mission and/or
    run the IOS for UABM X-rides, Progress Checks and Elimination Checks.
       2.2.6.1. All ICSI upgrade training will be accomplished by the CSI flight commander or
       assistant. (T-3)
    2.2.7. CSI Evaluator (CSIE). CSIEs are required to conduct CSI initial and recurring
    evaluation requirements and to ensure quality and standardization of the CSI cadre. (T-2) On
    completion of this training, the CSI will be able to conduct academic and positional
    certifications and evaluations in the classroom, the FMT and on the IOS. All training for this
    position will be IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202/AETC Supplement. (T-2)
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                           9


       2.2.7.1. CSIEs will be selected from the most highly-qualified ICSIs, typically the Flight
       Commander and the Assistant Flight Commander. (T-3)
       2.2.7.2. CSIE training will be conducted by the flight commander or qualified CSIE.

2.3. Training Records and Reports. ACS will:
   2.3.1. Maintain a training folder for each assigned CSI. The training folder will include
   records of individual training to include, but not limited to, IQT, BSI, FLUG, AI, F-22, ICSI
   and CSIE certification, IAW the RDS. (T-2)
   2.3.2. The AF Form 4348 provides a permanent record and certification source for CSI
   certifications not attained through an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   Following certifying official signature on the AF Form 4348, records of training leading up
   to the certification may be removed from the training folder. (AF Form 4348 is prescribed in
   AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. Refer to that
   publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
       2.3.2.1. For each certification achieved and listed on the LoX, ACS will maintain
       documentation on an AF Form 4348 in the individual’s training folder or on an AF Form
       8 in the member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). (T-2) Use one line for each positional
       certification. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF
       Form 4348 in the Remarks block.
       2.3.2.2. Academic certifications may be entered one line per academic block when the
       CSI is qualified in multiple lessons in that block. Additionally, the annual recertification
       must be logged on the AF Form 4348.
10                                                              AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


     2.3.2.3. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for Cause (with
     prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice). Supervisors should
     consult with the servicing Civilian Personnel Office on processing any appropriate
     administrative actions as a result of decertification.
         2.3.2.3.1. Decertification for Cause. This action is normally associated with
         Commander-Directed Downgrade of a CSI, but also applies to commander-directed
         decertification of examiners (resulting from substandard performance). This category
         of Decertification warrants a review of all the CSI’s qualifications and certifications
         with consideration to suspending some or all of them. To document Decertification
         for Cause, place an “X” in the appropriate box; enter date of decertification under
         Decertification Date block; enter name, rank, organization and office symbol and
         signature of the decertifying official under Decertifying Official/Organization block.
         2.3.2.3.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
         performance. Such decertification is warranted when loss of certification occurs that
         will not be regained, when instructor-certified events become core mission events, or
         when a higher certification is obtained making the previous entry obsolete.
         Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for decertification of CSIEs as a result
         of reasons other than substandard performance. This category of Decertification does
         not require any review of the CSI’s remaining qualifications / certifications. To
         document Discretionary Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate box; enter
         date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block.
     2.3.2.4. The CSI Flight Commander will inspect training folders of CSIs who have
     completed IQT and forward the folders through the squadron DO to the squadron
     commander. (T-3) Maintain all completed training records in each CSI’s training folder
     until the AF Form 4348 is signed by the SQ/CC and disposed of IAW the RDS. (T-2)
     2.3.2.5. During the initial review of individual training folder for new CSIs (if one
     exists), review previous AF Form 4348 (or other certification documentation) entries to
     determine all applicable certifications of the newly assigned CSI. Document applicable
     certifications accepted by the ACS commander on a new AF Form 4348. (T-2) The CSI
     Flight Commander or other individual designated by the SQ/CC will sign a one line entry
     below all other entries verifying that: “The above certification transcriptions are
     accurate.” (T-3)
     2.3.2.6. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
     e-Publishing web site.
     2.3.2.7. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program in the unit supplement. (T-2)
     Include a list of certifications applicable to the unit and designated certifying officials.
     (T-2)
  2.3.3. Use AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record, to document any unusual occurrence that
  could affect training progress. ICSIs should annotate areas of difficulty on the form. (T-3)
  2.3.4. ACS may specify additional training folder requirements.
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                         11


   2.3.5. Document training in either GTIMS or through unit specified procedures as applicable
   and determined by the flight commander. Track the following information for all CSIs as
   applicable:
       2.3.5.1. Ground training dates accomplished and expiration dates. (T-3)
       2.3.5.2. FMT and IOS sorties by month, and cumulative totals. (T-3)
       2.3.5.3. Academic Instructor currency by date last accomplished and expiration date. (T-
       3)
       2.3.5.4. Recurring academic instructor recertification and testing. (T-3)
       2.3.5.5. Periodic evaluations by date last accomplished and expiration date. (T-3)
       2.3.5.6. Training events accomplished and amount remaining for the semiannual training
       cycle. (T-3)
       2.3.5.7. FMT and IOS currency by date last accomplished and expiration date. (T-3)
2.4. Loss of CSI Qualification. Failure of an evaluation, a commander-directed downgrade, or
failure to perform CSI duties for more than 225 days will result in a loss of CSI qualification. To
regain qualification, CSIs must, at a minimum, successfully complete an evaluation according to
Chapter 3 of this instruction. (T-2)
2.5. Loss of AI Qualification. CSIs will be decertified as AIs if they fail any academic
evaluation. (T-2) To regain AI qualification, they must successfully re-accomplish the failed
evaluation IAW AETCI 36-2604. (T-2)
2.6. CSI Requalification. The following provides criteria for requalifying CSIs who have not
performed CSI duties for:
   2.6.1. A period of 226 days to 2 years. The OG commander determines whether a CSI may
   complete a locally-generated training program in lieu of completing a formal qualification
   syllabus. Locally-generated programs will be developed considering the CSI’s previous
   experience and currency. Send a copy of the proposed training to AETC/A3V for approval.
   ICSIs will conduct the training. An RQ MSN evaluation will be completed for CSIs
   according to Chapter 3 of this instruction.
   2.6.2. A period of more than 2 years. The CSI must complete the applicable qualification
   syllabus. (T-2)
2.7. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified CSIs to maintain and
increase their proficiency. It provides minimum academic and simulator training requirements.
This training is also necessary to develop the CSI force and certify instructors in specific unit or
local area requirements. Judicious scheduling of CT is required to develop instructors and ensure
training standardization. As part of the CT program, missions are flown to develop and enhance
individual proficiency. These sorties allow less experienced CSIs to learn and refine techniques
from more experienced CSIs.
   2.7.1. CT requirements can be met on any ACS syllabus or CT mission, any CSI upgrade
   mission, any CAF unit or FI mission.
   2.7.2. CT sorties will be flown in the FMT on any representative mission profile. (T-3) The
   CSI running the IOS will log a support sortie (not CT). (T-3)
 12                                                             AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


2.8. Training Cycle. There are two semiannual CT training cycles, 1 January to 30 June and 1
July to 31 December of each calendar year. Semiannual requirements are reviewed at the end of
each semiannual period.
2.9. CT Administration.
   2.9.1. Quarterly CSI CT Meetings:
       2.9.1.1. CSIs will attend and actively participate in CSI CT meetings. (T-2) The purpose
       of these meetings is to discuss standardization, safety, mission-related topics,
       instructional techniques, grading practices, and to increase general knowledge.
       2.9.1.2. Attendance at CSI CT meetings is mandatory. (T-3) The unit will determine a
       method to track attendance. (T-3) Individuals not available for CSI CT meetings will
       read the meeting minutes or be briefed by the CSI Flt/CC. (T-3)
       2.9.1.3. To encourage training cross flow, CSIs are also encouraged to attend ABM CT
       meetings held by the ACS.
   2.9.2. Requirements. This instruction establishes minimum CSI CT requirements. ACS may
   direct additional training, to include cockpit performance, in a supplement to this instruction
   as necessary for individual weapon system requirements.
   2.9.3. Prorating End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the squadron
   commander may prorate training requirements for instructors who were not available for
   duty. Use the prorating allowance in Table 2.2 to determine the number of months to be
   prorated based on each period of consecutive calendar days of non-duty.

Table 2.2. Prorating Allowance.




ITEM      Consecutive Days of Non-Duty         Months of Proration
1         0 - 15                               0
2         16 - 45                              1

7         166 - 180                            6
   2.9.4. Failure to Complete CT Requirements:
       2.9.4.1. CSIs who fail to accomplish CT training requirements will not instruct in the
       new training cycle until a review is completed to determine the cause of the deficiency
       and whether additional training is required. (T-2)
       2.9.4.2. The OG/CC is the review and waiver authority and will consider the type and
       magnitude of the deficiency and the individual’s experience level to determine if
       additional training, increased supervision, or a waiver to the previous training cycle
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                        13

   requirements in Table 2.4. (T-3) Document waivers and the justification for the waiver in
   the individual’s training folder. (T-3)
   2.10.2. Instructional Category Currency. All CSIs must accomplish an instructional sortie
   every 60 days. (T-3) Non- current instructors must regain currency before instructing in any
   category. (T-2) To regain currency, the non-current CSI will instruct from the IOS while
   being monitored by a current and qualified CSI or complete a CT sortie with a current and
   qualified CSI. (T-2)

                                      EVALUATIONS

3.1. Types of Evaluations. The CSI Stan/Eval program utilizes several types of evaluations to
ensure qualification of instructors and validate unit programs.
   3.1.1. Mission (MSN) evaluations. MSN evaluations are used to qualify the CSI in FMT
   cockpit operations. MSN evals are administered periodically and are documented on an AF
   Form 8. (T-2)
   3.1.2. IOS evaluations. IOS evaluations are used to qualify the CSI on the IOS console. IOS
   evals are administered periodically and will be documented on an AF Form 8. (T-2)
   3.1.3. Console CSIE evaluations. CSIE evaluations are used to qualify a limited number of
   CSIs as Examiners. Examiners will conduct CSI MSN and IOS evaluations. The CSIE
   evaluation will be a one-time event documented on an AF Form 8. (T-2)
   3.1.4. SPOT evaluations. A SPOT evaluation is not intended to satisfy the requirements of a
   periodic MSN or IOS evaluation and has no specific requisites or requirements, unless
   specified in the unit supplement. They may be administered as No Notice. An examinee may
   utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a MSN or IOS evaluation expiration date provided all
   requirements for the evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph
   3.3.2.
   3.1.5. Supplementary evaluations. A Supplementary evaluation is an administrative tool
   used by a commander to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate
   implemented solutions to operational problems. Although similar to a SPOT evaluation that
   is used to check a specific problem area, supplementary evals are not aircrew qualification
   evaluations, but instead primarily evaluate items such as programs, flight evaluation folders,
   academic testing, etc.
       3.1.5.1. The commander directing the evaluation will determine evaluated areas. (T-3)
       The appropriate Stan/Eval function (e.g., OGV or squadron Stan/Eval) will determine the
       method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection,
       and will report results as directed by the commander. (T-3)
       3.1.5.2. Individuals other than CSIEs as determined by the commander may conduct
       supplementary evaluations
       3.1.5.3. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a
       qualification/mission evaluation. Supplementary evaluations should not result in the
       assignment of an overall grade for any specific CSI, nor should it be documented on an
       AF Form 8.
       3.1.5.4. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes. (T-3)
3.2. CSI Examiners (CSIE).
   3.2.1. CSIE Selection. The SQ/CC will select and designate in writing, all CSIEs from the
   most highly qualified and experienced instructors. (T-3) Selection and designation will be
   annotated on the unit certification documents (LoX, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 4324,
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                      15


   Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet), updated in GTIMS and reported in
   the Stan/Eval Board (SEB) minutes. (T-3)
   3.2.2. CSIE Upgrade (T-3):
      3.2.2.1. Self-study this AETCI and AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 2, F-15 Aircrew Evaluation
      Criteria.
      3.2.2.2. See one MSN evaluation and one IOS evaluation.
      3.2.2.3. Do one MSN evaluation and one IOS evaluation monitored by a qualified CSIE.
      3.2.2.4. The last monitored evaluation will be accomplished by the CSI Flight
      Commander and will generate an AF Forms 8, 4324, and 4348.
   3.2.3. CSIE Functions (T-3):
      3.2.3.1. Conduct simulator evaluations as required.
      3.2.3.2. Maintain CSI qualification.
      3.2.3.3. Administer F-15C flight simulator and IOS evaluations on missions in which
      they maintain qualification.
      3.2.3.4. Prior to the mission, brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
      how it will be conducted.
      3.2.3.5. Conduct a thorough post-mission debriefing for the examinee on all aspects of
      the evaluation. Debriefs will include the examinee’s overall grade, specific deviations,
      area grades assigned (if other than qualified [Q]), and any required additional training.
      Flight commander must be debriefed on all evaluations. Additionally, the flight
      commander must attend all debriefs where the overall grade is Q3.
      3.2.3.6. Immediately correct inappropriate representations with respect to safety or flight
      discipline during an evaluation. If this situation occurs, the CSIE will debrief the flight
      commander and document the deviation on an AF Form 8.
      3.2.3.7. CSIEs will not evaluate CSIs for whom they were the primary instructor during
      training or upgrade. SQ/CC may waive this restriction on a case-by-case basis. Active
      waivers will be documented in the SEB minutes.
      3.2.3.8. Attend the SEB and/or read the minutes.
3.3. Conducting CSI Evaluations. All CSI evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions
of this instruction and should be accomplished on actual ABM student instructional missions
whenever possible. (T-2)
   3.3.1. Evaluation criteria. Evaluation criteria from AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 2 and Table 3.2 of
   this instruction will be used to grade all performance. (T-2)
   3.3.2. Expiration Date. Required mission and IOS evaluations expire on the last day of the
   17th month following the month in which the last simulator evaluation was successfully
   completed (e.g., a periodic evaluation which was completed on 9 Oct 14 expires on 31 Mar
   16).
   3.3.3. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations should be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the 6-month period prior to the expiration date.
 16                                                              AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


   3.3.4. Requisites. The examinee will accomplish all required planning IAW the training
   mission during a student training mission while the CSIE observes. (T-3) The simulator
   phase for CSI evaluations includes a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of
   CSI performance. (T-3) The profile used to fulfill the simulator phase requisite must
   incorporate all appropriate requirements set in Table 3.1 and allow accurate measure of the
   proficiency of the examinee. (T-3)Evaluation profiles will reflect unit tasking, daily training
   missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission. (T-3)
   3.3.5. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When evaluation of a required area is not possible
   during the training mission, the area may be evaluated verbally. CSIEs will make every effort
   to evaluate all required areas during the training mission before resorting to this option.
   CSIEs will document the alternate means of evaluation in the examiner’s remarks section of
   the AF Form 8. (T-2)
3.4. Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further
describe evaluations. (T-3)
   3.4.1. Initial (INIT) evaluation. The first evaluation of any type for an instructor
   qualification in a weapon system (INIT MSN or INIT IOS).
   3.4.2. Periodic MSN and periodic IOS evaluations. The recurring evaluation of any type for
   an instructor qualification in a weapon system.
   3.4.3. Requalification (RQ) evaluation. An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
   qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, a flight recheck following a
   failed periodic evaluation or loss of qualification due to a commander- directed downgrade.
      3.4.3.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic evaluation, the
      evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic evaluation. The AF Form 8
      Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix.
      3.4.3.2. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a periodic evaluation, the recheck
      evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 3.5.2 The AF Form 8 Mission/Check
      description will be documented with an RQ prefix.
      3.4.3.3. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
      paragraph 3.5.10), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The AF
      Form 8 Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT,
      as applicable.
      3.4.3.4. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
      qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
   3.4.4. No-Notice (N/N) evaluation. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is
   notified of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission.
   “Normal” mission preparation begins with the posting of the following day’s schedule. The
   intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the mission.
      3.4.4.1. The no-notice evaluation provides commanders a sampling of daily CSI
      performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness. ACS will conduct no-
      notice evaluations as desired. Specific program goals are at the discretion of the OG/CC
      and SQ/CC.

      3.4.4.2. An examinee may utilize an N/N evaluation to update an MSN or IOS
      evaluation expiration date provided the N/N evaluation meets all of the requirements for
      the periodic MSN or IOS evaluation. If all requirements were not completed on the first
      sortie, the SQ/CC may authorize subsequent sorties to complete required events. For out-
      of-the-eligibility-period No- Notice evaluations, if the examinee elects not to update a
      periodic evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented as an N/N SPOT
      evaluation.
   3.4.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation. The
   applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations and the purpose for any
   prefixes will be explained under Mission Description in the Examiner’s Remarks.

3.5. Grading System. A two level grading system is used to evaluate and document CSI
performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while areas/subareas
of CSI performance are individually graded against evaluation grading criteria established in
Tables 3.2 and AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 2. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On
the second level, an overall qualification level is determined from the compilation of these
individual scores/grades.
   3.5.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Qualified [Q] /U
   [Unqualified]) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system. (T-2)
       3.5.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory
       knowledge of all required information, performed CSI duties within the prescribed
       tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
       3.5.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
       tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the CSIE.
       Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or
       jeopardize safety.
       3.5.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters, compromised
       safety, and/or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances adversely affected
       mission accomplishment. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade of U requires
       debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the CSIE.
   3.5.2. Critical Area(s). Grade all critical areas identified in Table 3.1 as either Q or U. If the
   examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas identified in this
   instruction, an overall grade of Q3 will be assigned. (T-2)
   3.5.3. Performance Areas/Sub-areas.
       3.5.3.1. The CSIE must grade the areas/sub-areas listed as “required” in Table 3.1. (T-2)
22                                                           AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


     3.5.3.2. The CSIE will grade any area/sub-area observed during an evaluation if
     performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or overall
     safety. (T-2)
     3.5.3.3. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are acceptable,
     provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
     jeopardize safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall
     area/subarea grade.
     3.5.3.4. The CSIE may further identify an area/sub-area as “Commendable” if, in the
     examiner’s determination, the CSI has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
     that particular area/sub-area. Document commendable areas in the examiner’s remarks
     section of the AF Form 8. (T-3)
  3.5.4. Overall CSI Mission Evaluation Qualification Levels. Overall CSI evaluation and
  Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE) performance are graded as a compilation of all
  area/sub-area grades based on the following guidance:
     3.5.4.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1). The examinee demonstrated desired performance
     and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the
     grading criteria. This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, and may be
     awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
        3.5.4.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
        area(s)/subarea(s).
        3.5.4.1.2. In the judgment of the CSIE, none of the discrepancies preclude awarding
        of an overall Q1.
        3.5.4.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
        debriefing of that evaluation.
     3.5.4.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2). The examinee demonstrated the ability to perform
     duties safely, but:
        3.5.4.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
        assigned.
        3.5.4.2.2. In the judgment of the CSIE, there is justification based on Q- performance
        in one or several areas/subareas regardless of whether or not additional training was
        assigned.
        3.5.4.2.3. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded. (The CSIE may
        award a Q3, but the maximum grade will be Q2).
     3.5.4.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3). The examinee demonstrated an unacceptable level of
     safety, performance or knowledge.
        3.5.4.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires a Q3 for the
        applicable evaluation or EPE.
        3.5.4.3.2. A Q3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the CSIE, there is justification
        based on Q- or U performance in one or more areas/subareas.
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                       23


     3.5.4.4. Overall Qualification Levels. The overall qualification level awarded on an
     evaluation is based on performance during both the simulator and ground phases. An
     overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have
     been completed and given due consideration. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at
     any time.
         3.5.4.4.1. To receive a qualified grade (Q1 or Q2) on an evaluation, the examinee
         must demonstrate the ability to operate the IOS or FMT safely and effectively during
         all phases of an evaluation. However, CSIE judgment will always be the determining
         factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
     3.5.4.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ designation may be awarded
     by the CSIE for a MSN or IOS evaluation. The designation may be awarded when:
         3.5.4.5.1. The examinee has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all
         phases of the evaluation and;
         3.5.4.5.2. The examinee received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated during the
         evaluation and EPE.
  3.5.5. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 3.5.2. when discrepancies result in failure to
  pass a flight evaluation.
     3.5.5.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the CSIE provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy
     and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to
     remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated with
     “Debriefed” in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8
     Comments.
     3.5.5.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by CSIE to remedy deficiencies
     identified during an evaluation. Assignment of additional training by a CSIE should
     result in no higher than a Q2 on the applicable evaluation. The overall grade is still at the
     discretion of the CSIE IAW paragraph 3. 5.4.
         3.5.5.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, or use of a
         simulator. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         3.5.5.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8 Comments
         section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
         knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to an ICSI. (T-3)
         3.5.5.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8 (see paragraph 3.6.1). (T-3)
         3.5.5.2.4. The ICSI who completed the additional training (or final event if more than
         one) will sign as the Certifying Official on the AF Form 8 under Additional Training,
         Section II. (T-3) This serves to verify completion of all assigned training as
24                                                              AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


         documented in paragraph C, Recommended Additional Training, under Examiner’s
         Remarks.
         3.5.5.2.5. Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following
         the date of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 14, additional training
         must be accomplished by 30 Apr 14). (T-3) If a CSI exceeds the allotted time for
         completion of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation
         and direct appropriate action. (T-3) Document the circumstances with a Memo for
         Record (MFR) to be filed with the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph 3.6.1.9.3.5.4. (T-3)
  3.5.6. Failure to Pass an Evaluation.
     3.5.6.1. CSIs receiving a Q3 IOS or MSN evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR) and
     will not conduct student training. (T-2) Failure of an evaluation results in loss of AI
     status until remedial training and reevaluation are successfully completed. However,
     failure of an academic evaluation does not automatically affect CSI IOS or MSN
     qualification or impact the ability to conduct student FMT missions.
     3.5.6.2. If an examinee fails an evaluation, a successful recheck must be completed by
     the end of the third month after the date of the first failure, (e.g., for an evaluation on 20
     Jun 14, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 15). (T-3) The CSIE that administered the
     original check will not administer the recheck. (T-3) A recheck is successfully completed
     when the examinee performs to Q criteria (Q or Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U.
     3.5.6.3. SQ/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in this paragraph on a case-by-
     case basis. Every reasonable effort must be made to requalify the examinee. Commanders
     will determine the training required based on the individual’s experience level. (T-3)
     Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph
     3.5.5.2. (T-3)
  3.5.7. Restrictions. When deemed necessary in the judgment of the CSIE, restrictions will be
  imposed on the examinee until successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a
  recheck.
     3.5.7.1. Restrictions should address the specific operation that requires supervision and
     the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
     3.5.7.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item of the AF Form 8 Comments. (T-3) Restrictions associated
     with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8. (T-3)
  3.5.8. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the CSI be
  placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor)
  will be determined by the squadron commander. (T-3) Supervision will be accomplished by
  instructors or designated supervisors qualified in the specific weapon system. (T-3)
  3.5.9. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an examinee fails to
  complete an evaluation within the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation
  or within a six-month period beginning with the month in which the evaluation was
  administered for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the CSI loses the qualification
  covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 3.5.6 apply. Qualification may be
  re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see paragraph 3.4.3) or by
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                         25


   completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs may approve waivers to preclude the re-
   accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the evaluation on a case-by-case basis.
   Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph
   3.6.1.9.3.5.4. (T-2)
   3.5.10. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) in the CSI’s
   chain-of-command may direct a downgrade to unqualified status without administering an
   evaluation under the following guidance:
       3.5.10.1. For instruction-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying
       discipline or safety) - including incidents not observed by an examiner.
       3.5.10.2. For non-instruction-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
       administrative or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the
       commander’s confidence in the CSI’s ability to safely operate the IOS and/or FMT (e.g.,
       lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the CSI’s decision-making
       abilities).
       3.5.10.3. The CSI will cease acting in the qualification(s) in which they have been
       downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
3.6. Documentation. Administration of the CSI qualification evaluation program requires
accurate documentation. The qualifications for which a CSI is to be evaluated are determined
from the unit certification document. The results of all CSI evaluations are recorded on the AF
Form 8. (T-3) The chronological history of evaluations for a CSI is recorded on an AF Form
942, Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the CSI. (T-3) (Use of
electronic forms is authorized, to include use of electronic signatures and wholly electronic
FEFs.)
   3.6.1. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. Use the AF Form 8 to record CSI
   qualification. The AF Form 8 is signed by four individuals in the following order: the CSIE
   who completes the evaluation, the Reviewing Officer, the Final Reviewing Officer and the
   examinee. Exception: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8, only the
   commander directing the downgrade signs as the Final Approving Officer.
       3.6.1.1. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8
       (T-3):
          3.6.1.1.1. If an electronic form is used, the format required by the form will be used.
          3.6.1.1.2. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
          two-digit year format.
          3.6.1.1.3. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a
          three-letter month and two-digit year format.
          3.6.1.1.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
          otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.
          3.6.1.1.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and
          justification (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. Unit supplements may
          direct specific format standards for such data entry.
26                                                             AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


     3.6.1.2. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites or
     the additional training. Use this date on the AF Form 942.
     3.6.1.3. Examinee Identification. Name, Civ or Grade and last four of SSAN.
     3.6.1.4. Organization and Location. In order to maintain a consistent record of instructor
     history regardless of the CSI’s actual office symbol, enter the unit designation
     (ACS/DON) and location where the examinee is assigned/attached for training (Tyndall
     AFB).
     3.6.1.5. Aircraft/Crew Position. Enter the weapon system (SMF-15C) in which the
     evaluation was given and SP/SI/SE as the crew position. Only when a CSIE is receiving a
     SPOT CSIE Objectivity evaluation should you enter SE as the crew position.
     3.6.1.6. Eligibility Period. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from
     the last similar periodic evaluation (e.g., if the last IOS evaluation expires Sep10, enter
     Apr-Sep 10). Enter N/A (not applicable) for INIT, SPOT, CSIE and RQ evaluations.
     3.6.1.7. Qualification.
        3.6.1.7.1. Ground Phase: N/A for all CSI evaluations.
        3.6.1.7.2. Flight Phase.
            3.6.1.7.2.1. Mission/Check. Use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): IOS, MSN, and SPOT. Use the following prefixes,
            when applicable, to describe the type of evaluation: INIT, RQ, and N/N. More
            than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation. Make a single line entry to
            document the event(s) used to complete the evaluation.
            3.6.1.7.2.2. Date. Enter the date the event was completed.
        3.6.1.7.3. Qualification Level. Place a “1” or “2” in the qualified block or a “3” in the
        unqualified block for the examinee’s overall qualification level. Combined
        evaluations require only one qualification level number if all parts of the evaluation
        were awarded the same qualification level grade. If the qualification levels assigned
        parts of a combined evaluation vary, indicate the qualification level for each part
        separately. In the event of a ground recheck for a simulator phase Q3 evaluation,
        annotate the overall qualification grade on the AF Form 8 (and AF Form 942) as
        “3/1” in the qualified block.
        3.6.1.7.4. Expiration Date of Qualification. For evaluations that establish a new
        eligibility period, enter the month (Mmm) and year (YY) that is 17 months after the
        month in which the flight phase of the evaluation was successfully completed. For
        evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        3.6.1.7.5. Additional Training.
            3.6.1.7.5.1. Due Date(s). If required, enter a date not to exceed the last day of the
            third month following the event requiring additional training (e.g., 26 Jan 10
            Evaluation, 30 Apr 10 due date); otherwise, enter “N/A.”.
            3.6.1.7.5.2. Date Additional Training Completed. Enter the date(s) the examinee
            completed additional training, otherwise, enter “N/A.”
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                     27


            3.6.1.7.5.3. Certifying Official. The ICSI completing the additional training (or
            last training event if more than one) will sign and date as the certifying official.
        3.6.1.7.6. Restrictions/Exceptionally Qualified/Commander-Directed Downgrade.
        Place an “X” in the appropriate block when comments are annotated in Section IV.
        Do not annotate for restrictions resulting from failed requisite examinations.
     3.6.1.8. Signatures.
        3.6.1.8.1. Flight Examiner. The CSIE signing Section III of the AF Form 8 is
        responsible for the content of the AF Form 8. He/she will normally be the first dated
        signature. If however, more than one CSIE was involved in administering the
        evaluation, CSIEs other than the one signing Section III will enter remarks in the
        Mission Description block of the AF Form 8 describing those parts of the evaluation
        they evaluated and sign a signature block immediately adjacent to their remarks.
        3.6.1.8.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers. The Reviewing Officer should
        be the CSI Flight/CC and Final Approving Officer should be the SQ/CC who signs
        the civilian appraisal. Both will review the content of the AF Form 8, the CSIE’s
        overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is adequate to correct the
        noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an “X” in the “Concur” block
        indicating concurrence with the AF Form 8. If either or both officers do not agree
        with the overall rating, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting
        officer will place an “X” in the “Do Not Concur” block on his/her line on the AF
        Form 8 and provide reason for non-concurrence in Section IV, D, Additional
        Comments, Reviewing/Approving Officer’s Remarks (as applicable) block. The
        Reviewing Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8 after the CSIE but prior to the
        Final Approval Officer. The same individual will not sign as both the Reviewing and
        Final Approving Officer. As applicable, the Final Approving Officer may recommend
        or give a commander-directed downgrade, IAW paragraph 3.4.11, if further action is
        warranted. When the flight examiner is the CSI Flight Commander, the SQ/DO will
        sign as the Reviewing Officer and the SQ/CC will sign as the Final Approving
        Officer.
        3.6.1.8.3. Organization Block Format. Annotate unit or organization and office
        symbol of the CSIE that administered the evaluation and the unit or organization and
        office symbol of the reviewing and final approving officer.
        3.6.1.8.4. Examinee. The examinee will sign and date after the Final Approving
        Officer’s signature in Section III of the AF Form 8 certifying that the examinee has
        been briefed and understands the action being taken. Annotate unit or organization
        and office symbol (ACS/DON) in the Typed Name and Grade block. The examinee
        will be the last dated signature on the AF Form 8.
     3.6.1.9. Comments. Use the following headings and format in the space provided on the
     reverse side of the form, formatted head-to-foot:
        3.6.1.9.1. Restrictions (If required). Document each restriction by annotating the
        specific restriction, level of supervision required, and criteria for removal of the
        restriction.
28                                                         AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


     3.6.1.9.2. Exceptionally Qualified Designation (Optional). Enter designation in all
     capital letters. Document justification before Examiner’s Remarks, Section IV
     Comments.
     3.6.1.9.3. Examiner Remarks.
        3.6.1.9.3.1. General. For evaluations requiring two or more sorties, the mission
        description and each required subsequent paragraph/subparagraph will be
        annotated with First Sortie, Second Sortie, etc., as applicable. First Sortie, Second
        Sortie, etc. entries on subsequent paragraphs/subparagraphs will be annotated
        only if there are discrepancies or recommended additional training - otherwise
        annotate with “None” or omit as required. CSIEs other than the one signing
        Section III will sign a signature block containing name, rank, unit and office
        symbol immediately adjacent their remarks under their Mission Description
        portion of the Examiner’s Remarks.
        3.6.1.9.3.2. Mission Description. Mission descriptions will be of sufficient detail
        to verify that the required areas for the evaluation were accomplished.
        3.6.1.9.3.3. Discrepancies. Document discrepancies by annotating the grading
        area number, grading area title (followed by any subarea title in parenthesis),
        grade awarded annotation if discrepancy was debriefed and synopsis of
        discrepancy.
        3.6.1.9.3.4. Recommended Additional Training. If discrepancies are documented
        in paragraph B and are not listed as Debriefed, annotate Paragraph C with
        recommended additional training or a cross reference to where the additional
        training is documented (e.g., the examinee’s grade book). If there is no additional
        training, annotate paragraph C as, “Recommended Additional Training: None."
        3.6.1.9.3.5. Additional Comments. Comments are restricted to significant
        information dealing with the evaluation not documented elsewhere. OPR/EPR-
        type comments or comments comparing the examinee to other individuals are
        prohibited.
            3.6.1.9.3.5.1. If an alternate evaluation method is used to satisfy a part of the
            ground or simulator phase requirements, enter area number, area title, reason
            not accomplished in the normal method, alternate evaluation method used and
            date.
            3.6.1.9.3.5.2. If an individual received an overall Q3, indicate whether the
            entire evaluation must be re-accomplished, or just specific grading
            areas/subareas.
            3.6.1.9.3.5.3. If the recheck examiner of a ground recheck is different than the
            initial CSIE, the recheck examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement
            under this paragraph.
            3.6.1.9.3.5.4. Incorporate the information contained in any applicable MFRs
            (e.g., waivers, etc.).
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                     29


         3.6.1.9.4. Reviewing Officer’s Remarks. (Optional) Reviewing Officers will annotate
         their remarks following the Examiner’s Remarks in the space provided. If no remarks,
         annotate with “None.”
         3.6.1.9.5. Approving Officer’s Remarks. (Optional) Approving Officers will annotate
         their remarks following the Reviewing Officer Remarks in the space provided. If no
         remarks, annotate with “None.”
         3.6.1.9.6. Additional Reviews. (Optional) Additional reviews are at a unit’s
         discretion and will be defined in the unit’s supplement.
  3.6.2. Temporary Evaluation Documentation and Suspense. File temporary evaluation
  documentation or a draft AF Form 8 in the CSI’s FEF after all evaluation requirements are
  complete. The temporary evaluation documentation or draft Form 8 will include examinee,
  examiner, type evaluation, qualification level, and date completed. List any discrepancies by
  area/subarea, any restrictions, any additional training and any additional training due dates.
  The examiner completing the evaluation will sign and date the documentation. Remove the
  temporary evaluation certificate when the permanent AF Form 8 is filed in the FEF. File the
  completed AF Form 8 (all reviews/approvals accomplished) in the FEF not later than the end
  of the third month following the date completed on the AF Form 8. (T-3)
  3.6.3. Ground Rechecks. Ground rechecks are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of
  an unqualified evaluation when the CSIE deems a simulator recheck unnecessary. The
  ground recheck will be documented on the original AF Form 8 generated to document the Q3
  evaluation. To document the ground recheck, follow instructions in paragraphs 3.6.1.1
  through 3.6.1.9.6, except as noted below (T-3):
     3.6.3.1. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation.
     3.6.3.2. Simulator Phase. Document the date of the ground recheck on a separate line as
     “GROUND RECHECK” below the evaluation entry under Flight Phase.
     3.6.3.3. Qualification Level. Annotate the overall qualification grade as “3/1” in the
     qualified block.
     3.6.3.4. Expiration Date of Qualification. For evaluations that establish a new eligibility
     period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the ground
     recheck was successfully completed.
     3.6.3.5. Examiner’s Remarks: Recommended Additional Training. Document all
     recommended additional training associated with grading areas where deficiencies will be
     remedied by a ground recheck under subparagraph labeled Ground.
     3.6.3.6. Signature. The CSIE that completed the flight evaluation will sign the front of
     the AF Form 8. If the recheck examiner is different than the initial CSIE, the recheck
     examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement in the Section IV Comments,
     Examiner’s Remarks.
  3.6.4. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Commanders will direct local Stan/Eval function to
  prepare an AF Form 8 as follows (T-3):
     3.6.4.1. Date Completed. The effective date of the downgrade is the date the commander
     initiated the downgrade action. Normally, this is the simulator phase date (for cause). If
30                                                            AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


     this is a result of a downgrade for non-training related issues, the date the commander
     mandated the downgrade action will be used. The date does not have to match the final
     approval officer (i.e., the initiating commander) signature date. It may be prior to or the
     same as but will not be after the commander’s signature date.
     3.6.4.2. Examinee Identification. Complete Name, Grade, and last four of SSAN.
        3.6.4.2.1. Organization and Location. Organization and location blocks IAW
        paragraph 3.6.1.4.
        3.6.4.2.2. Aircraft /Crew Position. Enter the CSI’s weapon system (F-15C) and the
        crew position to which he/she will be re-qualified (MP/IP).
        3.6.4.2.3. Eligibility Period. Enter “N/A” for the block.
     3.6.4.3. Qualification.
        3.6.4.3.1. Flight Phase. In the Mission/Check block enter the qualification(s) to be
        downgraded (i.e., IOS, MSN) with the date of the situation that caused the
        downgrade.
        3.6.4.3.2. Qualification Level. If the CSI is downgraded to an intermediate level of
        qualification, place a “2” in the Qualified block. If the CSI is downgraded to an
        unqualified status, place a “3” in the Unqualified block.
        3.6.4.3.3. Expiration Date of Qualification. Enter “N/A”.
        3.6.4.3.4. Restriction(s) and Additional Training Due Date.
            3.6.4.3.4.1. If the downgrade is simply to an intermediate level of qualification,
            leave the box for Restriction(s) unmarked and enter “N/A” for Due Dates and
            “N/A” for Date Additional Training Completed. The commander may still
            recommend additional training in Section V. Comments in order for the CSI to
            regain their qualification; however, a due date will not be entered and the
            instructor completing the training will not fill out the Certifying Official blocks.
            3.6.4.3.4.2. If the downgrade is to an unqualified status, place an “X” in the box
            for Restriction(s) and enter a Due Date as the last day of the third month from the
            effective date. Complete the Date Additional Training Completed when required
            training is complete. The ICSI completing the additional training (or last training
            event if more than one) will sign and date the Certifying Official blocks in Section
            II of the AF Form 8.
        3.6.4.3.5. Commander-Directed Downgrade Block. Place an “X” in the box.
     3.6.4.4. Only the commander directing the downgrade and the individual concerned will
     sign the AF Form 8. Additional reviews are at the unit’s discretion.
        3.6.4.4.1. Flight Examiner. Leave blank.
        3.6.4.4.2. Reviewing Officer. Leave Blank.
        3.6.4.4.3. Final Approving Officer. The commander directing the downgrade will
        sign and place an “X” in the remarks block.
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                     31


        3.6.4.4.4. Examinee. The crewmember will sign acknowledging the action being
        taken by the commander.
     3.6.4.5. Comments:
        3.6.4.5.1. Non-Training Related Cases. If the commander directed downgrade is for
        non-training related cases, enter “RESTRICTIONS: COMMANDER-DIRECTED
        DOWNGRADE.” Paragraph A, Narrative, describe the reason for the commander
        directed downgrade. Include “for cause” in the reasoning statement if due to
        disciplinary/adverse administrative actions not related to training. For paragraph B,
        Discrepancies, enter “None.” For paragraph C, Recommended Additional Training,
        enter as required or “None.” For paragraph D, Additional Comments, enter as
        required or “None”. If additional reviews are accomplished, annotate in remaining
        space or use continuation page.
        3.6.4.5.2. Training Related Cases:
            3.6.4.5.2.1. If the downgrade is to an intermediate level of qualification or to an
            unqualified status, enter “RESTRICTIONS: COMMANDER-DIRECTED
            DOWNGRADE.” Paragraph A, Narrative, describe the reason for the commander
            directed downgrade. Include “for cause” in the reasoning statement. For
            paragraph B, Discrepancies, identify discrepancies. For paragraph C,
            Recommended Additional Training, enter as required or “None.” For paragraph
            D, Additional Comments, enter as required or “None.” If additional reviews are

  3.6.5. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing
  pertinent information extracted from all the AF Forms 8 accomplished by the CSI (T-3).
     3.6.5.1. Data Entry. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations. Use each AF Form 942
     until it is filled or “Z” out any unused blocks.
     3.6.5.2. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
     used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942
     should be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new unit. If electronic
     backups are normally maintained on removable storage media (e.g., DVD-ROM/CD-
     ROM) or are specifically prepared to facilitate transfer of an FEF, file the storage media
     in Section I of the FEF.
 32                                                             AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014


3.7. Flight Evaluation Folders. The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the
history of training qualification for each CSI. The AF Form 8 is the source document used to
record and verify the qualification of a CSI. A complete history of the AF Forms 8 in an FEF is
maintained on an accompanying AF Form 942. (T-2)
   3.7.1. Description of Folders. If hard-copy FEFs are used, folders must be letter size, able to
   separate contents into two sections and constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board
   folder or equivalent). Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSAN to
   the inside back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional
   information on the label if required. Folders must bear the “Privacy Act” statement or a “For
   Official Use Only” label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder. (T-2)
   3.7.2. Maintenance. Each CSI must have an FEF, which includes all AF Forms 8, AF Forms
   942, and any additional unit specified items. The FEF should be maintained by the CSI Flight
   Commander or the Stan/Eval functional office in the organization to which the individual is
   assigned or attached for training or as defined in the unit supplement. (T-2)
   3.7.3. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections. (T-2)
       3.7.3.1. (left side) . This section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms and those items
       authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g., logs of initial and annual
       reviews). Section I may contain two tabbed sub-sections. Tabs are optional.
          3.7.3.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top of Tab 1 (when tabs are used), in
          chronological order with the most recent on top.
          3.7.3.1.2. Tab 2 (if used). Maintain any additional information as directed by the unit
          supplement.
          3.7.3.1.3. If used, file backup electronic storage media in Section I of the FEF.
       3.7.3.2. (right side) . This Section contains AF Forms 8 and MFRs for all evaluations
       listed on the AF Form 942 in Section I.
          3.7.3.2.1. File AF Forms 8 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
          Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more weapon systems will file AF
          Forms 8 in chronological order without consideration of weapon system.
          3.7.3.2.2. MFRs documenting waivers are filed on top of the affected AF Form 8.
          Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the applicable AF Form 8
          under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is
          complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent MFRs documenting major
          discrepancies relating to qualification are filed immediately above the latest affected
          AF Form 8 or, in cases where the memo is for items other than those found on AF
          Forms 8, in chronological order with AF Forms 8 (regardless of the date the
          discrepancy is discovered).
   3.7.4. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8 and AF Form
   942. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on qualification. Discrepancies that alter
   the qualification of the affected CSI are considered major. Those discrepancies that do not
   alter the qualification of the affected CSI are considered minor and include typos, formatting
   and misspellings.
AETCI13-101V4 6 MAY 2014                                                                          33


     3.7.4.1. Major Discrepancies. Identified major discrepancies are documented on a
     permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/942,
     or in chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/942.
     3.7.4.2. Minor Discrepancies. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent
     record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction. The record of minor
     discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization of AF Forms 8/942 and CSI FEFs.
     Record of minor discrepancies will reside in Section I of the FEF. Any records of minor
     discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior to any permanent change in station.
     3.7.4.3. Corrections. As a source document, the AF Form 8 may be corrected by use of
     white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the CSIE
     signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If the original CSIE is not available
     after a reasonable effort to obtain his/her initials, priority will then be to obtain the
     reviewing official’s initials first, the approving official (if reviewing official unavailable),
     and finally the squadron commander. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may
     be altered without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected CSI and the
     contents of Section II of the FEF.
  3.7.5. Review of FEF.
     3.7.5.1. Initial Review. The ACS will review the FEF for all newly assigned CSIs to
     establish their qualification(s) prior to their first sortie. The reviewing organization is
     responsible for establishing the qualification of the CSI as determined from the latest
     applicable documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
     qualification of the CSI, the POC maintaining the FEF is responsible only for
     documentation subsequently placed in the FEF. Initial reviews are documented on the AF
     942. (T-2)
     3.7.5.2. Posting Review. The ACS will review each AF Form 8 when it is placed in the
     FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility
     period and qualification as documented are correct, all required evaluation events and
     requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8
     contains all signatures and initials within the allotted time. (T-2)
     3.7.5.3. Periodic Review. The unit will review all unit FEFs to confirm expiration dates
     used to track required CSI qualification evaluations are the same as those listed in the
     FEFs. The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification period window
     unless a more restrictive review period is established by the unit supplement. (T-2)
  3.7.6. Transfer of FEF. When custody of the FEF is transferred to a new unit or base, retain
  all records in the folder until reviewed by the gaining unit. After review, return to the
  individual those forms not retained in the folder. CSIs will normally hand- carry their FEF to
  the gaining organization. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail
  the folder to the gaining unit. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy until
  the gaining organization has received the original FEF. (T-2)
  3.7.7. Computer Generated Forms and Electronic FEFs. Computer generated forms must
  mirror AF Forms. If used, electronic copies of the FEF will be forwarded with the individual
  when they move to a new squadron. Electronic backups will be maintained on removable
  storage media (e.g., DVD-ROM/CD-ROM). (T-2)

                 BUDDY SIMULATOR INSTRUCTOR (BSI) PROGRAM

A2.1. BSI Program. This program should last 30-60 days (minimum of 30 days). New CSIs will
accomplish training requirements listed below. Briefings received during IQT may be used to
fulfill these requirements.
   A2.1.1. Ground Training. Ground training consists of the following:
       A2.1.1.1. BSI briefing (before training students).
       A2.1.1.2. CSI responsibilities briefing (before training students).
       A2.1.1.3. Commander’s review or Commander’s Awareness Program briefing.
       A2.1.1.4. Grading practices briefing.
   A2.1.2. Simulator Training.
       A2.1.2.1. BSI missions are student sorties accomplished by the new CSI on the IOS with
       his assigned BSI monitoring from either the cockpit or over the shoulder at the IOS. BSI
       sorties may be accomplished with either the assigned BSI, or a supervisor (assistant flight
       commander or above) in the new CSI’s chain of command monitoring performance.
       A2.1.2.2. The objective of these flights is to further develop the new CSI’s proficiency
       and instructional techniques. On each BSI sortie, the ICSI will discuss instructional
       techniques, planning profiles, student progress, common student errors, and possible
       pitfalls the new CSI should avoid. These missions will be documented in the new CSI’s
       BSI training record.
