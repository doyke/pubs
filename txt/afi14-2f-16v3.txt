This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-2, Intelligence Rules and
Procedures, and is consistent with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence
Training, AFI 14-202, Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 14-
202, Volume 3, General Intelligence Rules. This publication establishes the minimum Air Force
standards for training personnel performing intelligence duties in F-16 units. This publication
applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF), Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG) intelligence
personnel supporting F-16 operations. The National Guard Bureau will be considered
functionally as a major command (MAJCOM) for the purposes of this publication. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). This AFI may be supplemented, but all
supplements must be coordinated with the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) prior to
certification and approval. Refer recommended changes to the OPR using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route AF Forms 847 through the appropriate
functional chain of command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this
publication are identified with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance
statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the
authorities associated with the tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of
command to the appropriate tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR
for non-tiered compliance items.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change adds risk factors, known as “tiers” to tasks assigned to organizations below
major command (MAJCOM) level to depict the assessed risk of non-compliance. References to
Theater Airborne Reconnaissance System (TARS) intelligence support have also been deleted as
the requirement is no longer valid. It also deletes references to Statement of Intelligence Interest
(SII) as the term is outdated and re no longer a requirement. A margin bar (|) indicates newly
revised material.

     1.1.1. Scope. This volume outlines the procedures applicable to F-16 intelligence operations.
     With the complementary references cited, this volume prescribes standard operational
     procedures to be used by all CAF F-16 intelligence personnel. These operational procedures
     are the minimum and can be supplemented by additional unit-level written guidance. Unit-
     level written guidance may expand these basic procedures, but in no case will they be less
     restrictive.
     1.1.2. Office of Primary Responsibility. Air Force Intelligence (AF/A2) delegates office of
     primary responsibility (OPR) for this instruction to Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ
     ACC)/A2.
       1.1.3. References. The primary references for F-16 intelligence operations are AFI 14-2F-16
       Volume 1, F-16 Unit Intelligence Training, AFI 14-2F-16 Volume 2, F-16 Unit Intelligence

       Planning, General Planning and Employment Considerations, 3-1.Threat Guide, Threat
       Reference Guide, 3-1.F-16, Tactical Employment - F-16, and this instruction.
       1.1.4. Compliance. The senior intelligence officer (SIO) will ensure compliance with Air
       Force and MAJCOM directives and procedures as well as special notices in the Intelligence
       Read File (IRF). (T-2)
1.2. Waivers. MAJCOM/A2s will courtesy-copy AMC/A2 regarding all waiver requests and
responses. ACC/A2 will notify AF/A2DF of significant trends in waiver requests if such
correspondence indicates the need to readdress existing policy and guidance.
1.3. Supplements. AF/A2 delegates approval authority to the MAJCOM/A2 for MAJCOM
authored supplements to this AFI. MAJCOMS will ensure copies are provided to AF/A2, HQ
ACC/A2 and all other appropriate MAJCOMs upon publication. Per AFPD 14-2, supplements
will not be less restrictive than the lead AFI and should be limited to unique requirements only.

                          EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. External intelligence trainers (EITs) will conduct external intelligence
training for pilots. External training includes threat knowledge, visual recognition (VR), and
collection and reporting (C&R). If any intelligence professional is called on to conduct
personnel recovery (PR) training, this must be done in accordance with AFI 16-1301. External
training for pilots will be coordinated through the wing/group and squadron Weapons and
Tactics Flight or Officer. The SIO may determine if other unit personnel require external
training and will modify training requirements as appropriate. (T-2)
3.2. External Intelligence Training. The OSS/OSF SIO will: (T-2)
     3.2.1. Establish an external intelligence training program tailored to the unit’s mission,
     projected wartime/AEF/EAF tasking and/or weapon system and base/deployment location(s).
     (T-2)
     3.2.2. Appoint an external intelligence training program manager to oversee program
     execution. Where assigned, the USAF Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course graduate will

SUBJECT: Summary of Squadron Pilot External Intelligence Training

1. The xx Fighter Squadron has 25 assigned CMR pilots. 78 percent of pilots received 100
percent of their required intelligence training topics for this training cycle. The status of
intelligence training is listed below:

2. IAW the Intelligence Training Plan, each pilot is required to be trained on each training item
at least once each training cycle. At the completion of the annual training cycle, the following
pilots have not completed the annotated training items:

3. The annual Intelligence MQF test was administered on 15 Jan 08. All CMR pilots have taken
the 100 question test (50 questions and 50 visual recognition slides). While not all pilots obtained
the minimum passing score of 85 percent the first time around, all tests have been corrected to
100 percent. A total of 25 pilots took the test. The initial average test score for the squadron was
95 percent.

5. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and MiG-29
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
