MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C
             ALMAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs

FROM: HQ USAF/A1

SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) to AFI 36-2110, Assignments

1. By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this guidance memorandum immediately
implements changes to AFI 36-2110, Assignments, to include the reassignment policy of Air
Force members approved for expedited transfer and amends the provisions for dependent travel
allowances in conjunction with an Airman's Indeterminate TDY (ITDY). Compliance with this
memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force
publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and
Forms Management.

2. This change incorporates new guidelines for the reassignment of Air Force members who
were sexually assaulted and approved for expedited transfer and the reassignment of Air Force
alleged offenders accused of sexual assault or related offense. Any expedited transfer reference
in AFI 36-2110, Attachment 24, Humanitarian Reassignments and Deferment, to Air Force
members who were sexually assaulted will be deleted and replaced with guidance in Attachment
26, Expedited Transfer or referenced in Attachment 12, Threatened Persons Assignments. Any
reference in Attachment 24 to dependents who were sexually assaulted will remain in
Attachment 24.
3. In addition, in accordance with guidance provided in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation
(JFTR), Airmen tasked to deploy on 365-Day Extended Deployments/Indeterminate TDY (ITDY)
under Air Force Instruction 36-2110, Assignments, Chapter 5, will no longer be automatically
considered ITDY for purposes of dependent travel and transportation allowances under the JFTR,
Vol I, Para U4605, Member Ordered on TDY. Airmen tasked for a 365-day extended
deployment prior to 1 July 2012 will not be affected by this clarification. Consistent with the
JFTR, ITDY dependent travel and transportation allowances to an alternate place will be
authorized only when the deploying Airman's orders do not provide for return to his or her
Permanent Duty Station and the deployment period meets the requirements specified in JFTR
Para U4605A. An Extended Deployment shall not be considered indeterminate if the TDY period
is known and return to PDS is anticipated. Orders must specify TDY period and return to PDS if
expected.

4. In collaboration with the Chief of Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE) and the Director of the
Air National Guard (NGB/CF), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services
(AF/A1) develops personnel policy for Air Force Military Assignments Programs.
                                                                                         2
This Air Force Instruction (AFI) may be supplemented at any level; all supplements must be
approved by the Human Resource Management Strategic Board (HSB) prior to certification and
approval. This guidance memorandum becomes void after 1 year has elapsed from the date of
this memorandum, or upon incorporation by interim change to, or rewrite of AFI 36-2110,
whichever is earlier.

                HUMANITARIAN REASSIGNMENT AND DEFERMENT

1. The changes outlined below are approved for immediate implementation.

/A24.6.7. previous verbiage DELETED (renumbered below); replaced in Attachment 26,
Expedited Transfers or referred to Attachment 12, Threatened Persons Assignments.

/A24.6.7. Reassignment requests due to an Airman’s spouse or child who was sexually assaulted
will be considered for approval by HQ AFPC/DPAPH when paragraph A24.6.7.2 does not apply.
The request for reassignment must be fully substantiated by the appropriate medical authority
that remaining in the area where the incident occurred would be detrimental to the welfare of the
family member.

/A24.6.7.1. Airmen may request a specific base for reassignment following a sexual assault
incident involving the spouse or child; however, manning must fully support the Airman’s
desired location. The primary consideration is to relocate the Airman’s family away from where
the incident occurred. Retraining may be considered for this type of request on a case-by-case
basis.

A24.6.7.2. If the sexual assault occurred within the family or with an intimate partner,
reassignment requests will be under the Humanitarian Assignments policy when it is essential in
establishing or operating an effective Family Advocacy program according to AFI 40-301,
Family Advocacy. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP), consistent with DODD 6400-1
(Reference (o)) and DOD instruction (DODI) 6400.06 (Reference (p)), covers adult military
dependent sexual assault victims who are assaulted by a spouse or intimate partner and military
dependent sexual assault victims who are 17 years of age and younger. The installation SARC,
FAP and domestic violence intervention and prevention staff shall direct coordination when a
sexual assault occurs within a domestic relationship or involves child abuse.
NOTE: While requests for humanitarian consideration must u s u a l l y be initiated by the
member, there are some instances involving family advocacy issues where the member does
not desire assignment or assignment cancellation and there are no quality control factors that
would support such action. In these situations, the member’s commander can request
assignment or assignment cancellation via humanitarian deferment when the basis is to continue
or obtain treatment for family advocacy issues. The request must be fully documented and
endorsed by the local Family Advocacy Officer (see paragraph 3.8.10.2 for personnel assigned
overseas).
                                                                                                 4



                                         Attachment 26

                                   EXPEDITED TRANSFER

A26.1. If an Airman is sexually assaulted and files an unrestricted report, the Airman may
request an Expedited Transfer (ET) with assistance from the Sexual Assault Prevention and
Response (SAPR) Office. If an Airman is the victim of stalking or other sexual misconduct
(i.e., indecent viewing, visual recording, or broadcasting; forcible pandering; indecent exposure)
and files a report, the Airman may also request an ET with assistance from the Victim and
Witness Assistance Program in the installation’s Legal Office. An ET request initiated on behalf
of another will not be accepted.

A26.2. Airmen who were sexually assaulted and request transfer following threats of bodily
harm or death, should be encouraged to immediately report the threat to their commander, law
enforcement authorities, SARC, Victim Advocate or Special Victim’s Counsel. The office
receiving a request for transfer based on threats of bodily harm or death should also immediately
report the threat to the Airman’s commander and law enforcement authorities. Requests to
transfer under these circumstances will be handled in accordance with AFI 36-2110, Assignments
Attachment 12, Threatened Person Assignments.

A26.3. Ordinarily only one ET may be approved for an unrestricted reported incident.
Subsequent ET requests will only be considered when the alleged offender is later assigned to
the same duty location as the Airman who filed the unrestricted report of sexual assault, stalking,
or other sexual misconduct.

A26.3.1 The sexual assault victim forwards the Vice Wing Commander’s (or equivalent) memo
along with the vMPF ET application and all documents related to the approved ET (to include
the Exceptional Family Member Program [EFMP]) documentation and other applicable PCS
documentation) to his/her unit commander who then forwards to the Total Force Service Center
(TFSC) at HQ AFPC. Upon receipt of a Vice Wing Commander’s (or equivalent) approved ET
from the sexual assault victim’s commander through vMPF, the TFSC will forward to
Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center, Humanitarian and EFMP Assignments Branch, (HQ
AFPC/DPAPH) for execution of reassignment location. The TFSC acts as the liaison between
HQ AFPC/DPAPH and the Airman approved for ET.

A26.3.2. HQ AFPC/DPAPH will evaluate the Airman’s location preferences listed on the Vice
Wing Commander’s (or equivalent) memo and facilitate the reassignment. If preferences cannot
be met based on Air Force requirements, manpower utilization, or an exceptional family
member’s needs, AFPC will coordinate with the Vice Wing Commander (or equivalent) and
installation SARC on viable alternatives to prevent negative impact on the Airman’s career and
an exceptional family member, if applicable. If the Vice Wing Commander (or equivalent) or
SARC are aware that the requester has a Special Victim’s Counsel, they will also notify the
Counsel. If location resolution cannot be obtained, the discussion will be resolved between
AF/CVS and AFPC/CC.
                                                                                                     5
A26.3.2.1. For colonels (including selectees), and chiefs (including selectees) while requests are
submitted initially to HQ AFPC, the final authority in determining reassignment location is
AF/DPO and AF/DPE, respectively. Throughout this AFGM when HQ AFPC/DPAPH is
referred to, substitute AF/DPO if the Airman is a colonel or colonel select, and AF/DPE if the
Airman is a chief or chief select.

A26.3.3. Reassignment from CONUS to an overseas location, or between overseas theatres,
should not be considered unless it has been documented that family members reside in the
overseas area and the requester has expressed a preference for transfer to the overseas location.
Family members can be defined as mother, father, siblings, and loco parentis. Requests to
relocate to locations where family members other than those defined reside will be considered on
a case by case basis.

A26.3.3.1. If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the Airman’s
foreign-born spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be included in
the ET request. If reassignment can be facilitated, a request for a designated location move
(DLM) to the native country must be processed per AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.

A26.3.4. When an Airman is applying for ET and is married to another Airman, join spouse will
be considered if join spouse intent is updated accordingly in the personnel system.

A26.3.5. An Airman desiring ET who has a spouse or children enrolled in the EFMP must
include appropriate medical or educational documentation concerning the EFMP situation with
the ET request (i.e., DD Form 2792, plus addendums, DD Form 2792-1, IEP, AF Form 1466,
1466D, etc.). An ET reassignment cannot be approved unless the projected assignment location
can meet the needs of the exceptional family member IAW Attachment 25.

A26.3.6. An Airman will generally only be delayed from departing PCS when they are
required to remain for completion of a criminal or disciplinary investigation or action in which
they are the subject, including investigation and trial by US military or civil authorities or
administrative actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or AFI 36-2606,
Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or AFI 36-3208,
Administrative Separation of Airmen.

A26.3.6.1. If an Airman who has been approved for an ET has also undergone past disciplinary
action, but the commander does not deem a separation is appropriate, the losing unit commander
must formally notify the gaining unit commander, in writing, of any incomplete administrative or
disciplinary actions and provide a comprehensive analysis of the member’s duty related or
personal problems related to the administrative or disciplinary action.

A26.3.7. If an Airman’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated after an Airman is
reassigned there due to an ET request, he or she should be considered for intra-command
reassignment to another organization on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty
exists on base, or if the base is being deactivated, reassignment instructions will be provided by
HQ AFPC/DPAPH.

A26.3.8. Retraining or crossflow actions will be considered on a case by case basis as a last
resort, but the goal is timely reassignment actions with minimal disruption to an Airman’s career.
                                                                                                    6
All retraining actions will be coordinated through AFPC/DPS. As a general rule, reassignment
into a special duty position is not considered since the selection process is under a nominative
process and requires additional training. Additionally, when an Airman requires reclassification
prior to ET reassignment, HQ AFPC/DPAPH will coordinate with AF/A1PT.

A26.3.9. If an Airman submits a request for reassignment and the circumstances change prior to
a final decision or the Airman’s departure on assignment, he or she must immediately inform
either the MPS or the TFSC, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPH. A message reply will be
provided with final disposition instructions. Once an Airman has departed on an ET
reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn.

A26.4. To enhance protection for the sexual assault victim, potential reassignment of the alleged
offender shall be considered by the Vice Wing Commander (or equivalent), balancing interests
of the sexual assault victim and the alleged offender. The Vice Wing Commander (or
equivalent) is required to consult with the servicing Staff Judge Advocate and Military Criminal
Investigation Organization in making this decision when there is an open investigation.
Reassignment options include a temporary or permanent change of assignment (PCA) or
permanent change of station (PCS) to a location determined by Air Force needs and if applicable,
the EFMP requirements of the alleged offender’s spouse or children.

A26.4.1. The Vice Wing Commander (or equivalent) will notify an alleged offender who has
been selected for ET. The alleged offender will then have an opportunity to submit through
his/her unit commander, location preferences for inclusion in the Vice Wing Commander’s (or
equivalent) memorandum. The alleged offender will also have the opportunity to submit
documentation of family member’s enrollment in the EFMP, as well as any other circumstances
relating to the reassignment that he or she desires to bring to the Vice Wing Commander’s (or
equivalent) consideration. The alleged offender shall be notified that they have the right to
consult with an Area Defense Counsel prior to submitting these matters.

A26.4.2. The alleged offender’s unit commander will complete the vMPF ET application on
behalf of the alleged offender and will submit it and all documents related to the ET (to include
Vice Wing Commander’s (or equivalent) memo of approved ET decision, Exceptional Family
Member Program (EFMP) documentation and other applicable PCS documentation) to the
TFSC. Upon receipt of a Vice Wing Commander’s (or equivalent) ET from the alleged
offender’s commander through vMPF, the TFSC will forward to HQ AFPC/DPAPH for
execution of reassignment location. The TFSC acts as the liaison between HQ AFPC/DPAPH
and the Airman selected for ET.

A26.4.3. HQ AFPC/DPAPH will evaluate the Airman’s location preferences listed on the Vice
Wing Commander’s (or equivalent) memo and facilitate the reassignment. If preferences cannot
be met based upon Air Force requirements, manpower utilization, or an exceptional family
member’s needs, AFPC will coordinate with the Vice Wing Commander (or equivalent) on
viable alternatives to prevent negative impact on the Airman’s career and exceptional family
member if applicable. If the Vice Wing Commander (or equivalent) is aware that the requester
has an Area Defense Counsel, they will also notify the ADC. If location resolution cannot be
obtained, AFPC/DPA is the final authority in determining location of reassignment.
                                                                                                     7
A26.4.4. When an Airman is selected for ET and is married to another Airman, join spouse will
be considered if join spouse is updated accordingly in the personnel system.

A26.4.5. An alleged offender who has a spouse or children enrolled in the EFMP shall provide
appropriate medical or educational documentation concerning the EFMP situation upon
notification that their Vice Wing Commander (or equivalent) has selected them for ET (i.e., DD
Form 2792, plus addendums, DD Form 2792-1, IEP, AF Form 1466, 1466D, etc.). An ET
reassignment cannot be approved unless the projected assignment location can meet the needs of
the exceptional family member IAW Attachment 25.

A26.4.6. Reassignment from CONUS to an overseas location, or between overseas theatres,
should not be considered unless it has been documented that family members reside in the
overseas area and the requester has expressed a preference for transfer to the overseas location.
Family members can be defined as mother, father, siblings, and loco parentis. Requests to
relocate to locations where family members other than those defined reside will be considered on
a case by case basis.

A26.4.6.1. If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the Airman’s
foreign-born spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be included in
the ET request. If reassignment can be facilitated, a request for a designated location move
(DLM) to the native country must be processed per AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.

A26.4.7. If an Airman’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated after an Airman is
reassigned there due to an ET request, he or she should be considered for intra-command
reassignment to another organization on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty
exists on base, or if the base is being deactivated, reassignment instructions will be provided by
HQ AFPC/DPAPH.

A26.4.8. Assignment availability codes, assignment limitation codes and medical limitation
codes must also be addressed prior to reassignment. The goal for transferring the alleged
offender is a timely reassignment with minimal disruption to an Airman’s career and family.
                                                                                                  8

                                            Chapter 1

                                ASSIGNMENT AUTHORITY

1.1. Assignment Authority. The Department of Defense (DOD) allocates funds, delegates
authority and directs policies for TDY assignment and permanent change of duty station (PCS)
assignment of AF military personnel. This instruction implements DOD directives and
instructions and contains the authority, AF policies and procedures, to select personnel and direct
their temporary or permanent assignment or reassignment to satisfy national security
requirements. PCS may also be directed to ensure equitable treatment of Airmen, such as PCS
from overseas (OS) to the continental United States (CONUS), upon completion of the
prescribed OS tour. This instruction must be cited as the assignment authority only for
operational (including rotational), training (including formal education and professional military
education) and force structure assignments. Use Table 1.1 to find information on specific
assignment policies/procedures.
   1.1.1. Designated Assignment Authority and Assignment Office of Primary Responsibility
   (OPR). Table 1.2 shows the designated assignment authorities and OPRs to which authority
   is delegated for assignments and related actions prescribed by this instruction. The AF uses a
   centralized assignment system to ensure compliance with laws; personnel management
   directives and instructions; functional area directives and instructions; to ensure assignments
   and related actions are cost effective; fair and equitable; and to maintain personnel
   accountability. PCS assignment authority must not be further delegated. TDY assignment
   authority is delegated as shown in Chapter 4.
   1.1.2. Other PCSs. There are a number of reasons why Airmen may be directed, authorized,
   or entitled to make a PCS. Some examples are upon accession, upon separation or
   retirement, as a patient, as a prisoner, for administrative actions or boards, in connection with
   judicial proceedings, and so on. When PCS is for reasons other than those cited in
   paragraph 1.1, the PCS authority, funding authorization, and policies and procedures to be
   followed should be within the instruction which requires the PCS (see Attachment 22). To
   assist in determining whether or not to request a PCS IAW this instruction or some other AF
   instruction, use this general test: If the reason for the PCS is not for the purpose of an
   Airman filling a funded vacant manpower authorization and to perform duty in his or her Air
   Force specialty, and selection of the Airman was not based on individual qualifications and
   the PCS eligibility policies and procedures prescribed in this instruction, then the PCS is not
   within the authority of this instruction. When a PCS is necessary and no AF instruction
   authorizes the move, then a request for PCS may be submitted as outlined in paragraph 1.5,
   Exceptions. In one way or another, the MPS provides support for all PCSs. Therefore, to
   assist MPS’ in identifying appropriate OPRs for PCS-related queries, Table 1.2 and
   Attachment 22 are provided for information purposes.
   1.1.3. Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) and Permanent Change of (Duty) Station
   (PCS). Normally, an Airman is assigned to a unit to fill a manpower position and perform
   duty at the same location as the unit. As a general assignment policy, Airmen are not
   permanently assigned (including detailed, attached, etc.) to a location unless an AF unit (or
   AF element for DOD organizations) has officially been established at that location.
   Assignment of Airmen OS without proper establishment of an AF unit at the location where
 10                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   the Airman will actually perform duty can create severe problems (for example, if no Status
   of Forces Agreement (SOFA) exists, or an existing agreement does not cover an Airman
   and/or his or her family, when the rate of pay and allowances is different at the actual duty
   station in relation to the location of the manpower authorization to which the Airman may be
   assigned, etc.). Assignments contrary to this policy circumvent the AF manpower system
   and personnel assignment and accountability systems, can affect an Airman’s allowances and
   pay, and can have serious consequences. Exceptions may be considered according to
   paragraph 1.5.
      1.1.3.1. PCA with PCS. When Airmen physically perform duty at a location which is the
      same as the organization to which they are assigned, and upon reassignment will
      physically perform duty at a new location, then this is a permanent change of assignment
      (PCA) with concurrent permanent change of duty station (PCS).
      1.1.3.2. PCA without PCS.
          1.1.3.2.1. When an Airman is permanently reassigned from one organization to
          another organization with no change of permanent duty station, this is a PCA without
          PCS (PCA w/o PCS), or
          1.1.3.2.2. When an Airman is permanently reassigned from one permanent duty
          station to another (that is, the duty location [codes] are different) this is normally a
          PCS, except when both locations are within the corporate limits of the same city or
          town, then both locations are considered to be within the same permanent duty station
          for PCS allowance purposes (see paragraph 2.50). In such cases, notwithstanding
          the change of permanent duty stations, the move is still managed as a PCA w/o PCS.
          In other words, the rules for management of PCSs do not apply if it is a PCS without
          PCS allowances.
      1.1.3.3. PCS without PCA. There are times when it may be necessary to direct Airmen
      to physically change stations, but it may not be appropriate to change the unit to which
      they are assigned. This is rarely necessary for assignments directed IAW this instruction,
      but is common in connection with PCSs IAW other AFIs. For example, an Airman
      returning from OS for normal retirement may be assigned PCS w/o PCA to a retirement
      processing base. During the time between departure from the OS area and actual
      retirement date, the Airman remains assigned for manning, accountability and other
      purposes, to their last unit of assignment OS.
1.2. Assignment Requests. The Director of Assignments (or equivalent) in coordination with
major commands (MAJCOMs), field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units
(DRU), is authorized to initiate assignments for Airmen currently assigned to
MAJCOM/FOA/DRU to fill valid vacant manpower authorizations. This does not preclude
certain actions authorized to be initiated below MAJCOM/FOA/DRU level which flow directly
to the assignment OPR. Below are assignments initiated on behalf of the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
by the assignment OPR in coordination the Career Field Functional Manager:.
   1.2.1. PCS assignments prescribed by this instruction, intracommand or intercommand, with
   or without permanent change of assignment (PCA).
   1.2.2. Any intercommand PCA (between units of different commands) action prescribed by
   this instruction (with or without PCS).
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  11


   1.2.3. (Officers only.) Any intracommand PCA w/o PCS where officer changes senior rater
   (for example, wing to MAJCOM, MAJCOM to NAF, etc.).
   1.2.4. Any change of position involving a colonel (including selects) into or out of a Defense
   Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) controlled position, joint duty controlled
   position, or position of command at the group level, requires prior approval by the Air Force
   Senior Leadership Management Office (AFSLMO), AF/DPO, whether the position change
   is a PCA or PCS.
   1.2.5. Assignment of an officer to an unauthorized position (see paragraph 2.46).
   1.2.6. Assignment of an officer with the grade Lt Col or below to an authorized colonel
   position must be approved in advance by AF/DPO (with the exception of judge advocates).
   1.2.7. Any change of an officer’s Duty AFSC (DAFSC), excluding:
       1.2.7.1. Upgrade to the fully qualified level.
       1.2.7.2. Change directed by the assignment OPR.
       1.2.7.3. Change resulting from completion of formal education and training courses.
       1.2.7.4. Changes as the result of AFSC conversions or AFSC management actions.
       1.2.7.5. Requests for utilization or assignment (TDY or PCS) other than IAW with the
       above paragraphs may be submitted for consideration according to paragraph 1.5,
       Exceptions.
   1.2.8. Submit requests containing the information and using the method prescribed by
   applicable instructions, manuals and/or guidance as follows:
       1.2.8.1. For general officers (including brigadier general selects), as instructed by
       AFSLMO, AF/DPG
       1.2.8.2. For colonels (including selects), out of system, at least 90 days before the
       required report not later than date (RNLTD), as instructed by AF/DPO
       1.2.8.3. For judge advocates, as instructed by the assignment OPR.
       1.2.8.4. For officers, Lt Col and below (including Medical Service and Chaplains), at
       least 240 days before the required RNLTD, unless otherwise agreed to by the assignment
       OPR.
       1.2.8.5. For Airmen with the grade of CMSgt (including selects), as instructed by
       AF/DPE.
       1.2.8.6. For Airmen with the grade of SMSgt and below, as instructed by HQ
       AFPC/DPAA.
1.3. Distribution of Personnel. Personnel are distributed to meet the overall needs of the AF as
follows:
   1.3.1. According to DOD Directive 1315.7, Military Personnel Assignments, and DODI
   1315.18, Procedures for Military Personnel Assignments.
   1.3.2. As equitably as possible between CONUS MAJCOMs (or equivalent) within a
   specialty and grade. Additionally, for enlisted Airmen, according to Manning Unit Group
 12                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   (see Attachment 1, Definitions), the plug table (see Attachment 1, Definitions) and the
   manning priority plan when submitted by the MAJCOM (or equivalent) to HQ
   AFPC/DPAA5. NOTE: Normally overseas units are not manned over 100 percent.
   1.3.3. According to guidance from the Air Staff functional area OPRs.
   1.3.4. According to written Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for special circumstances.
   An MOA may be terminated by the designated assignment authority shown in Table 1.2
   when it no longer serves the best interests of the AF.
   1.3.5. As directed by the designated assignment authority shown in Table 1.2.
1.4. Waivers (see Attachment 1, Definitions). A formal waiver process is established when a
need exists often enough to deviate from a provision established by this instruction (e.g., a
standard, a requirement, a limit, etc.). Use this paragraph as the basic guidance for processing a
waiver, except when a paragraph, table or attachment contains specific waiver instructions.
There is no mandatory format, unless a paragraph, table or attachment prescribes the waiver
content and/or format, but all requests must be justified. Also see paragraph 1.5, Exceptions, to
determine when a request for an exception may be appropriate instead of a request for waiver.
   1.4.1. Justification. Justification for a waiver must show how approval is in the best interests
   of the AF from the standpoint of operational necessity. Waiver requests must not be
   approved based solely on personal desires or for personal reasons but may coincidentally
   satisfy an Airman’s personal desires or needs. Situations which are not based on operational
   necessity might be considered as an exception, see paragraph 1.5. Requests which do not
   meet the justification criteria for either a waiver or an exception should not be submitted.
   1.4.2. Originator Level. DOD or this instruction requires certain waivers "originate" no
   lower than a minimum level. It is recognized that requests are often "initiated" at a lower
   level (such as unit or group commander). Requests initiated at a lower level, but endorsed at
   the minimum originator level, are acceptable. Waivers may be initiated in one of the
   following two ways:
       1.4.2.1. An Airman may initiate a waiver request on his or her own behalf only when
       specifically authorized in a paragraph, table, or attachment. In all other instances,
       requests by Airmen which require waiver(s) must be submitted as an exception according
       to paragraph 1.5.
       1.4.2.2. An official responsible for a mission which cannot be effectively accomplished
       except by waiver of a provision established by this instruction may initiate a waiver
       request. When a minimum originator level has been established, a paragraph, table, or
       attachment must state the minimum level. The intent of the minimum originator level is
       to limit the number of waivers and restrict requests to those which are operationally
       essential. It is not the intent to require (or prohibit) an official at the minimum originator
       level to endorse waiver requests from Airmen. It is the intent for these officials to
       originate or endorse only those waiver requests essential to accomplish their mission.
       Regardless of the originating level, all requests must meet the justification criteria for
       approval.
   1.4.3. Commander Actions. All waiver requests must be routed through the unit
   commander, except those originated above the unit level which should be coordinated with
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   13


   the unit commander (for colonels (including selects), coordinate at least one level below the
   level of origination). A unit or higher level commander may disapprove a waiver request if it
   is not justified and must advise the requester of the reasons for disapproval. Commanders
   may address the impact approval might have on their local mission in their forwarding
   endorsement. When a unit commander recommends approval or concurs, he or she forwards
   the request to the Career Development Element of the servicing Military Personnel Element
   (MPF/E) for a recommendation and, if necessary, forwarding to the minimum originator
   level, unless the request is being processed through command channels. Waiver requests not
   initiated by an Airman must indicate whether or not the Airman has been advised and include
   volunteer status, if determined.
   1.4.4. MPS Actions. MPS’ must assist Airmen and commanders in ensuring that the
   requirements established by this instruction are met. MPS’ should advise the Airman, the
   unit commander or minimum originator level, as appropriate, when a waiver request does not
   appear to be justified or some other requirement is not met. Submission of a waiver request
   must not be the basis for delay in PCS processing or delay in complying with other actions
   within the time frames prescribed, except as follows. When the MPS receives a waiver
   request of an urgent nature which might have a bearing on an Airman’s pending PCS, the
   MPS must contact the appropriate assignment OPR (Table 1.2) for guidance without delay.
   Advise Airmen that submission of a waiver request does not change their duty status (for
   example, it does not change them from a leave status to a present for duty or TDY status).
   Submission of a waiver request is not the basis for failure of an Airman to meet a port call or
   RNLTD, and does not delay the requirement that they make a decision under the 7-day
   option, or negate any other requirement. In urgent situations, the MPS may send a request to
   the HQ AFPC assignment OPR or other OPRs for consideration/resolution.
   1.4.5. Assignment OPR and Approval Authority Actions. The MPS normally forwards
   assignment waiver requests to the assignment OPR, unless instructed otherwise. The
   assignment OPR may approve or disapprove a request when authorized, or make a
   recommendation and forward the request to the approval authority.
1.5. Exceptions (see Attachment 1, Definitions). Exceptions to policies, procedures, or other
provisions of this instruction may be considered when an action is prohibited; is not addressed; a
criterion is not met and there are no waiver provisions established; or, there are waiver
provisions but that criteria is not met. Use this paragraph as the basic guidance for processing a
request for exception, unless a paragraph, table, or attachment contains specific instructions for
exceptions. There is no mandatory format, but all requests must be justified.
   1.5.1. Justification. A request for an exception may be justified:
       1.5.1.1. Based upon operational necessity, or
       1.5.1.2. When compliance with a requirement would result in an injustice, a severe
       inequity, or a personal hardship significantly greater than other Airmen encounter in
       similar circumstances, or
       1.5.1.3. When it is shown an exception serves the overall best interests of the AF.
   1.5.2. Requester or Originator Level. Unless a paragraph on a subject specifies a minimum
   level, there is no minimum originator or requester level for a request for exception (including
   a request which might require waivers). A request for exception may be submitted by an
14                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  official responsible for a mission (that is, unit or group commander, etc.), or an Airman may
  submit a request on him or herself. Exception requests from Airmen may be endorsed by
  senior level officials at their discretion. However, requests from Airmen must still be
  evaluated based on the justification. Disapproval or an Airman’s request which has been
  endorsed by a senior official must not be construed as disapproval of a request originated by
  a senior official. All requests must cite what exception is requested. Requests initiated by
  Airmen must be submitted through their unit commander. (NOTE: When an exception
  request warrants approval but requires a waiver, the assignment authority serves as the
  minimum originator level and submits a waiver request to the waiver approval authority.
  Refer to paragraph 3.8.9.2 or 2.25.3 to ensure compliance with appropriate requestor levels
  for TOS or curtailment waivers.)
  1.5.3. Commander Actions. Unit commanders must review requests by Airmen and
  determine if the required justification exists. A unit commander, or higher level commander,
  may disapprove an Airman’s request if it is not justified and must advise the Airman of the
  reasons for disapproval. Commanders may address the impact approval may have on their
  local mission in their forwarding recommendation. When a commander recommends
  approval, he or she must forward the request to the MPS unless the request is being
  processed through command channels. Exception to policy requests submitted by other than
  the Airman must indicate whether or not the Airman has been advised and include volunteer
  status, if determined.
  1.5.4. MPS Actions. The MPS must assist Airmen and commanders in ensuring the
  requirements established by this instruction are met. MPS’ should advise an Airman, the unit
  commander, or other requester when a request does not appear to be justified or fails to meet
  some other requirement. Submission of an exception request must not be the basis for delay
  in PCS processing or delay in complying with other actions within the time frames
  prescribed, except as follows. When the MPS receives a request of an urgent nature which
  might have a bearing on an Airman’s pending PCS, the MPS must contact the appropriate
  assignment OPR for guidance without delay. Advise Airmen that submission of an exception
  request does not change their duty status (for example, it does not change them from a leave
  status to a present for duty status or TDY status). Submission of an exception request is not
  the basis for failure of an Airman to meet a port call or RNLTD, and does not delay the
  requirement that they make a decision under the 7-day option, or negate any other
  requirement. In urgent situations, the MPS may send a request to the HQ AFPC assignment
  OPR or other OPRs to expedite a final decision.
  1.5.5. Assignment OPR and Approval Authority Actions. Requests for exceptions to policy,
  procedures, or other provisions will be addressed to the office shown below for Airmen as
  indicated. These offices, with input from the assignment OPR when necessary, may
  disapprove a request, approve it, or make a recommendation for consideration by the
  appropriate approval level. When the authority to approve a request is within the office
  shown below, the approved exception will be forwarded to the assignment OPR for
  appropriate action. When an exception (or a waiver in conjunction with an exception)
  requires approval at a higher level, then the assignment OPR prepares a request for
  assignment, curtailment, or other action, and submit it to the appropriate approval level and
  include the exception approval, or recommendation for approval, from the office listed
  below.

                                           Chapter 2

                        GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

2.1. General Information. There are a number of policies and procedures which apply to
assignment actions and programs and most are stated below. However, additional policies and
procedures for specific actions, assignments, or programs are contained in a paragraph, a table,
an attachment, in other referenced directives or instructions, or in guidance provided by the
designated assignment authority or assignment OPR shown in Table 1.1. Assignments are
influenced by all of these requirements collectively. When necessary, in the national interests or
the best interests of the AF, waivers, exceptions and/or deviations from policies and procedures
in this instruction may be authorized by proper authority. For example, AF/DPG (for assignment
of general officers, including brigadier general selects), AF/DPO (for assignment of colonels,
including selects), and AF/DPE (for assignment of CMSgts, including selects), may request or
approve waivers, grant exceptions, or deviate from this instruction when necessary.
2.2. Release of Personal Assignment Information. Release of certain personal information to
the public or outside DOD channels is governed by AFI 33-323, Privacy Act Program, and DOD
Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement DOD Freedom of Information Act Program. Follow
the guidance in those publications prior to releasing personal information outside DOD channels.
2.3. Equal Opportunity. The AF assigns Airmen without regard to color, race, religious
preference (except chaplains), national origin, ethnic background, age, marital status (except
military couples), spouse's employment, educational or volunteer service activities of a spouse,
gender (except as provided for by statute or DoD policy), or sexual orientation. This applies to
PCS and TDY assignments.
2.4. Primary PCS Selection Factor. The primary factor in selection of an Airman for PCS is
the Airman’s qualifications to fill a valid manpower requirement and perform productively in the
position for which being considered. PCS eligibility factors such as time on station (TOS) and
so on, although important, are secondary. When Airmen with the required qualifications are
identified, then PCS eligibility criteria and other factors will be considered. Volunteer status,
individual preferences, humanitarian or special circumstances may be considered to the extent
these factors are consistent with operational manning requirements. PCS is not authorized based
solely on the fact an Airman can be used or prefers assignment elsewhere.
   2.4.1. Special Experience Identifier (SEI). AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel
   (Officer and Enlisted) implements policy and prescribes procedures for SEI establishment
   and management. The SEI compliments the assignment process and is used in conjunction
   with the grade, AFSC (or Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) code), AFSC prefixes and suffixes,
   Special Duty Identifier (SDI), Reporting Identifier (RI), Personnel Processing Codes (PPC),
   and professional specialty course codes. The SEI system may be used when experience or
   training is critical to the job/person assignment match, and no other means is appropriate or
   available. SEIs can be used when it is essential to rapidly identify personnel to meet unique
   circumstances, contingency requirements, or other critical needs. Manpower positions are
   coded with an appropriate SEI to identify positions that require unique
   experience/qualification.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   31


       2.4.1.1. Assignment OPRs must approve requests in advance to match assignments using
       the SEI because of the potential to subordinate other important assignment
       considerations. Further, after selections have been made, the assignment OPR must
       review them to ensure the impact in relation to other factors is justified.
       2.4.1.2. Requests for exceptions to match by SEI without manpower positions being
       coded require approval of the HQ AFPC assignment branch chief.
   2.4.2. Security Access Requirement. Manpower positions often require Airmen assigned
   have access to a specified level of classified information. When the urgency to fill a position
   does not allow selection of an Airman using PCS eligibility criteria and subsequent
   processing (and/or investigation), selection may be necessary from among Airmen who
   currently have access or can be granted access immediately. The assignment OPR must
   approve, in advance, assignment selection based upon an Airman’s security status. Further,
   after such selections have been made, the assignment OPR must review them to ensure the
   impact in relation to other factors is justified.
   2.4.3. PCS Costs. Assignments of qualified, eligible Airmen are directed as economically as
   possible, when other considerations are not overriding. PCS cost projections are based on the
   average cost for a particular kind of move and whether the person moving is an officer or
   enlisted member.
2.5. PERSONNEL TEMPO (PERSTEMPO). In its simplest definition, PERSTEMPO is the
number of days per 12-month period an Airman is TDY away from his or her permanent duty
station. In general, TDY in excess of 120 days in a 12-month period is considered to be high
PERSTEMPO. In a broader sense, PERSTEMPO is the short and long term impact on an
Airman, the Airman’s unit, his or her family, etc of satisfying the needs of the AF. In this
respect, all TDY and PCS assignment policies and procedures are PERSTEMPO sensitive.
2.6. PCS Allowances. When an Airman is directed to make a PCS, the AF may not deny the
Airman any travel and transportation allowances associated with the PCS. Airman cannot waive
their PCS allowances in return for PCS consideration. The government is obligated to pay PCS
allowance costs should the Airman claim reimbursement. Airmen will not be afforded special
assignment consideration on the basis of PCS allowances they may or may not use, other than as
authorized in conjunction with an approved program (for example, the Home-Basing and
Follow-On Assignment Programs, as outlined in Attachment 5).
2.7. Grade, AFSC and Skill Level Relationship for Assignments.
   2.7.1. Officers. Officers are eligible for assignment in any AFSC they possess or are
   qualified to be awarded. Officers are normally assigned to manpower authorizations
   associated with their current grade; however, the needs of the AF may require assignment
   otherwise. Also see paragraph 2.18 for assignment of officers not selected for promotion.
   Promotions through the grade of lieutenant colonel may not be the sole basis for PCS.
   Lieutenant colonels may not be assigned to colonel positions without the advance approval of
   AF/DPO.
   2.7.2. Enlisted. Assignments are directed by the assignment OPR as shown below.
   Assignment OPR may deviate when in the best interests of the AF.
 32                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       2.7.2.1. Enlisted personnel are selected to fill manpower requirement with the following
       grade/skill combinations:
          2.7.2.1.1. CMSgts (E-9) for Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) code positions.
          2.7.2.1.2. SMSgts (E-8) for 9-level positions.
          2.7.2.1.3. MSgt (E-7) and TSgt (E-6) for 7 level positions.
          2.7.2.1.4. SSgt (E-5) and Senior Airman (SRA) for 5 level positions.
          2.7.2.1.5. Airman First Class (A1C), Airman (Amn) and Airman Basic (AB) for 3
          level positions.
       2.7.2.2. CMSgts (including CMSgt selects) may be assigned in any AFSC or Chief
       Enlisted Manager (CEM) Code they possess or are qualified to be awarded.
       2.7.2.3. Normally, Airmen in the grade of SMSgt and below are selected for assignment
       in their Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC), except when serving in a special
       duty identifier (SDI) or reporting identifier (RI). Airmen serving in a SDI/RI are
       normally selected based on their Primary AFSC (PAFSC).
          2.7.2.3.1. Enlisted members in a retraining/reclassification status (incompatible grade
          and CAFSC skill level) are selected for assignment and allocated against
          requirements commensurate with their grade, regardless of the skill level of their
          CAFSC. See Table 2.1, AAC 29.
          2.7.2.3.2. Enlisted members awarded CONUS/OS Imbalanced skills are managed as
          outlined in Chapter 3.
       2.7.2.4. Enlisted members projected for promotion to the next higher grade are normally
       considered for assignment based on their projected grade. Up to the grade of SMSgt,
       promotion may not be the sole basis for PCS. The needs of the AF may require
       assignment other than as shown below.
       2.7.2.5. Enlisted retrainees may be assigned to OS long tour areas on their initial
       assignment as volunteers; however, they will not normally be assigned to short tour areas
       (as a volunteer or non-volunteer).
2.8. Manpower Authorization Changes. Normally, assignments are not made nor manning
entitlements adjusted in response to increases in functional category "A" military manpower
authorizations when approved and made effective within the current or two succeeding fiscal
quarters. This timeline (a minimum of 6 months) allows the assignment process to react to the
increase and provide Airmen acceptable minimum assignment selection notice.                A
MAJCOM/FOA/ DRU (or equivalent) may request fill actions earlier than the above minimums
with specific justification. The assignment OPR will evaluate and approve/disapprove such
requests. Assignment of Airmen incident to decreases in authorizations resulting in a surplus
will be managed according to guidance in paragraph 2.48.
2.9. Utilization Standards and Assignment of Rated Officers.
   2.9.1. Utilization Standards for Rated Officers. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of
   1989 (ACIA), codified as 37 U.S.C., Section 301a, imposes utilization standards, commonly
   referred to as ―gates,‖ for rated officers. Rated officers are required to be assigned to
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  33


  operational flying duties for specific amounts of time by 12 years (1st gate), or 18 years
  (2nd/3rd gate) of aviation service to maintain their entitlement to continuous aviation career
  incentive pay (ACIP). Operational flying duties are identified by aircrew position identifier
  (API) codes 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 (API codes 0, 3 and 4 identify other than operational flying
  duty). A rated officer must perform at least 8 years (96 months-1st gate) of operational
  flying duty by the 12th year of aviation service to receive ACIP through 18 years of aviation
  service; at least 10 years (120 months-2nd gate) of operational flying duty by the 18th year of
  aviation service to receive ACIP through 22 years of officer service; and at least 12 years
  (144 months-3rd gate) of operational flying duty by the 18th year of aviation service to
  receive ACIP through 25 years of officer service. It is Air Force policy to have as many
  Airmen as possible perform flying duties to meet 1st and 2nd gate requirements; however,
  not all officers will fulfill the requirements for their 3rd gate. AFI 11- 401, Aviation
  Management, Chapter 2, explains these requirements in detail. Compliance with the
  following guidance, in combination with paragraph 2.45, Officer Duty Changes, is essential
  to effective rated officer management. Waivers of the following policies require HQ
  AFPC/DPAO approval.
     2.9.1.1. Graduates of undergraduate flying training (UFT) are assigned to operational
     flying duties until they have completed 96 months of flying to the maximum extent
     possible. Gate credit accumulated during UFT counts toward this restriction.
     2.9.1.2. Rated officers may be considered for duties other than operational flying upon
     completion of 96 months of operational flying, if otherwise eligible and qualified,
     2.9.1.3. The typical officer with over 12 years of aviation service must have completed
     or be able to complete at least 10 years, and preferably 12 years of operational flying duty
     before the 18th year of aviation service before being assigned to duties other than
     operational flying. In those cases where rated officers are currently assigned to stabilized
     tours in duties other than operational flying and the possibility exists of the officers not
     meeting the utilization standards, tour curtailments (or waiver of remaining stabilized
     tour period) may be directed by the assignment OPR according to the established policies
     in paragraph 2.15.6. To the extent possible, tour curtailments (or waiver of remaining
     stabilized tour period) will normally be directed sufficiently in advance to provide
     adequate and timely replacement.
  2.9.2. Rated Officer Assignments (Lieutenant Colonels and Below). Rated officers who are
  not disqualified for aviation service IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service,
  Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, are assigned primarily to fill rated requirements.
     2.9.2.1. Rated officers may ask for a change to another rated AFSC or non-rated duty as
     indicated in paragraph 2.45. In addition, a commander or MAJCOM may submit
     requests to resolve manning problems or to provide career development opportunities.
     2.9.2.2. Report officers disqualified from aviation service per AFI 11-402, for
     assignment or other disposition according to paragraph 2.41. Rated officers disqualified
     from aviation service for medical reasons may continue to be assigned to duty in a rated
     AFSC not involving operational flying upon approval of HQ AFPC/DPAO according to
     AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).
 34                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       2.9.2.3. Report officers eliminated from a flying training course being attended in PCS
       status or TDY en route PCS status, and officers eliminated from undergraduate flying
       according to paragraph 2.41.
   2.9.3. Voluntary Request for Disqualification from Aviation Service. Rated officers
   applying for a commission change, legal, or medical education programs, must include a
   voluntary request for disqualification for aviation service. Refer to AFI 11-402, paragraph
   3.7.1.2. for complete instructions.
   2.9.4. Assignment of Rated Officers to Non Flying Positions. Rated officers who volunteer
   for a non flying position (PCS or PCA), when a flying position is available, must complete
   the statement in Figure 2.1. (This can be provided via E-Mail). Similarly, when the
   assignment OPR selects a volunteer for a non-flying position when a flying position is
   available, the assignment transaction must include the personnel processing code (PPC)
   ―GTW‖ in the assignment notification.

 SUBJECT: FOUO - Acknowledgment of Understanding -- Aviation Career Improvement Act
 (ACIA)

 This email contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which must be
 protected under the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.

 1. I, (name, SSN), acknowledge that I voluntarily elect to pursue a non flying duty assignment
 and will fail to achieve my (1st) (2nd) flying gate. (See paragraph 2.9., AFI 36-2110,
 Assignments.)

 2. I recognize this action will terminate my continuous entitlement to Aviation Career
 Incentive Pay after passing (12 years of aviation service) (18 years of aviation service) (22
 years of officer service). I further acknowledge understanding that aviation incentive pay after
 the (12th year of aviation service) (18th year of aviation service) (22nd year of officer service)
 is contingent on my having a rated duty AFSC and being assigned to operational flying duty.


 (Typed name, grade, SSN)                                             (Signature)

 NOTE: Officers provide the original to HQ AFPC/DPAO, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-6001
 through the MPS before the assignment OPR approves the assignment. Assignment OPRs file
 the original in the officer's Master Personnel Records Group as a permanent document.
2.10. Volunteer Status and PCS Eligibility. Within a group of qualified Airmen, volunteers
meeting minimum eligibility criteria for PCS selection are selected ahead of non-volunteers.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    35


Conversely, qualified non-volunteers meeting the minimum eligibility criteria for PCS are
selected ahead of qualified volunteers who do not meet the minimum eligibility criteria for PCS.
For example, using the PCS eligibility criterion of TOS for a CONUS to CONUS PCS, qualified
volunteers who meet the minimum TOS requirements are considered first in order of longest on
station and qualified non-volunteers who meet the minimum TOS are considered next in order of
longest on station. Stated another way, qualified volunteers who do not meet minimum TOS
requirements will not be selected ahead of qualified non-volunteers who meet minimum TOS
requirements.
2.11. Volunteers Replacing Non-volunteers Selected for PCS. Airmen who volunteer (or
desire to volunteer) for a specific assignment are not permitted to replace non-volunteers already
selected for an assignment. If such replacements were permitted, the non-volunteer, in most
instances, would be reselected based on original eligibility. Airmen volunteering for an
assignment will be selected, in turn, when they become the most eligible volunteer. See
paragraph 2.12 when an Airman selected for PCS as a volunteer desires assignment
cancellation.
2.12. Change of Volunteer Status After PCS Selection. An Airman selected as a volunteer
for an assignment may request assignment cancellation based on hardship or best interest of the
Air Force. NOTE: A request under this paragraph is different than an Airman requesting
cancellation of an assignment based on denial of dependent travel due to a lack of general
medical services (see Attachment 24 or Attachment 25), or other reasons.
   2.12.1. The assignment OPR considers the following:
       2.12.1.1. Justification provided
       2.12.1.2. Whether there are other qualified, eligible volunteers from which to select,
       2.12.1.3. The amount of lead time to select and notify another person
       2.12.1.4. Training scheduled or completed.
       2.12.1.5. Any other variables associated with the particular assignment.
   2.12.2. When a request is disapproved, the Airman remains on assignment as a volunteer.
   The Airman’s status is not changed to reflect ―non-volunteer‖. If a PCS cancellation request
   submitted under this paragraph is disapproved, the Airman cannot request separation or
   retirement under 7-day option provisions (unless they are still within 7 days of official
   notification). An officer may not cancel a Specified Period of Time Contract (SPTC) having
   accepted a PCS or training, nor may an Airman cancel a voluntary extension of enlistment or
   reenlistment, which was executed for the purpose of accepting the PCS or training. An
   SPTC for an officer or an enlisted Airman’s extension of enlistment (but not a reenlistment)
   may be canceled as outlined in the prescribing instruction for those actions if it no longer
   serves the purpose for which executed. For example, if an enlisted Airman extends an
   enlistment to accept an assignment and the assignment is canceled, then the enlisted Airman
   may request cancellation of the extension.
2.13. Minimum Age for Assignment to a Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger Area. Airmen must
be at least 18 years of age to be assigned (PCS or TDY) to a hostile fire or imminent danger area.
2.14. Non-career Officers and First-Term Airmen (FTA). There are several assignment
provisions which apply only to non-career officers (see Attachment 1, Definitions) and FTA
 36                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


(see Attachment 1, Definitions). Unless a paragraph, table, or attachment stipulates special
guidance for non-career officers or FTA, the guidance is the same as for career enlisted Airmen.
   2.14.1. FTA serving an initial enlistment of 4 or more years is not given more than two
   assignments to different locations following initial basic and skill training during their first 4
   years of service, regardless of tour length. FTA is permitted additional PCSs in conjunction
   with an approved humanitarian reassignment, a join spouse assignment, as a volunteer, or
   when the PCS is a mandatory move. Low-cost moves are excluded from the two-move
   count.
   2.14.2. Non-career officers are not arbitrarily limited in the number of PCSs they may be
   directed to make. Compliance with TOS minimums, selecting personnel in turn based on
   longest on station, and other factors are adequate to limit the number of moves.
   2.14.3. Non-career officers fall into two groups and are managed as follows:
       2.14.3.1. Non-career officers with an established date of separation (DOS) may decline
       to obtain retainability for a PCS or training ADSC, without prejudice. For example, a
       Medical Service officer with an established DOS as the result of an SPTC may decline to
       obtain retainability for a PCS or training ADSC, without prejudice. NOTE: Expiration of
       an ADSC is not the same as an established DOS.
       2.14.3.2. Non-career officers with an indefinite DOS have indefinite service retainability
       for any ADSC-incurring event such as PCS or training. NOTE: Expiration of an ADSC
       is not the same as an established DOS. A non-career officer who does not desire to
       participate in an ADSC- incurring event, such as PCS or training, must exercise his or her
       option to establish a separation date under 7-day option provisions as explained in
       paragraph 2.30. However, to provide non- career officers adequate time to acclimate to
       military service, to avoid forcing them to make a premature career decision, and to the
       extent operational requirements permit, the following policy applies. As a non-volunteer,
       non-career officers with an indefinite DOS may be selected for an ADSC-incurring event
       when:
           2.14.3.2.1. The ADSC can be completed before becoming a career officer (for
           assignment purposes, a career officer is (both) a captain or higher who has 4 or more
           years total active federal commissioned service [TAFCS]). For eligibility for
           involuntary PCS OS, compute completion of the ADSC for the OS tour using the
           unaccompanied tour length. A non-career officer who elects to serve the
           accompanied OS tour length voluntarily incurs the longer accompanied ADSC (which
           may result in becoming a career officer), or
           2.14.3.2.2. They are within 12 months of having 4 years TAFCS and have no ADSC
           beyond 4 years (Unless a waiver is approved by the assignment authority). Within
           HQ AFPC, waiver authority is the assignment division chief.) This allows a non-
           career officer who does not desire an additional ADSC beyond 4 years to request
           separation in lieu of an event, or
           2.14.3.2.3. They already have an ADSC beyond 4 years TAFCS. In this instance,
           career officer procedures apply.

2.15. Assignment Deferment and Availability. The reasons for deferments vary. Deferments
may be authorized when it is possible to maintain an equitable assignment system and also
support the need for stability in certain organizations or functions. In other instances, deferments
are to preclude an Airman’s PCS while suitability to remain on active duty is evaluated or during
a period of observation or rehabilitation. And still further, sometimes a deferment period is
required to process or complete an action, recognize a temporary PCS ineligibility condition, or
other circumstance of a temporary nature. The most common reasons for deferment are identified
by assignment availability codes (AACs) shown in Table 2.1. A list of activities, organizations,
or positions authorized stabilized tours is maintained and continually updated by HQ
AFPC/DPAPP in the Stabilized Tour Guide. The Stabilized Tour Guide can be accessed online
at http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AssignProc/. The guide lists organizations authorized
stabilized tours, the length of the tour, and if the tour is designated as a minimum or maximum
tour. When a previously granted deferment causes significant assignment inequities, then waiver
of the deferment may be considered depending on the reason deferred. To preclude assignment
inequities or granting a deferment and subsequently having to waive it, the AF must carefully
limit both the number of organizations/functions, etc., authorized stabilized tour deferments and
limit the number of individual deferments. Generally, when an Airman may be vulnerable for
PCS selection during the period of a proposed deferment or stabilized tour, then a request for
PCS or deferment should not be approved. Deferment or stabilized tour assignment
notwithstanding, all Airmen are subject to temporary or permanent assignment to meet
worldwide AF requirements. An AAC usually applies only to an Airman’s current assignment.
Deferments may be based on a specific action applicable to only one Airman (such as placement
on the control roster, or operational deferment), or circumstances that apply to all Airmen in a
unit (such as assignment to a stabilized tour). When a previously authorized deferment no longer
serves the overall best interest of the AF (for example, the Airman is required to fill a higher
priority manning need or assignment OS is necessary to ensure equitable distribution of OS
assignments), a deferment may be terminated (waived/ curtailed) by either HQ AFPC/DPAPP, or
the assignment/appropriate OPR. The deferment of a group may be removed or modified by the
authority which granted the original deferment. The reasons for deferment are addressed in
specific paragraphs elsewhere in this instruction or deferment may be directed per another
directive or instruction. For example, medical instructions prescribe which injuries, illnesses, or
diseases render an Airman ineligible for PCS or TDY, and the duration of the deferment.
Therefore, that medical instruction authorizes temporary deferment for medical conditions. Even
though this instruction authorizes waiver of deferment, an assignment OPR may not waive a
deferment or AAC for which assignments is not the OPR without coordination with the OPR.
For example, waiver of AAC 14, Material Witness, would require coordination with the SJA
which requested the code (or the SJA might agree to remove the code). Stabilized tour
deferments are not normally updated for Airmen serving OS; however, there are some exceptions
(for example, officers serving OS in joint activities filling positions designated as joint duty
assignments (JDA). See Table 2.1 to confirm which specific codes are updated when serving
OS. The following additional guidance applies.
   2.15.1. Date of Availability (DOA). An Airman is considered available for reassignment on
   the first day of the "availability" month. Availability for assignment in the PDS is managed
   by month and year. The DOA is computed in different ways depending on the reason for the
   AAC.
38                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  2.15.1.1 For stabilized tours, compute the DOA by adding the stabilized tour period to the
  DAS or date assigned to the tour. For example, an Airman is assigned duty on a three year
  stabilized tour on 22 June 2007. The Airman’s DOA is Jun 2010 and because of the way
  stabilized tour DOAs are computed, the Airman is shown as available on 1 June. 2010.
  However, when selection for PCS is made by computer, computer programming takes into
  account how stabilized tour DOAs are computed and assignment selection will not normally
  be to fill a requirement which requires departure within the availability month. For example,
  an Airman available in Jun would normally not be selected by the computer for an
  assignment with an RNLTD earlier than 31 Aug. If the same Airman was selected to fill a
  requirement with a 10th of the month RNLTD, then the RNLTD for a person with a Jun
  DOA would not be earlier than 10 Sep. When assignment selections are done manually,
  assignment OPRs will take into account how stabilized tour DOAs are computed and make
  assignment selections accordingly. EXCEPTION: For officers, the joint duty assignment
  DOA is computed based on joint duty credit guidelines (see paragraph 2.15.6.3 below).
     2.15.1.2. For AACs based on a quality control indicator (Table 2.1, AACs 10 through
     21, except 14) establish the DOA as the month following completion of the action. For
     example, an Airman receives an Article 15 on 22 June 2007 with a six month suspended
     reduction, or is placed on the control roster 22 June 2007 for a six month observation
     period. Although the actions expire 21 December 2007, the correct DOA in each case is
     January 2008. This action ensures a departure date (mo/yr) no earlier than the
     completion of disciplinary, rehabilitative, or administrative action. As a rule, Airmen are
     matched to requirements and RNLTDs are established so the departure date is not earlier
     than the first day of the availability month and year. The MPS will reclama an
     assignment or request a change of RNLTD for assignments not meeting this criteria.
     EXCEPTION: A reclama is not necessary to change the RNLTD nor is a waiver required
     when the Airman desires to depart after the actual day punishment, or an observation
     period, etc., expires and the commander concurs.
     2.15.1.3. When multiple AACs apply to an Airman, the code with the longest period of
     deferment is entered as the first AAC, the AAC for the next longest deferment is second,
     and so forth.
     2.15.1.4. MPS’ are not authorized to update the following AACs (these AACs are
     updated by the assignment OPR only): 36 (Enlisted only), 46, 48, 54 and 56.
     2.15.1.5. MPS’ may place Airmen in the following AACs when they receive "by-name"
     deferment authority: 21 (for "other" reasons as shown in Table 2.1 and paragraph
     2.40.3.10), 28, 30, 34, 39, 41, 51 (enlisted only), 52, 58, and 85. NOTE: MPS’ may use
     the assignment action reason for an Airman’s PCS, assignment trailer remarks, or other
     approval (such as a letter/memo, approved application, PCS orders, etc.) as authority for
     deferment.
     2.15.1.6. MPS’ may place Airmen in the following AACs when they receive "by-name"
     deferment authority, or when the MPS confirms the Airman is authorized deferment as a
     result of being assigned to an organization, function, position, etc., as shown in the
     Stabilized Tour Guide (see paragraph 2.15.6): 22, 36 (officers only), 42, 43, 44, 45, 47,
     50, 51 (officers only), 55, 57 or 59. NOTE: MPS’ may use the assignment action reason
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     39


     for an Airman’s PCS, assignment trailer remarks, or other approval (such as a
     letter/memo, approved application, PCS orders, etc.) as authority for deferment.
     2.15.1.7. MPS’ may place Airmen in the following AACs when this instruction or some
     other instruction or directive requires or authorizes deferment: 02, 05, 08, 09, 10, 12, 13,
     14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 38, 40, 52 (enlisted only), 53, 65, 67, 69, 70,
     71, 72, 73, 74, and 77. NOTE: MPS’ may use the assignment action reason for an
     Airman’s PCS, assignment trailer remarks, or other approval (such as a letter/memo,
     approved application, PCS orders, etc.) as authority for deferment.
  2.15.2. When an Airman is not initially assigned to a stabilized tour upon arrival PCS and
  subsequent assignment to a stabilized tour at the same location is proposed, a specific period
  of deferment must be proposed and the deferment approved by the assignment OPR at the
  time the assignment is approved.
  2.15.3. Airmen who are vulnerable for OS assignment selection are not normally approved
  for placement in an organizational deferment AAC except Airmen arriving PCS for
  immediate assignment to an activity or function authorized deferment, or the reason for
  reassignment carries with it a deferment upon completion of PCS (for example, humanitarian
  reassignment, join spouse assignment, and so on).
  2.15.4. DOA Deferments Waivers. As a guide, if it becomes necessary to waive deferments,
  the longest organizational (as opposed to by-name) deferments are waived first. For
  example, a four year organizational deferment is normally waived before a three year
  deferment, and both before waiving a one year individual (by-name) deferment. Deferments
  not involving the expenditure of PCS funds are waived before those where the Airman made
  a PCS move in conjunction with deferment. For example, an Airman with several years on
  station moves to a stabilized unit at the same location and is subsequently deferred, will have
  deferments waived before an Airman assigned to the location specifically to join a military
  spouse. There may be exceptions as manning priorities, requirement for backfill,
  humanitarian considerations, etc. may dictate otherwise.
  2.15.5. Military Operational Deferment. At times, the continued assignment of a particular
  Airman may be essential to accomplish a specific mission. In these rare circumstances, a
  military operational deferment of an Airman may be requested and may be over and above an
  existing unit or function deferment. Normally, only one operational deferment is granted and
  the period will not exceed one year. This period is adequate in most cases to train a
  replacement or to make arrangements for project or program continuity. A military
  operational deferment is appropriate only in support of units transitioning to a new or
  significantly different weapons system or to support special projects generated by high-level
  tasking where duties and the Airman’s qualifications are significantly different from those
  normally associated with the Airman’s career field. A request for operational deferment must
  contain complete details to include cost factors, the mission impact, and why a particular
  Airman’s presence and qualifications are essential to the mission. Requests are submitted to
  the assignment OPR for consideration (Table 1.1). When waiver of deferments becomes
  necessary, operational deferments (AAC 58 for officers and AAC 51 for enlisted) are among
  the last to be waived because of the short duration and justification on an individual basis.
  2.15.6. Educational Deferment. It is the intent of the AF to support Airmen in achievement
  of their personal education goals provided they satisfy their primary duties without
40                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  significant impact on "in-turn" assignments. Therefore, at key times in certain educational
  programs, Airmen stationed in the CONUS may be authorized an assignment deferment for
  educational reasons. Like other deferments, education deferments may be waived when they
  do not serve the overall best interest of the AF. Educational deferments may be requested per
  AFI 36-2306, The Education Services Program. The following criteria apply.
     2.15.6.1. Officers. An officer enrolled in an off-duty graduate or doctorate degree
     program may be deferred from PCS for the period necessary to complete the program,
     not to exceed 12 months. Officers with an Assignment Selection Date (ASD) are not
     eligible to apply for deferment, nor is deferment authorized for the purpose of completing
     an additional degree equal to or lower than is currently held unless it directly applies to
     the officer’s AFSC or AF needs. The deferment period is terminated when studies are
     discontinued, or when the degree requirements are completed, whichever occurs first. A
     deferment for the purpose of completing a thesis or research paper is not authorized.
     NOTE: The AAC 52 will be updated by the assignment OPR.
     2.15.6.2. Enlisted. Enlisted personnel enrolled in a voluntary education program (local
     off-duty study) may ask for deferment to preclude departure on an assignment before
     completion of the specific education program. Airmen with an ASD are not eligible to
     apply for deferment; however, may request an RNLTD change (not to exceed three
     months) to accommodate completion of a course presently enrolled in. Educational
     deferment is terminated at the end of the specified period, when studies are discontinued,
     or when degree or academic requirements are completed, whichever occurs first.
     Eligibility criteria follow:
         2.15.6.2.1. Vocational School Program. Enlisted enrolled in programs leading to
         award of a vocational diploma may be delayed from PCS for a period not to exceed
         three months from the month of PCS notification.
         2.15.6.2.2. Associate, Baccalaureate, and Graduate Degree Programs. Enlisted
         airmen enrolled in programs leading to award of a degree may be deferred from PCS
         if they can complete the degree and any required academic residency in 12 months or
         less. FTA must be obligated for a total of six years active service to apply for a 12
         month deferment. Airmen selected for an assignment may request a change of
         RNLTD for a period not to exceed three months from the month of PCS notification
         in order to complete a course in which presently enrolled. Deferments approved
         under this provision are not to exceed the course completion date.
     2.15.6.3. Officers and Enlisted. Airmen request deferment through the local Education
     Services Officer (ESO). If approved, the ESO sends the deferment request to the MPS
     for update in MilPDS. For officers, the MPS updates MilPDS and awaits decision by the
     assignment OPR. For enlisted, the MPS approves requests meeting program guidelines
     and updates the educational deferment AAC (52) in MilPDS. The MPS must not update
     an AAC 52 for enlisted Airmen currently serving on an AAC 50 (maximum stabilized
     tour) without prior approval by the assignment OPR. Questionable cases should be
     forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for resolution. Consecutive education deferments are not
     permitted nor is a subsequent deferment effective within 12 months of a previously
     completed program. An Airman is not granted additional deferment time to retake tests
     or courses failed.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     41


     2.15.6.4. Educational Leave of Absence (ELA). Airmen must meet the criteria in AFI
     36-2306, The Education Services Program. For approved requests, the TDY order is
     used as the source document for update of AAC 52 and may be input by the MPS upon
     receipt. The deferment period may not exceed the period of TDY authorized. Airmen
     with an ASD are ineligible.
  2.15.7. Stabilized Tour Deferment. The mission or function of some organizations require
  the AF to manage an Airman’s period of assignment more closely than would be realized by
  normal attrition and TOS requirements. A list of activities, organizations, or positions
  authorized stabilized tours is maintained and continually updated by HQ AFPC/DPAPP in
  the Stabilized Tour Guide. The Stabilized Tour Guide can be accessed online at
  http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AssignProc/. Stabilized tour deferment is not authorized
  for Airmen assigned OS. The stabilized tour deferment may be waived or an activity may be
  terminated when it no longer serves the overall best interest of the AF. For management
  purposes, stabilized tours are divided into two major groups, maximum and minimum tours.
     2.15.7.1. Maximum Tours. A maximum tour identifies the maximum period of time an
     Airman will be assigned to a particular duty and/or organization, unless an extension is
     approved. The reasons vary why the period of assignment should not exceed the initial
     deferment period. For example, the duty may be outside the mainstream of an Airman’s
     primary career field and prolonged assignment is undesirable.
     2.15.7.2. Minimum Tours. A minimum tour identifies the minimum period of time an
     Airman will be assigned to a particular duty and/or organization, but longer assignment is
     authorized. Extension of a minimum tour deferment is not required. After expiration of
     the initial deferment, an Airman remains assigned until selected for another assignment.
     The reasons for a minimum tour vary. For example, a minimum tour may be necessary to
     receive pay back for special training (formal or on-the-job), for experience gained, and so
     on.
     2.15.7.3. Joint Qualification System (JQS). Statutory changes in the John Warner
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (NDAA 07) directed the
     Secretary of Defense to establish different levels of joint qualification, as well as, criteria
     for qualification at each level. The new JQS meets this direction by acknowledging joint
     experiences and establishing an additional path to accumulate joint credit. This credit is
     based on validated joint experiences that are not captured when assigned to a JDAL
     position. Under the JQS, an approved Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) position is
     now known as a Standard Joint Duty Assignment (S-JDA). Joint credit is accrued based
     on time served in a JDAL position in accordance with SecDef time in position rules.
     Non-JDAL positions or venues through which an officer demonstrates attainment of
     knowledge, skills, and abilities in joint matters are considered experienced-based joint
     duty assignments (E-JDAs). E-JDA credit is accrued via a self nomination process that
     an officer must complete after they leave the position. E-JDA credit takes into account
     the intensity of where an officer works in the joint environment.
         2.15.7.3.1. The JQS also introduces a point accrual formula, establishes four
         qualification levels that encompass joint experience from grade O-1 to O-10, and
         provides the opportunity for reserve (RC) officers to earn joint duty credit, experience
         points, and joint qualification levels. (NOTE: Please refer to the HQ AFPC/DPAPPO
42                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


        Personnel Service Delivery (PSD) Guide for S- JDA rules and procedures as well as
        step-by-step instructions on how to self-nominate for E-JDA credit. The guide can be
        accessed via the AFPC homepage).
        2.15.7.3.2. The JQS acknowledges accrued joint experiences but is not intended to
        replace assignments to an S-JDA position on the JDAL. S-JDA joint credit is still the
        primary means of achieving joint experience and joint duty credit. The Air Force is
        responsible for ensuring quality force standards are applied when nominating officers
        to be assigned to S-JDAs on the JDAL.
        2.15.7.3.3. HQ AFPC/DPAPPO provides policy and guidance on joint officer
        matters. This office is the liaison between AFPC assignment OPRs, Joint Chiefs of
        Staff J1 offices, the Air Staff, and OSD. Only officers possessing demonstrated
        qualities of high personal and professional competence are assigned to a designated
        S-JDA position. Selection for S-JDA duty will be determined by qualifications the
        officer possesses to perform the required duty. Only Joint Qualified Officers (JQO)
        will be assigned to Critical JDA positions, unless waived by OSD.
        2.15.7.3.4. The tour of duty for officers assigned to S-JDA positions, as designated
        by SecDef, for general officers is 2 years and 3 years for all other officers, unless
        otherwise specified by DOD policy or JDAL tour length.
        2.15.7.3.5. Overseas Tours. Officers must serve the accompanied-by-dependents
        tour in order to receive full S-JDA joint credit. Only those tours that are at least 2
        years may be designated as full credit overseas S-JDAs. Officers who serve the
        unaccompanied-by-dependents tour length that are 2 years or less receives cumulative
        credit.
        2.15.7.3.6. Early release waivers from a designated S-JDA position, whether
        requested by the officer or the Air Force, must be coordinated with the joint
        organization and HQ AFPC/DPAPPO. (NOTE: Please refer to CJCSI 1330.05,
        Enclosure J, Tour Length Requirement and Early Releases, for specific guidance and
        policy).
        2.15.7.3.7. Critical Occupation Specialty (COS). Early departure from a S-JDA by
        an officer with a COS AFSC (11XX, 12XX, 13XX) may be authorized when an
        officer is selected for a command assignment, Professional Military Education, career
        milestone assignment, or for return to duty in their COS. COS officers must serve a
        minimum of 22 months in order to receive full joint duty credit. In this case, a JDAL
        early release waiver is not required.
        2.15.7.3.8. Cumulative Joint Tour. Officers may combine awarded cumulative joint
        credit, not previously used, to accumulate a full tour of duty to a current JDAL tour in
        order to achieve enough time for award of a full tour.
     2.15.7.4. Enlisted MAJCOM Headquarters Tours. CONUS MAJCOM headquarters and
     staff elements are authorized three year minimum stabilized tours (AAC 44) for assigned
     personnel. Airmen not vulnerable for OS PCS selection may be assigned (PCA w/o PCS)
     to a MAJCOM headquarters on the same base without prior HQ AFPC approval. CMSgt
     authorizations are three year maximum tours. Deferment is not authorized for Airmen
     assigned in excess of 100 percent of manpower authorizations.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 43


  2.15.8. Stabilized Tour Assignment, Curtailment, Extension, and Completion.
     2.15.8.1. Stabilized Tour Assignment. A stabilized tour assignment and the
     accompanying deferment begin on the date an Airman is assigned to the unit or function
     authorized a stabilized tour. The date of assignment may or may not be the same as the
     date arrived on station. See paragraph 2.15.2 when assignment to a stabilized tour is
     proposed after an Airman’s arrival on station. Training during a stabilized tour, TDY, or
     other absences from duty do not change the tour completion date. TDY en route is not
     part of the tour.
     2.15.8.2. Stabilized Tour Curtailment.        An Airman may submit stabilized tour
     curtailment requests to the unit commander. If the unit commander recommends
     approval, it is forwarded to the activity commander for consideration. If supported by the
     activity commander, the request is sent through the appropriate assignment OPR for
     consideration. Unit/activity commanders and MAJCOMs have disapproval authority for
     any curtailment request initiated at a lower level. Airmen may not seek curtailment for
     the purpose of applying for a specific job. Unit and activity commanders may also
     request curtailment of stabilized tours (and reassignment) for Airmen assigned to
     organizations they command. The request must contain the facts and circumstances and
     specify whether concurrent PCS is requested in conjunction with tour curtailment. A
     request for PCS must include any necessary waivers of PCS eligibility criteria and
     originate at the appropriate level. In cases involving quality issues, curtailment and PCS
     are not effected until appropriate administrative or disciplinary action has been taken
     (unless an exception to policy is justified). When Airmen are curtailed (for any reason),
     they are subject to selection for any assignment for which eligible.
     2.15.8.3. Stabilized Tour Extension (Maximum Tours Only). An Airman may request
     voluntary extension to a stabilized tour no earlier than 15 months prior to tour completion
     and not later than an established ASD. The period of extension will normally not exceed
     12 months. Unit commanders and parent MAJCOMs (or equivalent) have disapproval
     authority. Commanders of activities subordinate to a MAJCOM determine if their field
     commanders may submit extension requests directly to the MAJCOM. When approval is
     recommended, the request is sent to the assignment OPR for consideration. Tour
     extensions do not apply to minimum tours.
     2.15.8.4. Stabilized Tour Completion. Actions taken upon completion of a stabilized
     tour vary depending on the type of tour served:
         2.15.8.4.1. Upon completion of a minimum tour an Airman remains assigned until
         selected for voluntary or involuntary reassignment. The local commander or parent
         MAJCOM should establish procedures to periodically review the status of Airmen
         who have completed their minimum tour to ensure continued assignment serves the
         overall best interest of the AF. Recommendations to reassign an Airman must be fully
         justified and based on a requirement for fresh expertise, job stress or personal
         hardships. Reassignment is not justified based on an arbitrary period of time.
         2.15.8.4.2. When completing a maximum tour, an Airman is considered to be in a
         mandatory move status (either to another unit on the same station or PCS) and is
         normally reassigned upon completion of the initial tour, unless extended. A request
         to extend a maximum tour is submitted as provided in paragraph 2.15.8.3. Officers
44                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


        are reassigned during the assignment cycle coinciding with their DOA; enlisted
        airmen are considered CONUS mandatory movers and compete for reassignment via
        the EQUAL process (see Attachment 16).
            2.15.8.4.2.1. CONUS Mandatory Mover requirements are advertised on the
            Overseas Returnee (OSR)/CONUS Mandatory Mover’s (CMM) EQUAL.
            Exceptions include individuals assigned as Field Training Detachment (FTD)
            Instructors, aircrew personnel (1AXXX AFSCs) 820th Security Forces Group
            (3P0X1s only), and those assigned to the USAF Air Demonstration Squadron
            (Nellis AFB NV). MPS’ will run a monthly AAC 50 roster 13 months in advance
            of the projected DOA expiration dates and provide a copy of the Maximum Tour
            Completion Counseling handout to each member (Attachment 16).
        2.15.8.4.3. An Airman assigned to a MAJCOM Inspector General travel team,
        performing inspection duty is normally assigned other duties after 24 months.
        Reassignment is first considered within the MAJCOM headquarters or to another unit
        on the same base. PCS may be considered when the Airman is the most eligible for
        PCS among others assigned to the same base. A request for extension of travel team
        inspection duty will be favorably considered unless there are overriding reasons why
        extension does not serve the best overall interest of the AF. Airmen are not normally
        assigned involuntarily to travel team inspection duty within the 3 year period
        following a previous assignment to such duty. Exceptions must be approved by HQ
        AFPC/DPAPP.
     2.15.8.5. (Enlisted Only) Minimum Tours in a Special Duty Identifier (SDI). In most
     cases, duties of an SDI are unrelated to an enlisted Airman's PAFSC. Enlisted Airmen
     are not normally retained in these duties for an extended period of time after completion
     of a minimum stabilized tour. To preclude loss of AFSC proficiency, it is necessary to
     monitor the length of assignment in SDI tours and consecutive assignments in SDIs are
     not appropriate.
        2.15.8.5.1. Enlisted Airmen performing duty in an SDI may be authorized
        assignment deferment if their unit of assignment is listed in the stabilized tour guide.
        Normally duty in an SDI does not, in itself, automatically involve deferment from
        reassignment, although in some instances all authorizations in a particular SDI may
        be in units authorized stabilized tours.
        2.15.8.5.2. Approximately 12 months before their DOA, Airmen receive a system
        generated RIP notification with two options: volunteer for reassignment to return to
        duty in their PAFSC in conjunction with completion of the stabilized tour or continue
        serving in the SDI.
            2.15.8.5.2.1. Enlisted Airmen choosing to be reassigned will receive enhanced
            consideration for an OS assignment consistent with their OS volunteer status and
            vulnerability. If not matched to an OS requirement, they will be considered for
            assignment to a unit on the current duty station, or reassigned to a CONUS
            assignment through the EQUAL process (see Attachment 16).
            2.15.8.5.2.2. . Enlisted Airmen may choose to remain assigned to their present
            duties and location upon completion of their initial minimum tour if they do not
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    45


               desire reassignment and AF requirements do not dictate reassignment. When an
               Airman desires to return to their PAFSC, notify the MPS (with Unit CC
               endorsement) at least 12 months in advance to requested reassignment date. This
               date is the earliest they can normally expect to move; however, AF requirements
               could dictate shorter assignment notification.
           2.15.8.5.3. Until an enlisted Airman is reassigned out of the SDI, the AAC and
           expired DOA of the initial stabilized tour period remains in the PDS. The expired
           date is used to generate an automated notification on the anniversary of completion of
           the initial minimum stabilized tour period. This automated anniversary notification
           reiterates the Airman’s options and require commander’s endorsement.
           2.15.8.5.4. A copy of the automated notification with Airman’s election (initial or
           anniversary) is maintained in the PIF until the Airman is reassigned or until it is
           superseded by a subsequent automated notification.
   2.15.8. High School Seniors Assignment Deferment (HSSAD) Program. The HSSAD
   program is intended to decrease turbulence and increase stability for military families with
   dependent children entering their senior year of high school. This policy applies to active
   duty officers (LtCol and below) and enlisted (SMSgt and below). If approved, this program
   defers an Airman from reassignment while the high school dependent is in their senior year
   of high school. The DOA is the 1st day of the 2nd month after dependent’s graduation date or
   Airman’s DEROS. See Attachment 7 for processing instructions.
2.16. Assignment Limitation Code (ALC). Assignment limitations, permanent or
semipermanent, are used to alert personnel managers of long term constraints on assignment or
utilization of Airmen. They broadly restrict, or limit the selection of Airmen for assignment to or
from certain duties or areas and apply to a duration longer than just to the current duty
assignment. Normally, limitations applying only to a current assignment or location are
managed by an AAC, although exceptions to use an ALC may be made. An ALC may be
permanent or semi-permanent. Table 2.2 lists the various types of assignment limitations and
corresponding system update codes. ALC waivers require the advance approval of HQ
AFPC/DPAPP unless Table 2.2 lists a specific OPR.
2.17. Medical Deferment or Limitation. Worldwide commitments require every Airman to be
physically qualified for immediate global deployment, except as indicated below.
   2.17.1. Temporary Medical Deferment. An Airman may be deferred from PCS or TDY
   when a temporary medical condition (expected to last less than 12 months) prevents
   worldwide service When an authorized official at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF)
   updates a temporary medical deferment, an automatic interface with MilPDS will process an
   AAC "31" (see Table 2.1) update if the availability date is 30 calendar days or more from the
   date of the AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Conditions Report. Deferments of less than 30
   calendar days will not authorize an AAC 31. The availability date will not exceed and will
   not be extended beyond 12 months from the date when the underlying defect was deemed, or
   clearly should have been deemed, disqualifying for worldwide duty (AFI 48-123). When an
   Airman is scheduled for a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1) while temporarily medically
   deferred from PCS, MTF officials determine if the Airman will proceed on PCS and can be
   evaluated and/or treated upon arrival at the next duty station, or whether the Airman must be
   evaluated and/or treated at current station. If the MTF determines the Airman must be
 46                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   evaluated at the current location, the MPS will reclama the assignment (see paragraph 2.46)
   upon written notification. The assignment OPR may request assistance from HQ
   AFPC/DPAMM, Medical Standards Branch, to determine the appropriate assignment action
   based on the medical circumstances.
   2.17.2. Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) and Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) Deferment.
   MTFs submit an AF Form 469 on airmen with physical limitations not of a temporary nature,
   that interfere with World Wide assignability, to indicate an MEB (which could result in a
   disability retirement or separation) is being processed. The automatic MiPDS interface
   updates an AAC 37. If the Airman’s personnel record reflects an AAC 31, Medical
   Deferment, the AAC will automatically be removed and replaced with AAC 37, Medical
   Evaluation Board (MEB) or Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) (see Table 2.1). Per AFI 36-
   3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement and Separations, and AFPD 41-1, an
   Airman pending an MEB or PEB may not be reassigned PCS or TDY (or granted leave
   outside the local area, separated, or retired) until the MTF determines the medical
   disposition. If circumstances arise regarding the assignment status of an Airman pending an
   MEB or PEB, (for example, for an Airman serving OS it appears the DEROS will expire
   before a final determination is made), the MPS will advise the assignment OPR by message
   and provide complete details. The MPS will provide an information copy to HQ
   AFPC/DPAMM and HQ AFPC/DPAPP. Guidance will be provided as appropriate. NOTE:
   An AAC 31 or 37 does not preclude an Airman from separating or retiring; these personnel
   actions must be monitored by other means. DEROS will not be involuntarily extended for
   medical reasons. When appropriate medical authority determines an Airman is not medically
   cleared for PCS, and AAC 31 or 37 is updated, the airman is directed to remain in place and
   the DEROS will be allowed to expire. When Airmen are medically cleared for PCS near or
   after their DEROS, the MPS advises the assignment OPR, with information copy to HQ
   AFPC/DPAMM and HQ AFPC/DPAPP, of the circumstances and requests assignment
   disposition.
   2.17.3. Medical Assignment Limitation Code (ALC) "C" Stratification. When a PEB directs
   an Airman to remain on active duty, who may not be fully qualified for World Wide service,
   the AF must carefully manage future assignments. In such cases, HQ AFPC/DPAMM will
   input and manage ALC "X, ―Y, or ―C" (see Table 2.2) as appropriate. The assignment OPR
   may select Airmen with medical ALCs for reassignment to locations permitted by their
   stratification as specified in AFI 41-210, Patient Administrative Functions. Assignments or
   deployments outside the designated geographic restrictions require a waiver. Waiver
   authority and procedures are also designated in AFI 41-210. If the Airman’s medical
   circumstances preclude the assignment, the assignment OPR selects the next most eligible
   Airman for the assignment.
2.18. Officers Not Selected for Promotion.
   2.18.1. Lieutenant Colonels Not Selected for Promotion to Colonel. Selection for promotion
   to colonel is the result of an extremely competitive process nonselection for promotion to
   colonel is normally not a basis for PCS ineligibility. Senior managers must use this highly
   qualified resource to the best advantage of the AF in positions commensurate with their grade
   and qualifications. Keep in mind, the mandatory retirement date a lieutenant colonel receives
   based on grade may preclude consideration for some assignments (lack of the required
   retainability for PCS and/or retainability to serve the associated ADSC).
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     47


  2.18.2. Officers Not Selected for Promotion to Lieutenant Colonel or Major. Nonselection
  for promotion to lieutenant colonel or major does not, in itself, render an Airman ineligible
  for PCS. However, nonselection for promotion can affect consideration for PCS or other
  events as explained below.
     2.18.2.1. Officers in the grade of major or captain with an established DOS or mandatory
     retirement date based on nonselection for promotion are ineligible for a PCS if lacking
     required retainability for the assignment action. Approved waiver/exception to policy
     actions is required for movement when an officer does not meet minimum PCS
     retainability requirements. See paragraph 2.29 for additional guidance on retainability.
     2.18.2.2. Officers in the grades of major or captain not selected for promotion to the next
     higher grade may be considered for PCS or other events if they have the minimum
     retainability (that is, have not had a mandatory DOS or retirement date established and
     still have an indefinite DOS). However, when it cannot be assured the AF will receive
     full return in terms of service for PCS funds, education or training costs, etc., (for
     example, in the event of a second nonselection for promotion resulting in establishment
     of a mandatory DOS or mandatory retirement date), selection must be kept to an absolute
     minimum. Therefore, nonselection for promotion can affect consideration for PCS or
     other events based on the resulting limit on retainability or potential limit on retainability.
  2.18.3. Officers Selected For or En Route to an Event. When an officer is not selected for
  promotion, the officer's status must be quickly evaluated by the assignment OPR. This
  includes officers scheduled for an event such as PCS, education or training (that is, officer
  has a DEROS, will PCS upon completion of training, etc.); those selected for PCS, education
  or training (including those who have departed); and those attending such events (for
  example, TDY and return) in conjunction with PCS. The officer’s supervisor, losing/gaining
  commanders, and MPS share the responsibility to assist the assignment OPR or selection
  authority in identifying officers selected for PCS or other events when nonselected for
  promotion. The losing commander will reclama (see paragraph 2.46) to the assignment
  OPR/selection authority and request disposition instructions. The reclama must include: (1)
  date notified of nonselection, (2) if the officer has departed, (3) if cancellation will create a
  hardship, the basis for the hardship and how it is considered to be uncommon to others in
  similar circumstances, (4) status of shipment of HHG, (5) location of dependents, (6)
  officer's desires, and (7) any other pertinent details. The assignment OPR/selection authority
  will review each case and provide assignment disposition to the officer and MPS. NOTE:
  Officers completing an OS tour without the minimum PCS retainability for a CONUS
  assignment may be extended in place depending on their accompanied status, their DEROS,
  and other factors.
  2.18.4. Other Circumstances. Officers selected for PCS, formal education, or training who
  subsequently have their promotion delayed (includes officers delayed pending removal from
  a promotion list), and officers found not qualified for promotion to first lieutenant, require
  reevaluation. The commander must reclama (see paragraph 2.46) the selection to the
  assignment OPR providing all pertinent information. The assignment OPR will provide
  assignment disposition by email message...

2.19. Dependent Care. All Airmen must ensure care of their dependents when separated due to
TDY or PCS. Airmen who cannot or will not meet military commitments due to family needs
are considered for discharge.
   2.19.1. Military Couples with Dependents and Single Airmen Sponsors. Military couples
   with dependents and single Airmen sponsors are expected to fulfill their military obligations
   on the same basis as other Airmen in the AF. They are eligible for worldwide duty and all
   assignments for which they qualify including TDY or PCS to imminent danger or hostile fire
   areas. To ensure military couples with dependents and single Airmen sponsors are available
   for worldwide duty, they must have workable plans to provide parent-like care for their
   dependents when the requirements of military service require separation from their
   dependents. Dependent care plan requirements are prescribed by AFI 36-2908, Family Care
   Plans. When an Airman has a questionable dependent care plan, commanders will require
   the Airman to develop a workable plan. To assist, commanders may consider approving
   leave for the Airman and, as necessary, direct the Airman to receive counseling on the
   criteria for humanitarian deferment or reassignment, or hardship discharge depending on the
   duration and severity of the problem. If the Airman cannot or will not develop an adequate
   dependent care plan, the commander will process the Airman for discharge IAW applicable
   directives or, if eligible, may be given an opportunity to apply for immediate retirement.
   2.19.2. Airmen Adopting Children.
       2.19.2.1. Airmen may be authorized deferment from PCS or TDY after a child is
       officially placed in the home as part of the official adoption process. A single Airman
       sponsor or one Airman of a military couple may request up to a 6-month deferment from
       assignment to an OS location if concurrent travel is denied (regardless of the tour length),
       or where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18 months and is not permitted to
       serve the accompanied by dependents tour. The intent is to avoid involuntary separation
       of the Airman and child to facilitate bonding. When a child has been in the Airman’s
       home for some time prior to the official adoption process or a bonding period is not
       necessary for other reasons, the Airman may decide not to request a 6-month deferment.
       As necessary, counsel the Airman on humanitarian assignment or deferment options as
       outlined in Attachment 24. This 6-month deferment is separate from any other
       humanitarian deferment the Airman may be granted in connection with adoption.
       2.19.2.2. Airmen who qualify for and desire the 6-month deferment must provide a
       statement from adoption authorities, endorsed by the unit commander, confirming the
       date the Airman initiated formal adoption proceedings and the date the child was
       officially placed in the Airman’s home incident to the adoption application.
       Commanders may request assistance from the servicing legal office if any question exists
       on the adequacy of the statement or eligibility of an Airman under this paragraph.
       Deferments are not approved in advance of placement of a child in the Airman’s home as
       described above.
       2.19.2.3. The MPS updates assignment limitation code ―A‖, Post Delivery
       Deferment/Adoption Deferment (see Table 2.2) upon Commander (or designated
       representative) approval. The Airman’s deployment availability code (DAC) is
       automatically updated based on the assignment limitation code "An" update.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  49


2.20. Assignment of Family Members to Command or Supervisory Positions. Assignment
of family members to the same duty location or unit is not prohibited, however, family members
will not be assigned where one member will or may hold a command or supervisory position
over another family member. Such assignments result in, or may create a perception of,
preferential treatment or loss of impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of command
and supervisory functions. Family member is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, or child.
Relationships other than command and supervisory (for example, an Airman has court martial
jurisdiction over a family member), and other circumstances (such as command or supervision
over a former spouse) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. For additional family member
assignment considerations, see Attachments 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 24 and 25.
   2.20.1. Resolve situations at base level, if possible. When both Airmen hold an AFSC
   requiring placement in the same unit or function, the unit commander working with the
   assignment OPR initiates action to reassign one Airman to another unit or function on base in
   an additional AFSC. If neither Airman possesses an additional AFSC, submit a request for
   assignment disposition as outlined below. When a question of propriety of assignment in
   circumstances other than those outlined herein exists, the case may be forwarded for
   consideration as an exception. Send the case to HQ AFPC/DPAP and include the following
   information:
       2.20.1.1. Grade, name, and SSN of Airmen involved.
       2.20.1.2. Family relationship.
       2.20.1.3. Circumstances that resulted in the command or supervision of one family
       member by another (marriage, join spouse, humanitarian/EFMP assignment, school
       assignment, and so on).
       2.20.1.4. Efforts to resolve the case at base level.
       2.20.1.5. Recommendation of local commander.
       2.20.1.6. Each Airman’s PCS volunteer status and location preferences.
2.21. Join Spouse (Officer/Enlisted) PCS Considerations. Military couples consisting of an
officer and enlisted member receive assignment consideration primarily based on the officer’s
utilization. For PCS considerations where both Airmen are officers or both are enlisted,
utilization is determined on a case-by-case basis based on the needs of the AF. Exceptions may
be considered on a case-by-case basis per paragraph 1.5.
2.22. First Assignment after Commissioning (From Enlisted Status). Officers commissioned
from enlisted status are not reassigned back to the base they departed from for their first
assignment. Such an assignment, however, is permitted when the Airman is in a formal student
status. For example, if an enlisted Airman stationed at Base A becomes a commissioned officer,
he or she will not be assigned back to Base A for their first permanent party assignment after
commissioning. This does not preclude assignment as a student if Base A also happens to be the
training location for initial skill training for the officer’s specialty.
2.23. Assignment of Former Officers. Former officers who enlist may remain assigned to the
same permanent duty station to which they were assigned immediately prior to enlistment if
there is a requirement for their grade/AFSC, and other assignment considerations support
continued assignment.
 50                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


2.24. Soliciting an Assignment. Airmen should not solicit reassignment, other than via
voluntary PCS applications and requests authorized by this instruction or other AF instructions;
an Airman’s assignment preference statement; or response to a request for volunteers for a
specific requirement. This does not preclude an Airman from inquiring about their assignment
status through authorized inquiry channels. Although a status may be provided, an Airman’s
relative standing as a volunteer or non-volunteer amongst others is normally not given.
2.25. Time on Station (TOS) Requirements. The purpose of a minimum TOS requirement is
to enhance operational readiness by stabilizing Airmen at their current location, to reduce PCS
costs, and to improve the quality of life of Airmen and their dependents by reducing personal and
family turbulence. Table 2.3 reflects the minimum TOS requirements for PCS and certain
inplace actions. See paragraph 2.26 for guidance on PCS departure date. EXCEPTION: For
officer JDA assignments, the minimum TOS to receive full JDA tour credit is computed
differently than normal TOS (JDA time is computed to the exact day). For example, if DAS is
15 Jan 2004 and the TOS minimum is 3 years, then officer meets the minimum on 14 Jan 2007.
   2.25.1. TOS is computed on a month-to-month basis; not on the number of days. Compute
   TOS by adding the required period to the month and year of date arrived station (DAS).
   EXAMPLE: If DAS is any day of the month in Jan 2008 and the TOS minimum is 4 years,
   then Jan 2008 counts as the first month. The Airman meets the 3 year TOS minimum on 1
   Jan 2012. For all PCS moves, the TOS requirement must have been met by the departure
   date, unless a waiver or an exception has been approved. When an Airman has TDY en route
   in conjunction with a PCS, the minimum TOS requirement must be met prior to departure on
   TDY.
   2.25.2. For CONUS to CONUS PCS, when multiple Airmen meet required assignment
   qualifications, the Airman with the longest TOS should be selected when there are no other
   overriding considerations. An example of an overriding consideration would be the goal to
   equitably distribute OS assignments. When an Airman who has the longest TOS is also
   vulnerable for involuntary OS assignment, then OS vulnerability would override the fact the
   Airman also has the longest TOS. Another example of an overriding consideration is if
   selection of the Airman with the longest TOS would require backfill and generate an
   additional CONUS to CONUS PCS of similar urgency. Also see paragraph 2.10, Volunteer
   Status and PCS Eligibility.
   2.25.3. Waivers may be requested on a case-by-case basis as prescribed in paragraph 1.4. A
   TOS waiver must be requested by a general or flag officer or equivalent Federal civilian
   grade (including officers of the Foreign Service of the Department of State), or a colonel in a
   wing commander position, or equivalent. (Equivalent is defined as a person, military or
   civilian, designated as a senior rater and serving in the grade of colonel or higher, or
   equivalent civilian grade.) Requesters must be serving in the prescribed military rank or
   civilian grade (for example, the requester cannot be a lieutenant colonel selected for colonel).
   Requests for exceptions, including those which require a waiver, may be submitted on a case-
   by-case basis as prescribed in paragraph 1.5.
2.26. PCS Departure Date and Port Call Date. An Airman’s PCS departure date is
determined according to Table 2.4 and the instructions below. For planning purposes only, the
assignment OPR includes in each PCS selection a projected departure date (PDD). When the
actual PCS departure date is determined and approved by the Airman’s commander (or
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     51


designated official), the date is entered into the PDS and overrides the original PDD. The timing
of PCS departure in relation to the RNLTD, a TDY en route reporting date, training class start
date, port reporting date (if applicable) and the amount of travel time authorized or used
determines how much leave an Airman will be charged in connection with the PCS. When a
course of instruction is involved, see paragraph 2.26.5 and Table 4.1. Compliance with the
RNLTD, port reporting date, or other reporting dates (whether they are not later than dates or not
earlier than dates) is mandatory. Airmen must carefully plan their departure date, travel and
leave so they will not be charged with unwanted leave or incur unexpected expenses while
waiting to report as directed. Airmen reporting contrary to instructions may be allowed to
terminate their leave status; however, could be subject to disciplinary action for failure to comply
with their reporting instructions.
   2.26.1. For CONUS to CONUS PCS. To determine the PCS departure date, subtract the
   number of days leave the commander approves, maximum allowable travel time, and any
   other period the Airman may be authorized en route from the RNLTD. When an Airman has
   TDY en route, also subtract the number of days TDY. Airmen must meet the minimum TOS
   for PCS before the departure date. When TDY en route is involved, then the minimum TOS
   must be met before departure on TDY. At the commander's discretion, an Airman may be
   allowed to depart up to a maximum of 60 days prior to RNLTD, provided the Airman meets
   the minimum TOS for PCS. Airmen are not permitted to depart earlier than 60 days prior to
   the RNLTD without prior approval of the assignment OPR (except as authorized in Table
   2.4, rule 7). Approval by the assignment OPR will be in the form of a change to the RNLTD
   which, in turn, changes the earliest date the Airman can depart. The change of RNLTD will
   also reset PCS-related suspense flags and assist the MPS in monitoring processing for PCS.
   EXAMPLE: If an RNLTD is 31 Dec 2007 (Julian date of 365) and the Airman requests 30
   days leave en route and is authorized 7 days travel time, then subtract 37 from 365 which
   equals a Julian date of 328 (or 24 Nov 2007). The PCS departure date is 24 Nov 2007.
   Commanders may permit Airmen to depart up to 60 days prior to the RNLTD provided on
   that date the Airman meets the minimum TOS for PCS. To compute the maximum earliest
   departure date authorized without an RNLTD change, subtract 60 from the Julian date of 365
   (31 Dec 2007) which is Julian date 305, or 1 Nov 2007. However, in this example, if the
   Airman had a DAS in Dec 2004 then he or she would be restricted to a departure date of not
   earlier than 1 Dec 2007, the date minimum TOS is satisfied.
   2.26.2. For CONUS to OS PCS. Use the procedure above to initially determine the
   departure date and confirm the Airman meets the minimum TOS requirement. Airmen are
   not permitted to depart on PCS without a firm port call. The Airman requests flight
   reservations (port call) from the Transportation Management Office (TMO) as outlined in
   AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures. A firm port call date can be used (in lieu of
   the RNLTD) to compute a more accurate departure date. The 60 day maximum window
   before the RNLTD is normally adequate to accommodate the departure date the Airman
   desires in relation to the port call date received. Airmen will not request, and TMOs will not
   schedule, an Airman’s port call earlier than the first day of the RNLTD month, unless the
   Airman has leave in an OS area approved by the commander per AFI 36-3003, Military
   Leave Program and the leave authorization and leave address are included in PCS orders.
   Flight reservations must ensure the Airman will be in place at the OS duty station on or
   before the RNLTD. Flight reservations where an Airman departs on the RNLTD are
52                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  acceptable if the scheduled transportation provides for the Airman’s arrival at the OS duty
  station on the RNLTD. The TMO may schedule an Airman’s port call on any day during the
  reporting month which meets the RNLTD. For example, if an RNLTD is 10 Jun 2008 a port
  call date of 31 May 2008 is not acceptable (earlier than the first day of the RNLTD month)
  nor reservations departing the on 10 Jun and arriving on 11 Jun (Airman would arrive later
  than required reporting date). If an RNLTD is 30 Jun 2008, the Airman may state a
  preference for movement during the 10 day window of 21-30 Jun 2008; however, it may not
  be possible to provide transportation during the preferred period. TMO may provide a port
  call date such as 12 Jun 2008 to satisfy transportation schedules and reporting date policies.
  2.26.3. For PCS OS to CONUS. The PCS departure date must be within the Airman’s
  DEROS month (unless the DEROS was allowed to expire due to the Airman being on
  international hold, in confinement, or not being medically qualified for assignment). A
  departure date prior to the DEROS month requires an approved OS tour curtailment;
  departure after the DEROS month requires an extension of OS tour, unless the Airman is
  authorized leave in the OS area and the leave is authorized in PCS orders. With a unit
  commander's concurrence, MPS’ may schedule an Airman for departure on any day during
  the DEROS month to ensure maximum use of transportation. Commanders may retain an
  Airman at the OS duty station up to the last day of the DEROS month for operational
  reasons. When PCS is to a course of instruction, see paragraph 2.26.5.
  2.26.4. For PCS OS to OS. The PCS departure date must be within the Airman’s DEROS
  month. A departure date prior to the DEROS month requires an approved OS tour
  curtailment; departure after the DEROS month requires an extension of OS tour, unless the
  Airman is authorized leave in the OS area and the leave is authorized in PCS orders. The
  port call for PCS travel to the new OS duty station cannot be earlier than the first day of the
  RNLTD month unless the Airman has approved leave in the OS area or deferred COT leave.
  To comply with these requirements may require adjustment of departure within the DEROS
  month, extension or curtailment of DEROS month, and/or change of the RNLTD depending
  on the amount of leave the Airman desires en route and other variables. MPS’ may request
  extension or curtailment of DEROS in such cases directly to the assignment OPR and include
  the gaining unit of assignment. With a unit commander's concurrence, MPS’ may schedule
  an Airman for departure on any day during the DEROS month to ensure maximum use of
  transportation. Commanders may retain Airmen at the current OS duty station up to the last
  day of the DEROS month for operational reasons. When TDY en route to a course of
  instruction is involved, see paragraph 2.26.5.
  2.26.5. For PCS Involving a Course of Instruction. Also see paragraph 4.5 and Table 4.1.
  PCS or TDY en route to courses of instruction may stipulate a ―report not earlier than date,‖
  or a requirement to ―depart not later than one day after graduation.‖ Either of these
  requirements along with the limitations associated with the Airman’s DEROS, port call date,
  and/or RNLTD can result in a conflict of mandatory reporting requirements or the potential
  for an Airman having to take unwanted leave. When requirements conflict or it appears an
  Airman may be forced to take unwanted leave, the MPS will review Table 4.1 with special
  attention to the notes and, when necessary, advise the assignment OPR and include the
  Airman’s desired travel/leave arrangements and any other pertinent information. The
  assignment OPR will review the circumstances and make changes as appropriate.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                      53


   2.26.6. Officer Joint Duty Assignments. For PCS involving JDA officers, also see
   paragraph 2.15 and Table 2.4. A departure date prior to completion of the full JDA tour (to
   the day) is not authorized unless the request is coordinated through the joint organization
   (Director, J-1 or equivalent) and HQ AFPC/DPAPO. Failure to coordinate could result in the
   officer not receiving joint duty credit. If the officer is serving on a 3-year JDAL billet and
   early departure necessitates a joint tour length waiver, the losing command/agency will
   forward an early release memorandum signed by a General Officer or SES equivalent stating
   the projected departure date, departure reason, and type of joint duty credit to be awarded.
   Assignment actions or expenditure of funds can not take place until the waiver is approved.
2.27. Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD)/Report Not Earlier Than Date (RNETD).
   2.27.1. RNLTD. The RNLTD is established as outlined in Table 2.4 and IAW the following
   additional instructions. Do not deviate from these instructions or Table 2.4 without specific
   approval of the assignment OPR or approval of an exception per paragraph 1.5.
      2.27.1.1. RNLTDs are established primarily based on manning requirements. For the
      majority of assignments within the CONUS or to OS, the RNLTD is the last day of the
      requirement month. When mission essential, a reporting date earlier than the last day of
      the requirement month may be directed by the assignment OPR. For assignments OS, a
      reporting date of the 10th of the month is authorized when overlap with key or
      supervisory personnel is mission essential and incumbents will be retained until the end
      of their DEROS month. A 10th of the month RNLTD will not be established arbitrarily
      as a requirement for all personnel being assigned to an OS location, unless an exception
      has been approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP. See Table 3.9, note 3 for computation of
      DEROS if member reports prior to the RNLTD month. An RNLTD earlier than the 10th
      of the month will not be established for PCS OS unless an exception has been approved
      by HQ AFPC/ DPAPP. NOTE: An RNLTD earlier than the 10th of the month for an OS
      assignment does not allow sufficient flexibility in transportation scheduling and may
      result in having to schedule Airmen at commercial airline rates when a less costly
      military contract passenger flight a few days later could have been used.
      2.27.1.2. TMOs schedule Airmen so they are in place at their OS duty station by the
      established RNLTD. See paragraph 2.26.
      2.27.1.3. OS RNLTDs are not established between 20 Dec and 5 Jan of the following
      year, unless there are overriding military considerations. The fact that an Airman does
      not object or wants to travel during this period is not a factor. A fewer than normal
      number of military passenger flights are scheduled during this period increasing the
      likelihood of having to support PCS travel via civilian commercial airlines. In addition to
      being more costly, it is often difficult to obtain civilian reservations as flights during this
      period are booked so far in advance. Airmen can also encounter severe problems in
      securing civilian air travel to their port of departure.
   2.27.2. RNETD. An RNETD may be directed and will be included by the MPS in PCS
   orders when it is essential that an Airman not arrive at a TDY or PCS location earlier than the
   established date. An RNETD may be necessary for a variety of reasons such as quarters may
   not exist sooner, or unnecessary costs to the government and/or member may result when
   members arrive early. Similar to an RNLTD, Airmen who arrive earlier than the established
   RNETD are not in compliance with their written orders. Therefore, it is important for
 54                                                           AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   Airmen commanders, and MPS’ to carefully manage departure from current station. To avoid
   unwanted leave and/or personal expense or hardship, Airmen should carefully plan their
   departure from current station and arrange to meet other personal and dependent
   requirements consistent with the RNETD. When Airmen indicate compliance with a RNETD
   will constitute an undue hardship or for some other reasons they desire a change or deletion
   of the RNETD, they should submit a request for change through their unit commander to the
   MPS. The MPS will use the reclama procedures shown in paragraph 2.46 to advise the
   assignment OPR and request resolution.
2.28. Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC). The ADSC serves as a personnel
management and control system to help maintain a trained and experienced force. It helps
ensure the AF receives a return in terms of active service for training, education, or PCS
movement of Airmen. The ADSC is a key element in personal and career plans. The MPS will
advise Airmen when they are selected for an ADSC-incurring event as prescribed in AFI 36-
2107, Active Duty Commitments (ADSC) and AFI 36-2133, Specified Period of Time Contracts
(SPTC). See paragraph 2.29 on retainability. Accordingly, except for PCS, officers
acknowledge or decline ADSC(s) on AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment
Acknowledgment Statement, unless otherwise prescribed in AFI 36-2107, and enlisted (with
more than 19 years service) acknowledge ADSCs on AF Form 63, but decline to obtain
retainability for an ADSC on AF Form 964. A DEROS is used to manage service commitments
for members stationed overseas in much the same way an ADSC is used to manage CONUS
assignments in ensuring the AF receives a return for the cost of a PCS move.
   2.28.1. Enlisted Airmen extending or reenlisting under the Enlisted Critical Skills Retention
   Bonus are obligated to serve in the SRB skill for the full period of extension or reenlistment.
   See AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force. As such, they will have AAC
   ―CS‖ placed on their records to preclude assignment outside of the critical skill. See Table
   2.1.
2.29. Retainability Requirements. Retainability is obligated active military service. DOD and
the AF prescribe minimum retainability requirements for PCS to ensure the AF receives
repayment for the costs associated with PCS, training, or other actions, to provide mission
continuity at the gaining unit, to provide stability to Airmen and their families after PCS, or to
satisfy some other AF requirement. In addition, the AF has established retainability
requirements for approval of certain voluntary actions which allow Airmen to remain in place.
Use this paragraph in conjunction with Table 2.5, PCS Retainability Requirements, which
establishes the minimum retainability required for most PCSs and in-place actions, and Table
2.6, Separation and Retirement Date Minimums for OS PCS Selection, which establishes the
minimum PCS retainability normally required in conjunction with OS assignments. The amount
of retainability a person has or is eligible to obtain after completion of a particular OS tour is, in
certain cases, a factor in eligibility for OS PCS. These requirements are reflected in Table 2.6
whenever applicable. The retainability policies and procedures for officers and Airmen have
many similarities, but there are significant differences. The differences are addressed below in
separate paragraphs for officers and enlisted personnel.
   2.29.1. Computing Retainability. Compute retainability on a month to month basis, not the
   actual number of days. For PCS CONUS to CONUS, CONUS to OS, and OS to OS, add the
   number of months retainability required to the RNLTD (month and year only). For example,
   if a RNLTD is any day in Jun 2008 and the retainability requirement is 24 months, then the
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   55


  person requires retainability of at least 1 Jun 2010. For PCS OS to CONUS, add the number
  of months retainability required to the Airman’s DEROS (month and year only). For
  example, if the Airman’s DEROS is any day in Sep 2008 and the retainability required is 12
  months, the person requires retainability of 1 Sep 2009, or later.
  2.29.2. Retainability Waiver or Exception. A waiver (see paragraph 1.4) or an exception
  (see paragraph 1.5) to the minimum required retainability may be requested on a case-by-
  case basis. Group or blanket waivers or exceptions will not be considered. When necessary,
  assignment OPRs may originate waivers or exceptions in order to direct the PCS of Airmen
  with less than the normal minimum required retainability. Assignment OPRs must include
  approved retainability waiver or exception to policy information in the PCS instructions.
  Failure to include this approval information in PCS instructions can delay the assignment
  process (the MPS would reclama selection of Airmen with insufficient retainability).
  Enlisted airmen may request a delay in obtaining retainability according to paragraph
  2.29.6.8.
  2.29.3. Retainability and PCS Allowances. Airmen are not permitted to use PCS allowances
  without the full prescribed PCS retainability, unless an individual retainability waiver or
  exception to policy is approved. (NOTE: As an exception, FTA retraining in conjunction
  with CAREERS attending retraining in a TDY en route status may depart on PCS and use
  allowances provided they reenlist prior to departing the training site according to the
  procedures outlined in Table 2.7, note 6). MPS’ are encouraged to withhold issuance of PCS
  orders to prevent use of PCS allowances until the Airman satisfies the retainability
  requirement; other ways are acceptable as long as they are effective. Following are some
  examples of how Airmen may be affected.
     2.29.3.1. Officers who request a follow-on PCS agree to the PCS ADSC when advised of
     selection for the follow-on PCS; however, the follow-on PCS ADSC is not normally
     updated in the Personnel Data System (PDS) until an officer arrives at the follow-on
     location. When officers use any allowances associated with a follow-on PCS, they incur
     the follow-on PCS ADSC, regardless of when the ADSC is actually updated in the PDS.
     2.29.3.2. Enlisted Airmen who desire to use PCS allowances, (for example for a COT),
     must have the full required retainability for the COT and will incur the PCS ADSC at the
     time they use allowances, regardless of when the ADSC is actually updated in the PDS.
     2.29.3.3. Enlisted Airmen (only) may request a delay in obtaining PCS retainability as
     authorized in paragraph 2.29.6.8 and Table 2.7. However, a delay may be granted only
     up to the point in time when Airmen desire to use PCS allowances. Airmen may have to
     choose or compromise between the benefit they accrue from a delay in obtaining
     retainability and their desire to use PCS allowances for which they must have full
     retainability.
  2.29.4. Retainability Requirements Longer than the PCS Minimums. Some officer and
  Airman assignments require longer retainability than the normal PCS minimum. For
  example, when an officer is assigned to a stabilized tour, the service retainability requirement
  is equal to the stabilized tour length. For an officer, consult the Stabilized Tour Guide (see
  paragraph 2.15.6) to determine if assignment is to a stabilized tour. In other instances, for
  both officers and enlisted, the assignment instructions or a PPC will identify when a longer
  retainability requirement applies. Establishment of a minimum retainability requirement
56                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  longer than normal PCS retainability requires advance approval by HQ AFPC/DPAPP.
  Airmen who refuse to satisfy the longer retainability requirement may still be assigned if the
  longer requirement is waived. Longer retainability requirements may be waived by the
  assignment authority, the assignment OPR, or gaining unit. If the longer requirement is not
  waived, the assignment will be cancelled. (An AF Form 964 is not required).
  2.29.5. Officers. Upon selection for an event such as PCS which requires an ADSC (see
  AFI 36-2107 for ADSC incurring events), the MPS will determine whether or not officers
  have or can obtain the minimum retainability. For PCS selection, see Table 2.5 and/or Table
  2.6, and/or the ADSC(s) requirement stated in the event or PCS notification. Officers
  (including non-career officers) who have an indefinite DOS are considered as having
  indefinite retainability. (See paragraph 2.18 for officers nonselected for promotion.) When
  officers have an established DOS or approved retirement date, use that date to compute
  retainability. NOTE: Expiration of an ADSC is not a DOS. Having or nearing 20 or more
  years total active federal military service (TAFMS) is not the same as an approved retirement
  date. The assignment OPR (or other authority depending on the event) will include the
  length of ADSC in the assignment transaction trailer remarks or in message notification, or
  may reference the applicable table and rule in AFI 36-2107 for computation of the ADSC by
  HQ AFPC. Officers must be informed of the ADSC for an event or PCS (see paragraph
  2.33, PCS Notification).
     2.29.5.1. For PCS or other ADSC-incurring event, the MPS will determine an officer's
     retainability status. When officers have retainability (either because they have an
     indefinite DOS, or when they have an established DOS or retirement date which satisfies
     the minimum retainability) and:
         2.29.5.1.1. Accept the PCS or event and the associated ADSC, then officers
         acknowledge selection and the MPS advises the Assignment OPR of PCS notification
         (see paragraph 2.33, PCS Notification).
         2.29.5.1.2. Want to decline the PCS, event and/or associated ADSC, and:
             2.29.5.1.2.1. Have an indefinite DOS. Then the MPS will advise the officer, that
             he or she must sign and submit a request to establish a DOS or retirement date, if
             eligible, according to the 7- day option provisions in paragraph 2.30. Officers
             who have retainability (including non-career officers) cannot simply decline a
             PCS, an event, and/or the associated ADSC, and take no other action. Officers
             who do not sign and submit an application requesting to establish a separation or
             retirement date within the prescribed timeframe according to paragraph 2.30 are
             considered to have accepted the PCS or event and the associated ADSC. An
             officer who receives an approved DOS or retirement date under 7-day option
             provisions may be directed to PCS or participate in any event for which they have
             the minimum retainability, or if the minimum retainability is waived, or
             2.29.5.1.2.2. Have an established DOS or retirement date which is greater than
             the retainability required, then they may, if eligible, request an earlier separation
             date or retirement date. A request for earlier separation or retirement must be
             submitted within 7 days of official notification of a PCS or event. The MPS will
             submit a reclama to the assignment OPR or event selection authority when an
             officer requests an earlier separation or retirement date. Officers who are
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                57


             ineligible for earlier separation or retirement may be unable to avoid proceeding
             on PCS or participating in the event. When an officer with an established DOS or
             retirement date is required to make a PCS or participate in an event which has an
             ADSC, then the ADSC will update to the officer’s records, but he or she will not
             be made to serve any ADSC which extends beyond their established DOS or
             approved retirement date. These officers would separate or retire on the
             established DOS or approved retirement date with a portion of an ADSC
             unserved.
     2.29.5.2. When officers do not have retainability and:
         2.29.5.2.1. A ccept the PCS, event, and/or ADSC but have an established voluntary
         DOS or voluntary retirement date (not a mandatory or involuntary DOS or retirement
         date) and do not have the minimum retainability, the Contact Center will assist the
         officer in determining if they are eligible to request withdrawal of their DOS
         according to AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, or eligible to request
         withdrawal of their retirement according to AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements.
         Officers who have a DOS which is the result of expiration of a SPTC may be eligible
         to execute an SPTC IAW AFI 36-2133. An officer is not permitted to execute an
         SPTC if they have an involuntary or mandatory DOS. An officer who had an
         indefinite DOS and then established a voluntary DOS or retirement date cannot elect
         to execute an SPTC. These officers must request withdrawal of their DOS or
         retirement date and, if approved, withdrawal reverts the officer back to having an
         indefinite DOS. When officers are not eligible to withdraw their DOS or retirement
         date or execute an SPTC, then the MPS will reclama the assignment selection.
         2.29.5.2.2. Want to decline the PCS, event, and/or associated ADSC. When officers
         (career or non-career) have an established DOS or retirement date and do not have the
         minimum required retainability for PCS or event, and/or do not want the associated
         ADSC, they may refuse to obtain additional retainability (without prejudice) and the
         MPS will reclama the selection. When an officer with an established DOS or
         retirement date is required to make a PCS or participate in an event which has an
         ADSC, then the ADSC will update to the officer’s records, but he or she will not be
         made to serve any ADSC which extends beyond their established DOS or approved
         retirement date. These officers would separate or retire on the established DOS or
         approved retirement date with a portion of an ADSC unserved.
  2.29.6. Enlisted Airmen. There are a number of actions prescribed by this instruction which
  have a retainability requirement. The MPS will determine if enlisted Airmen do or do not
  have the prescribed retainability; whether or not enlisted Airmen want to accept the action;
  their eligibility to obtain additional retainability or decline to obtain retainability; what
  actions enlisted Airmen must take in connection with acceptance or declination; schedule
  enlisted Airmen for completion of those actions; and follow-up to ensure completion within
  the timeframe established for a particular action. Enlisted Airmen who are eligible and
  desire to reenlist on their expiration of term of service (ETS) must not be en route PCS.
  Enlisted Airmen who want to accept a PCS but want to delay obtaining PCS retainability are
  processed according to paragraph 2.29.6.8. Delay in obtaining retainability other than for
  PCS may be requested as an exception per paragraph 1.5.
58                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     2.29.6.1. Enlisted Airmen (including FTA) who have retainability cannot refuse a PCS
     or other action, except:
        2.29.6.1.1. Enlisted Airmen eligible to request retirement under 7-day option
        provisions (see paragraph 2.30). Enlisted Airmen who request and receive an
        approved retirement date under 7- day option provisions may still be required to make
        a PCS, perform TDY, or participate in some other action depending on the amount of
        retainability they have remaining up to their actual retirement date, or
        2.29.6.1.2. When provisions exist to allow an enlisted Airman who has retainability
        to refuse a specific action. For example, an enlisted Airman requests a voluntary
        extension of OS tour and has the retainability to serve it, but after approval requests
        the extension be canceled.
     2.29.6.2. For enlisted Airmen who do not have retainability and want to obtain it, the
     MPS will determine if they are eligible and assist them reenlistment or extension of
     enlistment according to AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force.
     Retainability must be obtained within the time prescribed for the action (see paragraph
     2.29.6.4). When Airmen are temporarily ineligible or are eligible but want to delay
     obtaining retainability, the MPS will determine if the enlisted Airman meets any of the
     delay conditions outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.8 and Table 2.7. When enlisted Airmen
     need additional retainability, but are ineligible to obtain it and/or when they do not meet
     the criteria for approval of a delay, then the MPS will reclama the selection.
     2.29.6.3. For enlisted Airmen who do not have the retainability and do not want to obtain
     it, the MPS will take action for career Airmen required by paragraph 2.29.6.3.1 and
     paragraph 2.29.6.6, if applicable. For FTA, the MPS will take action required by
     paragraph 2.29.6.3.2.
        2.29.6.3.1. Career Enlisted Airmen. When career enlisted Airmen need additional
        retainability and refuse to obtain it, the MPS will formally record their declination as
        outlined in this paragraph, unless they are eligible and desire to request retirement as
        shown in paragraph 2.30. When career enlisted Airmen assigned in the CONUS
        (only) have 19 or more years total active federal military service (TAFMS) and are
        eligible to request retirement, but instead choose to decline to obtain retainability, see
        paragraph 2.29.6.6. Career enlisted Airmen who decline to obtain retainability are
        required to read the portions of AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air
        Force and AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program (electronic) pertaining to
        ineligibility for reenlistment or extension of enlistment and promotion ineligibility,
        and sign an AF Form 964, PCS, TDY, or Training Declination Statement, within 7
        calendar days of being notified of the need for retainability (for PCS, also see
        paragraph 2.33, PCS Notification). The AF Form 964 is filed in the electronic Unit
        Personnel Record Group (UPRG). If a career enlisted Airman will not sign the AF
        Form 964, the following statement will be entered on the AF Form 964 (front or
        reverse), signed by the MPS (who counseled the enlisted Airman), and filed in the
        electronic UPRG: ―(Grade, name, SSN) of career enlisted Airman, has refused to sign
        this document confirming his or her decision to decline to obtain retainability and
        acknowledging he or she is ineligible for promotion and ineligible to extend his or her
        enlistment or reenlist‖ Enlisted Airmen who decline to obtain the minimum
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    59


        prescribed retainability may be directed to participate in the event when the required
        retainability is waived or in any event for which they have retainability, (from
        assignment selection to current DOS). NOTE: Enlisted Airmen who are not eligible
        to request retirement at the time of PCS notification and who decline to obtain
        retainability (which renders them ineligible for promotion or to further extend or
        reenlist) may still be permitted to retire if they will reach retirement eligibility before
        the DOS they have as of the date of declination and they are otherwise eligible IAW
        AFI 36-3203. If not eligible to retire, they will separate on their established DOS.
        The MPS updates AAC 09. See paragraph 2.29.6.7 to request withdrawal of
        retainability declination. Career enlisted Airmen who are ineligible to obtain
        retainability because of High Year of Tenure (HYT) restriction (see AFI 36-3203)
        will not be required to complete an AF Form 964 and will not be coded as having
        declined to obtain retainability. When PCS is a mandatory move, see paragraph
        2.29.6.5.
        2.29.6.3.2. FTA. FTA who decline to obtain retainability are required to sign an AF
        Form 964 (except Section II, paragraph b does not apply to FTA, and Section III,
        Career Motivation counseling is not required). If a first term Airman will not sign the
        AF Form 964, the following statement will be entered on the AF Form 964 (front or
        reverse), signed by the MPS (who counseled the Airman), and filed in the electronic
        UPRG: ―(Grade, name, SSN of FTA), has refused to sign this document confirming
        his or her decision to decline to obtain retainability.‖ This declination does not render
        the enlisted Airman ineligible for reenlistment or promotion. The MPS updates ALC
        L or 8 (as appropriate), with a DOA as the DOS prior to reenlistment (expires upon
        reenlistment). See paragraph 2.29.6.7 for limitations on withdrawal of declination
        statement. When PCS is a mandatory move, see paragraph 2.29.6.5.
     2.29.6.4. The following events require retainability and prescribe action to be taken. For
     PCS retainability and certain in-place actions, the MPS will refer to Table 2.5 and/or
     Table 2.6. Remember, do not require enlisted Airmen who are restricted from obtaining
     minimum retainability due to High Year of Tenure (HYT) (see AFI 36-3203, Service
     Retirements) to formally decline to obtain retainability.
        2.29.6.4.1. PCS CONUS to CONUS. The MPS will conduct a retainability interview
        and require Airmen to obtain retainability no later than 30 calendar days after official
        PCS notification. The 30 calendar day suspense is intended to give the MPS
        flexibility in scheduling the retainability interview, not to allow enlisted Airmen 30
        days to decide if they want to obtain retain-ability or not. See paragraph 2.29.6.8 for
        Airmen who desire to delay obtaining retainability. Process Airmen who decline to
        obtain retainability IAW paragraph 2.29.6.3.
        2.29.6.4.2. PCS CONUS to OS. The MPS will conduct a retainability interview and
        require enlisted Airmen to obtain retainability no later than 30 calendar days after
        official PCS notification. See paragraph 2.29.6.8 for enlisted Airmen who desire to
        delay obtaining retainability. When PCS is OS (either from the CONUS or from OS),
        enlisted Airmen must have or obtain the retainability for at least the unaccompanied
        tour length within 30 calendar days of PCS notification. Having accepted the PCS
        and obtained retainability for the unaccompanied tour length, then enlisted Airmen
        who subsequently elect and are approved to serve an accompanied tour, may require
60                                                   AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     additional retainability for the longer accompanied tour length. Do not allow enlisted
     Airmen to delay obtaining retainability for the unaccompanied tour while awaiting
     processing for an accompanied tour. Enlisted Airmen have 15 calendar days after
     concurrent travel approval to obtain retainability for the accompanied tour length or
     to formally decline. See paragraph 2.29.6.8 for enlisted Airmen who desire to delay
     obtaining retainability for the accompanied tour length.
     2.29.6.4.3. PCS OS to CONUS. Enlisted Airmen must have retainability required by
     Table 2.5 before they will be provided an assignment from the OS area. Enlisted
     Airmen must have or obtain retainability (including enlisted Airmen who must
     reenlist or extend) or complete their declination no later than the 25th day of the 8th
     month prior to DEROS (unless a delay is requested and approved to allow for
     voluntary retirement application (not 7 day option), or reenlistment in an SRB AFSC
     according to Table 2.7, rules 1 and 7) (see paragraph 2.29.6.8). Enlisted Airmen
     who do not have the retainability required for an assignment will be involuntarily
     extended at their OS location until their DOS as shown in paragraph 3.10.1, JFTR,
     Vol I, Appendix Q and Table 3.12. Enlisted Airmen eligible to obtain retainability
     will not receive an assignment under the retainability exception provisions in Table
     2.5 until declination action has been completed. For enlisted Airmen who decline to
     obtain retainability follow the procedures in paragraph 2.29.6.3. Career enlisted
     Airmen ineligible to obtain retainability because of HYT restrictions (see AFI 36-
     3203, Service Retirements) will not be required to complete AF Form 964 and will
     not be placed in AAC 09, but will be provided an assignment when they have
     retainability as outlined in Table 2.5.
     2.29.6.4.4. PCS OS to OS (Consecutive OS Tour [COT]). Enlisted Airmen must
     have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30 calendar days of the date
     they sign their DEROS Option RIP to receive COT consideration. Delay in obtaining
     these 12 months retainability will not be granted. Upon selection for a COT, enlisted
     Airmen must have or obtain the retainability for at least the unaccompanied tour
     length within 30 calendar days of PCS notification unless a delay is requested and
     approved according to paragraph 2.29.6.8 and Table 2.7. Having accepted the PCS
     and obtained retainability for at least the unaccompanied tour length, enlisted Airmen
     who elect and are approved to serve an accompanied tour, may require additional
     retainability for the longer accompanied OS tour length. Enlisted Airmen have 15
     calendar days after concurrent travel approval to obtain retainability to serve the
     accompanied tour length, or formally decline per paragraph 2.29.6.3 (and serve the
     unaccompanied tour length).
     2.29.6.4.5. In-Place COT (IPCOT). Airmen must have or obtain the retainability for
     at least the unaccompanied tour length within 30 calendar days unless a delay is
     requested and approved according to paragraph 2.29.6.8 and Table 2.7. Enlisted
     Airmen who are currently serving an unaccompanied tour who elect to serve an
     accompanied IPCOT may require additional retainability for the longer accompanied
     OS tour length. Enlisted Airmen have 15 calendar days after approval of an
     accompanied tour to obtain retainability to serve the accompanied tour length.
     Enlisted Airmen who receive an approved IPCOT who refuse to obtain retainability
     are not required to formally decline. The MPS will request the assignment OPR
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  61


        cancel the IPCOT when enlisted Airmen refuse to obtain retainability. Airmen must
        have at least 12 months retainability to be considered for a CONUS PCS. Airmen’s
        DEROS will be extended to match DOS if member refuses to obtain retainability
        (within 30 calendar days) to meet the 12 month requirement.
        2.29.6.4.6. OS Tour Extension. Enlisted Airmen must obtain retainability required
        for voluntary extension of an OS tour within 30 calendar days after being advised of
        approval of their extension request. Do not require enlisted Airmen who refuse to
        obtain retainability to formally decline. The MPS will request the assignment OPR
        cancel the OS tour extension when enlisted Airmen refuse to obtain retainability.
            2.29.6.4.6.1. Indefinite DEROS. Enlisted Airmen must maintain at least 8
            months service retainability in order to keep an indefinite DEROS. Enlisted
            Airmen who fail to maintain at least 8 months service retainability will have a
            DEROS established which equals their DOS.
        2.29.6.4.7. Other Actions. For other actions which may require retainability (e.g.,
        TDY, training, enlisted Airmen erroneously assigned with less than the minimum
        retainability, change in OS tour length, etc.), the paragraph, attachment, or instruction
        which describes the action or program will indicate the timeframe within which
        retainability must be obtained and specify action to be taken in the event an enlisted
        Airman refuses. Enlisted Airmen who refuse to obtain the full prescribed
        retainability for an action may, in many instances, be directed to complete the action
        with the amount of retainability they have. EXAMPLE: An enlisted Airman is
        selected for TDY of 179 days in length, but only has 120 days retainability and
        declines to obtain additional retainability. After the enlisted Airman has formally
        declined to obtain the additional retainability, they can be directed to perform TDY
        with the amount of retainability they do have.
     2.29.6.5. Involuntary Separation of Enlisted Airmen Who Lack PCS Retainability.
     Enlisted Airmen in a mandatory move PCS status (such as due to a force structure
     drawdown) are subject to separation in lieu of PCS when the enlisted Airman is ineligible
     or refuses to obtain the prescribed amount of PCS retainability and the enlisted Airman
     currently possesses less than 12 months service retainability (computed from RNLTD to
     current DOS). Commanders may establish an earlier separation date (by memorandum to
     Separations), under the provisions of AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen,
     when the enlisted Airman can no longer be used effectively based on the mission
     drawdown.
     2.29.6.6. Retainability Declination, Enlisted Airmen With 19 Years TAFMS or More.
     When CONUS-assigned enlisted Airmen (only) have 19 years or more TAFMS as of the
     month and year of PCS notification, and lack the minimum required PCS retainability
     and decline to obtain it, then the AF will establish an involuntary DOS for them as shown
     below. Withdrawal of declinations will not be considered after an involuntary DOS has
     been established. This process does not apply when enlisted Airmen have less than 19
     years TAFMS as of PCS notification month and year (see paragraph 2.29.6.3.1). This
     provision is not intended to deny enlisted Airmen retirement. It does not apply to enlisted
     Airmen with less than 19 years TAFMS as of the month and year of PCS notification.
     The intent is to preclude enlisted Airmen who were eligible to elect retirement in lieu of
62                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     PCS, but who declined instead to obtain PCS retainability, from remaining on active duty
     for a prolonged period of time waiting to retire upon their normal DOS. (NOTE: An
     involuntary DOS established under this provision is not an approved retirement date.
     Enlisted Airmen who get an involuntary DOS this way must still apply for and receive
     approval to retire. Failure to request retirement may result in separation upon DOS
     without benefit of retirement.) An involuntary DOS is not established when declination
     of retainability is other than for PCS, such as TDY, training, or some other reason.
     Enlisted Airmen will have an involuntary DOS established which is either the last day of
     the 6th month following PCS notification, or the latest date among the following:
        2.29.6.6.1. The last day of the month in which enlisted Airman completes 20 years’
        TAFMS (but not less than 6 months from PCS notification).
        2.29.6.6.2. The last day of the month in which an ADSC expires.
        2.29.6.6.3. When assigned to a CONUS maximum tour, the last day of the month of
        the DOA.
        2.29.6.6.4. When enlisted Airmen are surplus due to base closure, unit deactivation,
        AFSC overage, or similar circumstances, the DOS is the last day of the month
        Airmen can be effectively used at their current station. The assignment OPR
        determines this date considering such factors as whether or not the enlisted Airman is
        filling a valid manpower authorization, etc.
        2.29.6.6.5. When enlisted Airmen meet the criteria outlined above, the MPS will
        record declination as required in paragraph 2.29.6.3.1 and update the PDS with
        AAC 09. Reclama the assignment using reclama reason code ―09‖ and in the trailer
        remarks indicate enlisted Airman has 19 or more years’ TAFMS. It is important not
        to use any other reclama code reason. The message subject should be ―PCS
        retainability declination for enlisted Airman with 19 or more years’ TAFMS‖ when
        reclama is by message. Address the message to the assignment OPR with an
        information copy to HQ AFPC/DPAA5 for SMSgt and below. For CMSgts
        (including selects), address the reclama message to AF/DPE. AF/DPE or DPSOR in
        coordination with DPAA5, will determine and update the involuntary DOS, and
        notify the MPS by message .
     2.29.6.7. Enlisted Airmen Requests to Withdraw Retainability Declination Statement.
        2.29.6.7.1. Career Enlisted Airmen. Declinations by career enlisted Airmen described
        in paragraph 2.29.6.6 (more than 19 years TAFMS) may not be withdrawn. For
        other career enlisted Airmen, the MPS will send requests, which must include the unit
        commander’s recommendation, to the assignment OPR (Table 1.2). Approval of
        withdrawal is based on manning in the career enlisted Airman’s AFSC. Requests for
        withdrawal submitted in conjunction with retraining are processed according to AFI
        36-2626, Airman Retraining Program.
        2.29.6.7.2. FTA. Declinations by FTA may not be withdrawn and declination
        renders them ineligible to apply for any self-initiated PCS action. However, FTA
        may reenlist without obtaining approval to withdraw their declination statement.
        After reenlistment, the record of previous declination by FTA is deleted.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     63


       2.29.6.8. Enlisted Airmen Retainability Delays. The MPS Commander may authorize an
       extension of the suspense date by which enlisted Airmen must have additional
       retainability for the reasons shown in Table 2.7, Enlisted Airman PCS Retainability
       Suspense Delay. Pay particular attention to the notes to Table 2.7 as they contain
       additional special instructions and limitations for each category of delay. Delay in
       obtaining retainability is intended as a tool to accommodate enlisted Airmen who have
       accepted an assignment (within certain limits). Approval of delays must be judiciously
       applied since they can have a negative impact on a gaining unit if the individual granted a
       delay later declines to obtain retainability. Delays must not expose the government to
       the risk of PCS allowances being used for which Airmen do not have sufficient
       retainability. Delay is not authorized for the purpose of allowing enlisted Airmen more
       time to consider accepting a PCS. Delay for any other reason or period of time requires
       approval of an exception to policy per paragraph 1.5. The MPS Commander may
       delegate authority to approve authorized delays to a section chief. Any delay must be
       approved within the original retainability suspense period established for a particular kind
       of PCS or action. A delay of the retainability suspense is not a waiver to the amount
       (length) of retainability required.
2.30. Seven Day Option. The options extended to officers to request retirement or separation
and for enlisted to request retirement, in connection with selection for certain events, are not the
same. There are some similarities and certain special provisions and restrictions apply to both.
The areas which are similar are addressed below followed by separate paragraphs explaining the
options for officers and those for enlisted.
   2.30.1. Special Provisions and Restrictions. There are a number of special provisions and
   restrictions which apply to the 7-day option. The following apply to both officers and
   enlisted, unless indicated otherwise.
       2.30.1.1. Normal separation and retirement criteria apply when a signed request for
       separation or retirement is dated before an ASD for PCS or selection date for training.
       Any request for separation (officers only) or retirement (officers and enlisted) must be
       under 7-day option when a signed request for separation or retirement is the same date or
       after an ASD for PCS or selection date for training. The fact an Airman was not aware or
       had not been officially notified of selection does not change the fact they had been
       selected on or before the date of their separation or retirement request. Use the previous
       rule to determine which action is officially first when an Airman’s request for separation
       or retirement and selection for PCS or training occur at about the same time. The MPS
       will reclama (per paragraph 2.46 for enlisted and paragraph 2.30.2.4 for officers) and
       advise the assignment OPR the Airman applied for separation or retirement prior to
       selection when the Airman’s request for voluntary separation or retirement was before
       selection for PCS or training and the Airman does not want the assignment or training.
       However, if the Airman wants to accept the PCS or training, then they must submit a
       request to withdraw their separation or retirement request within 7 calendar days of
       official notification of selection for PCS or training. The decision to approve or
       disapprove the withdrawal request will be based upon the best interest of the Air Force.
       When an Airman’s request for separation or retirement was submitted under normal
       voluntary provisions but they had an ASD prior to the date of their request, then the
       reason for their separation or retirement request will be changed by AFPC retirements or
64                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     separations office to reflect it as being submitted under 7-day option provisions. 7-day
     option rules apply in determining the separation or retirement date in this case.
     2.30.1.2. An Airman is not required to request separation or retirement under 7-day
     option provisions if they do not desire to participate in the event or incur the associated
     ADSC when the instruction governing an education or training event contains a provision
     to allow Airmen to decline attendance (with or without prejudice). If there are no
     provisions in the prescribing instruction allowing an Airman to decline (with or without
     prejudice), then 7-day option provisions apply.
     2.30.1.3. Airmen who elect separation or retirement remain eligible for any PCS, TDY,
     or training for which they have sufficient retainability or when the retainability
     requirement is waived. Airmen directed to participate will be assigned the ADSC for the
     event, but will not be made to serve beyond their DOS or retirement date. In such cases,
     Airmen separate or retire with a portion of the ADSC unserved. An ADSC will not
     involuntarily extend an established DOS or retirement date.
     2.30.1.4. Airmen applying for separation or retirement under 7-day option provisions
     may not request a separation or retirement date earlier than the minimum dates allowed
     for normal voluntary separation or retirement requests. Similarly, if the AF seeks to
     establish a separation or retirement date earlier than the Airman requests, the date will not
     normally be earlier than the minimum authorized by separation or retirement instructions.
     Airmen selected for PCS, TDY, or training who have an established DOS or retirement
     date may request an earlier DOS or retirement date under 7-day option provisions, if
     eligible, but not earlier than the minimum authorized by separation or retirement
     instructions.
     2.30.1.5. Airmen who establish a separation or retirement date under 7-day option
     provisions who later decide they do not want to separate or retire may request withdrawal
     of the approved date through separation or retirement channels. AFPC separation or
     retirement office will route the request to the assignment OPR for consideration.
     Requests for withdrawal are not automatically approved. The assignment OPR will make
     a recommendation of approval or disapproval based on manning and the overall best
     interests of the AF. See paragraph 2.30.1.10.2 for guidance on 7-day option subsequent
     to withdrawal.
     2.30.1.6. During the period of time between establishment of an ASD and notification of
     actual PCS selection, if an Airman desires to request separation or retirement, 7-day
     option provisions apply. Normally, notification of establishment of an ASD or
     notification of nomination for assignment does not require an Airman to request
     separation or retirement within 7 calendar days, unless the ASD or nomination
     notification states otherwise.
     2.30.1.7. Officers. Under 7-day option provisions, officers serving on an SPTC may not
     establish a separation date earlier than the expiration date of their contract, however,
     officers may establish an earlier retirement date, if eligible.
     2.30.1.8. Enlisted. Under 7-day option provisions, enlisted Airmen serving an enlistment
     contract may not establish a separation date earlier than the expiration date of their
     contract, however, enlisted Airmen may establish an earlier retirement date, if eligible.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                      65


     2.30.1.9. Enlisted Airmen who elect retirement under 7-day option provisions are not
     eligible for promotion. Enlisted Airmen selected for promotion before they submit a
     retirement application under 7-day option may not withdraw the retirement to accept
     promotion.
     2.30.1.10. The 7-day option provisions do not apply in the following circumstances:
         2.30.1.10.1. The move is in conjunction with an Airman being accessed for entry on
         active duty or an Airman recalled to active duty.
         2.30.1.10.2. An Airman with a DOS or retirement date established per 7-day option
         provisions who then requests and receives approval to withdraw their 7-day option
         DOS or retirement date, is not authorized a 7-day option in connection with the first
         event following approval of withdrawal when selection is within 12 months of the
         date of approved withdrawal. When selection for the first event is more than 12
         months following the date of approval of withdrawal, the Airman may exercise 7-day
         option provisions, if eligible.
         2.30.1.10.3. An Airman has departed on PCS whether or not they have arrived at the
         new duty station.
         2.30.1.10.4. The move is under authority of an instruction other than this one, for
         example, PCS in a patient status, prisoner status, for court martial, for administrative
         proceedings, etc., (see Attachment 22).
         2.30.1.10.5. Airmen restored to active duty, or reinstated on active duty following
         action under the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR)
         process.
  2.30.2. Officers. Officers with an indefinite DOS selected for PCS, education, training, an
  ADSC-incurring event, or who have an ASD, who do not want to participate in the event
  and/or do not want the associated ADSC, if eligible as outlined below and in Table 2.9, must
  submit a request for separation IAW AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, or
  request for retirement IAW AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements. Officers may be directed to
  participate in the original event, or may be selected for another event for which they have
  retainability or when the retainability requirement is waived, even though a DOS or
  retirement date is requested or established under 7-day option provisions. The ADSC for an
  event will be updated to officers’ records if they participate, but in some cases, such as when
  a requested separation or retirement date is approved and officers are directed to participate
  in the event anyway, they would separate or retire on the approved date with a portion of the
  ADSC not served. Officers’ separation request will be submitted to the MPS within 7
  calendar days or retirement requests must be signed and submitted via vMPF within 7
  calendar days of official PCS notification or event notification date. Officers notified of an
  ASD are not required to request separation or retirement within 7 calendar days of the event
  notification date; however, the rest of the 7-day option provisions apply during the period
  between establishment of an ASD and up to 7 calendar days following official notification of
  selection for PCS. Officers who fail to submit a request to establish a DOS (through the
  MPS) or retirement date within 7 calendar days via vMPF are considered as having accepted
  the event and the associated ADSC. Officers who have an established DOS or retirement date
  at the time of official PCS notification or event notification, if eligible, may request an earlier
66                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  DOS or retirement date. Officers who have an established DOS or retirement date based on
  expiration of an ADSC and their current DOS or retirement date is greater than the ADSC
  they would incur for the event for which selected, have no options under the 7-day option
  provisions. The following eligibility requirements shown in Table 2.9 are further explained
  below.
     2.30.2.1. Officers who have 19 or more years TAFMS as of the event notification date
     (month and year) or establishment of an ASD may apply for retirement. Officers in the
     grade of LtCol and below with less than 19 years TAFMS with no ADSC or an ADSC
     which will expire before they reach 20 years TAFMS will be authorized to request a
     retirement date in lieu of an additional ADSC if that additional ADSC would extend
     beyond the date the officer reaches 20 years TAFMS.
     2.30.2.2. The date of separation or date of retirement officers are eligible to request
     under 7-day option provisions varies depending on their grade, whether serving OS or in
     the CONUS, if they have been notified of establishment of an ASD based on
     vulnerability for involuntary PCS selection and whether or not they have an unserved
     ADSC on the requested separation or retirement date. Officers may not request a
     separation or retirement date which is before the expiration of an ADSC, except as an
     exception to policy IAW paragraph 1.5. Officers with no ADSC (and those with an
     ADSC which will expire before the requested date of separation or retirement) may
     request a separation or retirement date which is no later than the first day of the 12th
     month following their ASD (mo/yr) or 1st day of the 7th month following official event
     notification (mo/yr), except:
         2.30.2.2.1. Officers with an indefinite DOS selected for PCS, education, training, an
         ADSC- incurring event, and those who have an ASD who are assigned in the CONUS
         who have an ADSC greater than that which they would incur for the event which
         selected are not eligible to execute a 7-day option.
         2.30.2.2.2. Officers assigned OS must request a separation date to coincide with their
         DEROS (month/year) or must request a retirement date which is the first day of the
         month following DEROS, if otherwise eligible to separate per AFI 36-3207, or retire
         per AFI 36-3203. Officers who want to separate or retire after present assignment but
         the date they desire is after their current DEROS, must request a voluntary extension
         of OS tour to satisfy the requirement to separate upon DEROS (month/year), or retire
         on the first day of the month following DEROS (as extended). This extension must
         be completed before establishment of an ASD as shown in Table 2.8 and paragraph
         2.31. Once an ASD has been established, officers who desire to separate or retire on a
         date other than authorized above must request an exception to policy per paragraph
         1.5. This includes requests for curtailment to facilitate retirement prior to the first day
         of the month following the original DEROS month. Officers who have an ADSC
         beyond their DEROS must either request an extension of DEROS as outlined above
         so their ADSC is completed as of the requested separation or retirement date, or they
         may request an exception to policy. Approval of a DOS beyond current DEROS may
         result in involuntary extension of DEROS to match the established DOS if the officer
         lacks retainability to receive a CONUS assignment (see Table 2.5). Officers are not
         required to request separation or retirement within 7 calendar days of being notified
         of an ASD; however, the rest of the 7-day option provisions apply during the period
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  67


        between establishment of an ASD and up to 7 calendar days following official
        notification of end assignment. Requests submitted more than 7 calendar days after
        official notification of end assignment must be submitted as an exception to policy
        per paragraph 1.5. Because officers must separate or retire in conjunction with their
        DEROS, officers who have an indefinite DEROS who want to separate or retire after
        present assignment must request a specific DEROS be established as outlined in
        paragraph 3.8.5. The request to establish a DEROS and the separation or retirement
        request should be submitted together when the requested DEROS results in an ASD
        being established.
        2.30.2.2.3. For officers serving on a CONUS maximum stabilized tour (AACs 46 and
        50), officers cannot request a separation or retirement date earlier than the minimum
        authorized in separation and retirement instructions. For officers completing a
        CONUS maximum stabilized tour (AACs 46 and 50), an ASD is established as shown
        in paragraph 2.31 and Table 2.8. Officers are not required to request separation or
        retirement within 7 calendar days of being notified of establishment an ASD;
        however, the rest of the 7-day option provisions apply during the period between
        establishment of an ASD and up to 7 calendar days following official notification of
        end assignment. After establishment of an ASD, officers are limited with regard to
        the latest separation or retirement date they may request. If otherwise eligible per
        AFI 36- 3207, officers serving on a CONUS maximum stabilized tour may request a
        separation date not earlier than the first day of the month following completion of
        their longest ADSC or not greater than their availability date (month/year). If
        otherwise eligible per AFI 36-3203, they may request a retirement date which is no
        earlier than the first day of the month following completion of their longest ADSC or
        no greater than the first day of the month following their availability date. Officers
        who want to separate or retire after present assignment but the date they desire is after
        their DOA, must request a voluntary extension of stabilized tour to satisfy the
        requirement to separate upon DOA (month/year), or retire on the first day of the
        month following DOA (as extended). This extension must be completed before
        establishment of an ASD as shown in Table 2.8 and paragraph 2.31. Once an ASD
        has been established, officers who desire to separate or retire on a date other than
        authorized above must request an exception to policy per paragraph 1.5. Officers
        who have an ADSC beyond their DOA must either request an extension of DOA as
        outlined above so their ADSC is completed as of the requested separation or
        retirement date, or they may request an exception to policy. Prior to establishment of
        an ASD officers, who desire to separate or retire, may request separation according to
        AFI 36-3207, or retirement according to AFI 36-3203.
        2.30.2.2.4. For officers notified of establishment of an ASD based on vulnerability
        for PCS selection and who are currently assigned OS, see paragraph 2.30.2.2.2
        above. For officers assigned in the CONUS who are currently serving on a CONUS
        maximum stabilized tour, see paragraph 2.30.2.2.3 above. For all other officers
        currently assigned in the CONUS, when notified of establishment of an ASD
        according to paragraph 2.31 and Table 2.8, based on vulnerability for involuntary
        PCS selection, the following applies. Officers are not required to request separation
        or retirement within 7 calendar days of being notified of an ASD; however, the rest of
68                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


        the 7-day option provisions apply during the period between establishment of an ASD
        and up to 7 calendar days following official notification of end assignment. After
        establishment of an ASD, officers are limited with regard to the latest separation or
        retirement date they may request. The earliest date they may request varies depending
        on whether they are assigned OS, to a CONUS maximum tour or a CONUS
        assignment other than a maximum tour. Officers may not request a separation or
        retirement date which is before the expiration of an ADSC, except as an exception to
        policy IAW paragraph 1.5. Officers with no ADSC (and those with an ADSC which
        will expire before the requested date of separation or retirement) may request a
        separation or retirement date which is no later than the first day of the 12th month
        following event notification. Officers who have an ADSC greater than that which
        they would incur for an event for which selected are not eligible to execute a 7-day
        option. Once an ASD has been established, officers who desire to separate or retire
        on a date other than authorized above must request an exception to policy per
        paragraph 1.5. Prior to establishment of an ASD, officers who desire to separate or
        retire, may request separation according to AFI 36-3207, or retirement according to
        AFI 36-3203.
     2.30.2.3. Officers are authorized an additional opportunity (second 7-day option period)
     in which to request separation or retirement, if eligible, when a change in assignment data
     results in a greater ADSC (greater meaning an ADSC of longer length than originally
     accepted), or whenever the end assignment changes before the officer departs on PCS.
     For example, if an officer originally accepted a PCS ADSC of 24 months but then
     training is added increasing the length of the ADSC from 24 months to 30 months, this is
     a greater ADSC. In this example it is appropriate to afford the officer a second 7-day
     option period. Another example is an officer originally accepted an ADSC for PCS of 24
     months but then the RNLTD is delayed by 3 months. Based on paragraph 2.30.2.3.1
     below, this officer would not be afforded an additional 7-day option opportunity because
     the 24 month ADSC for PCS was not greater than the original length of the ADSC. (It is
     true, however, that the 3 month delay of RNLTD would delay when the 24 month ADSC
     would start and when it would be completed.) In still another example, an officer
     accepted a CONUS to CONUS PCS to Randolph AFB and the associated ADSC for a
     PCS. Then the assignment was changed to Wash, D.C. (but the length of the PCS ADSC
     was the same). This officer would be afforded a second 7-day option because of the
     change of end location (even though the length of the PCS ADSC was the same).
        2.30.2.3.1. Normally, a second 7-day option period is not authorized when the event
        start date or RNLTD is delayed due to unforeseen circumstances and the length of the
        ADSC originally accepted (as explained above) is not greater (longer in length).
        However, such delays, in turn, can cause delay in the ADSC completion date.
        Therefore, when the start date or RNLTD is delayed 181 days or more, an officer may
        request a second 7-day option period as an exception to policy per paragraph 1.5.
        The decision whether or not to approve the second 7-day option request will be made
        on a case-by-case basis.
        2.30.2.3.2. A second 7-day option period is not authorized when a change of
        assignment data or change of end assignment is the result of approval of an officer's
        request for the change.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  69


     2.30.2.4. An officer signs and submits a separation or retirement application under 7-day
     option provisions via the vMPF. If an exception to policy is being requested,
     AFPC/DPSOR or AFPC/DPSOS will notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP and indicate what
     exception is being requested. For colonels (including selects), AFPC/DPSOR or DPSOS
     will notify AF/DPO only. If an exception to policy is also being requested, that
     exception will also be stated in the notification. Upon receipt of the retirement or
     separation request, HQ AFPC/DPAPP will coordinate with the assignment OPR and
     make a recommendation to AFPC/DPSOR or DPSOS.
  2.30.3. Enlisted Airmen selected for PCS, TDY, or training (PCS or TDY), who do not want
  to participate in an event may elect to request retirement under 7-day option provisions.
  Enlisted Airmen who elect to retire are ineligible for promotion consideration and are
  ineligible for extension of enlistment or reenlistment, except as authorized per AFI 36-2606
  in conjunction with a request for retirement. Aside from 7-day option provisions, enlisted
  Airmen who do not have the minimum required retainability for the event or the associated
  ADSC may be eligible to decline to obtain retainability as outlined in paragraph 2.29.
  Enlisted Airmen fall into four major categories as shown below:
     2.30.3.1. Enlisted Airmen who have retainability and are not eligible to request
     retirement IAW the criteria below and Table 2.9, have no options (under 7-day option
     provisions) which allow them to refuse or decline to participate in an event.
     2.30.3.2. Enlisted Airmen who do not have retainability and are not eligible to request
     retirement IAW the criteria below and Table 2.9, are not eligible under 7-day option
     provisions, but can decline to obtain retainability as outlined in paragraph 2.29.‖
     2.30.3.3. Enlisted Airmen who do not have retainability and are eligible to request
     retirement IAW the criteria below and in Table 2.9 (specifically, those who meet the
     criterion of having 19 or more years TAFMS as of official PCS notification and are
     assigned in the CONUS [only]) but who decline to obtain PCS retainability instead of
     requesting retirement, will be processed as outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.3.1, and an
     involuntary DOS will be established according to paragraph 2.29.6.6. After
     establishment of an involuntary DOS, Airmen may elect to retire earlier than the
     involuntary DOS, if otherwise eligible, but may not retire later than their involuntary
     DOS. An involuntary DOS is not an approved retirement date. Enlisted Airmen must
     still apply for retirement and meet the retirement eligibility requirements as shown in AFI
     36-3203.
     2.30.3.4. Enlisted Airmen who do, or do not, have retainability and are eligible to request
     retirement IAW the criteria below and in Table 2.9, within 7 calendar days of official
     PCS notification (month and year) and want to request retirement must submit a request
     for retirement, if otherwise eligible IAW AFI 36-3203. Enlisted Airmen must ask for a
     retirement date that is within their current enlistment, or current enlistment as extended .
     When an enlisted Airman's current DOS is before a requested retirement date authorized
     by 7-day option provisions, enlisted Airmen may submit a request for extension of
     enlistment along with their retirement request. IAW AFI 36-2606, the period of
     extension may not be longer than necessary to allow retirement on the requested date and
     may not exceed 12 months. The following additional instructions apply:
70                                                    AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     2.30.3.4.1. Assigned in CONUS. Enlisted Airmen who are eligible to retire (20 years
     TAFMS or more), or who will reach retirement eligibility within 6 months following
     notification, may request a retirement date not later than the first day of the seventh
     month following PCS notification. Do not count the notification month. If eligible,
     an earlier retirement date may be requested as authorized in AFI 36-3203. As an
     exception to the latest retirement date permitted above, enlisted Airmen who will
     reach retirement eligibility within the 7 to 12 month period following PCS
     notification may also request retirement, but are restricted to requesting a date which
     is not later than the first day of the month following the month in which retirement
     eligibility is reached.
     Example A: An enlisted Airman who has 19 years and 6 months TAFMS, or more,
     as of PCS notification in Feb 2008 may request a retirement date not later than 1 Sep
     2008.
     Example B: First. An enlisted Airman who has 19 years and 3 months TAFMS as of
     PCS notification in Feb 2008 may request a retirement date not later than 1 Dec
     2008. In this instance, the enlisted Airman’s TAFMSD is Nov 1988 and retirement
     eligibility is reached in Nov 2008. Enlisted Airman must retire on the first day of the
     month following the month in which retirement eligibility is reached.
     Second. In the case of an enlisted Airman with 19 years TAFMS as of PCS
     notification (for example TAFMSD in Feb 1989 and notified of PCS selection in Feb
     2008) who will reach retirement eligibility in the 12th month following PCS
     notification, the enlisted Airman may request a retirement date not later than 1 Mar
     2009. In this instance only, since the enlisted Airman must retire on the first day of
     the month following the month in which retirement eligibility is reached, then
     retirement is authorized on the first day of the 13th PCS notification. month following
     2.30.3.4.2. Assigned OS. Enlisted Airmen must request a retirement date which is the
     first day of the month following DEROS, if otherwise eligible to retire on that date
     per AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements. Enlisted Airmen who want to retire after
     present assignment but the date they desire is after their current DEROS, must request
     a voluntary extension of OS tour to satisfy the requirement of retiring on the first day
     of the month following DEROS (as extended). This extension must be completed
     before establishment of an ASD as shown in Table 2.8 and paragraph 2.31. Once an
     ASD has been established, enlisted Airmen who desire to retire on a date other than
     the first day of the month following DEROS must request an exception to policy per
     paragraph 1.5. Enlisted Airmen who have an ADSC beyond their DEROS must
     either request an extension of DEROS as outlined above so their ADSC is completed
     as of the requested separation or retirement date, or they may request an exception to
     policy (with waiver of ADSC). Seven day option provisions apply during the period
     between establishment of an ASD and up to 7 calendar days following official
     notification of end assignment. Requests submitted more than 7 calendar days after
     official notification of end assignment or requests from enlisted Airmen who do not
     meet the eligibility criteria must be submitted as an exception to policy per
     paragraph 1.5. Because enlisted Airmen must retire in conjunction with their
     DEROS, Airmen who have an indefinite DEROS who want to retire after present
     assignment must request a specific DEROS be established as outlined in paragraph
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 71


        3.8.5. The request to establish a DEROS and the retirement request should be
        submitted together when the requested DEROS results in an ASD being established.
        2.30.3.4.3. Completing a CONUS Maximum Stabilized Tour. Enlisted Airmen
        completing a CONUS maximum stabilized tour (AAC 50) who desire to retire after
        present assignment and who are otherwise eligible to retire per AFI 36-3203, must
        request a retirement date which is no greater than the first day of the month following
        the maximum tour date of availability. Retirement eligible enlisted Airmen may apply
        for retirement while serving a maximum tour as long as requested retirement date is
        on or after the first day of the month in which their longest ADSC is completed. An
        ASD is established as shown in Table 2.8 and enlisted Airmen are limited after
        receiving an ASD in the retirement date they may request, unless they request an
        exception to policy. Enlisted Airmen who are not eligible to retire on the tour
        completion date, but will be eligible for retirement within the 12-month period
        following official PCS notification, may apply for retirement if the requested date is
        not later than the first day of the month following the month in which retirement
        eligibility is reached. Enlisted Airman reaching retirement eligibility within 12
        months of DOA must request an extension of the maximum tour to coincide with
        requested retirement approximately 12 months prior to current DOA (see paragraph
        2.15.7.4.2.1 and Attachment 16). A request of an extension of DOA to coincide with
        requested retirement date outside the CONUS Mandatory Mover time-line will be
        processed as an exception to policy IAW paragraph 1.5.
     2.30.3.5. Enlisted Airman applying for retirement via the vMPF self-service applications
     do not have to complete a declination nor is a reclama of the assignment required. The in
     system retirement application (with the reason for retirement as special program ID code
     "72") serves as the reclama and automatically updates AAC 09. HQ AFPC/DPSOR will
     separate the exception request and forwarded it to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for a
     recommendation on the exception to policy. If the retirement request is disapproved, the
     Airman complies with the assignment instructions. If the retirement request is approved,
     an assignment cancellation is automatically generated to the Contact Center, MPS,
     enlisted Airman and the assignment OPR.
     2.30.3.6. Second 7-Day Option.         Enlisted Airmen are authorized an additional
     opportunity (second 7-day option period) in which to request retirement, if eligible, when
     notified of a change of end assignment before departure on PCS, or when a change of
     assignment data requires additional retainability. When additional retainability is
     required and enlisted Airmen are not eligible to request retirement, enlisted Airmen who
     do not have the additional retainability may be eligible to decline to obtain retainability
     per paragraph 2.29. Enlisted Airmen who are not eligible to request retirement and
     enlisted Airmen who have the additional retainability have no options under 7-day option
     provisions. An additional 7-day option period is not authorizedwhen the change of end
     assignment or change in assignment data was the result of an enlisted Airman's request
     for the change. Following are some examples:
           Example A: An enlisted Airman was not eligible to retire in lieu of PCS when
        originally selected. If the end assignment location changes and since original
        selection the enlisted Airman has become eligible to retire in lieu of PCS, then the
        enlisted Airman may request retirement when notified of the change of end

           assignment, whether or not they have retainability for the change is not a factor.
              Example B: An enlisted Airman had or obtained retainability when originally
           selected for PCS and was not then and is not now eligible to request retirement under
           7-day option provisions. The RNLTD is delayed for 3 months, the Airman does not
           have the additional retainability required and refuses to obtain it. This enlisted
           Airman could; however, decline to obtain retainability and then a decision would
           have to be made if the RNLTD should revert back, retainability waived, or the
           assignment canceled.
2.31. Assignment Selection Date (ASD). The ASD is used in several ways. It may be the date
an officer or enlisted Airman is selected by name for assignment by the assignment OPR, or it
may be the date the assignment process begins in order to reassign an officer or enlisted Airman
on a scheduled future date (such as upon DEROS, tour completion date from a CONUS
maximum stabilized tour, the date Airman will become surplus, and so on), OR it may be the
date when an officer (only) is identified by the assignment OPR as vulnerable for PCS selection.
Table 2.8. Determining Assignment Selection Date, shows the reasons and specific dates when
an ASD is established. When an Airman gets an automatic ASD based on a schedule or an
officer (only) gets an ASD based upon vulnerability for PCS selection, that is the Airman’s
official ASD. For officers, an automatic ASD will be superseded by a vulnerability ASD. The
PDS transaction or message providing an Airman an end assignment may cite a different date as
the ASD. When this happens, the date shown as the ASD in the message or transaction may be
either the date the Airman was matched to the assignment, or it may be the date the transaction
was updated; but it is not the official ASD. When the assignment OPR approves a change of
DEROS, change of date of availability, etc., and an ASD was established, the assignment OPR
must review and manually change or cancel the ASD, as appropriate.
   2.31.1. Following is a general example of how an automatic ASD works. For this example,
   we'll use an enlisted Airman assigned OS; however, the concept is similar for officers.
   Approximately 9 months in advance, enlisted Airmen with a date eligible for return from OS
   (DEROS) in a given month are identified. An ASD is automatically established based on the
   DEROS (month and year). In this case, establishment of an ASD does not mean the enlisted
   Airman has been selected for a specific assignment. What it means is, reassignment of an
   individual will occur based on a firm future date and the ASD is the date the assignment
   process (or assignment "cycle") begins. Once the cycle begins, enlisted Airmen must be
   limited in the actions they are allowed to take (such as, extension or curtailment of DEROS,
   change of CONUS maximum tour completion date, etc.) similar to enlisted Airmen actually
   selected for PCS. Next, name selections are made to replace enlisted Airmen on their
   DEROS (or maximum tour completion date, and so on). These selections are from enlisted
   Airmen assigned in the CONUS or OS (for consecutive OS assignments). Then, the
   projected vacancies created by these name selections are prioritized (along with other
   existing vacancies) and OS returnees are then matched to fill all or a percentage of the
   vacancies. In this example, the "cycle" is complete when the OS returnee is matched to a
   specific assignment location; however, as you can see, it starts with the ASD. Remember,
   for officers, an automatic ASD (generated by DEROS or tour completion) will be superseded
   by a vulnerability ASD.
   2.31.2. , Airmen may not request an assignment, deferment from reassignment, separation,
   retirement, or other action which would render them ineligible for assignment on or after
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 73


   establishment of an ASD, except as an exception to policy IAW paragraph 1.5 and as
   follows:
       2.31.2.1. Officers. Request for retirement or separation under 7-day option provisions,
       see paragraph 2.30, Seven Day Option.
       2.31.2.2. Enlisted. Request for retirement under 7-day option provisions, see paragraph
       2.30, Seven Day Option.
       2.31.2.3. Request for reassignment or deferment under humanitarian provisions or the
       EFMP as authorized in Attachment 25.
       2.31.2.4. Request for separation for convenience of the government or hardship,
       including pregnancy (see AFI 36-3207 for officers and AFI 36-3208 for enlisted).
       2.31.2.5. Request for deferment from reassignment based upon pregnancy as authorized
       in paragraph 2.39.
       2.31.2.6. Request submitted under sole surviving son or daughter provisions as
       authorized in Attachment 11.
       2.31.2.7. Hostile fire or imminent danger area deferment for family members as
       authorized in Attachment 6.
       2.31.2.8. Release from assignment to a family Airman’s unit as authorized in
       Attachment 6, or as an aircrew member as authorized in Attachment 9.
       2.31.2.9. Request for separation based on conscientious objector status per AFI 36-3204.
       2.31.2.10. Request from a commander for operational deferment as authorized in
       paragraph 2.15.4.
       2.31.2.11. Request for release from assignment as a Medal of Honor recipient or
       candidate as authorized in paragraph 3.12.
       2.31.2.12. Request for change of assignment or cancellation based upon equal
       assignment opportunity provisions as outlined in paragraph 2.3.
       2.31.2.13. Request to be released from voluntary OS PCS selection per paragraph 2.12.
2.32. Assignment Preferences. For military couples, also see Attachment 8.
   2.32.1. Officers:
       2.32.1.1. Colonels (including selects) make their personal assignment preferences known
       primarily through their senior rater and chain of command. Officers should ask their
       senior rater for advice on their next assignment and consider that advice carefully.
       Officers may also call AFSLMO (AF/DPO) and/or MAJCOM (or equivalent) senior
       officer manager to express their assignment preferences. While an officer's preferences
       will be considered, there is no guarantee the next assignment or location will be to a
       preference--ultimately the next assignment will be determined by the needs of the AF.
       (NOTE: Assignments for judge advocates are managed by AF/JAX.)
       2.32.1.2. Lieutenant colonels and below (excluding judge advocate officers) make their
       personal assignment preferences known through the use of the Airman Development
       Program (ADP). The officer’s commander also uses this ADP to make recommendations
 74                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       for the officer’s next assignment. Commander involvement is required in the process as
       the ADP will not be accepted by the assignment OPR without it. Attachment 17
       provides essential information to enable officers to understand and participate in the AF
       Assignment System (AFAS).
   2.32.2. Enlisted.
       2.32.2.1. CMSgts (including selects) volunteer for assignments advertised on EQUAL-
       Plus (see Attachment 16) by notifying their assignment NCO at the Chiefs' Group.
       Notification can be via telephone, e-mail, data fax, or electronic message.
       2.32.2.2. SMSgt and below use the self-service assignment preference application
       available through the vMPF to record CONUS or OS assignment preferences. To
       enhance the chance for selection to a desired location, the EQUAL should also be used
       (see Attachment 16). Airmen desiring to update their preferences should log onto the
       vMPF and select the self-service actions, under Assignments.
          2.32.2.2.1. Enlisted Airmen volunteer for special duty assignments (SDAs) via AMS
          by update of the SDA job number from the EQUAL-Plus ad (see Attachment 16).
          Enlisted Airmen are limited in volunteering for only those SDAs which appear as ads
          on EQUAL-Plus. In addition to this electronic application some SDAs also require a
          hard copy application. The requirement for a hard copy application will be reflected
          in the EQUAL-Plus ad.
          2.32.2.2.2. Each enlisted Airman is individually responsible for the currency and
          accuracy of his or her assignment preferences in vMPF. When a change in status
          occurs, for example, marriage, completion of a PCS, and so on, Airmen should update
          their preferences accordingly. Outdated preferences or no preferences on file will not
          be the basis for release of an enlisted Airman from an assignment for which selected.
2.33. PCS Notification. The AF needs to know as quickly as possible after selection if Airmen
have accepted a PCS or exercised another option. The prescribed means to transmit notices of
assignment selection from the assignment OPR to the MPS is either by the PDS or e-mail
message. When initial PCS selection, change in assignment location, or change in RNLTD is
received with less than 90 calendar days until the RNLTD, MPS and unit notification periods
indicated below are reduced to 3 calendar days each. When an Airman is absent from station, the
additional procedures shown in paragraph 2.33.7 apply.
   2.33.1. The MPS, unit commanders, and AF officials authorized to effect notifications must
   ensure local procedures are established and followed so notifications are in strict accordance
   with this instruction. Members may be told or become aware they have been selected for PCS
   in a variety of ways. However, "official" PCS notification takes place when the Airman’s
   unit commander or authorized official notifies the Airman in writing (electronic/digital
   signature is acceptable) of PCS selection and the Airman acknowledges notification in
   writing (electronic/digital signature is acceptable). NOTE: If an Airman acknowledges
   notification, regardless of who provides the notification, the Airman’s written
   (electronic/digital signature is acceptable) acknowledgment and election are still valid.
   2.33.2. Sometimes Airmen want to request a humanitarian assignment or deferment, or want
   to submit some other action for consideration when notified of selection for an event. They
   may also want to wait to make a binding decision on the event until they receive a decision
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                        75


   on their humanitarian, HSSAD or other request. Such delays are not authorized. If an
   Airman is willing to be bound by the AF's decision of approval or disapproval after due
   process of any request they submit, then advise the Airman to accept the event and associated
   ADSC within 7 calendar days and proceed with submission of the request. T he assignment
   will be changed or canceled as appropriate if the request is approved. However, when
   Airmen do not desire to accept an event or ADSC in the event a request they submit is
   disapproved, they should be advised to make a binding decision when initially notified
   because they will not be given another opportunity under 7-day option provisions when
   advised of disapproval. The eventual cancellation of a PCS requirement will not be the basis
   for allowing an Airman to withdraw an action taken under 7- day option provisions or
   (enlisted only) removal of a formal retainability declination statement, provided the
   requirement was valid at the time the Airman was notified of selection.
2.33.3. The 7 calendar day count begins the day after the date an Airman is officially notified
and ends at the close of MPS business hours on the seventh calendar day following official
notification. If the seventh calendar day is a weekend or holiday, then the official notification
period is extended to the first duty day thereafter. The MPS and unit suspenses are computed
similarly. EXAMPLE: An Airman acknowledges notification by the unit commander at 0930
hours, 15 Aug 2007 has until the close of business on 22 Aug 2007 (7 full calendar days), to
accept the assignment or take some other authorized action.

   2.33.4. Airmen must take one of the following actions, or contact the MPS within the same 7
   calendar day period to request counseling or assistance after acknowledging notification by
   the unit commander:
       2.33.4.1. Officers and Enlisted. Airmen must sign and date the notification showing
       their acceptance and return the notification to the MPS when they have the required
       retainability (see paragraph 2.29) and accept the assignment and/or ADSC.
       2.33.4.2. Officers only. Officers who have the required retainability (see paragraph
       2.29) but who do not want to participate in the event and/or do not want the associated
       ADSC, must submit retirement or separation application through the vMPF within 7
       calendar days of notification and must submit an application for separation or retirement,
       if eligible, under 7-day option provisions as required in paragraph 2.30.
       2.33.4.3. Enlisted only. Enlisted Airmen who have the required retainability (see
       paragraph 2.29) but want to retire in lieu of the PCS and/or ADSC, must submit
       retirement application through the vMPF within 7 calendar days of notification, if
       eligible, under 7-day option provisions as required in paragraph 2.30. Enlisted Airmen
       who have the required retainability are not eligible under 7-day option provisions to
       request separation in lieu of PCS.
       2.33.4.4. Enlisted only. Enlisted Airmen who do not have the required retainability and
       who do not want the assignment and/or ADSC, must report, in person, to the MPS within
       7 calendar days of notification and must sign a formal retainability declination statement
       when required by paragraph 2.29.
       2.33.4.5. Enlisted only. Enlisted Airmen who do not have the required retainability (see
       paragraph 2.29) and who accept the assignment and/or ADSC and want to obtain
76                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     retainability must sign and return the notification in person to the MPS within 7 calendar
     days. The MPS will suspense enlisted Airmen to obtain retainability at the earliest
     possible date, but not later than 30 calendar days after the date enlisted Airmen
     acknowledged selection. The MPS will reclama the assignment and have the enlisted
     Airman sign an AF Form 964 if they fail to obtain the required retainability within 30
     days of notification. If the enlisted Airman refuses to sign, the AF Form 964, then the
     MPS will take action according to paragraph 2.29.6. The MPS will not execute the AF
     Form 964 without the enlisted Airman’s knowledge.
     2.33.4.6. Enlisted only. Enlisted Airmen assigned OCONUS who, during their DEROS
     forecast, elect an OS Returnee assignment and do not have the required retainability (12
     months from DEROS month) must obtain it within 30 days of election. If they fail to
     obtain the required retainability within 30 days of DEROS forecast, the MPS will have
     the Airman sign an AF Form 964. If the Airman refuses to sign, the AF Form 964, then
     the MPS will take action according to paragraph 2.29.6. The MPS will not execute the
     AF Form 964 without the enlisted Airman’s knowledge.
  2.33.5. When the assignment selection notice is via the PDS, the MPS reviews the PCS
  Notification Report within 7 calendar days of receipt, confirms Airman’s eligibility, and
  forwards the PCS notification RIP either electronically or via distribution to the Airman’s
  unit. The unit commander or authorized official must then notify the Airman within 7
  calendar days or receipt of notice from the MPS. When the MPS identifies a PCS
  ineligibility condition and there is no indication a waiver or exception has been granted, the
  MPS will reclama the selection per paragraph 2.46 and will not forward the notice to the
  unit.
  2.33.6. The instrument to record official notification and acknowledgment may be either the
  PCS Notification RIP, or an official e-mail notification initiated by the AFPC assignment
  team. If an e-mail is used, it must contain at least the following information.
     2.33.6.1. The gaining location (unit, position number, and duty title are optional);
     2.33.6.2. RNLTD;
     2.33.6.3. ADSC (for officers) and retainability required (for enlisted), including
     ADSC/retainability for training, if applicable.
     2.33.6.4. If PCS is OS, the minimum required unaccompanied tour length (the
     accompanied tour length is optional);
     2.33.6.5. The AFSC in which selected;
     2.33.6.6. The signature and date the unit commander or authorized official effected
     notification;
     2.33.6.7. The signature and date the Airman acknowledged notification (date Airman
     acknowledges notification must be the same as the date officially notified in paragraph
     2.33.6.6 above);
     2.33.6.8. A statement directing the Airman to elect one of the two options below by
     initialing in the blank space (or block) in front of that option. After making an election,
     but not later than 7 calendar days from the date of official notification, direct the Airman
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                       77


       to report to the MPF/E Career Development element. Include the guidance in paragraph
       2.33.3.
          2.33.6.8.1. I accept the PCS (and training, if applicable) and the associated ADSC.
          2.33.6.8.2. Statements indicating: I do not desire the PCS and/or training; and/or I do
          not desire to incur the associated ADSC; and/or I do not desire to obtain the required
          retainability. I understand within 7 calendar days of notification, if eligible, I must
          sign and submit a request to separate (officers only); or a request to retire
          (officers/enlisted); or I must decline, in writing to obtain additional retainability
          (enlisted and only those officers who already have an established DOS). I also
          understand if within 7 calendar days of notification I am ineligible, or I fail to submit
          a request to separate (officers only) or retire (officers/enlisted), or I do not decline, in
          writing, to obtain retainability (enlisted only), then I will be considered to have
          accepted the PCS (and training, if applicable) and the associated ADSC.
          2.33.6.8.3. Optional statements may be added by the AFPC assignment OPR; for
          example, asking if the Airman desires counseling on humanitarian
          assignment/deferment or any other circumstances. Be sure to advise the Airman that,
          even though they may desire additional counseling, they must still choose one of the
          above options within 7 calendar days after notification.
   2.33.7. When the unit commander or official authorized by the commander cannot notify the
   Airman due to the Airman’s absence from the duty station (but the Airman will return within
   10 calendar days), the unit will delay notification until the Airman’s first duty day after
   return. If the Airman will be absent more than 10 calendar days, the unit will advise the MPS
   of the Airman’s status and provide the details on the Airman’s whereabouts (address, contact
   phone number, etc.). The MPS will notify the member, at his or her TDY location, leave
   address, etc., and assist the Airman with actions necessary to accept the assignment (for
   example, extension of enlistment), or exercise another option (request separation or
   retirement) as the circumstances and length of absence dictate. The fact an Airman is on
   leave or TDY must not delay the notification process. The Airman must make a decision to
   accept the PCS or exercise an authorized alternative within the prescribed timeframe. If for
   some reason an Airman cannot be notified in writing and must be advised by telephone, a
   second official should witness the call (conference call). A written record of what the Airman
   was told should be made and both officials should sign the document. Be sure the Airman
   understands the instructions and provide a contact point at the MPS (grade, name, duty title,
   telephone number), and advise the Airman to call if he or she has any questions or requires
   additional assistance. Require the Airman to acknowledge the telephone conversation via e-
   mail within 48 hours of the call and send the acknowledgment to the MPS. When Airmen
   are absent from station and are notified of PCS selection, then use the date the Airman
   acknowledges receipt of notification via e-mail or use the date Airman is personally
   contacted by phone. See paragraph 2.31 for actions permitted after establishment of an
   ASD.
2.34. PCS Notification and Orders in Hand Minimums. To allow sufficient time to plan
movement of dependents, HHG, and arrange other PCS-related actions, Airmen are normally
selected for PCS so official notification can be effected at least 90 calendar days before the
RNLTD. In addition, Airmen normally should have PCS orders in hand at least 60 calendar days
 78                                                           AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


before the PDD shown in the assignment instructions. However, there are numerous exceptions
listed in paragraph 2.34.1 when it is not practical or necessary to adhere to the minimums or an
Airman can anticipate he or she will be reassigned at a certain time (even though they may not
know where). There are also times when military requirements dictate less than 90 calendar days
notice and/or when orders cannot be given to the Airman within 60 calendar days of departure.
When military requirements preclude meeting these goals, the assignment OPR may waive the
minimums and will indicate in the assignment instructions that the minimums are waived. For
PCS movement to or from OS, orders may be issued prior to receipt of flight reservations.
   2.34.1. The minimum notice and orders in hand minimums do not apply to the following (no
   waiver is required):
       2.34.1.1. Flying, technical training, or other school graduate or eliminee assignments.
       2.34.1.2. When the Airman is being reassigned from OS.
       2.34.1.3. Approved self-initiated assignments.
       2.34.1.4. First assignment after basic or initial skill training.
       2.34.1.5. Assignment to training or education when necessary to avoid a quota going
       unfilled.
       2.34.1.6. Assignments which require SCI access.
       2.34.1.7. Low-cost PCS.
       2.34.1.8. When the Airman voluntarily waives the minimums.
       2.34.1.9. When Airman is surplus.
       2.34.1.10. General officer or colonel (including selectee) assignments.
       2.34.1.11. Upon accession (officers) or enlistment (enlisted) including assignment of
       former officer upon enlistment.
       2.34.1.12. When the PCS is for reasons other than prescribed by this instruction (such as
       upon accession or enlistment, to a hospital as a patient, prisoners to confinement, upon
       separation/retirement, and so on (see Attachment 22).
       2.34.1.13. When requirements according to AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation
       Procedures, have not been met.
   2.34.2. Orders directing an Airman who is TDY or on leave to PCS will not normally be
   published before the Airman’s return to current duty station, except:
       2.34.2.1. When the orders publishing function confirms the Airman will not incur a
       personal financial loss;
       2.34.2.2. The Airman’s unit or base is being inactivated;
       2.34.2.3. For humanitarian or EFMP assignment and the Airman signs a statement that
       he or she is willing to accept a financial loss if prompt reassignment is elected.
2.35. Change in Assignment or Assignment Data. Once an Airman has accepted an
assignment, the assignment OPR must exercise caution in approving changes to the original
assignment, especially any change after an Airman has departed on PCS (if the Airman has
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  79


departed, see paragraph 2.36, Diversion of an Airman En Route PCS). For example, a later
RNLTD or change which adds training may require additional retainability and/or greater
ADSC, or a change in gaining OS location may involve a longer OS tour length. Sometimes
changes cannot be avoided. When a change is directed prior to an Airman’s departure on PCS,
MPS’ and commanders will use the 3 calendar day notification period, the procedures in
paragraph 2.33, and the MPS will take the actions shown below:
   2.35.1. Change in gaining location (only). Once PCS orders are issued, a change in the
   gaining location could create a hardship on the Airman or, if they were a volunteer, they may
   not want an assignment to a different location. When the projected gaining location is
   changed, the MPS will authorize the Airman a second 7-day option period (see paragraph
   2.30). This may result in Airmen exercising an authorized option for which the Airman was
   not eligible at the time of initial notification. For example, when originally selected an
   Airman may not have been eligible to retire in lieu of PCS, but since then they have become
   eligible. When notified of the change of gaining location, they may opt at that time to retire
   in lieu of the change.
   2.35.2. Assignment data (other than gaining location) is changed requiring additional
   retainability or increase in the length of ADSC. Normally, changes in assignment data such
   as change of gaining unit, requirement for a security clearance, or even changes requiring
   additional retainability (when the Airman already possesses the retainability or already has a
   greater ADSC), do not warrant a second 7-day option opportunity. However, when the
   change requires additional retainability or increase in the length of ADSC, the MPS will
   afford the Airman a second 7-day option period (see paragraph 2.30) in which to accept or
   decline the change, if eligible. For example, enlisted Airman required to extend their
   enlistment or reenlist to satisfy the additional retainability requirement; or officers with a
   DOS who must execute a SPTC for additional retainability; or officers with an indefinite
   DOS who will incur a greater ADSC would require a second 7-day option period. This
   includes exercising any options the Airman was not eligible for at the time of initial
   notification.
2.36. Diversion of an Airman En Route PCS. When a change of projected gaining location is
required and the Airman is en route PCS (and has not arrived at the original gaining location),
change of assignment at this time is a "diversion." (Also see paragraph 2.36.3 and 2.36.4 for
continuation of PCS.) Use of the term diversion should signal a high degree of urgency to all
who are responsible for processing the change. A diversion can impose a severe personal and/or
financial hardship on the Airman, unfairly place an Airman at a disadvantage, and result in
excessive PCS costs to the government. Before directing a diversion, the assignment OPR must
carefully weigh the circumstances and alternatives. (See paragraph 4.17 for requests to place an
Airman in a 'TDY Hold" status when a temporary situation dictates an Airman not return to their
previous permanent duty station, nor proceed to the original gaining location, and a decision is
pending regarding a new gaining permanent duty station.) An Airman who is diverted en route
is not afforded a 7-day option period to take action in lieu of PCS since they have already
departed on PCS. A diversion might be necessary due to announcement of inactivation or
movement of a unit, announcement of weapon system conversion, or unforeseen urgent and
essential changes in manning requirements. The assignment OPR will make a determination on
a diversion after the following considerations have been made:
80                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  2.36.1. Whether or not the Airman was contacted and, if known, Airman’s volunteer status,
  present location, phone number where Airman can be reached, and any other pertinent
  information (location of dependents if different than Airman’s location, status of HHG, status
  of family member’s medical and educational clearance, etc.).
  2.36.2. When assignment involves an OS location, the following general guidelines apply.
     2.36.2.1. Whenever possible, Airmen selected for assignment OS as volunteers who are
     not vulnerable for involuntary OS selection are diverted within the same country to a
     location with the same tour length.
     2.36.2.2. Airmen selected for assignment OS as non-volunteers are diverted within the
     same OS theater and to a location with the same OS selection criteria (i.e., short tour,
     long tour), whenever possible.
     2.36.2.3. If dependents have been authorized concurrent travel, diversion of an Airman is
     rarely justified to a location where concurrent travel is not authorized.
     2.36.2.4. OS short tour returnees will not be assigned to CONUS-Isolated stations unless
     no other personnel are available or mission accomplishment would be impaired. Short
     tour returnees selected involuntarily can request release from a CONUS-Isolated station
     assignment through the MPS to assignment OPR, who is the final approval authority.
  2.36.3. Upon approval by the assignment OPR to change an Airman’s assignment, the losing
  MPS is advised. If the Airman has departed on PCS, the losing MPS will normally contact
  the Airman en route and effect notification. After the Airman has been notified, the losing
  MPS will immediately amend the original PCS orders and send copies to the Airman, the
  original gaining location, and the new gaining location. When the losing MPS cannot contact
  the Airman en route, then before amending orders, the losing MPS will immediately advise
  the assignment OPR, the original gaining MPS, the new MPS and the assignment OPR of the
  circumstances. The assignment OPR then must consider the probability that the Airman will
  arrive at the original PCS location before being advised of the change of assignment. In view
  of this, the assignment OPR will review the urgency of the requirement and other factors and
  may decide to cancel the change of assignment. However, if the circumstances still justify
  the change, the assignment OPR will contact the original gaining MPS and, provided the
  Airman has not yet arrived in the area, the assignment OPR will direct the original gaining
  MPS to issue amendments to PCS orders "continuing" the Airman’s PCS. Include the
  following statement in the amended orders, "This is a continuation of original assignment
  from (fill in previous permanent duty station) and Airman may be entitled to an additional
  dislocation allowance (DLA) as authorized by the JFTR." With the assistance of the original
  gaining unit commander and sponsor, the Airman is immediately informed upon arrival in
  the area of the change of assignment, given copies of the orders directing continuation of
  PCS, and directed to proceed to the new location without delay. If the Airman states
  continuation change of PCS will create a personal or financial hardship or protests the change
  of assignment for other reasons, the MPS will obtain the details in a written statement from
  the Airman and immediately contact the assignment OPR and request guidance.
     2.36.4. If, after an Airman arrives in the local area of the gaining base, it is decided to
     request the Airman be assigned elsewhere (whether or not they have signed in), then a
     new PCS is required. The fact an Airman has not signed in simply means accountability
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   81


       for the Airman has not transferred to the gaining base. For assignment purposes,
       completion of the travel portion of the PCS before approval of further assignment
       requires a new PCS. See paragraph 2.25 for time on station waivers and paragraph
       2.51 for waiver of second dislocation allowance (DLA) in the same fiscal year (FY).
       Intent to move or not move dependents or not to claim DLA is not a factor. A PCS
       cannot be continued nor a PCS order amended to change the permanent duty station after
       the RNLTD. In either of these instances a new PCS is required.
2.37. PCS Cancellation. Once an Airman is selected for PCS and orders are published,
cancellation of the assignment could impose a hardship on the Airman. A PCS should not
normally be canceled within 60 days of the PDD unless the Airman cannot be effectively used at
the projected location. Cancellation of a PCS may be authorized only by the assignment OPR.
The following actions are taken upon receipt of PCS cancellation:
   2.37.1. If an Airman has not departed on PCS, then the MPS advises the commander of the
   cancellation within 48 hours of receipt of the cancellation notice. If the Airman indicates a
   hardship will exist as a result of cancellation, then the MPS will direct the Airman to prepare
   a written statement without delay containing the details of the hardship. The statement
   should be expeditiously processed through the unit commander to the MPS. Upon receipt of
   the statement, the MPS will advise the assignment OPR by e-mail message. As a minimum,
   the e-mail message should contain the Airman’s grade, name, SSN, selected AFSC, AAN,
   RNLTD, gaining PAS, CONUS and OS assignment preferences, and specifics of the
   hardship. The assignment OPR will consider reinstatement of original assignment, provide
   an alternate assignment, or confirm cancellation and provide the reasons Airman is required
   to remain at the present base.
       2.37.2. If an Airman has departed on PCS, within 48 hours of receipt of the cancellation
       notice, the MPS will inform the unit commander and the MPS will effect notification to
       the Airman at their leave or TDY address (see paragraph 2.33), and direct the Airman to
       return to their previous duty station unless they desire to use leave. The MPS will request
       the Airman to provide written acknowledgment within 72 hours and state whether a
       hardship will or will not exist. If the Airman indicates a hardship, they must include the
       details. The MPS will then advise the assignment OPR by e-mail message as shown in
       paragraph 2.36.1. If the Airman cannot be reached, the MPS advises the assignment
       OPR of the circumstances and additional guidance will be provided. As information,
       when a PCS is canceled while the Airman is en route, their date arrived station does not
       change and availability for reselection for assignment does not change.
2.38. Pregnant Civilian Wife. An Airman may request consideration not to be en route PCS
during the 12-week closed period during which his civilian wife is expected to give child birth.
The 12-week closed period is 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after the expected delivery date. This
provision applies only when the wife will actually relocate as a result of PCS and the Airman’s
movement at an alternate time is compatible with AF requirements. The intent, to the degree
practical, is to enable the Airman to accompany his wife and relocate her at a time of less
difficulty, hardship, or risk. It is not intended to ensure the Airman’s presence at the time of
birth. Sometimes it may be necessary for an Airman to be en route PCS during this 12-week
closed period, for example, when PCS involves TDY en route for training which cannot be
rescheduled. When an Airman’s presence is medically essential during birth, the Airman may
request consideration for humanitarian deferment as outlined in Attachment 24.
 82                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   2.38.1. A request not to be en route PCS during the 12-week closed period must be
   submitted by the Airman, in writing, to the assignment OPR through the MPS within 7
   calendar days after official assignment notification, or immediately after the date an
   Airman’s wife is diagnosed as pregnant. Include in the request the action the Airman desires
   and state where the wife will move from and to. Attach a statement from the attending
   physician indicating the expected delivery date. Airman will receive consideration for
   change of PCS as follows: First, an Airman serving OS and accompanied by his wife
   (regardless of command sponsorship status) may request consideration of a voluntary
   extension of OS tour as outlined in paragraph 3.8.6. Second, an Airman may request a
   curtailment when the attending physician recommends curtailment, in writing, based on
   medical reasons (see Table 3.10). Extension or curtailment requests must be submitted
   without delay.
       2.38.1.2. An Airman serving in the CONUS whose wife is expected to give birth during
       the reporting month, the month before, or the month after, and the assignment is:
          2.38.1.2.1. CONUS to CONUS. The Airman should first determine if adjustment of
          personal travel or leave plans is possible to avoid relocation during the 12-week
          closed period. However, if adjustment of departure date necessitates a change of
          RNLTD, the Airman submits the request via the vMPF and provides the estimated
          date of delivery and the requested RNLTD. The assignment OPR will determine if the
          assignment will remain firm, if the RNLTD will be accelerated or delayed, or if some
          other action is necessary.
          2.38.1.2.2. CONUS to OS. The Airman submits request via the vMPF and provides
          the estimated date of delivery and the requested RNLTD. The assignment OPR will
          determine if the assignment will remain firm, if the RNLTD will be accelerated or
          delayed, or if some other action is necessary.
       2.38.1.3. Exceptions to the above provisions may be requested according to the criteria
       in paragraph 1.5. Exceptions based on medical reasons must contain a statement from
       the attending physician supporting the Airman’s request.
2.39. Pregnant Airmen. An Airman who is medically confirmed as pregnant is not normally
reassigned PCS while pregnant, except as provided for below. On receipt of AF Form 469, Duty
Limiting Conditions Report, confirming pregnancy, the Medical Treatment Facility update will
interface with MilPDS to update AAC 81 according to the instructions in Table 2.1, which will
automatically update ALC ―A‖ according to paragraph 2.39.5 and Table 2.2.
   2.39.1. The MPS will reclama assignments as follows:
       2.39.1.1. To any OS location (long or short tour location).
       2.39.1.2. Within the CONUS when the RNLTD is after the sixth month of pregnancy
       and the move is not a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1).
       2.39.1.3. To a CONUS-isolated station listed in Attachment 3.
   2.39.2. Airmen OS will be curtailed due to pregnancy as follows (also see Table 3.10).
       2.39.2.1. When the child is to be placed out for adoption. Return of an unmarried female
       Airman to the CONUS is necessary to prevent possible problems of citizenship for the
       child in the future. This provision does not apply to Airmen assigned to Alaska, Hawaii,
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     83


       or those other locations outside the CONUS if a child of an Airman is a US citizen at
       birth.
       2.39.2.2. Lack of obstetrical care or other medical considerations require the Airman be
       returned to the CONUS before DEROS.
       2.39.2.3. The Airman is assigned to a dependent-restricted location (that is, there is no
       accompanied-by-dependents tour authorized at that location, see the JFTR Vol 1,
       Appendix Q.).
       2.39.2.4. The Airman is assigned to a location where the unaccompanied tour length is
       less than 18 months and even though there may be an accompanied tour length authorized
       at the location, the Airman is not eligible, cannot qualify for, or is not permitted to serve
       an accompanied tour. The considerations here are family quarters, command sponsorship,
       and so on, not the availability of medical care.
   2.39.3. Pregnant Airmen in a mandatory PCS status (see Attachment 1) will not be
   reassigned:
       2.39.3.1. To any OS location (long or short tour).
       2.39.3.2. To any CONUS location during the 12-week closed period (6 weeks before or
       6 weeks after expected delivery date).
   2.39.4. During the 6-month period after the birth of a child to an Airman, deferment from
   PCS is authorized (see Table 2.2, ALC ―A‖). The intent is for the mother and child to bond
   during 6- month period. The military mother will be deferred from an assignment to a
   dependent- restricted overseas tour or an accompanied overseas tour when concurrent travel
   is denied. The military mother may waive this deferment. Unless the military mother waives
   the deferment, she is not to depart on PCS to an OS short location where the unaccompanied
   tour length is less than 18 months unless permission has been granted to serve the
   accompanied by dependents tour (when an accompanied tour is authorized). Regardless of
   the tour length of the OS location, concurrent travel must have been granted so the mother
   and child could travel OS together. The 6-month post-delivery deferment is not authorized if
   approval has been granted for the mother and child to travel OS concurrently. The 6-month
   deferment applies to any TDY.
       2.39.5. Requests from pregnant Airmen to proceed on PCS other than as permitted above
       may be submitted as an exception according to paragraph 1.5. A medical statement from
       the attending physician must be included supporting the Airman’s request. Justification
       must state if there are any complications, if it is a high-risk pregnancy or if there are any
       restrictions to travel (factors that make travel non-recommended).
2.40. Assignment Quality Control. All Airmen are responsible for meeting the AF quality
standards to remain on active duty. Commanders must take appropriate rehabilitative,
administrative, or disciplinary action for substandard Airmen. The assignment quality control
program establishes the minimum AF standards Airmen must meet to be eligible for PCS
reassignment.
   2.40.1. It is imperative commanders continuously monitor Airmen selected for reassignment
   until they depart. If an act or event disqualifies an Airman from reassignment before
   departure the commander must promptly request cancellation of the assignment to prevent
84                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  personal hardship on the Airman and detrimental impact on the AF mission. Commanders
  must prevent the reassignment of Airmen with known deficiencies and ensure action is
  initiated to defer selection for assignment until the deficiencies have been corrected.
  2.40.2. Although an Airman may be in a mandatory PCS status (see Attachment 1) or
  technically meet the eligibility criteria for PCS reassignment prescribed in this instruction,
  there may be performance, conduct, or other quality standards problems. All administrative
  (including dismissal/discharge) and disciplinary action must be considered and completed
  before an Airman is allowed to depart on PCS. When all appropriate action could not be
  taken before departure, then the losing unit commander formally notifies the gaining unit
  commander in writing of the reason(s) why the assignment was not canceled or
  administrative (including dismissal/discharge), disciplinary, or other action was not taken.
  This notification must be made as soon as possible and include a comprehensive analysis of
  the job-related or personal problems, and what rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary
  action has been taken.
  2.40.3. Assignment Ineligibility Criteria. The criteria listed below applies to all PCS moves
  except a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1). Usually, exceptions will not be considered
  except for approved humanitarian or EFMP assignment (Attachments 24 and 25) or for
  severe personal hardships that develop as a direct result of a short notice assignment
  cancellation. Requests for exceptions of quality control standards are forwarded for final
  decision to HQ AFPC/ DPAPP for lieutenant colonels and below, and to AF/DPO for
  colonels and colonel selects.
     2.40.3.1. Members in the following categories are ineligible for reassignment as
     indicated (RNLTD change will not be requested nor date of availability [DOA] changed
     to make an Airman eligible).
     2.40.3.2. AAC 10, enlisted Airmen nonselected for reenlistment, except mandatory PCS
     (see Attachment 1).
     2.40.3.3. AAC 12, Airmen who are serving Article 15, UCMJ punishment, if DOA is
     after the departure date.
     2.40.3.4. AAC 15, Airmen pending charges or trial by court-martial or civilian criminal
     court, if DOA is after the departure date.
     2.40.3.5. AAC 16, Airmen undergoing an observation period on the control roster, if
     DOA is after the departure date.
     2.40.3.6. AAC 17, Airmen under AFOSI or Security Forces investigation, if DOA is
     after the departure date (excludes normal security clearance investigations).
     2.40.3.7. AAC 19, Airmen whose most recent performance report (OPR/EPR) or final
     PCS performance report will be a referral report as defined in AFI 36-2406, Officer and
     Enlisted Evaluation, System. If the Airman’s DOA (AAC 19 expiration date) is after the
     projected departure, except for mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1) the Airman is
     ineligible to proceed on assignment. In addition, enlisted Airmen whose most recent
     EPR, or final PCS EPR is or will be a promotion recommendation of ―1‖ or ―2,‖ except
     mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1) are also ineligible to proceed on assignment.
     Commanders have the option of submitting another report after 120 days supervision to
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    85


     document improved performance. If a subsequent EPR is submitted (not a referral), the
     AAC 19 is deleted and Airman may proceed on assignment. If a subsequent report is not
     submitted, the AAC 19 will expire on the date of next projected report.
     2.40.3.8. AAC 21, Airmen with involuntary separation action initiated or recommended
     against them; Airmen undergoing Article 32 investigations; Airman is pending
     completion of action for desertion; officers found not qualified for promotion to first
     lieutenant; enlisted Airmen with an administrative demotion action initiated or planned;
     or when there are other reasons that, in the opinion of the commander (other reasons),
     should bar the Airman from reassignment. AAC 21 should only be updated when the
     commander has authorized the hold in writing, stating one of the specific reasons above.
     If citing ―other reasons‖, provide specific justification to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for
     lieutenant colonels and below, or AF/DPO for colonel and colonel selects. HQ
     AFPC/DPAPP or AF/DPO must approve the update of ―other reasons‖ before AAC 21
     will be updated to Airman’s record.
     2.40.3.9. Airmen failing to meet physical fitness standards. Failure to meet physical
     fitness standards does not, in itself, impact Airman’s assignment or assignment selection.
     However, commander-directed disciplinary/rehabilitative actions such as control roster,
     UIF, and such due to failure to meet physical fitness standards can preclude assignment
     or assignment selection. Recommended administrative/personnel actions for failure to
     meet physical fitness standards are addressed in AFI 10-408, Fitness Program,
     Attachments 13. Additional options not mentioned in AFI 10-408 may be considered.
     These options include requesting RNLTD delays as an exception to allow the Airman an
     opportunity to retest, as well as, requesting Commander- Directed Hold (AAC 21),
     providing specific justification to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for consideration. If the commander
     elects to request assignment cancellation due to administrative/personnel actions taken as
     a result of fitness failure, an assignment quality control review must be accomplished
     IAW paragraph 2.40.7.
     2.40.3.10. Enlisted Airmen with an approved administrative discharge which has been
     suspended for a period of probation and rehabilitation (separation ID Code "T", AFI 36-
     3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen).
     2.40.3.11. Enlisted Airmen not recommended for further upgrade training or removed
     from training for failure to progress (Training Status Code "T"), AFI 36-2201, V3, Air
     Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration
     2.40.3.12. Airmen who are financially irresponsible. Assignment restriction is based on
     the resultant administrative or disciplinary action and is not initiated as a direct result of
     this paragraph.
     2.40.3.13. Airmen are ineligible to apply for any of the following self-initiated
     assignment actions while in AAC 10 through 21 (excluding 14), regardless of DOA:
     COT, OS follow-on (as an exception, Airmen may submit an out of system request to the
     assignment OPR for consideration for a CONUS follow-on provided they can get the
     required retainability prior to departure on PCS and prior to using any follow-on PCS
     allowances), join spouse, CONUS- isolated, and for Airmen only, BOP, and VSBAP.
86                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     2.40.3.14. COTs and follow-on assignments OS are not mandatory PCS moves. When
     an Airman assigned OS, who has been selected for a COT or follow-on OS assignment,
     falls in any of the PCS ineligible categories listed in paragraph 2.40.3, the assignment
     will be canceled whenever the DOA is after the current DEROS.
  2.40.4. If at any time during an OS tour an Airman falls in any of the categories listed below,
  cancellation of an approved COT or follow-on OS assignment should be considered. When
  the Airman’s commander determine it is appropriate to cancel a COT or follow-on OS
  assignment based on any of these circumstances, the MPS will request cancellation of the
  assignment to HQ AFPC/DPAPP with complete specifics, to include the commander's
  recommendation and comments.
     2.40.4.1. The Airman or dependents have been involved in an unfavorable incident with
     foreign nationals during the current OS tour.
     2.40.4.2. The Airman has family problems which could be aggravated by continued OS
     assignment.
     2.40.4.3. There is evidence of poor performance or conduct (substantiated by
     OPRs/EPRs and/or a substantial and current unfavorable information file [UIF]) during
     the current OS assignment that may negate productivity in another OS area.
     2.40.4.4. There is evidence the Airman or dependents have medical problems to the
     degree that continued OS assignment is not recommended by medical authorities. The
     appropriate evidence should be provided by medical officers.
     2.40.4.5. There are other factors that, in the opinion of the commander, are or may be
     detrimental to the AF if the Airman is continued in an OS area.
  2.40.5. Involuntary DEROS extensions. Involuntary DEROS extensions are only required if
  an Airman is placed on AAC 17 (Under Security Forces or OSI Investigation) while in an OS
  area. All other involuntary DEROS extensions are optional at the commander’s discretion;
  procedures are in place to allow for completion of rehabilitation or disciplinary action at the
  OS location (See paragraph 3.10.2 )
     2.40.5.1. An AAC update (other than 13, 31 or 37) does not allow an Airman’s DEROS
     to expire; therefore if the commander elects to hold the Airman beyond the DEROS
     month, the request must be processed from the commander through the Special Courts
     Martial (SPCM) to the approval authority (WG/CC or higher) to extend the DEROS (see
     paragraph 3.10.2). Involuntary DEROS extensions are only approved in 30-day
     increments, and only up to 120 days total, without prior approval from HQ
     AFPC/DPAPP. Commanders must submit 30-day, involuntary DEROS extension
     requests each month, with a new letter from the WG/CC each month, until the pending
     action is complete or until the unit commander elects to release the Airman.
  2.40.6. Procedures. Upon receipt of an assignment notification, the MPS reviews the
  Airman’s record to determine eligibility for the assignment and completes one of the
  following actions:
     2.40.6.1. If any of the conditions in paragraphs 2.40.3 or 2.40.4 exist, or the MPS
     believes the assignment should be canceled (UIF is substantial and current, etc.), the MPS
     notifies the Airman’s commander of the need to request cancellation of the assignment
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  87


     and the reasons for such action. When the Airman’s commander confirms the assignment
     should be canceled, the MPS reclamas the assignment to the assignment OPR.
     2.40.6.2. When the MPS review indicates the Airman appears to meet quality standards,
     the PCS notification is forwarded to the Airman’s commander. The commander is
     referred to this paragraph to help determine the Airman’s suitability for the assignment.
     Coordination with the Airman’s immediate supervisor and appropriate base agencies may
     be necessary to confirm assignment eligibility. If there is evidence of substandard
     performance or conduct (not previously recorded) which would disqualify the Airman for
     PCS, the commander notifies the MPS via e-mail requesting the assignment be canceled
     providing the specific reasons and the corrective or disciplinary action that has or will be
     taken. If this notification is based on data not already part of the UIF, or is based on
     contemplated action, it is filed in the Airman’s PIF until eligibility is restored.
     2.40.6.3. If there is a disagreement on a Airman’s assignment eligibility it is resolved at
     the next higher level of command.
  2.40.7. Mandatory PCS Assignments. OS returnees, Airmen surplus to requirements,
  Airmen disqualified to remain at a special duty assignment, Airmen relieved from duty for
  cause, and students although mandatory movers, are not exempt from quality control action
  required by paragraphs 2.40. Those administrative or disciplinary actions which are
  appropriate must be taken and should be completed before an Airman is reassigned. When all
  appropriate action has not been taken/completed, the reassignment must be approved by HQ
  AFPC/DPAPP.
  2.40.8. Requests for Assignment Cancellation or Requests for Quality Reviews. A request
  from a gaining commander, or MPS for cancellation of assignment or for an assignment
  quality review is appropriate only if some new PCS disqualifying factor becomes known that
  was not considered in the assignment selection process or by the losing commander.
  Requests for cancellation from MAJCOM functional managers will be considered for
  mission impacting reasons. Current UIF contents, previous OPRs/EPRs, and past
  rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary actions are not a basis to challenge an
  assignment nor is the fact an Airman has a current quality control AAC, provided it expires
  before the departure date. The following steps and procedures apply if a request for
  assignment cancellation or quality review becomes necessary. (Ensure an information copy
  of all correspondence is provided to the losing and gaining commanders, the assignment OPR
  and HQ AFPC/ DPAPP).
     2.40.8.1. A request will be sent from the gaining MSS/CC or MPS Commander to the
     losing MSS/CC or MPS Commander who should review the case with the losing
     commander to determine if the Airman meets the minimum PCS standards.
     2.40.8.2. If the losing commander agrees that the assignment should be canceled, the
     losing MSS/CC or MPS Commander requests cancellation from HQ AFPC/DPAPP and
     provides the specific reasons for the disqualification and indicates the rehabilitative,
     administrative, or disciplinary action taken by the commander (i.e., control roster, Article
     15, etc.).
     2.40.8.3. If the losing commander confirms the Airman is qualified for the assignment,
     the losing MSS/CC or MPS commander advises the gaining MSS/CC or MPS
 88                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      commander. If the gaining commander still does not agree, then the gaining MSS/CC or
      MPS commander elevates the case to the HQ AFPC assignment OPR.
      2.40.8.4. The AFPC assignment OPR reviews the case and if assignment cancellation
      appears appropriate, provides HQ AFPC/DPAPP with specific justification to cancel the
      assignment. The final decision as whether or not to cancel the assignment rests with HQ
      AFPC/DPAPP.
   2.40.9. Requests to Return Unqualified Personnel. Airmen who have departed PCS will not
   be returned to the losing unit except in those cases specifically authorized by HQ
   AFPC/DPAPP. Based on PCS costs and personal hardships which may result, return will
   normally be approved only when the action for which the return is requested cannot be
   completed at the gaining unit. Requests to return Airmen for the purpose of administering
   disciplinary actions such as Article 15, letters of reprimand, or control roster will usually not
   be approved. Such actions can be completed at the gaining location. When it is appropriate,
   the losing commander sends all available information, including correspondence from the
   gaining commander, to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for a final decision on the return request.
   2.40.10. Compliance Responsibilities. Compliance with these procedures is the inherent
   responsibility of both commanders and the personnel staff. Commanders have the ultimate
   responsibility of ensuring only quality personnel are retained in the AF and permitted to be
   reassigned. Decisions to cancel, reassign, or return Airmen will be based on the overall best
   interest of the AF. The intent is to ensure that an Airman’s problems are resolved (through
   rehabilitation, dismissal, or discharge) at the location where they arose. On an individual
   basis, AF/DPO for colonel and colonel selects, and HQ AFPC/ DPAPP, for lieutenant
   colonel and below and all enlisted, may direct the cancellation of an assignment, diversion to
   another base, waiver of PCS disqualifying factors, or the return of an Airman to the losing
   base when such action is clearly in the best interest of the AF.
2.41. Reporting of Disqualified Officers/Enlisted and Officers Eliminated from Flying or
Technical Training.
   2.41.1. Disqualified Officers/Enlisted.
      2.41.1.1. Operations Officers (Rated and Nonrated). Within 5 workdays of an operation
      officer being disqualified for aviation service according to the process shown in AFI 11-
      402, the unit commander will notify (via email) the HQ AFPC assignment OPR. The
      notification will contain the information shown in Figure 2.3. Within 5 work days, HQ
      AFPC/DPASF (or other assignment OPR when appropriate) will provide assignment
      instructions.
      2.41.1.2. Support Officers. Within 5 work days of support officers being disqualified
      from performing in their current DAFSC (for example, permanently PRP decertified or
      medically disqualified) by message in the format in Figure 2.4, the unit commander will
      notify (via email) the HQ AFPC assignment OPR (e-mail must be encrypted). Within 5
      work days, HQ AFPC/DPASF (or other assignment OPR when appropriate) will provide
      assignment instructions.
      2.41.1.3. Enlisted. Within 5 workdays of completion of action per AFI 36-2101,
      Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), the unit commander will report
      (via email) disqualified enlisted Airmen to the HQ AFPC assignment OPR. Be sure to
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  89


      include any additional pertinent information and if there is any administrative or
      disciplinary action pending and the details. E-mail must be encrypted. The assignment
      OPR will provide assignment instructions within 5 workdays of receipt.
   2.41.2. Officers Eliminated from Flying Training or Technical Training. When an officer is
   attending flying training or technical training in PCS status, or TDY en route PCS status, and
   is formally eliminated from training, then the commander will report the elimination to HQ
   AFPC/DPAOT1 (officers attending flying training) OR HQ AFPC/DPASF (officers
   attending technical training) within 5 workdays of elimination via encrypted e-mail in the
   format in Figure 2.3. If the training is undergraduate flying training (UFT), include HQ
   AETC/DOT( ) (enter appropriate office symbol) and AETC/DPAOS as addressees (use
   format in Figure 2.4).

2.42. Advance Academic Degree (AAD) Assignment (Officers). This paragraph implements
DOD Directive 1322.10, Policy on Graduate Education for Military Officers, and AFI 36-2302,
Professional Development and Academic Degrees and Professional Continuing Education.
Officers who receive advance degrees (Masters or Doctors of Philosophy [Ph.D.]) through fully
funded programs, must be assigned for a minimum of 3 years to a manpower authorization which
requires their specific degree and academic discipline (that is, an AAD position). It is the intent
that officers be assigned to an AAD position initially following graduation. When, for
operational reasons, immediate assignment upon graduation to an AAD position is not possible,
the officer may delay fulfilling the 3 year AAD assignment requirement until the second
assignment after graduation. Assignment OPRs and commanders are responsible for ensuring
proper utilization and assignment of officers who receive AADs. Therefore, during the 3 year
period following graduation, or in instances where a delay to an AAD assignment has been
granted, any change in duty position of the officer requires the advance approval of the
functional assignment team. Additionally, HQ AFPC/DPAPE must coordinate on assignments
of officers awarded an AFIT-sponsored AAD. When assignment to an AAD position is not
possible as the second assignment following graduation, then consideration may be given to
permanently waive the requirement to serve 3 years in an AAD position and is at the discretion
of the respective AFPC Officer Assignment Division Chief after consultation with AU/CFR.
However this should be done only as a last resort. The requirement to serve 3 years in an AAD
position is in addition to an ADSC requirement (see AFI 36-2107, table 1.1), or mandatory
utilization requirement (see paragraph 2.60). For example, an officer graduates from a Master's
 92                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


degree program sponsored by AFIT but because of vulnerability for an OS involuntary short tour
assignment, the officer is not assigned immediately upon graduation to an AAD position. The
officer must be granted to delay assignment to an AAD position until the officer completes the
OS tour. Upon return from OS, a requirement still exists to assign the officer to an AAD
position for 3 years (even though a portion of the ADSC for the master's degree has been
served). When upon return from OS, for operational reasons the officer still cannot be assigned
to an AAD position, then the officer must again be granted relief from fulfilling the AAD
requirement. As stated above, at this time consideration should be given to permanently waiving
the requirement to be assigned to an AAD position.
   2.42.1. HQ AFPC/DPA is responsible for the management of PhDs and masters degree
   candidates in AAD training programs. Execution of the process is delegated to each
   functional assignment team, while oversight is provided by HQ AFPC/DPAPE. Oversight
   consists of adherence to paragraph 2.42, applicable timelines and assignment procedures.
   Officers self- nominate through their functional assignment team, which in turn, prepares
   nominations for review during one of their functional community’s Development Team
   meetings. Once selected, HQ AFPC/DPAPE matches officers to requirements at specific
   colleges/universities and processes assignment actions to the AAD program.           HQ
   AFPC/DPAPE updates AAC 48 (See Table 2.1) in PDS. Each functional assignment team,
   in coordination with HQ AFPC/DPAPE, will process the subsequent assignment upon
   graduation from school.
   2.42.2. When, due to operational requirements, an officer cannot fill an AAD position after
   graduation, or at any subsequent time if the initial immediate requirement is waived, the
   AAD payback delay or permanent waiver, must be coordinated through AU/CFR by the
   assignment OPR.
   2.42.3. Assignment OPRs give priority assignment consideration to officers who have
   obtained AADs through fully-funded programs when filling AAD positions; however,
   officers possessing AADs earned by other means will also be used to fill AAD requirements
   whenever possible.
   2.42.4. If the pool of available and qualified officers for a given academic cycle is such that
   not all Air Force Educational Requirement Board (AFERB) AAD requirements can be filled,
   the AAD program requirement, and thus the follow-on position, can be changed by the
   functional assignment team, if approved by AU/CFR.
   2.42.5. If the subsequent AAD position for an AFERB AAD requirement is such that it
   cannot be supported due to operational and /or force development requirements, the
   subsequent AAD position may be substituted with another valid AAD position by the
   functional assignment team, if approved by AU/CFR.
2.43. Assignment of Airmen Who Were Previously Designated as "Missing" (Including
PWs/ MIAs). Airmen placed in a "missing" casualty status as the result of hostilities, either
armed conflict or terrorist activities, are normally given an assignment limitation upon their
return to US control. This limitation applies only to Airmen who subsequent to being declared
missing are officially categorized as Missing, Missing in Action (MIA), Captured (PW),
Beleaguered, Besieged, Detained (Hostage), or Interned as defined in AFI 36-3002, Casualty
Services.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     93


   2.43.1. The purpose of this provision is to limit assignment, TDY, or PCS to areas where
   Airmen are not accessible to the same combatants, terrorists, or nations sympathetic with the
   combatants or terrorists. This limitation is void in the event of general mobilization. Airmen
   may request the assignment limitation be removed; however, the limitation is not
   automatically removed based solely on the Airman’s request. A request for removal may be
   disapproved and the assignment limitation continued when the limitation is considered to be
   in the best interests of the AF, for example, based on security considerations. When an
   Airman submits a request for removal, HQ AFPC/DPAPP will staff the request to determine
   if removal is appropriate and advise the Airman, and Airman’s commander of approval or
   disapproval.
   2.43.2. HQ AFPC/DPAPP, in conjunction with HQ AFPC/DPFCM, Missing Persons
   Branch, and other activities, when necessary, will determine when action should be taken or
   continued in conjunction with this paragraph to limit future assignment. Upon Airman’s
   return to US control, HQ AFPC/ DPFCM will provide HQ AFPC/DPAPP a copy of DD
   Form 1300, Report of Casualty. In turn, HQ AFPC/DPAPP will issue a memorandum as a
   source document, with the DD Form 1300 as an attachment, to the Airman’s unit commander
   and the Airman, directing update of ALC ―7‖ in the PDS. The memorandum instructs the
   commander to contact and brief the Airman on the assignment limitation. Unless the Airman
   requests, in writing, to HQ AFPC/ DPAPP that the limitation be removed and the removal
   request is approved, then the Airman is restricted from PCS and/or TDY as stated above.
   Scan the correspondence in the Airman’s electronic ARMS record.
2.44. Officer Duty Changes (Lieutenant Colonel and below). Duty changes are centrally
managed by the assignment OPR via the Duty AFSC (DAFSC) change request process. All
levels of command, all supervisors, and all personnel and assignment managers share
responsibility and accountability for utilization and assignment of officers in the most efficient
and cost effective manner possible. However, the assignment OPR is primarily responsible and
accountable for inventory control of the number of officers serving in each AFSC and ensuring
officers are utilized consistent with law; Congressional, DOD, and HQ USAF functional area
OPR directions; AF directives and instructions; and other guidance.
   2.44.1. The following general rules apply to duty change requests:
       2.44.1.1. Any level of command may initiate a DAFSC change request for operational
       reasons.
       2.44.1.2. Approval of a duty change in itself does not guarantee an officer will continue
       permanently to serve in the new duty or for a specified period of time. Commanders may
       request deferment (AAC 39) not to exceed 12 months for officers who receive an
       approved duty change from one utilization field to another based on operational needs.
       2.44.1.3. Only career officers (see Attachment 1), may request a change of duty to a
       different utilization field. Officers with a DOS within 90 days of the date of a request
       and those with an ASD are not eligible to request a duty change. Members may request a
       change of utilization field by submitting a duty (DAFSC) change request if they believe
       the change will result in better utilization of their qualifications to meet AF requirements.
       Duty changes for professional development may be disapproved when an officer’s
       performance in current duty is unsatisfactory, when they do not meet the prerequisites for
       entry into the requested AFSC, when the duty requested would not be economical use of
94                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


     their training and/or experience, or when overall manning in their current duty precludes
     release.
     2.44.1.4. For officers (operations (rated or nonrated) or support) disqualified from duty
     in their DAFSC and officers eliminated from flying training or technical training who are
     attending in PCS status or TDY en route PCS status, see paragraph 2.42.
     2.44.1.5. Duty change requests involving assignment/utilization (PCA or PCS) of
     officers in a different competitive category may be considered as an exception to policy
     as outlined in paragraph 1.5. Normally, PCS of members in conjunction with such
     assignments will not be approved. (NOTE: Change of an Airman’s DAFSC to match the
     DAFSC of a manpower authorization or change of the manpower authorization DAFSC
     to match an officer does not resolve the competitive category mismatch.) To change
     competitive categories officers may submit a request for competitive category transfer
     per AFI 36-2106.
  2.44.2. To ensure compliance with these requirements and to provide all officers fair and
  equitable opportunities, the assignment OPR is the approval authority for the following
  officer duty changes:
     2.44.2.1. From one utilization field to another (for example, from AFSC 11XX to
     36XX).
     2.44.2.2. From the staff level to the director and commander level.
     2.44.2.3. Involving waiver of the specialty eligibility requirements. Members must meet
     the specialty eligibility requirements shown in the Air Force Officer Classification
     Directory (AFOCD), unless a waiver of the requirements has been requested and
     approved. The assignment OPR must be advised of any approved waivers when a duty
     change is requested. Approval of a waiver of the specialty eligibility requirements does
     not necessarily mean the duty change being requested will be approved.
     2.44.2.4. When it is proposed a rated officer attend a command-sponsored formal
     training course. Send proposed changes in advance to HQ AFPC/DPAO by message for
     approval.
     2.44.2.5. DAFSC change resulting from classification actions per AFI 36-2101,
     Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).
  2.44.3. HQ AFPC assignment OPR approval is not required for the following duty changes:
     2.44.3.1. Normal upgrade of the DAFSC to the fully qualified level.
     2.44.3.2. Change directed by the assignment OPR incident to assignments.
     2.44.3.3. Changes as a result of completion of formal education and/or training courses.
  2.44.4. Duty change (DAFSC) requests are submitted to the MPS on AF Form 2096,
  Classification/On-the-Job-Training Action or via in-system requests. Requests from officers
  must include "Self-initiated" in Section V and include the unit commander's recommendation
  in Section VI. Using data from the AF Form 2096, the MPS updates the PDS. Include the
  following in the Remarks section (abbreviate to the degree the request is understandable). If
  necessary, submit out of system.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    95


       2.44.4.1. State the reason for the request and how the best interests of the AF are served.
       2.44.4.2. Indicate if officer and commander concur or nonconcur. Concurrence is not
       required, but should be solicited.
       2.44.4.3. Indicate if operational deferment is also requested.
2.45. Position Numbers Bypass Routine. A bypass position number enables MPS’ to report
assignment data such as rated position identifier (RPI), program element code (PEC), functional
account code (FAC), and so forth, when there is no valid manpower authorization in the unit to
which assigned for the officer's DAFSC. When assigned to a valid position, most duty
information is automatically updated from the manpower position number. A bypass position
number must not be used to circumvent assignment/utilization policies. Its intended use, for
example, is to report duty assignment data for an Airman who will fill an approved manpower
authorization but the authorization has not yet been updated through the manpower data system,
or to record the temporary duty (TDY) assignment at the same duty station of an Airman as club
manager due to the loss of the incumbent civilian club manager.
   2.45.1. If a manpower position number exists for an Airman’s DAFSC in the unit to which
   assigned, regardless of where in the unit the Airman may be physically performing duty, the
   Airman will be assigned against a valid position as an alternate to the primary person
   assigned.
   2.45.2. The assignment OPR may use the bypass position number to effect essential duty
   change actions or to project an assignment when the specific position number has not been
   determined or the assignment must occur despite the lack of an authorization.
   2.45.3. Colonels (including selects) will not be assigned to bypass position numbers without
   the advance approval of the MAJCOM Senior Officer Management Office
   (MAJCOM/DPO), or equivalent, or AF/DPO.
   2.45.4. Rated officers assigned a rated duty AFSC and required to perform operational flying
   duty should be reported in RPI 1, 2, 6, or 8. Rated officers assigned to a rated duty AFSC but
   not required to perform operational flying duty should be report in RPI 3 or 4.
2.46. Reclama of Assignment. A reclama (or formal protest) is a request to the assignment
OPR to change or cancel a proposed or directed action. A reclama may be submitted in-system
or out of system by e-mail message for actions which are time sensitive or when a paragraph or
attachment specifies a reclama message be submitted. Message reclamas should include the
gaining unit. Be sure to include the Airman’s identification data in the message subject and
include the projected assignment Shipping AFSC (for officers) and Control AFSC (for enlisted).
   2.46.1. In-system reclamas are usually submitted when the RNLTD is more than 120
   calendar days from the date of the reclama using the appropriate reclama reason codes.
   Ensure narrative remarks are included to fully explain the circumstances.
   2.46.2. Out of system reclamas are usually submitted when the RNLTD is 120 days or less
   from the date of the reclama and should contain a complete explanation of the circumstances.
   Use an e-mail for actions involving:
       2.46.2.1. Contingency assignments, or
       2.46.2.2. Unit or base activation or deactivation, or
 96                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      2.46.2.3. Weapons systems conversions, or
      2.46.2.4. Assignment was a short-notice assignment as shown in paragraph 2.33.
      2.46.2.5. Enlisted only. Reclamas will not be submitted when assignment action reason
      (AAR) is E2 or has a "P" series AAR (except P7).
      2.46.2.6. Enlisted Aircrew Members. The MPS must reclama if enlisted aircrew
      members receive less than 120 calendar days' advance notification for involuntary
      assignment to duty that does not require flying status. Use reclama reason code "AM"
      with trailer remarks that state: "Aircrew member provided less than 120 calendar days'
      notification. Airman notified (date). Projected departure date is (date)." If Airman
      waives the 120 calendar days' notice requirement, then a reclama is not submitted.
2.47. Surplus (and Overage) Management.
   2.47.1. A surplus (including excess) exists when there are more people assigned to a location
   than there are manpower authorizations in a grade and AFSC for officers, or in a career field
   ladder for enlisted. (In most cases, for enlisted manning purposes, a career field ladder
   includes manpower authorizations in grades AB through SMSgt in an AFS. However, when
   the duties in a particular AFSC are significantly different than others within the AFS or in
   cases where AFSCs merge at certain skill levels, then, with concurrence of the assignment
   OPR, ladder manning may be based on specific AFSCs.) The fact that a condition meets the
   definition of surplus, in itself, does not mean that PCA or PCS reassignment action will be
   taken to resolve it. The AFPC Functional Managers will work with MAJCOM Functional
   Managers, as necessary, to resolve surplus issues. When authorizations are deleted,
   commanders will identify surplus Airmen to the AFPC assignment OPR. The AFPC
   assignment OPR will determine whether or not the surplus Airmen can fill another local
   position. When local positions do not exist, the assignment OPR will determine appropriate
   disposition. As a general guideline, PCS action is not normally justified when a surplus is
   projected to be resolved in 6 months or less, such as by attrition. Airmen may not declare
   themselves surplus.
   2.47.2. Per DOD direction, PCS eligibility exceptions based on surplus (for example, no
   waiver of minimum TOS required) are authorized for use only when the reason for surplus is
   one of those listed below. Reassignment for other reasons which meet the definition of
   surplus may be considered on a case-by-case or group basis according to paragraph 1.5, or
   it may be possible other PCS eligibility exceptions may be applicable (for example, no
   waiver of minimum TOS required for PCS to or from training).
      2.47.2.1. Unit inactivation, or
      2.47.2.2. Base closure or consolidation, or
      2.47.2.3. Organization or staffing changes, or
      2.47.2.4. Reclassification or loss of AFSC, or
      2.47.2.5. Promotion to the grade of colonel or CMSgt, or
      2.47.2.6. Disqualification for duty without reclassification or loss of AFSC, for example,
      loss of security clearance, SCI access, professional certification, nuclear certification,
      medical qualification, or relief from duty for cause. A person who loses qualification to
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   97


     perform the duties of a particular manpower position may still possess the mandatory
     qualifications to hold an AFSC. In itself, loss of a qualification does not necessarily
     result in an Airman being surplus (or excess). Commanders will identify surplus Airmen
     to the AFPC assignment OPR. Whenever possible, these Airmen are reassigned to
     positions in their AFSC for which they are still qualified at the same location. However,
     there are times when all positions at a location require a particular qualification, or
     assignment to another position at the same location is not practical for some reason. In
     such cases, assignment requests may be submitted as exceptions with justification IAW
     paragraph 1.5.
  2.47.3. In keeping with DOD guidelines, surpluses will be managed by duty location.
  Reassignment to resolve a surplus will be considered in the following order:
     2.47.3.1. PCA (without PCS) intracommand, then intercommand, for duty in:
         2.47.3.1.1. Current DAFSC (officers) or CAFSC skill level (enlisted); and then
         2.47.3.1.2. For duty in any awarded AFSC.
     2.47.3.2. When PCS is necessary to resolve a surplus, then:
         2.47.3.2.1. For Airmen assigned in the CONUS, see paragraph 2.47.6.1, or
         2.47.3.2.2. If currently assigned OS, see paragraph 2.47.6.2.
     2.47.3.3. Exceptions to this order may be requested IAW paragraph 1.5 (For example,
     while one location may have a surplus there may be shortages at other locations. Instead
     of directing the PCA of Airmen for duty in any awarded AFSC, the best interests of the
     AF might be served to direct PCS of an Airman in his or her current DAFSC for officers
     or CAFSC for enlisted.)
  2.47.4. Officers. Surpluses at a location in one grade and AFSC are sometimes offset by
  shortages in other grades and such circumstances may be acceptable without assignment
  action. However, sometimes the overall experience level, the particular grades in which
  surpluses exist, or other factors may warrant considering reassignment action to effect a more
  acceptable balance. Availability of PCS funds, length of time the surplus is projected to
  exist, and other pertinent factors will determine if grade and AFSC mismatches are resolved
  by reassignment action. Because of the variables, it is not possible to specify all of the
  circumstances when reassignment action will or will not be authorized to resolve a surplus.
  Commanders will submit a surplus request to the AFPC assignment team. AFPC assignment
  team will work with the MAJCOM Functional Managers, as necessary, to resolve these
  issues.
  2.47.5. Enlisted. A mismatch where the number assigned is greater than the number
  authorized at a location in various grades and/or skill levels of a career field ladder does not
  technically meet the definition of surplus (see paragraph 2.48). Therefore, assignment
  action is not normally necessary to resolve these mismatches. See paragraph 2.7. However,
  the overall experience level, the particular grades and/or skill levels of the mismatches, or
  other factors may warrant considering reassignment action (PCA or PCS) to effect a more
  acceptable grade and/or skill level balance. Availability of PCS funds, length of time the
  problem is projected to exist, and other factors will determine the extent to which grade
  and/or skill level mismatches are resolved by reassignment action. Because of the variables,
98                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  it is not possible to specify all of the circumstances when reassignment action will or will not
  be authorized to resolve a surplus or grade and/or skill level mismatches when there is no
  surplus. The AFPC Functional Managers will work with MAJCOM Functional Managers, as
  necessary, to resolve these issues.
     2.47.5.1. Reclassified/Disqualified Airmen: Airmen removed or disqualified from their
     primary duties may be declared surplus if local manning requirements do not exist in
     their secondary AFSC. Upon removal, commanders will contact the AFPC assignment
     OPR for assistance in placing the member into a local position. NOTE: Many special
     duty identifiers (such as retraining and MTI) have specific disqualification/removal
     processes. Please continue to utilize these established procedures.
  2.47.6. When PCS is necessary to resolve surpluses (or when PCS is requested as an
  exception to resolve enlisted grade and/or skill level mismatches), the following process will
  be used to identify the order in which Airmen should be reassigned. Note that deletion of an
  authorization in one squadron resulting in a surplus could result in an Airman elsewhere at
  the same location (for example, at wing level, in another MAJCOM, etc.) actually being the
  Airman (by-name) who is surplus to that location's total requirements. When authorizations
  are deleted, commanders will contact the AFPC assignment OPR for assistance in placing the
  surplus Airmen into another local position. A PCS may be appropriate, if a local position is
  not available. It is not necessarily the incumbent of the position which is deleted who is most
  eligible to be declared surplus to a duty station's total requirements. Airmen who are surplus
  who have insufficient retainability for PCS, those who must remain at a location for
  disciplinary action, Airmen assigned OS not recommended for further OS assignment, etc.,
  will be reported to the assignment OPR for disposition. Exceptions to the order prescribed
  below may be requested IAW paragraph 1.5 on a group or case-by-case basis.
     2.47.6.1. At a CONUS location, when a surplus exists (or, for enlisted, when PCS is
     requested as an exception to resolve grade and/or skill level mismatches) the AFPC
     assignment OPR will arrange all Airmen assigned to a location (without regard to
     MAJCOM) in a specific grade and AFSC for officers, and grade, and/or skill level and
     AFSC for enlisted, in order of TOS (without regard to AACs, volunteer status for PCS,
     organizational level, MAJCOM, etc.) with longest TOS being the most eligible. Airmen
     do not volunteer to be surplus. Assignment preferences are considered after an Airman
     has been identified for PCS. The assignment OPR will consider commander or
     MAJCOM Functional Manager requests to retain individual Airmen as exceptions.
     Airmen vulnerable for OS PCS selection within 24 months are selected on a priority basis
     for OS assignments as shown in Table 3.3 and Table 3.4. Airmen not vulnerable for OS
     PCS selection, or when no OS requirements exist, are allocated for CONUS assignment
     according to the guidance in paragraph 1.3.
     2.47.6.2. At an OS location, when a surplus exists (or, for enlisted, when PCS is
     requested as an exception to resolve grade and/or skill level imbalances) the AFPC
     assignment OPR will arrange all Airmen assigned to a location (without regard to
     MAJCOM) in a specific grade and AFSC for officers, and grade, and/or skill level and
     AFSC for enlisted, as shown below. Airmen do not volunteer to be surplus. Assignment
     preferences are considered after an Airman has been identified for PCS according to the
     following process:
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   99


         2.47.6.2.1. Sequence Airmen in order of least time remaining from date they become
         surplus to current DEROS (for example, 1 month to 36 or more months), with least
         number of months remaining to DEROS being most eligible. Compute time
         remaining to DEROS from date entered current IPCOT, not total TOS for Airmen
         currently serving IPCOTs. Use time remaining to DEROS as extended, not total TOS
         for Airmen who have approved extensions of OS tour. Airmen who have voluntary
         extensions of OS tours who have not entered the extension may request cancellation
         IAW Table 3.10, rule 25. Every Airman on this list is offered the opportunity to
         volunteer for a consecutive OS tour (COT) according to the guidelines in
         Attachment 4. For those Airmen ineligible for a COT, those who do not volunteer
         for a COT or those not selected for a COT, then proceed with the next steps below.
         2.47.6.2.2. Airmen accompanied by command sponsored dependents (long or short
         tour) with less than 12 months remaining who are ineligible, or do not volunteer for a
         COT and those not selected for a COT will be curtailed and reassigned to the
         CONUS. Similarly, Airmen serving unaccompanied tours (long or short tour) with
         less than 7 months remaining who do not receive a COT will be curtailed and
         reassigned to the CONUS. In lieu of a waiver of PCS retainability, enlisted Airmen
         may also be separated if they lack retainability for a CONUS PCS (see paragraph
         2.29.6.5).
         2.47.6.2.3. Then, resequence the remaining Airmen in order of most time remaining
         to DEROS. These people will be considered for intra-theater (not inter-theater) PCS
         regardless of volunteer status for continuation of OS tour as follows. Continuation of
         OS tour (that is, PCS to another OS location to serve until their current DEROS or
         prorated DEROS) is not authorized for Airmen serving a tour of 18 months or more
         who have less than 12 months remaining to current or prorated DEROS. Further,
         Airmen accompanied by command sponsored dependents at their current OS location
         must satisfy all of the eligibility criteria for travel of dependents and be authorized
         concurrent travel to the continuation location. Continuation of tour will not be
         directed if concurrent travel cannot be approved. Continuation of OS tour is not
         authorized for unaccompanied Airmen serving a tour of 15 months or less, if they
         have less than 7 months remaining to current or prorated DEROS. Any remaining
         surplus personnel will be curtailed and reassigned to the CONUS when all intra-
         theater requirements have been filled. In lieu of a waiver of PCS retainability,
         enlisted Airmen may also be separated if they lack retainability for a CONUS PCS
         (see paragraph 2.29.6.5).
  2.47.7. Commanders, AFPC Functional Managers, and Assignment OPRs will continuously
  monitor the number of Airmen assigned versus authorized and immediately report Airmen
  who are projected to become surplus based on 6-month projected manning levels to the
  assignment OPR with an explanation of the reason for surplus. Commanders will not wait
  until Airmen actually become surplus to report them. Commanders may request approval to
  retain surplus Airmen with special qualifications, training, or for other special circumstances,
  either at the current location (as approved overages) or they may make recommendations for
  intra-command reassignment. The assignment OPR will consider a commander’s request
  along with the requirements of other MAJCOMs at the same location and in-theater (if OS)
  and other appropriate factors and direct PCA or PCS assignment as appropriate. Assignment
 100                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   OPRs are also responsible to continuously monitor and identify surpluses and should
   coordinate PCA or PCS actions they initiate based on surpluses with the commander
   especially when the commander has not reported the surpluses identified.
   2.47.8. The term overage describes a surplus (see paragraph 2.48) which is impractical or
   unnecessary to resolve by reassignment (PCA or PCS), or is the result of intentional action
   approved by the assignment OPR. For example, an OS returnee is a mandatory move;
   however, if the CONUS is manned at over 100 percent at all locations, then the reassignment
   of an Airman to a location as surplus is described as assignment as an overage. Another
   example of assignment as an overage would be when an assignment OPR directs assignment
   to a unit or location where no authorization exists for the Airman’s AFSC. The term overage
   is sometimes used in reference to other situations which do not involve a surplus as defined
   in paragraph 2.48. For example, in relation to enlisted manning the term overage may be
   used when there are more enlisted assigned in a particular grade or skill level of an AFSC
   than authorized. While no surplus may exist as defined in paragraph 2.48, use of the term
   refers to a condition of more assigned than authorized.
   2.47.9. AFPC Assignment OPRs will monitor enlisted aircrew members surplus to
   requirements at their current duty station and determine if PCS as indicated above is
   appropriate. However, they will not to be removed from flying status at the same time they
   are assigned to duty in other than their primary aircrew AFSC, nor will they be retrained,
   without approval of the assignment OPR in conjunction with their surplus status. When it is
   determined that surplus primary aircrew members are to be removed from flying status, they
   must be managed as shown in AFI 36-2214. In cases where primary aircrew members cannot
   be effectively used in their aircrew skill, a DOA is established that is 120 calendar days after
   the date the members are told of involuntary removal from flying status. Disposition
   instructions cannot be effective earlier than the DOA.
   2.47.10. Force Structure Management: MAJCOMS have a key advisory role and will
   identify and assist with force structure moves. MAJCOM A1 staffs communicate projected
   force structure actions, develop straw-man manning documents, identify the timing and
   movement of Airmen and act as the liaison between the force structure location and AFPC.
2.48. PCS Cost Identifier Code. The PCS Cost Identifier Code represents the fund cite shown
in AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes. It is used primarily by budget
managers for accounting purposes. This code, to which the cost of a PCS will be charged, is
provided by the assignment OPR in the assignment instructions to the MPS, and will be included
in PCS orders. If the MPS or base financial services officer (FSO) determines a PCS cost code is
not correct, they should advise the assignment OPR. However, base FSOs may authorize
charges against a correct account when an incorrect PCS Cost Identifier Code is cited in PCS
orders without amendment of PCS orders and without authorization for change of the code in
assignment data by the assignment OPR.
   2.48.1. Airmen accrue PCS allowances based on the relationship of the losing and gaining
   permanent (duty) stations according to the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR). The
   PCS Cost Identifier Code provided in assignment instructions must be compatible with the
   allowances an Airman accrues according to the JFTR. Whether or not Airmen accrue PCS
   allowances per the JFTR dictates whether a PCS move must be funded or unfunded.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  101


       2.48.1.1. A PCS Cost Identifier Code of "unfunded" cannot be the basis for denying an
       Airman PCS allowances or reimbursement for use of allowances authorized by the JFTR.
       For example, if a PCS cost identifier code of ―M - Reassignment Without Fund
       Allocation‖ is erroneously applied to a PCS from Travis AFB, CA to McGuire AFB, NJ,
       the Airman cannot be denied use of, or reimbursement for, PCS allowances he or she
       accrues per the JFTR. The corrective action in this instance is to change the PCS cost
       identifier code to a funded move.
       2.48.1.2. Conversely, a PCS cost identifier code for a ―funded‖ move cannot be the basis
       for an Airman moving at government expense if the JFTR authorizes no PCS allowances.
       If the assignment instructions or PCS orders cite a funded PCS cost identifier code, then
       the code is without effect.
2.49. No-Cost (No Allowance) Moves. No-cost moves are those where no PCS allowances
accrue to Airmen (reassignment between activities at the same PDS – NOT A PCS). As a nocost
move, an Airman can be moved between units at the same base, or between bases or addresses
when both bases or addresses are within the corporate limits of the same city or town, but are not
authorized to move HHG. Large metropolitan areas or large military reservations are often
comprised of a number of individual duty stations each having corporate city limits or
installation/base boundaries. It must be determined if a move will result in PCS allowances
accruing to the Airman when a change of duty station is being considered. Moves where Airmen
accrue PCS allowances must be requested by an activity authorized to request PCS moves and
approved by the assignment OPR (also see paragraph 2.51 for low-cost moves).
   2.49.1. In some cases it may be desirable to use some of the PCS procedures in managing
   nocost moves. To project manning requirements, when there is a change in MAJCOM or for
   other reasons, an assignment action number (AAN) and projection of the assignment in the
   PDS may be appropriate. It may also be desirable to use PCS orders to record some no-cost
   moves, such as those from one base to another. Include this statement in the remarks section
   when PCS orders are issued: "This is a no-cost move. No PCS allowances authorized. Date
   departed last duty station (DDLDS), date arrived station (DAS) and Date Eligible for Return
   from Overseas (DEROS} (if assigned overseas) will not change." The PCS Cost Identifier
   Code will be "M," Reassignment Without Fund Allocation.
   2.49.2. There may be a requirement for the Airman to vacate government quarters in
   connection with a no-cost move. For example, if an Airman resides in government quarters
   at their current duty location, but is not authorized to remain in those quarters upon
   assignment to another location. The move and dislocation allowance are funded with O&M
   funds using "local move" procedures outlined in the JFTR when no PCS allowances exist but
   relocation of residence is required.
2.50. Low-Cost PCS, (as prescribed in DODI 1315.18). Low-cost moves are PCSs between
duty locations in proximity (daily commute is common by the civilian public between either
location and Airman’s current residence) and it is determined in advance of approval of the PCS
that there will be no requirement for the Airman to relocate their household in conjunction with
the PCS being considered. The fact that an individual could be moved under low-cost PCS
provisions will not be the primary consideration in the assignment selection process. An Airman
is still considered for PCS based upon qualifications, eligibility for PCS, and assignment
selection priorities. One consideration for low-cost PCSs should be will an additional funded
 102                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


PCS be required to backfill. Another consideration is how vulnerable the Airman is for
subsequent reassignment (i.e., OS tour history and/or TOS) given that the DDLDS, DAS and
DEROS do not change as a result of a low-cost PCS. Furthermore, the assignment OPR, in
conjunction with the gaining commander, must weigh whether or not the Airman will likely
remain in the position long enough to become productive and proficient.
   2.50.1. PCS allowances accrue to Airmen whenever they are assigned between permanent
   duty stations which are not within the corporate limits of the same city or town, or between
   stations, reservations, or established areas having defined boundaries. NOTE: Designating
   metropolitan areas which are in many instances comprised of individual cities/towns as one
   duty station for the purpose of PCS allowances, called ―clustering‖, is prohibited by
   Comptroller General decision. Accordingly, when Airmen accrue PCS allowances, they
   cannot be reassigned under no-cost (no allowance) provisions. The fact that an Airman’s
   servicing MPS, parent unit, or commander will not change has no bearing on accrual of PCS
   allowances. PCS allowances accrue based on the relationship of the duty stations and not
   where an Airman resides. However, it does affect whether or not a move can be made under
   low-cost PCS provisions if relocation of household is required and authorized. A low-cost
   PCS between permanent duty stations in proximity may be considered if all of the following
   criteria are met:
       2.50.1.1. Before the PCS can be approved, the Airman must provide a written statement
       to the assignment OPR certifying he or she will not relocate his or her household as a
       result of PCS. The Airman’s certification must include the commuting distance and time
       from current residence to present duty station, and the expected commuting distance and
       time from current residence to the new duty station. The fact an Airman does not intend
       to relocate their household or does not intend to claim reimbursement for PCS allowances
       shall not be the primary basis or sole justification for approval of a low-cost PCS. The
       assignment OPR must coordinate proposed low-cost PCSs with HQ AFPC/DPAPA in
       advance of approval and provide the required statement.
       2.50.1.2. IAW the JFTR, Volume I, Airmen making PCS moves accrue allowances for
       travel, transportation, shipment of HHG, etc. Use of these allowances may be restricted
       based on the lack of governmental interest in the use of the allowances. In the case of a
       low-cost move, Airmen voluntarily agree not to use the normal PCS allowances (see
       paragraph 2.6). Mileage and per diem allowances are not authorized if Airman does not
       relocate their household (as is the case with a low-cost move). HHG transportation and
       DLA are not authorized under low-cost move provisions. Airmen, however, are
       authorized reimbursement, not to exceed $1000.00 (as prescribed in DODI 1315.18) in
       connection with transportation of Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E)
       IAW AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes (Fiscal Year 2009). If
       Airman resides in government quarters at their current duty location, but is not authorized
       to remain in those quarters upon assignment to a duty location in proximity, then the
       requirement to vacate quarters precludes the PCS being affected as low-cost PCS. The
       following applies:
          2.50.1.2.1. Before making any commitments, Airmen should request counseling
          based on their specific circumstances and JFTR allowances associated with moves
          between locations in proximity.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 103


           2.50.1.2.2. All normal PCS eligibility and selection policies and procedures apply,
           except there is no minimum TOS requirement and no PCS retainability requirement.
           2.50.1.2.3. Airmen will not incur a PCS ADSC.
           2.50.1.2.4. Low-cost PCS will be considered only for CONUS to CONUS and OS to
           OS PCS when the duty stations are in proximity as described in paragraph 2.51.
           2.50.1.2.5. Curtailment of OS tour is not authorized, original tour completion date
           will be retained and Airmen are not authorized COT leave/travel allowances.
           2.50.1.2.6. No en route training or TDY will be authorized in conjunction with a low-
           cost PCS.
           2.50.1.2.7. The PCS Cost Identifier Code for a low-cost PCS will be ―V‖, PCS
           Moves w/ Expenditures Less Than $1000.00.
           2.50.1.2.8. The Airman’s DDLDS/DAS/DEROS will not be changed in conjunction
           with a low- cost PCS. In the event the DDLDS/DAS/DEROS changes in the PDS as
           a result of processing the Airman’s PCS travel voucher, then the MPS must restore
           the previous DDLDS/DAS.
   2.50.2. PCS moves originally approved using normal TOS, retainability, ADSC criteria, and
   so on, which could have been made under low-cost provisions but were not approved in
   advance as low-cost moves will not be changed after the fact, nor will PCS orders be
   amended later to show the PCS was made under low-cost provisions. For example, an
   Airman selected for PCS who met the minimum TOS, had or acquired retainability, accepted
   the PCS ADSC, had DDLDS/DAS/DEROS changed upon PCS, etc., but who did not
   relocate his or her household incident to PCS, may not subsequently have that PCS changed
   (DDLDS/DAS/DEROS restored, ADSC removed, etc.) to reflect the PCS was made under
   low-cost move provisions. Conversely, PCS moves originally approved as low-cost PCSs
   will not be changed to fully funded moves without full justification and approval by HQ
   AFPC/DPAPA. Administrative relief can be provided only when justification clearly shows
   that the Airman was miscounseled or that the orders were unclear, incomplete, or invalid.
   Otherwise, all requests for retroactive amendments must be submitted via the BCMR
   process.
2.51. Second PCS and Second Dislocation Allowance (DLA), Same Fiscal Year (FY). This
paragraph applies to all Airmen regardless of marital or dependent status and is to be used in
conjunction with the JFTR which governs the allowance of, DLA. Except as authorized below,
only one PCS involving DLA allowance is authorized in a FY unless the SAF determines the
needs of the AF require an additional PCS. Approval for a second PCS (or more) in the same FY
and approval of a second DLA allowance (or more) involves two separate considerations: one is
TOS; and the other is whether or not the PCS involves a DLA allowance and requires a
Secretarial Process determination. As explained below, depending on the reason for PCS, an
Airman may not be entitled to DLA, or an additional DLA allowance in the same FY may be
excluded from the FY DLA count. Whether an Airman does not use a DLA allowance (actual
movement of dependents is not a prerequisite to DLA allowance in the case of Airmen with
dependents), or does not intend to claim reimbursement for movement of dependents are not
factors in the requirement to obtain a determination through the Secretarial Process. Neither the
Airman nor the AF can waive a DLA allowance. Further, neither a change of end assignment,
 104                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


diversion of an Airman en route, nor a TDY followed by PCS results in a second DLA
allowance. However, for a continuation of PCS, see paragraph 2.52.6. which may entitle an
Airman to an additional DLA. The PDS will normally show when an Airman has had a PCS with
DLA allowance in the current FY.
   2.51.1. Second PCS in Same FY. Table 2.3 shows the minimum TOS requirements for
   PCS. Based on TOS only, sometimes more than one PCS in the same FY may be permitted,
   but that in itself does not preclude the need for approval through the Secretarial Process of an
   additional DLA allowance, unless there is no DLA allowance for the PCS reason, or the
   allowance may be excluded from the FY DLA count as explained below. When a waiver of
   the TOS minimum shown in Table 2.3 is required in addition to a request for second DLA
   allowance, the waiver and second DLA requests will be combined. TOS waiver requests
   must be originated and processed according to paragraph 2.26 and paragraph 1.4.
   2.51.2. Second DLA Allowance in Same FY. The date an Airman departs the last permanent
   duty station, whether TDY en route, delay en route, or direct, etc., determines the FY to
   which the DLA is charged. Airmen may not waive their DLA allowance to avoid the
   requirement for a determination through the Secretarial Process. Requests for determinations
   through the Secretarial Process (DLA waiver) must be sent to the assignment OPR (see
   paragraph 2.26 and paragraph 1.4). The assignment OPR will then forward as necessary
   for additional processing and approval. When a TOS waiver is required, the TOS waiver
   must be approved before the DLA waiver is requested. If the TOS waiver is disapproved, the
   DLA waiver is not submitted and the requester is advised. Requests for a DLA waiver
   through the Secretarial Process should be submitted 90 calendar days before the Airman’s
   scheduled PCS departure or as quickly as possible thereafter. Requests must include:
       2.51.2.1. Grade, name, SSN, and pertinent AFSC information.
       2.51.2.2. Proposed unit of assignment (if known).
       2.51.2.3. Full justification and proposed departure date. Ensure alternatives considered
       are addressed and why alternative action is not feasible. For example, why another
       Airman cannot be moved in the same grade and specialty who would not need a second
       DLA, or why an Airman cannot be used at a nearby base to possibly avoid the move of
       Airman’s household.
       2.51.2.4. When an "after the fact" determination is requested, include reasons for not
       sending the request before the PCS.
       2.51.2.5. Departure date for each PCS during the current FY, if DLA was authorized,
       and if dependents relocated as a result of PCS. In the case of an Airman without
       dependents, indicate if the Airman was "assigned" government quarters as a result of
       PCS.
   2.51.3. When a request is approved, cite in PCS orders the document granting the DLA
   waiver and include the appropriate DLA category. Assignment instructions should include
   this information if not furnished to the MPS previously.
   2.51.4. As information, either Airmen do not have a DLA allowance in connection with PCS
   or the Airmen do have a DLA allowance, but it is excluded from the fiscal year count, as
   follows (recommend confirmation by consulting the JFTR):
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  105


       2.51.4.1. Upon PCS to first duty station upon entry on active duty (does not preclude
       payment of trailer allowance).
       2.51.4.2. Upon separation or retirement.
       2.51.4.3. For no-cost/no allowance PCS moves as explained in paragraph 2.49.
       2.51.4.4. When an Airman, with or without dependents, who is not entitled to
       transportation of dependents at government expense, is assigned to government quarters
       at the new permanent duty station.
       2.51.4.5. Between bases in an OS area where dependents are not authorized and Airman
       will be assigned to government quarters at the new base.
   2.51.5. To, from, or between schools (must be 20 weeks or more in duration) conducted at a
   military base or conducted, controlled, and managed by a Uniformed Service at a civilian
   education institution or elsewhere. NOTE: Airmen do have a DLA allowance, but the
   allowance is excluded from DLA computation.
   2.51.6. In very limited circumstances, a continuation of PCS (see paragraph 2.36.3) may
   result in an additional DLA allowance; however, the allowance is excluded from second
   DLA computation. For reimbursement of an additional DLA, Airmen must have actually
   established a household at the original gaining duty station and must actually relocate that
   household again as a result of the continuation of PCS.
2.52. Peace Corps, Assignment of Former Members of the. Former members of the Peace
Corps are not assigned permanent or temporary duty in the military intelligence field for a period
of 4 years following service with the Peace Corps. Members who later acquire an intelligence
specialty are not assigned in an intelligence capacity to any foreign country in which they
previously served as Peace Corps members. This limitation on the use of former Peace Corps
members will not be waived.
   2.52.1. The term "former members of the Peace Corps" includes former Peace Corps
   volunteers, volunteer leaders, and staff members of the Peace Corps. The term does not
   include persons who attended Peace Corps training but never went OS with the Peace Corps.
   These persons are restricted from being assigned duties in an intelligence capacity only to
   foreign countries for which they received Peace Corps training.
   2.52.2. ALC "R" identifies former members of the Peace Corps. See Table 2.2.
2.53. Security Access Requirements for PCS. AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
Management, is the prescribing instruction for the AF Personnel Security Program and takes
precedence in the event of a conflict with this instruction regarding personnel security access or
individual security investigation processing. A PCS may require an Airman have access to a
higher level of classified information. Each PCS selection will specify the level of security
access for that assignment. Airmen should have at least 12 months service retainability
remaining from the date of assignment to a position requiring SCI access unless they are already
SCI access eligible or have a current favorable SBI. Normally the investigation requester is the
base Security Forces function serving the Airman’s current unit, except when assignment
instructions or AFI 31-501 stipulate some other activity will be the requester.
 106                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   2.53.1. The PDS transaction, assignment trailer remarks, a Personnel Processing Code (PPC)
   or e-mail message will advise the losing commander, MPS and Airman of the security access
   requirement for the assignment.
   2.53.2. Losing commanders ensure unit procedures exist so that assignment selections are
   expeditiously reviewed to determine if an individual security investigation, reinvestigation,
   or other action is required. The unit provides the Airman’s administrative support. The unit
   commander and security manager (or other unit official designated by the commander)
   ensure the Airman reports to the local Security Forces for quality review of security
   documents (usually within 10 days of PCS notification), and that completed personnel
   security forms are given to the Security Forces (usually not more than 30 days after PCS
   notification) or according to locally established procedures.
   2.53.3. When the commander identifies circumstances as outlined in AFI 31-501 that
   preclude a favorable recommendation for access or submission or update of an investigation,
   the MPS will reclama to the assignment OPR (see paragraph 2.46) and explain the
   circumstances.
2.53.4 The MPS will include security data in the PCS orders as shown in AFI 33-208,
Administrative Orders.

   2.53.5. The MPS may publish PCS orders and allow Airmen to depart on PCS without a
   security determination in the following instances:
       2.53.5.1. For mandatory PCS moves (see Attachment 1), or
       2.53.5.2. Access required is top secret or lower, or
       2.53.5.3. For SCI access, if the assignment OPR authorizes issuance of PCS orders IAW
       the criteria in paragraph 2.53.6.
   2.53.6. The assignment OPR must monitor assignments requiring SCI access and obtain the
   status of SCI eligibility from the MAJCOM Special Security Office (SSO). As soon as
   determined, but not later than 90 calendar days before RNLTD, the MAJCOM SSO advises
   the assignment OPR whether Airman is eligible for SCI access. As an exception, the
   assignment OPR may approve departure of an Airman without an SCI eligibility
   determination. The decision to permit an Airman to proceed without an SCI eligibility
   determination is based on whether or not the Airman can be effectively used within the
   gaining unit permanently in a manpower position that does not require SCI access. If an SCI
   eligibility determination cannot be made or an exception approved 90 calendar days prior to
   RNLTD, the assignment OPR, with information to the losing unit, will:
       2.53.6.1. Delay the RNLTD, or
       2.53.6.2. Change the end assignment (with or without change of RNLTD), or
       2.53.6.3. Cancel the assignment.
   2.53.7. Graduates of technical training schools selected for assignments requiring SCI access
   may proceed to the new unit upon graduation without a completed investigation if
   recommended for SCI access by their commander according to AFI 31-501 and when they
   have a "1" under "S" in the PULHES profile. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                107


   (AFCAF) is responsible for determining SCI eligibility for all students attending technical
   training schools.
   2.53.8. Airman (Enlisted) Basic Training Graduates. The base personnel processing group
   does the tasks required by the authorized investigation requester. If the enlisted Airman is
   deemed acceptable by the 319 TRS, Lackland AFB, TX for SCI, then the Airman may be
   assigned to the appropriate AF Military Training Center.
2.54. PCS Orders.     PCS orders are issued IAW AFI 33-208, Administrative Orders.
   2.54.1. The MPS may publish PCS orders only after receipt of written assignment
   instructions via the PDS or a message from the assignment OPR directing a PCS or
   approving a PCS request.
   2.54.2. See paragraph 2.34 for orders in hand requirements.
2.55. Assignment Action Number (AAN). The assignment action number (AAN) is used by
the assignment OPR to control assignments and for other purposes. Budget managers use the
AAN for budget purposes to determine the fiscal year (FY) to which a PCS will be charged
based on the Transfer Effective Date (TED) (for orders cut before 1 October 2008). The TED is
the month and year of the AAN and corresponds to the original requirement month. The TED
(and FY to which a PCS will be charged) can only be changed by cancellation of the AAN and
issuance of a new AAN. A change in PDD or RNLTD will not change the FY to which a PCS is
charged. Orders cut before 1 Oct 2008 should charge DLA to the FY consistent with the TED.
Orders cut on or after 1 October 2008 should charge all costs to the FY in which the orders were
cut.
   2.55.1. AANs are necessary only for those permanent changes of station (PCS) and
   intercommand permanent changes of assignments (PCA without PCS) prescribed by this
   instruction. The AAN is determined at the time an allocation to fill a manning requirement is
   made, or at the time a name is applied to a manning requirement. PCS moves which are not
   made under the authority of this instruction (see paragraph 1.1.1 and Attachment 22) do
   not require an AAN and/or do not use the numbering system described below.
   2.55.2. The AAN construction is similar for officers and enlisted.        It consists of 10
   alphanumeric positions as follows:
 Position Description Example
 1-2 Requirement month (the month in which a requirement "09" is September exists, regardless
 of when a member actually departs or arrives)
 3 Calendar year of the requirement (last digit only) "8" is 2008
 4-5 Level of command initiating the assignment (see note 1.)"0N" is HQ USAF and HQ AFPC
 (see note 1.)
 6-10 Assignment sequence number (see note 2.) 12345 (or S1234) (see note 2.)
 NOTES: For officers, the initiating level will always be "0N." For enlisted, the command
 identified code of the DRU/FOA initiating the assignment request is used when the initiator is
 other than HQ AFPC. The first position of the five position sequence number (position 6) may
 be alpha and can be used to further identify sub-groupings of assignments. Activities
 authorized to initiate assignment requests may not use a letter in position 6 of the sequence
 number without prior approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPP for officers, and HQ AFPC/DPAA5 for
 enlisted. Some commonly used letters are:
 108                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


 "G" for generals, including brigadier general selects.
 "X" for colonels, including selects.
 "S" for enlisted for certain computer matched assignments.
2.56. Air Travel of Air Force Personnel. Air transportation is the primary mode of travel for
movement of AF military personnel to, from, and between OS areas. The inability of an Airman
to accept this concept is considered incompatible with an AF career (see AFI 48-123V2, Medical
Examinations and Standards Volume 2-Accession, Retention, and Administration).
2.57. Enlisted Aircrew Assignments. Enlisted Airmen who are career aviators are selected
and reassigned in their aircrew AFSC only. Career aviators are those AFSCs that require aviation
service as a mandatory specialty qualification according to the Air Force Enlisted Classification
Directory; AFI 11-401, Aviation Management; and AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist
Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges. Career aviators are those aircrew members who
perform full time aircrew duties in AFSCs 1AXXX, or SDIs IAW AFI 11-412, Aircrew
Management.
2.58. Enlisted Non-career Aviators and Operational Support Flyers. Authorized Crew
Composition - Active Forces. Non-career aviators and operational support flyers may be
reassigned to non-flying duties if it is in the best interest of the AF and if they are told of removal
from flying duties at least 120 calendar days in advance. In those cases where assignment
instructions are received that do not give 120 days notice of removal from flying status, the unit
MPS will reclama the assignment according to paragraph 2.46. The 120 calendar days notice of
involuntary removal from flying status can be waived by the Airman to accept the assignment.
NOTE: IAW AFI 11-402, enlisted personnel must volunteer to enter training that will qualify
them to perform in-flight duties as aircrew members (career and non-career) or operational
support flyers. Unless permanently disqualified under the provisions of AFI 11-402, enlisted
Airmen who complete initial training remain available for flying duties and may be directed to
perform such duties at any time.
   2.58.1. Aircrew Evaluation Board (AEB). The convening authority will ensure HQ
   AFPC/DPPAE is advised when an AEB is to be convened on an enlisted Airman who has
   been selected for PCS. HQ AFPC/DPPAE will determine disposition of the member and
   direct appropriate action when an enlisted Airman is TDY (either TDY en route PCS, or
   TDY and return with PCS afterwards).
   2.58.2. Airmen use the assignment preference listing through the vMPF self service
   applications to volunteer for flying duties as a non-career aviator or operational support flyer.
   2.58.3. The MPS will arrange for completion of a Class III flying physical, and schedule
   initial physiological training within 30 calendar days of PCS notification or nomination on
   receipt of an assignment levy with the prefix "X" on the projected CAFSC, when required by
   a PPC, for example, PPC "9JB," or a nomination to flying duty. Schedule only enlisted
   Airmen who are volunteers for flying duty unless otherwise directed.
   2.58.4. When an enlisted Airman is not medically qualified for flying duty per AF Form 469
   (or other correspondence from medical authorities such as AF Form 1042, Medical
   Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty), the MPS will reclama the
   assignment or request release from nomination and place the enlisted Airman in ALC "N"
   per Table 2.2. The ALC may be repeated if, after expiration, the enlisted Airman is again
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   109


   selected and again found not medically qualified. If the specific medical condition requires
   update of another AAC or ALC that limits assignment selection, then update of ALC "N" is
   not required.
2.59. (Enlisted Only) High Year of Tenure (HYT). Reenlistment or extension of enlistment
beyond the limits established in AFI 36-3202 are not authorized except for documented cases of
extreme personal hardship. Waivers are requested according to AFI 36-3203.
2.60. Officer Mandatory Utilization Requirement. A mandatory utilization requirement
(formerly called Directed Duty Assignment [DDA]) is a tool to ensure assignment of an officer
in a utilization field (AF specialty) for a prescribed period consistent with AF funded training or
education received, or other reasons as shown in Table 2.10. A mandatory utilization
requirement is separate from an ADSC or the requirement to be assigned to a manpower position
which requires an Advance Academic Degree (AAD, see paragraph 2.42). An officer may
begin to satisfy an ADSC associated with training immediately upon graduation, but the
mandatory utilization requirement is not satisfied until an officer is assigned in the mandatory
utilization AFS for the period prescribed, or an exception to the utilization requirement is
approved. Activities which have mandatory utilization requirements approved by HQ
AFPC/DPA will ensure the MPS’ servicing their functions are advised to include the mandatory
utilization requirement in PCS orders; certificate of completion; or other similar source
documents. The assignment OPR and unit commanders are responsible for ensuring an officer's
utilization complies with mandatory utilization requirements. Exception requests to assign
officers out of their mandatory utilization specialty (locally or in conjunction with PCS) are
submitted in advance of the requested assignment through the unit commander. Unit
commanders may disapprove exception requests or recommend approval and forward to the
assignment OPR. Exception requests may be submitted requesting to defer utilization or release
the officer from the utilization requirement. Requests must contain justification which shows
how the requested utilization is in the overall long term best interests of the AF versus temporary
local requirements or an officer's personal desires. Exception requests may be disapproved by
the assignment OPR, or when approval is recommended, forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPP which
may approve or forward as necessary for approval/disapproval to the AF OPR which established
the mandatory utilization requirement. HQ AFPC/DPA is the exception authority for the
mandatory utilization requirement in conjunction with AFIT-sponsored AAD assignments. The
requester will be advised of approval or disapproval. The following education or training does
not require approval of an exception of an existing mandatory utilization requirement for
application or selection:
   2.60.1. Professional military education.
   2.60.2. AFIT education.
   2.60.3. Undergraduate flying training.
2.61. Officers Desiring to Recore: AFPC will hold a crossflow board at a minimum once a
year to select officers in overage AFSCs for crossflow into shortage AFSCs. This applies to
Mission Support and Non-Rated Operations Officers only. Officers must satisfy (at minimum)
the educational and medical requirements for the AFSC in which they desire to crossflow.
Additionally, the officer must have (via email or memorandum), a statement from their current
AFSC assignment functional stating they agree to release the officer for crossflow consideration.
Officers must have at least three years Time in Service to be considered. The crossflow board
 110                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


will be the only avenue by which officers may recore (crossflow) voluntarily into a new AFSC.
This helps ensure fairness, equity, and balanced AFSC manning. AFPC/DPASF will announce
the application procedures and board timelines via 8106 message.
2.62. Personnel Processing Codes (PPCs). Codes included in assignment instructions which
refer to PCS-related processing requirements or post-selection assignment actions. The literal
translation of a PPC is located on the PPC listing available on the AFPC web site. MAJCOMs
request establishment of PPCs from HQ AFPC/ DPSSMF. HQ AFPC/DPSSMF will coordinate
those requests for PPCs which involve assignment policies or procedures.
2.63. Assignment Recommendations. Requirements for recommendations for assignments or
selection boards higher than officer's senior rater or an Airman's wing commander (or
equivalent) will not be established.
2.64. Assignment Incentive Pay. Assignment incentive pay is pay offered to Airmen entitled
to basic pay who performs service in an area designated by the SECAF. See Table 2.1, Rule 46.

Table 2.1. Assignment Availability Codes.

    NOTES:
1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.15.
a. See the Stabilized Tour Guide for a list of organizations authorized stabilized tours
(organizational deferment), the length of the tour (deferment), and if the tour is designated a
minimum or maximum tour.
b. An AAC does not preclude a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1 for definition of mandatory
PCS), unless note 8 is indicated for that code.

2. Do not update for Airmen assigned OS.
3. Airman is not eligible to apply for the following self-initiated assignment programs until the
deferment has expired: join-spouse, non-CONUS resident, to or from CONUS-isolated tour,
COT, COT follow-on (see paragraph 2.40.3.13.), and (enlisted only) BOP, and VSBAP. An
Airman who had an action approved under one of these programs before being placed in a code
making them ineligible may retain the previously approved action if expiration of the
ineligibility condition is before the departure date/ DEROS. An RNLTD will not be changed
for the sole purpose of allowing an Airman’s deferment to expire before the departure
date/DEROS.
4. Does not apply to CMSgts. Do not update unless specifically authorized by AF/DPE
5. If the enlisted Airman refuses to obtain retainability to fulfill the CDA commitment or
ADSC for directed training with a PCS, then the Contact Center reclamas the assignment.
 6. As determined by AFI 51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction
7. Do not involuntarily extend Airman’s DEROS. Retain Airman in place, but allow DEROS to
expire (unless a voluntary DEROS extension is requested and approved).
8. Includes mandatory PCS.
9. This provision for civil court is only when Airmen must appear as a material witness on
behalf of any party in connection with judicial proceedings to which the United States is a party
(includes hospital recovery claims).
10. Advise the assignment OPR with information addressee of HQ AFPC/DPAPP when
placing the Airman in this code and PCS is mandatory.
11. Requires assignment OPR approval prior to update of this code on an individual. The
assignment action reason (AAR) for a PCS or other similar approval (such as a letter/memo,
assignment trailer remarks, approved application, PCS orders, and so on) may be used by MPS’
as authority for update of an AAC.

may end before the scheduled date in order to meet manning needs having a higher priority.
HQ AFPC/ DPAA5 must approve all waivers of the date of availability for FY airman
retraining program or First Sergeant retrainees. Waiver authority for NCOs retraining under FY

 NOTES:
 1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.25. Do not use this as a stand-alone table.

 2. See Attachment 1 for definition of non-career officer and first-term airman (FTA). The minimum
 TOS for a non-career officer or FTA is based on the specific reason for PCS shown in column A, and
 not on the fact a member is a non-career officer or FTA.

 3. May be used only when the reason for surplus is one of those reasons listed in paragraph 2.47. If
 an Airman is surplus for a reason other than those listed, then an exception must be requested according
 to paragraph 1.5. (to include a waiver of TOS). Also see rule 24.

 4. Airmen accompanied by dependents require 24 months TOS before PCS. Single or unaccompanied
 people require 15 months TOS before PCS. These are minimum requirements; people may remain
 assigned longer.

 5. Applies only to members disqualified for duty due to loss of AFSC, security clearance or access to
 SCI, professional certification, nuclear certification or medical qualification, or relief from duty for
 cause and where no vacant position exists at the same duty station in which members may serve
 pending requalification.

        NOTE: For students, the RNLTD shown in member’s PCS orders may be earlier but
        not later than the RNLTD shown in the PDS. The RNLTD in the orders is the
        graduation date plus actual number of days leave desired plus travel time. A formal
        change of RNLTD shown in the PDS to agree with the orders is not required. When the
        PCS is OS, the member’s port call will not be earlier than the RNLTD month shown in
        PCS orders, but may be earlier than the RNLTD reflected in the PDS. Under such
        circumstances, reporting OS prior to the RNLTD month shown in the PDS will not
        result in a Category 1 PCS Processing Discrepancy.

NOTES:
1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.29. When PCS is to an OS location, see Table 2.6.

2. Certain assignments require service retainability greater than the minimum. When applicable,
assignment OPRs state the retainability required in assignment remarks, additional assignment
instructions, or a PPC.
 3. When the Airman is ineligible to obtain 12 months retainability (for example, an officer has an
 established DOS or retirement date, an airmen is HYT restricted, or is ineligible due to quality control
 or some other reason) or declines to obtain the retainability (for example, an enlisted Airman signs a
 declination statement, or an officer elects to 7-day opt or when serving on an SPTC declines to do an
 additional SPTC), the DEROS is extended to equal the DOS/retirement date. Normally this involuntary
 OS tour extension will be accomplished automatically by the PDS.

 4. When an Airman is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months retainability (see note 3 above), and
 has less than 7 months from DEROS to DOS/retirement date, the DEROS is extended to equal
 DOS/retirement date. When an Airman who is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months retain-ability
 has at least 7 months from DEROS to DOS, assignment OPRs provide an assignment (as an exception
 to the requirement that members have 12 months service retainability).

 5. An Airman eligible to obtain 12 months retainability must do so. Airmen may not extend or agree to
 obligated service just long enough to qualify for the 7 month retainability exception in note 4. For
 EXAMPLE: An officer with an indefinite DOS will incur a 12 month ADSC upon PCS. He/she may
 not agree to incur only a 7 month PCS ADSC. An enlisted Airman eligible to extend to meet the full
 12 month retainability requirement must do so. He/she cannot extend just enough to be eligible for the
 7 month exception.

 6. An Airman who cannot obtain the full 12 months retainability, but can obtain at least 7 (or more)
 months retainability, must obtain the maximum retainability for which they are eligible before they can
 receive an assignment under the 7 month retainability exception. For EXAMPLE: An enlisted Airman
 with 5 months service retainability from DEROS to DOS who is eligible to extend for only an
 additional 5 months (their maximum allowable), must extend the full 5 months (total 10 months
 retainability), or decline in writing. The enlisted Airman will not be permitted to extend just 2 months
 to be eligible for PCS under the 7 month retainability exception.

7. Minimum retainability requirement is 6 months. However, the expectation that Airmen will obtain up
to 24 months retainability, if otherwise eligible, remains. If member cannot obtain 24 months
retainability, 6 months is the minimum retainability required in conjunction with a PCS.

AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                           149


below or from AF/DPO colonel and selectees.

3. For officers, as an exception, select a volunteer if he or she provides a written statement indicating
understanding that their DEROS will be involuntarily extended to match their mandatory DOS or
mandatory retirement date. In this case, they will separate or retire upon completion of the involuntarily
extended OS tour.

4. Career enlisted Airmen, regardless of volunteer status, are ineligible for PCS selection if upon
completion of an unaccompanied short tour, they will be subject to involuntary DEROS extension due to
HYT restriction. HQ AFPC/DPA is the waiver authority for PCS selection.
5. Career enlisted Airmen, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether or not the enlisted
Airman has dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to be eligible for
selection. HQ AFPC/DPA is the waiver authority. The intent of a retainability requirement beyond
completion of the unaccompanied OS tour length is: either to ensure the enlisted Airman can obtain the
required retainability to receive a CONUS PCS after an unaccompanied OS tour and preclude
involuntary extension of an unaccompanied tour due to lack of PCS retainability, or to ensure adequate
retainability to allow election of an accompanied tour. The retainability requirement beyond tour
completion is not intended to preclude an involuntary DEROS extension due to lack of PCS retainability
for enlisted Airmen who are serving an accompanied tour. The accompanied tour length is not always
12 months more than the unaccompanied tour (e.g. 24/15 month tours), so eligibility for selection uses
the accompanied tour length for 24/ 12 tours, OR the unaccompanied tour length plus 12 months for
24/15 tours. For example, for a 24/15 tour, the accompanied tour is 9 months longer than the
unaccompanied tour, but CONUS PCS retainability required is 12 months. Therefore, in order to be
eligible for selection without knowing which tour a person will elect, they must have or be able to obtain
27 months total retain-ability.

6. Career enlisted Airmen, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether or not the enlisted
Airman has dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to be eligible for
selection. HQ AFPC/DPA is the waiver authority.

7. Consider a first-term airman with an approved Career Job Reservation (CJR) as a career enlisted
Airman for retainability for OS PCS selection.

8. Initial ETS is the completion of the enlisted Airman’s initial enlistment with no extensions.

9. HQ AFPC/DPA must approve selection for PCS of an enlisted Airman when, upon completion of an
unaccompanied OS short tour the enlisted Airman would have less than 7 months PCS retainability.

10. Airmen must be able to obtain retainability, regardless of marital status or whether or not Airmen
have dependents, to allow Airmen to elect the accompanied tour length or to request command
sponsorship if they acquire dependents.

 U     If an enlisted Airman requests a delay   Then, the MPS commander or designated
 L     in obtaining retainability and the reasonsection chief(s) may grant an extension of
 E     is:                                      suspense to (see notes 1, 2 and 3):
 1     To reduce obligated service which        Not later than the 25th day of the 8 th month
       would be deducted from a Selective       before DEROS for enlisted Airman assigned
       Reenlistment Bonus (SRB)                 OS who will not serve an IPCOT, or not later
                                                than 15 calendar days before enlisted Airman
                                                departs on PCS or enters an IPCOT, or the
                                                last day of SRB eligibility, whichever is
                                                earlier (see note 4).
  2 For quality control reasons (see note 5) not later than 15 calendar days after the
                                                enlisted Airman becomes eligible for PCS
                                                but not later than 60 days prior to the PDD,
                                                or the effective date of an IPCOT, whichever
                                                is earlier.
  3 for a first-term airman with CAREERS the date of award of the 3-skill level (see note
       retraining                               6).
  4 the enlisted Airman is on TDY or            not later than 15 calendar days after return
       leave                                    to their permanent duty station (for TDY of
                                                more than 60 days, forward documents and
                                                require the airman to obtain retainability at
                                                the TDY location).
  5 for an extended long OS tour (first-        allow retainability for a portion of the
       term airman only)                        extended tour (only) to be obtained after
                                                arrival OS (see note 7).
  6 sell leave in conjunction with              90 days before ETS but not later than 120
       reenlistment (career enlisted Airmen     calendar days before RNLTD or effective
       only)                                    date of IPCOT, whichever is earlier.
  7 to apply for voluntary retirement           not later than the 25th day of the 8th month
       which coincides with the airman’s        before current DEROS or not later than 15
       current DEROS (see note 8)               days after denial of the request, whichever is
                                                earlier.
  NOTES:
  1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.29.6.8.
  2. Do not grant a delay:
  a. Beyond the date an enlisted Airman desires to use allowances;
  b. For enlisted Airmen permanently ineligible to obtain full retainability;
  c. For circumstances not shown above (for example, airmen who are HYT restricted, etc.).
  3. Enlisted Airmen assigned OS must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30
  days of receipt of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. Delays to this
  requirement will not be considered unless rule 1 or 7 applies (see notes 4 and 8). A delay may
  be granted in obtaining full COT or IPCOT retainability only for one of the reasons shown in
  the table.
 4. A delay may be granted to reduce SRB impact, but it may not be possible within the
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    151


parameters authorized for delays to eliminate impact entirely. See AFI 36-2606 when
assignment is in an additionally awarded SRB AFSC and the enlisted Airman desires to reenlist
in the SRB AFSC for PCS retainability.
5. A delay for quality control reasons can only be granted if the enlisted Airman already had an
assignment prior to the quality control conditions.
6. Enlisted Airmen assigned OS must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30
days of receipt of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. Delays to this
requirement will not be considered. Enlisted Airmen must extend their enlistment the
maximum of 23 months if they either cannot reenlist in their present AFSC or desire to reenlist
in their retraining AFSC (which is an SRB skill). For reenlistment at an en route TDY training
site, the losing unit commander must obtain concurrence of the TDY unit commander to reenlist
the enlisted Airman at the training site (last training site when there are more than one). Do not
permit departure from the last training site without the full prescribed PCS retainability. If an
enlisted Airman does not reenlist upon completion of a training course, hold the enlisted
Airman at the training site and notify the assignment OPR responsible for the training into
AFSC, HQ AFPC/DPAPP, and the losing MPS within 3 calendar days after course completion
and provide a report of the circumstances. Disposition instructions will be provided by the
assignment OPR within 5 calendar days.
7. Grant first-term airman ineligible to reenlist because of insufficient time in service to request
a CJR, a delay to obtain retainability for a portion of the ELT length. At the time of initial PCS
notification, he or she must extend the maximum of 23 months and, having extended, must then
have at least the required service retainability to serve the minimum prescribed DOD standard
tour length (see the JFTR Appendix Q). The AF Form 899, Request and Authorization for
Permanent Change of Station - Military, which directs reassignment of Airmen selected under
this program, must reflect both the correct total number of months the airman will serve as an
extended long tour volunteer, and the fact that the airman was selected as an extended tour
volunteer. For example, an airman selected as an extended long tour volunteer for
reassignment to Ramstein, Germany, who elects the accompanied tour, is required to serve a
total of 48 months. Even though the JFTR, Appendix Q reflects a tour length of 36 months for
an accompanied tour to Germany, the correct entry for item 11 (Tour length, total number of
months) of the AF Form 899 is "48." In addition, item 12, (Extended long tour volunteer)
should reflect an "X" each time the assignment action reason is "AO, extended long tour
volunteer." This is important as the gaining MPS uses the AF Form 899 as the source document
to award initial DEROS (standard (accompanied or unaccompanied) tour length plus 12
months). Also include the following statement in item 24 (Remarks) of the AF Form 899
"Approval granted to delay obtaining (indicate number) months service retainability for a
portion of the extended (indicate accompanied or unaccompanied) tour according to AFI 36-
2110, paragraph 2.29." Upon approval of the delay, the MPS updates ALC "8" with an
expiration date equal to the projected tour completion date for the full prescribed tour. The
gaining MPS verifies this update upon the airman's arrival and corrects as necessary. When the
airman's DOS is updated as a result of reenlistment, the DEROS automatically changes to
reflect the full prescribed extended tour length.
8. Airman’s request for voluntary retirement should be submitted within 30 days of DEROS
forecast. The MPS does not need to report delays approved under this rule as they will not
purge until the airman is within 8 months of current DEROS. Once an airman has an ASD any
retirement request must be submitted under 7-day option rules.

 NOTES:
 1. This table must be used in conjunction with paragraphs 2.30. and 2.31. Besides PCS
 selection by the assignment OPR, this rule includes selection by the selection authority for
 training (whether or not listed in the Air Education and Training Course Announcement
 (ETCA) located at (http://etca.randolph.af.mil) or an education course, whether the Airman
 attends training or education course in PCS or TDY status (including TDY on the same base).

 2. AF/DPG, AF/DPO or HQ AFPC/DPAPP may authorize the use of an ASD other than as
 shown (for example, a permanent change of assignment (PCA) on the same station). AF/DPG
 establishes the ASD for general officers (including brigadier general selectees), and AF/DPO
 establishes the ASD for colonels (including colonel selectees).

 3. For enlisted Airmen retraining, the ASD is the date of the letter from HQ AFPC which
154                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  approves or directs retraining.
4. When the ASD is based on a schedule (officers and enlisted) or vulnerability for PCS
selection (officers only),that is an Airman’s official ASD for their next assignment. As of the
ASD and thereafter, 7-day option provisions apply to the date of separation or retirement a
member can request as described in paragraph 2.30., however, Airmen are not required to
apply for separation or retirement within 7 days of being notified of the establishment of an
ASD. The 7 day suspense requirement applies later when the Airman is officially notified of
actual PCS selection with end location, RNLTD, and so on. When the ASD is established based
on a schedule or vulnerability for PCS selection, then the ASD which appears in an assignment
transaction received through the PDS is the date the assignment OPR updated the PDS with the
end assignment information. An automatic ASD is not established for an officer or enlisted
Airman based on scheduled completion of a CONUS minimum stabilized tour.

5. For officers, the ASD is the date an officer is selected by name for assignment by the
assignment OPR; OR the ASD is the date the assignment process begins in order to reassign an
officer on a scheduled future date (such as upon DEROS, tour completion date from a CONUS
maximum stabilized tour, the date a member will become surplus, and so on); OR, the date an
officer is identified by the assignment OPR as vulnerable for PCS selection.

6. The 7-day option period per paragraph 2.30. begins when officially notified of selection
with end assignment location and counseled on the ADSC incurred.

7. Enlisted Airmen nominated do not have to exercise the 7-day option or decline to obtain
service retainability until the assignment OPR determines them to be a firm selectee and they
are officially notified of selection. After final selection of nominees, the ASDs of nominees not
selected will be canceled.

 NOTES:
 1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.30.; do not use this table alone to determine
 eligibility or effective dates and do not use column F for separation or retirement dates Airmen
 may request if they are serving OS or on a CONUS maximum stabilized tour. Also see
 paragraph 2.29. and AFI 36-3203 for officer and enlisted Airmen retirements, and AFI 36-
 3207 for officer separations.

2. Establishment of an ASD is addressed in paragraph 2.31. and Table 2.8. During the time
between establishment of an ASD and notification of actual PCS selection (with an end
location, etc.), if an Airman requests separation or retirement, the request must be according to
7-day option provisions except it does not have to be submitted within 7 calendar days of being
notified of establishment of an ASD.
3. If a colonel or colonel selectee will not reach 20 years TAFMS as of the first day of the
fourth month following event notification (mo/yr) the officer may request an exception to policy
from AFCMO to permit retirement on a later date.
4. If Airman has an ADSC beyond 6 months and has retainability, Airman must go on
assignment, they are ineligible to decline. If Airman has ADSC beyond 6 months and does not
have full retainability, they are ineligible to 7-day opt but must decline retainability as outlined
in paragraph 2.29.

                                            Chapter 3

                                    OVERSEA (OS) DUTY

3.1. General Information. This chapter supplements the general policies and procedures
prescribed elsewhere in this instruction and contains guidance applicable to OS tour lengths,
selection of Airmen for OS PCS, certain actions required as a result of OS PCS selection,
management of personnel while assigned OS, and actions in conjunction with OS tour
completion.
3.2. OS Tour Lengths. OS tour lengths prescribed by DOD are normally based on quality of
life conditions with long tour locations usually comparing favorably to U.S. standards. Normally
all Airmen assigned to a location serve the prescribed tour length, regardless of the military
Service in which they serve. However, there are exceptions and most of these are shown below
or are listed by location in the JFTR, Appendix Q. Also, OS tour lengths Airmen serve can be
affected by choices Airmen are authorized to make as outlined elsewhere in this instruction (for
example, as shown in Attachment 21). Airmen performing duty at a permanent duty station
which has a different tour length than that of their parent organization or a different tour length
than the location of the manpower authorization to which assigned (see paragraph 1.1.3 for
additional guidance), will serve the tour length applicable to their permanent duty station. Per
Congressional guidance, the standard tour length for Airmen stationed outside the CONUS shall
be 36 months accompanied and 24 months unaccompanied (except for Alaska and Hawaii),
unless the AF provides conclusive evidence to the DOD that tours at specific locations should be
shorter because of the lack of support facilities. The tour length (for assignment planning
purposes) is 36 months accompanied and 24 months unaccompanied if the JFTR, Appendix Q
does not specify a tour length for a location. Accompanied by dependent tours and command
sponsorship of dependents are permitted only when government family quarters or government
approved family quarters and support facilities are available to the individual. When a tour
length of less than 36/24 is requested, before selection of Airmen for PCS, the tour length must
be approved by DOD according to paragraph 3.2.1 below, or by SAF when the guidance in
paragraph 3.2.3 applies.
   3.2.1. Request to Establish or Change OS Tour Lengths. The DOD is the approval authority
   for establishment of, or changes to, OS tour lengths, except those described in paragraph
   3.2.3. Requests to establish a tour length or change to the DOD prescribed tour lengths
   reflected in the JFTR, Appendix Q require the coordination of the Services affected and are
   submitted by the Unified Commander concerned, through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
   Staff, to the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), for final decision.
   DODD 1315.18 contains specific site survey data and other information required as
   justification for the requested tour length. Tour lengths based on factors other than quality of
   life conditions must be requested as an exception according to paragraph 3.2.2 and
   approved by DOD.
       3.2.1.1. Whenever possible, the effective date of a change of OS tour length should be
       far enough in advance (approximately 12 months or more) that the fewest number of
       Airmen projected for assignment are affected, or a sufficient amount of time exists to
       cancel Airmen selected for PCS and reselect, if appropriate, without undue hardship to
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                165


     members or waste of PCS funds. This is very important when the OS PCS selection
     criteria changes from long to short, or vice versa. Because of commitments to follow-on
     assignments, etc., it may not be possible in all cases to preclude any impact on Airmen
     who are projected for assignment. Similarly, whenever possible, a tour length change
     should exclude those Airmen currently assigned unless it is clearly appropriate to include
     them. Establishing a tour length change effective date which affects Airmen already
     selected for assignment or currently assigned can create turmoil, hardship, stress on
     families and members, and generate additional PCS costs.
     3.2.1.2. When an OS tour length change requires an immediate or near-term effective
     date affecting Airmen projected with an assignment or currently assigned, specific
     guidance will be provided when the tour length change is announced.
     3.2.2. Tour Length Exceptions. In some instances tour lengths are specified by DOD
     based on duty to be performed or category of personnel rather than being based on the
     normal tour length criteria which is quality of life conditions. Also, for some
     assignments, DOD has approved an AF request for exception to the normal prescribed
     tour length. The assignment instructions or other guidance will identify to the Contact
     Center the tour length to be served in conjunction with the assignment. When a tour
     length is based on criteria other than normal quality of life criteria (such as duty to be
     performed, category of personnel, or the tour length for AF personnel is an exception),
     such tours will not be prorated (also see paragraph 3.11). Requests for tour length
     exceptions (those which are not based on quality of life conditions at a location, such as,
     for PME, formal education, in conjunction with training, a school, scholarship, fellowship
     or grant, and so on) may be submitted per paragraph 1.5 for consideration and approval
     by the appropriate level. Adequate time must be allowed to permit the exception request
     to be submitted to DOD for consideration. When it is known that the duration of an
     assignment will be less than the normal prescribed tour length for an OS location, then
     either a request for OS tour length exception must be requested and approved in advance,
     or curtailment of the tour length prescribed for the location must be requested and
     approved as an exception per paragraph 1.5. Documentation on approved OS tour length
     exceptions, including some circumstances not listed in this instruction, is maintained by
     HQ AFPC/DPAPP.
  3.2.3. "AF Only" Tour Lengths. The SAF may establish the tour length for a location or
  country not listed in the JFTR, Appendix Q provided only AF Airmen (fewer than 25) are
  assigned and it does not involve introducing command-sponsored dependents into an area
  where dependents currently are not authorized. The documentation required in support of
  these requests is the same as that to establish or change a tour length as explained in
  paragraph 3.2.1, but does not require DOD approval.
  3.2.4. Alaska and Hawaii Tour Lengths. Assignment to a major military installation in
  Alaska and Hawaii is, in many respects, similar to duty within the CONUS (customs, laws,
  language, etc.). However, some aspects are similar to duty OS, that is, geographically
  separated from the CONUS, Airmen receive OS allowances, and so on. For these reasons,
  personnel management for most locations in Alaska and Hawaii is a combination of both
  CONUS and OS policies and procedures. Unless the JFTR, Appendix Q indicates otherwise,
  both the accompanied and unaccompanied minimum tour lengths are 36 months. Airmen
  who desire to remain assigned beyond completion of the minimum tour may opt to keep their
166                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  automatic indefinite DEROS (see paragraph 3.8.5.1.1), request extension of tour, or an
  IPCOT.
  3.2.5. Officer Joint Duty Assignment (JDA) OS Tour Length. See paragraph 2.15.7.3. To
  receive credit for completion of a JDA tour, the period of time an officer must serve OS may
  differ from the normal DOD prescribed tour length (tour length published on JDAL). A JDA
  tour is not subject to tour proration.
  3.2.6. Air Liaison Officer (ALO) and Air Mobility Liaison Officer (AMLO) Duty Tour
  Length.
      3.2.6.1. Officers assigned from the CONUS to OS for ALO/AMLO duty must serve a
      minimum of 24 months, accompanied or unaccompanied, at the ALO/AMLO location.
      Upon completion of the 24 month ALO/AMLO tour, officers may be reassigned on a
      COT to serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location, for which they will receive
      COT leave travel allowances, or they may be reassigned to the CONUS. An ALO/AMLO
      tour is not subject to proration.
      3.2.6.2. Officers reassigned intratheater to serve an ALO/AMLO tour serve a minimum
      of 18 months of a 36 month tour at the initial OS location. Then they must serve the
      remaining 18 months at the ALO/AMLO location. COT leave travel allowances are not
      authorized as this move is a continuation of OS tour. An ALO/AMLO tour is not subject
      to proration.
  3.2.7. Contract Tours. Airmen assigned to locations where the tour length is specified by
  government-to-government contract will serve the specified contract tour. The fact that a
  foreign government may be reimbursing the US government for costs associated with a
  mission does not exempt the AF from complying with DOD and AF assignment policies.
  Contract tours will not be prorated.
  3.2.8. Medical Service Officer Shortage Specialty Accompanied OS Tour Length. Two and
  three year obligated medical service officers serving in shortage specialties as determined by
  the SAF in consultation with the AF Surgeon General, are allowed to serve two year
  accompanied tours in long tour areas. Travel of dependents OS, shipment of HHG, etc., at
  government expense is contingent upon the officer meeting all other allowance criteria
  except the normal accompanied long tour retainability requirement.
  3.2.9. Defense Attaché Tour Lengths. The Director, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),
  determines the tour lengths and whether the tours will be accompanied or unaccompanied for
  Airmen assigned to the Defense Attaché System. Assignment instructions will stipulate the
  tour length to be served. Attache tours are not subject to proration.
  3.2.10. Command Sponsored Position List (CSPL) Tour Lengths. A command sponsored
  position is a position established as such because of a direct supporting role to the warfighter
  or life support mission essential to maintain the armistice and/or support the warfighter.
  These positions must require duties where continuity is essential to mission effectiveness. At
  locations where election of the accompanied by dependents tour is restricted by a CSPL, a
  limited number of Airmen selected to serve what is otherwise a dependent-restricted
  unaccompanied tour may be given the opportunity to elect an accompanied by dependents
  tour and receive command sponsorship of dependents. The criteria used to determine who
  may be authorized to elect an accompanied tour may vary. Not all Airmen are eligible to
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 167


  serve an accompanied tour in those locations where such tours are authorized. Eligibility is
  contingent upon Airman’s actual duty assignment. Airmen identified to fill or offered a
  CSPL position, but who elect instead to serve the unaccompanied tour length, will not be
  required to serve the accompanied tour length and are considered to be serving a dependent-
  restricted unaccompanied tour.
  3.2.11. Key Billet Tour Length. Certain manpower positions may be formally designated
  and approved as "key billets" in OS units or activities where the presence of the Airman is of
  such unusual responsibility that continued presence for at least 24 months is determined to be
  absolutely essential to the mission of the activity of the unit or to the US presence in that
  area. The key billet designation applies only to those OS locations where the accompanied
  tour is at least 24 months. Airmen filling key billets, whether accompanied or
  unaccompanied, will serve a 24 month tour. Key billet tours are not subject to proration.
     3.2.11.1. Since it is mandatory that Airmen filling approved key billets serve the 24
     month tour, requests for key billet designations must be submitted, in writing, by the
     requester through the unified commander (USPACOM, USCENTCOM, USCINCLANT,
     etc. when joint positions are involved), or for Service-specific positions through the
     parent MAJCOM to the approval authority with an information copy to HQ AF/A1PPA
     and HQ AFPC/DPAPP. The approval authority, as reflected in DODI 1315.18, shall be
     as follows:
         3.2.11.1.1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff for the Joint Staff and other activities under its
         cognizance.
         3.2.11.1.2. The PDUSD (P&R) for joint staffs and activities under OSD cognizance.
         3.2.11.1.3. The Secretary concerned, when subparagraphs 3.2.11.1.1 or 3.2.11.1.2
         do not apply.
     3.2.11.2. Key billet requests must include:
         3.2.11.2.1. Specific duty location, MAJCOM, AFSC, grade, duty title, and position
         number.
         3.2.11.2.2. Position description and justification for a 24 month tour based on the
         unusual responsibility and need for continuity in the position.
         3.2.11.2.3. Statement that government-furnished quarters are available for the
         member and that concurrent travel of dependents is authorized.
         3.2.11.2.4. Statement that key billet is at a location where command sponsorship of
         family members is authorized.
     3.2.11.3. Once the approval authority makes a decision, the requester, AF/A1PPA, and
     HQ AFPC/ DPAPP will be notified. The approval authority and HQ AFPC/DPAPP will
     maintain a master listing of all approved AF key billets. When a position no longer
     requires key billet designation or the designated position changes, the original requesting
     activity will notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP, in writing, so the master list can be kept current.
  3.2.12. Designated Location Move (DLM) Tour Length. Airmen selected for assignment to
  a dependent restricted location who request and receive approval for a DLM according to
  AFI 36- 3020, Family Member Travel, will serve an unaccompanied tour of 24 months when
168                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  the OS country where the Airman will serve is the same as the native country of his or her
  spouse (see Table 3.5). Airman will not receive short tour credit. A DLM tour is not subject
  to proration. For award of ODSD based on a 24 month unaccompanied DLM tour refer to
  Table 3.3.
  3.2.13. (Enlisted Only) Extended Long OS Tour (ELT) Length. The AF extended long OS
  tour length is the prescribed long accompanied or unaccompanied tour shown in the JFTR,
  Appendix Q, plus 12 additional months. This voluntary program affords enlisted Airmen
  special assignment selection consideration ahead of volunteers for the DOD prescribed OS
  tour length according to the priorities shown in Table 3.2. For example, an enlisted Airman
  with dependents who volunteers and is selected as an ELT volunteer for a location with a 36
  month accompanied and 24 month unaccompanied tour length would be required to serve 48
  months accompanied or 36 months unaccompanied. NOTE: This program does not apply to
  short tour locations, that is, the JFTR, Appendix Q lists the tour lengths as NA/12, 24/12, or
  24/15. Enlisted Airmen who are selected for an ELT, but do not have, do not desire, or are
  ineligible to obtain retainability will not be permitted to retain an assignment and change to
  the standard tour length (accompanied or unaccompanied). Allowing such action would
  result in enlisted Airmen receiving special assignment selection priority without serving the
  longer tour. FTA who have extended their enlistment the maximum of 23 months may
  request a delay in obtaining the service retainability for a portion of the extended long OS
  tour if they have retainability for the prescribed standard (unaccompanied or accompanied)
  tour length, until arrival OS as outlined in paragraph 2.29 and Table 2.7. See paragraph
  3.2.13.3 and Attachment 8 for ELT requirements in conjunction with join spouse
  assignment.
      3.2.13.1. The AF Form 899 which directs reassignment of members selected under this
      program must reflect both the correct total number of months the member will serve as an
      extended long tour volunteer, and the fact that the member was selected as an extended
      tour volunteer. For example, an Airman selected as an extended long tour volunteer for
      reassignment to Ramstein, Germany, who elects the accompanied tour, is required to
      serve a total of 48 months. Even though the JFTR, Appendix Q reflects a tour length of
      36 months for an accompanied tour to Germany, the correct entry for item 11 (Tour
      length, total number of months) of the AF Form 899 is "48." In addition, item 12,
      (Extended long tour volunteer) should reflect an "X" each time the assignment action
      reason is "AO, extended tour volunteer." This is important as the gaining MPS uses the
      AF Form 899 as the source document to award initial DEROS (standard accompanied or
      unaccompanied tour length plus 12 months). See AFI 36-2102 for further guidance in
      accomplishing the AF Form 899.
      3.2.13.2. An enlisted Airman serving an extended OS tour is not usually reassigned
      involuntarily from the country for which initially selected. When involuntary
      reassignment to another country is necessary, the tour length is prorated on request of the
      enlisted Airman according to Table 3.12, rule 2, and paragraph 3.11.2. On PCS
      notification the enlisted Airman is required to sign a statement indicating whether or not
      he or she desires DEROS proration. When an enlisted Airman desires DEROS proration
      and the prorated DEROS would result in the member serving less than 12 months at the
      gaining location, the MPS will reclama the assignment. The enlisted Airman is not
      allowed to depart until a response to the reclama is received.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              169


     3.2.13.3. When one member of an enlisted military couple is selected as an extended tour
     volunteer, the joining spouse (regardless of the AAR shown in the assignment) will also
     serve the extended long tour (see paragraph 3.2.13 and Attachment 8, paragraph
     A8.8.3) unless waived by HQ AFPC/DPAPP. Waivers to less than the prescribed
     accompanied standard tour length are not authorized.
  3.2.14. (Officers Only) Accompanied Equivalent Tour Length Program. The officer
  accompanied equivalent tour length program affords an unmarried officer with no
  dependents an opportunity to choose to serve an OS tour equal to the accompanied tour
  length. NOTE: This option does not apply to officers with a military spouse and it does not
  require officers who have no dependents to complete a tour election statement. The
  following procedures apply:
     3.2.14.1. During the initial relocation briefing, the MPS will counsel unmarried officers
     with no dependents of the option to choose an accompanied equivalent tour length when
     an accompanied tour is authorized by the JFTR, Appendix Q. For example, a single
     captain with no dependents selected for reassignment to Ramstein AB would normally
     serve a 24 month unaccompanied tour. Under this program, he or she may choose
     instead to serve a 36 month accompanied equivalent tour length. MPS’ use the memo at
     Figure 3.1 to record an officer’s choice and the memo is the source document for the
     entry in the Remarks section of the PCS orders as required below. The memo is filed in
     the Airman’s relocation folder.
     3.2.14.2. Include in the officer's PCS orders the total number of months to be served in
     item 11 of the AF Form 899 and include the following statement in the Remarks area
     when an officer chooses to serve the accompanied equivalent tour length, "Member chose
     to serve the accompanied equivalent tour length and corresponding DEROS will be
     updated upon in- processing at gaining location."
     3.2.14.3. A officer's request to change back to the unaccompanied tour length prior to
     departure may be approved by the assignment OPR and will require amendments to the
     PCS orders, if previously published, to delete the officer's choice to serve the
     accompanied equivalent tour length.
     3.2.14.4. DEROS extension requests for officers serving the accompanied equivalent
     tour length may still be requested as outlined in paragraph 3.8.6.
     3.2.14.5. Any request to change back to the unaccompanied tour length after departure
     on the OS PCS must be processed as a DEROS curtailment as provided in paragraph
     3.8.9.2.

MEMORANDUM FOR MPS/(office symbol)                                          (date)

FROM: (Functional address symbol)

SUBJECT: FOUO - Officer Accompanied Equivalent Tour Length Volunteer Statement

This memorandum (E-Mail) contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY information which must be
protected under the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.

1. I (last name, first name, MI), (grade), (SSN) have a projected assignment to (location) and I
volunteer to serve the accompanied equivalent tour length at that location.

2. I understand as a result of this volunteer statement I am obligated to serve the prescribed
unaccompanied tour length of (# of months) PLUS an additional (# of months), which makes
the total OS tour length I agree to serve equal to the prescribed accompanied tour length shown
in the JFTR, Appendix Q. I understand and agree that my active duty service commitment
(ADSC) will be equal to my DEROS which will be based on the accompanied tour length. I
further understand after arrival OS that my OS tour extension opportunities and procedures for
curtailment of my OS tour will be the same as others who were required to serve the
accompanied by dependents tour length.



                                                            (signature of officer)

   3.2.15. KAIP. Airmen may elect, by entering into a written agreement, to serve the
   prescribed unaccompanied tour in Korea plus an additional 12 months in exchange for
   payment of $300/month. This incentive increases stability and elevates unit performance.
   Airmen selected for a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to Korea, regardless of volunteer
   status must be briefed and elect (in writing) to accept or decline a KAIP tour. KAIP tours
   will be established as 24 months unaccompanied or 36 months accompanied, when
   authorized, in Korea. See Attachment 13 for further guidance on this program.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    171


3.3. OS PCS Selection. As stated in paragraph 2.4, the primary factor in selection of an
Airman for PCS is the Airman’s qualifications. Mission sensitivities, coupled with the OS
environment, require assignment of personnel whose qualifications, performance, and conduct
meet established AF standards. Distribution of OS duty will be as equitable as possible
considering both desirable and undesirable locations among Airmen. similarly qualified. As an
example, if by using only the criteria of grade, AFSC, previous OS duty history, DAS, etc., two
Airmen might be prioritized on a non-volunteer OS short or long eligibility roster as numbers 18
and 34. However, when some other qualification is mandatory and these Airmen are the first two
on the eligibility roster who possess that qualification, then they would be prioritized as 1 and 2.
Airmen are considered by the assignment OPR separately for OS short tour locations and long
tour locations. (See Attachment 1 for definition of short and long OS tour). Selection of
Airmen for OS is based on the unaccompanied tour length. The OS duty selection date (ODSD)
and the short tour return date (STRD) as explained below, along with the number of short tours
and other information shown in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2, is used to sequence members for OS
PCS priority. Other paragraphs in this instruction on specific subjects (such as TOS,
retainability, quality control, etc.) must also be referenced in conjunction with OS PCS selection.
Guidance pertains to both volunteers and non-volunteers unless stated otherwise.
   3.3.1. AF Airmen will not be assigned to active duty on land outside the US and its
   territories or possessions until they have completed AF basic training requirements. In time
   of war or national emergency declared by Congress or the President, the period of required
   basic training (to include specialty training immediately following basic training), or its
   equivalent, shall not be less than 12 weeks. Airmen must be at least 18 years of age to be
   assigned to a hostile fire or imminent danger area (See Table 2.2). The DOD Pay and
   Allowances Manual designates those areas which are hostile fire or imminent danger areas.
   3.3.2. Non-career officers and FTA may not refuse or decline an OS PCS based solely on
   their non-career officer or FTA status. Also see paragraph 2.14 and paragraph 2.29.5 for
   officers, and paragraph 2.29.6 for enlisted.
   3.3.3. For additional guidance pertaining to volunteer status, see:
       3.3.3.1. Paragraph 2.10, Volunteer Status and PCS Eligibility;
       3.3.3.2. Paragraph 2. 11, Volunteers Replacing Non-volunteers Selected for PCS; and
       3.3.3.3. Paragraph 2.12, Change of Volunteer Status After PCS Selection.
   3.3.4. Within the OS selection priorities in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 for non-volunteers, ties
   are broken by arranging eligibles in the order shown in the note to Table 3.13 with the senior
   non- volunteer selected last. Ties for volunteers are broken using the same criteria and
   arrangement except the senior volunteer is selected first.
   3.3.5. When an Airman assigned in the CONUS is in a mandatory PCS status (see
   Attachment 1), and is vulnerable for OS PCS selection within 24 months, the OS selection
   priorities are as shown in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2.
   3.3.6. For OS selection as a non-volunteer, Airmen who have not been credited with
   completion of an OS tour are selected before those who have been credited with completion
   of an OS tour (whether credit was the result of PCS or TDY).
 172                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   3.3.7. The amount of retainability an Airman has or is eligible to obtain upon completion of
   an OS tour is a factor in determining eligibility for OS PCS selection. The particular OS tour
   length, volunteer status, and the specific reason for an Airman’s actual or projected
   separation or retirement date have a bearing on whether or not the Airman is eligible for OS
   PCS selection. These considerations are reflected in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2, but may be
   waived. The intent is to not subject Airmen selected as non-volunteers to involuntary OS
   tour extension after completion of the prescribed tour when it is known in advance they are
   ineligible to obtain sufficient retainability for a CONUS assignment. Therefore, officers
   approaching or who have an established mandatory separation or mandatory retirement date
   (a date prescribed by law, nonselection for promotion, etc.), and career enlisted Airmen
   approaching a mandatory HYT date (age or years of service), are eligible for OS PCS
   selection within the parameters established in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2. Officers and enlisted
   Airmen who have a separation or retirement date which is not a mandatory date (for example,
   officers who 7-day opted or Airmen who formally declined to obtain PCS retainability and so
   on) and/or Airmen who are eligible to request withdrawal of their separation or retirement
   date, are not restricted by guidance in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 from OS PCS selection on the
   basis of insufficient retainability for CONUS PCS upon tour completion.
   3.3.8. OS Imbalanced AFSCs. Enlisted Only. Enlisted Airmen who have two or more
   awarded AFSCs, one of which is an imbalanced AFSC, are selected and perform duty OS
   only in the imbalanced AFSC. This applies to Airmen who must attend en route training for
   award of the imbalanced AFSC and those who are already qualified (reference the Air Force
   Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). OS Imbalanced AFSCs are listed online in the
   retraining advisory maintained by HQ AFPC/DPPAE.
3.4. Credit for OS Service. Credit is given for OS service performed in any of the Armed
Forces of the U.S. within the guidelines below. OS duty begins on the date of departure from the
CONUS, for assignment purposes, unless an Airman has leave approved in an OS area. Credit
for OS service begins on Airman’s date of arrival at the new OS station for an Airman with
approved leave in an OS area prior to reporting to a new OS duty station. Credit for OS service
ends on the date of arrival at the CONUS port of entry, unless an Airman has leave approved in
an OS area after completion of an OS tour. When an Airman has leave approved in an OS area
after completion of an OS tour, then credit for OS service ends upon departure from the current
OS duty station. As explained below, ―award‖ of an OS service date means to give the Airman a
new date equal to PCS tour completion or the completion date of the last TDY performed in a
cumulative TDY period which qualifies for award of a new date. For example, an Airman who
has never served OS might have a TAFMSD and ODSD of 10 Sep 90. Upon completion of an
OS PCS on 25 Oct 99, the Airman would be awarded a new ODSD of 25 Oct 99. An
―adjustment‖ of an OS service date is adding the number of days an Airman was in a PCS or
TDY status to a previously awarded date. For example, an Airman serving in the CONUS last
returned from PCS OS on 25 Sep 2003 (ODSD is 25 Sep 2003) and he or she performs 5 days
TDY OS from 1 Feb 99 through 5 Feb 99. Upon completion of the OS TDY the Airman’s ODSD
would be adjusted by 5 days to 30 Sep 2003.
   3.4.1. In cases where the OS tour completion dates are earlier than the TAFMSD, the ODSD
   and STRD (see Paragraph 3.5.1.2 and 3.5.2.2) are updated to match the TAFMSD (the
   ODSD and STRD cannot be before a Airman’s TAFMSD).
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                173


  3.4.2. Non-CONUS residents of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Canal Zone receive credit
  for OS service performed in their home state or area since 1 May 1985. No OS credit was
  awarded prior to this date.
  3.4.3. AF Airmen performing duty with the Navy (such as officer Navy exchange tours)
  when assigned to AF units in the CONUS (which are collocated with Navy facilities) and
  who are deployed to sea are considered to be performing CONUS to OS TDY and are
  credited for TDY according to the rules in Table 3.4. Airmen assigned OS and are
  performing duty with the Navy are assigned PCS to land-based AF units OS (which are
  collocated with Navy facilities). These Airmen when deployed to sea are considered
  performing OS to OS TDY and are credited for TDY according to the rules in Table 3.4.
  3.4.4. Update of OS Service.
         3.4.4.1. OS Credit for PCS. The ODSD, STRD, and number of short tours, if
         applicable, will be automatically updated in PDS when the member completes or is
         curtailed from an OS tour. The appropriate tour credit will automatically update once
         the member in-processes at the new location and the MPS gains the member to file.
         Tours starting prior to Jan 2000 that are missing from Airman’s record cannot be
         updated by the MPS, however tours starting after Jan 2000 that are missing can be
         updated by the MPS. Submit a correction request IAW paragraph 3.4.4.3 for
         missing tours that started prior to Jan 2000. Table 3.3 provides the rules for award or
         adjustment of the ODSD and/or STRD based on PCS.
         3.4.4.2. OS Credit for TDY. The ODSD, STRD, and number of short tours, if
         applicable, is automatically updated in PDS when an Airman completes 2 or more
         consecutive days TDY in an OS location. This day-for-day credit is automatic for
         travel vouchers filed when the Airman is serviced by an Air Force Financial Service
         Office (FSO). The interface between the AF military personnel data system and the
         Defense Finance Accounting System (DFAS) makes it possible for Airmen to receive
         automatic OS TDY credit for his or her OS service. NOTE: Airmen who perform OS
         TDYs and who must file their travel voucher through other than Air Force FSO (i.e.,
         Army, Navy) must provide a copy of their completed travel voucher to their MPS for
         individual update of the OS TDY to receive credit (an automatic system interface
         does not exist between Army, Navy FSOs and AF FSOs). MPS’ must ensure that all
         data fields are updated, using information from the travel voucher, to document the
         TDY. The 43F data is required to document the date the travel voucher was
         processed by FSO. Table 3.4 provides the rules for award or adjustment of the
         ODSD and/or STRD based on TDY.
     3.4.4.3. Errors discovered by the Airman or MPS on OS dates (ODSD, STRD, OS tour
     dates, and/or number of short tours) must be thoroughly researched and verified prior to
     submitting a correction of record request to HQ AFPC/DPAPP. The MPS must conduct
     a records audit and use a combination of the following documents to verify OS tours or
     completed TDYs: travel vouchers, PCS orders, decoration citations, EPRs/OPRs, IDA’s,
     records review RIP. Requests for corrections must include the start and stop dates (day,
     month, and year) of the OS tour or TDY, specific country and location, OS tour length or
     number of days TDY, previous ODSD and STRD, and what the ODSD and STRD should
 174                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       be based on the information provided. Tours correction requests may be sent by any
       electrical means (email, FAX).
   3.4.5. Credit for OS service prior to Jan 2005 will not be corrected or otherwise changed by
   the MPS’ because policies, definitions, tour lengths, and so on are subject to change over
   time. Send unusual cases, such as those based on prior service or service in another branch
   of the US Armed Forces, to HQ AFPC/DPAPP (to AF/DPG for generals and general selects,
   and AF/DPO for colonel and colonel selectees) for review and final decision. All requests
   for OS duty credit for prior service in the US Armed Forces must include the documentation
   listed in paragraph 3.4.4.3. It is the Airman’s responsibility to provide the documentation.
   Do not send cases to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for review without the appropriate documentation to
   make a decision. In the case of prior service in which an Airman claims service at sea,
   include special orders assigning the Airman to and from the ship, copies of the ship's logs for
   the period of time sea service claimed, reports of separation verifying the Airman’s prior
   service, and any other documentation that will substantiate the Airman’s request. In addition,
   see paragraph 3.4.4 for the policy on AF Airmen who perform sea duty.
3.5. Overseas Duty Selection Date (ODSD) and Short Tour Return Date (STRD). The
ODSD and STRD are awarded and adjusted according to Tables 3.1, 3.2, and the following
guidelines below. HQ AFPC/DPAPP may authorize award or adjustment of ODSD/STRD as an
exception to the guidance in this instruction. A source document validated by HQ
AFPC/DPAPP or this instruction will authorize such credit.
   3.5.1. ODSD. The ODSD is used along with other factors to place Airmen in the proper
   sequence for selection for an OS tour (long or short) as shown below and in Tables 3.1 and
   3.2. For selection for an OS short tour, the ODSD is used as shown below and in Table 3.1.
   The ODSD will be the most recent of the following:
       3.5.1.1. Non-prior service Airmen are awarded an initial ODSD equal to their TAFMSD;
       or
       3.5.1.2. For prior service personnel who have completed a prior OS tour, the ODSD is
       either the TAFMSD or date Airmen completed the OS tour, whichever is most recent. If
       the stop date of a prior service OS long tour is before the adjusted TAFMSD then the OS
       tour information may be input in the PDS under the OS tour history area for historical
       purposes, but this data will not adjust the ODSD. The ODSD will remain the same as the
       adjusted TAFMSD if more recent; or
       3.5.1.3. The ODSD will be the date an Airman arrives in the CONUS after completing a
       long or short OS tour; or
       3.5.1.4. The date which is 1 day before arrival at a new permanent duty station on a COT
       when there is no travel through the CONUS; or
       3.5.1.5. On completion of the current tour for an In-place COT (IPCOT) (see
       Attachment 4); or
       3.5.1.6. The date of return from the last TDY when a new ODSD is awarded (see Table
       3.4); or
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   175


       3.5.1.7. The total number of days served on an OS TDY(s) which are added day-for-day
       to the ODSD upon completion of the TDY (only TDYs of two or more consecutive days
       are creditable for TDY performed after 5 Jan 1995).
   3.5.2. STRD and Number of Short Tours Completed. The STRD and number of short tours
   completed are used in combination with the ODSD and other factors to place members in the
   proper sequence for selection for OS short tours as shown in Table 3.1. The STRD will be
   the most recent of the following:
       3.5.2.1. Non-prior service members are awarded an initial STRD equal to their
       TAFMSD; or
       3.5.2.2. For prior service personnel who have completed a prior OS short tour, the STRD
       is either the TAFMSD or date Airman completed the OS short tour, whichever is most
       recent. If the stop date of a prior service OS short tour is before the adjusted TAFMSD
       then the OS tour information may be input in the PDS under the OS tour history area for
       historical purposes, but this data will not adjust the STRD. However, it will it be credited
       to the short tour counter. The STRD will remain the same as the adjusted TAFMSD if
       more recent; or
       3.5.2.3. The STRD will be the date the Airman arrives in the CONUS after completing a
       short OS tour; or
       3.5.2.4. The date which is 1 day before arrival at a new permanent duty station on a COT
       when there is no travel through the CONUS; or
       3.5.2.5. On completion of the current tour when it is a short tour for an In-place COT
       (IPCOT) (see Attachment 4); or
       3.5.2.6. The date of return from the last TDY when a new STRD is awarded (see Table
       3.4); or
       3.5.2.7. The total number of days served on an OS TDY(s) which are added day-for-day
       to the STRD upon completion (only TDYs or two or more consecutive days are
       creditable for TDY performed after 5 Jan 1995).
3.6. Actions Upon Notification of OS PCS Selection. The minimum period an Airman is
required to serve on an OS tour is based on the unaccompanied standard tour length shown in the
JFTR, Appendix Q (plus 12 additional months for enlisted Airmen selected as ELT volunteers).
The actual length of time an Airman will serve is determined by options an Airman may have.
An Airman is required, within the prescribed timeframe, to accept the unaccompanied tour
length or take one of the other authorized actions upon official PCS notification (see paragraph
2.33). Airmen may be eligible to make additional choices as outlined below, after having
accepted PCS selection for the unaccompanied tour:
   3.6.1. Home-Basing (HB) and Follow-On (FO) Assignment Programs. Lt Colonel and
   below and Enlisted. The purpose of these two programs is to reduce PCS costs, reduce PCS
   turbulence, and increase stability for members and their families by providing advance
   assignment consideration. The MPS must brief all eligible Airmen selected for or electing to
   serve an unaccompanied OS tour of 15 months or less on these programs. Airmen must
   either apply or decline to apply for these programs, in writing, according to Attachment 5.
 176                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   3.6.2. OS Tour Election and Command Sponsorship. An Airman with dependents who is
   selected for an OS assignment to a location where an accompanied by dependents tour is
   authorized (see the JFTR, Appendix Q) will be counseled on the requirement to make an OS
   tour election to serve either the unaccompanied or the accompanied by dependents OS tour
   (see Attachment 20). Attachment 20 also provides guidance on individually sponsored
   dependents and dependents OS in general. Airmen with no dependents, those selected for
   assignment to a dependent restricted location (tour length NA/12), and those not being
   assigned to a CSPL position (tour length 24/12, such as Osan AB, see the JFTR, Appendix
   Q), are not required to make a tour election.
3.7. Volunteering for Assignment To/From OS.
   3.7.1. Officers. Officers volunteer for OS tours or CONUS assignments according to AFAS
   guidance (see Attachment 17).
   3.7.2. Enlisted. Assignments to and from OS (including COTs, see Attachment 4) are made
   systematically at HQ AFPC (except see Attachment 8 for join spouse assignment).
   Requirements (assignments which will be filled) are identified on either the Enlisted
   Quarterly Assignment Listing (EQUAL) or EQUAL-Plus (see Attachment 16). In addition,
   enlisted Airmen may volunteer for OS and record up to eight OS preferences (bases or
   countries) through the vMPF, self-service actions. If more than one preference is listed, all
   preferences are considered equally for assignment purposes. These preferences are
   maintained in the PDS for all OS volunteers. The following applies to volunteers for OS
   assignment:
       3.7.2.1. Enlisted Airmen should not volunteer for OS tours for which they are ineligible
       to acquire required service retainability (see paragraph 2.29).
       3.7.2.2. Unless a deviation is granted by HQ AFPC/DPAA, enlisted Airmen possessing
       more than one AFSC, one of which is imbalanced, are selected for OS assignment in the
       imbalanced AFSC (see paragraph 3.3.9).
       3.7.2.3. Volunteer preferences reflect tour lengths as short, long, or extended long as
       defined in Attachment 1. Volunteers list their tour length preference based on the tour
       length prescribed for the desired area as shown in the JFTR, Appendix Q. Volunteers
       who desire consideration for any location which is OS should indicate "worldwide" in the
       first OS country preference. Volunteers are considered for selection as follows:
       3.7.2.4. Volunteers for OS locations, countries, or areas are considered for the specific
       preferences they state with unaccompanied tour lengths consistent with their tour length
       preference.
       3.7.2.5. Volunteers for worldwide OS duty are considered for assignment to any
       location. (The actual tour length each Airman serves is determined by the tour length
       preference (short or long), country, duty location, marital or dependency status, grade,
       and availability of housing).
       3.7.2.6. A volunteer is considered for assignment to a country/base of preference only
       until his or her turn for involuntary OS selection is reached, at which time the enlisted
       Airman is considered for OS assignment along with other eligible non-volunteers.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                177


     3.7.2.7. An enlisted Airman with an AAC in the PDS may volunteer for OS at any time.
     However, the member will not be selected for an OS assignment with a departure date
     prior to the expiration of the AAC (see paragraph 2.15.1) unless waived by HQ
     AFPC/DPAPP.
     3.7.2.8. Career enlisted Airmen are not eligible for OS assignment selection if their HYT
     precludes them from obtaining retainability to serve the full accompanied tour length or
     the unaccompanied tour plus 12 months IAW Table 2.6. Reenlistment or extension of
     enlistment beyond HYT for the purpose of obtaining PCS retainability or to serve the
     accompanied tour length is not authorized.
  3.7.3. Assignment Matches. After allocations are reviewed and changed, OS returnees are
  matched against them using the match priorities shown in Table 3.13. This first step in the
  computer program tries to match enlisted Airmen with awarded SEIs against allocations with
  SEI requirements, while satisfying the enlisted Airmen’s preferences. The second step is an
  attempt to match SEI requirements while ignoring preferences. The third step is an attempt
  to match preferences. If neither an SEI match nor a preference match can be made, OS
  returnees are given CONUS assignments based on AFSC, grade, and skill level.
  3.7.4. Airmen within 60 days of DEROS. When an Airman is within 60 days of the first day
  of the DEROS month (OS returnees are considered mandatory movers) and has not received
  an assignment, the MPS sends an e-mail message to the HQ AFPC assignment OPR. The
  HQ AFPC assignment OPR will provide assignment instructions to the Contact Center. The
  Contact Center will provide notification to the MPS and Airman via vMPF. The e-mail
  message from the MPS will include:
     3.7.4.1. Grade, name, SSN, CAFSC.
     3.7.4.2. DEROS, SEIs, CONUS and OS preferences.
     3.7.4.3. All AACs and ALCs with date of availability/expiration date, if applicable.
     3.7.4.4. Date of separation. Include statement to show whether Airman extended or
     reenlisted, and date of action.
     3.7.4.5. If there are any personnel actions, assignment actions, or requests for assignment
     pending that could conflict with the short-notice assignment. If so, state the kind of
     action and the status. If none, so state.
     3.7.4.6. If Airman previously declined an assignment, was declination statement signed,
     and date signed? Was the Airman a career Airman or a first-term Airman when
     declination was signed?
  3.7.5. CMSgts. OS selections and returnee assignment match processes for CMSgts are
  shown in Attachment 16.
  3.7.6. (Enlisted) MAJCOM inputs to HQ AFPC Enlisted Allocation Programs. MAJCOMs
  have an advisory role and provide oversight to allocations for overseas returnee cycles,
  CONUS mandatory moves, technical training graduate moves and overseas cycles. AFPC
  routes all allocations through the command staff for validation. MAJCOMS also have an
  advisory role to assist with manning priorities and changes to manning and allocation plug
  table. The plug table can be used to insert values for SEI, PPC, security access requirements,
  and other variables in the allocation for specified end assignment or AFSCs. The manning
 178                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   plug can be used to specify the desired manning level for an end assignment or AFSC in
   terms of a specific percentage, a maximum percentage, a minimum percentage, or a given
   percentage above the MAJCOM average. MAJCOMs will closely monitor both tables and
   submit changes via standard template located in the MAJCOM assignment toolbox.
3.8. Date Eligible for Return from OS (DEROS) Management. The following paragraphs
provide guidance on initial establishment and computation of DEROS, adjustment of DEROS,
the OS Returnee Counseling Program, DEROS options (such as, indefinite DEROS, extension,
IPCOT), DEROS curtailments, and DEROS proration. Any request that might result in a change
of DEROS for an officer serving in a JDA position must be coordinated with the joint
organization (Director, J-1, or equivalent) and HQ AFPC/DPAPPO.
   3.8.1. Initial DEROS Establishment and Computation. The tour length for the initial
   DEROS is established according to Table 3.8, an Airman’s tour election, remarks in PCS
   orders, the Assignment Action Reason or instructions from the assignment OPR. The
   DEROS is computed by adding the OS tour length (in months) to the date departed CONUS
   (or DAS when applicable). For example, an Airman who departs the CONUS on 20 Jun
   2008 to serve a 36 month tour would have a DEROS of 20 Jun 2011. An Airman who
   departs the CONUS on 1 Sep 08 to serve a 12 month tour would have a DEROS of 1 Sep 09.
   No other method will be used to compute the DEROS except when member reports prior to
   their RNLTD month. In those instances DEROS will be computed by adding the OS tour
   length to the RNLTD month. The DEROS is updated per the PSD Handbook. The DEROS
   for general officers and general officer selectees is established or adjusted at the discretion of
   the SAF. On arrival of a general officer or selectee at the OS duty station, the DEROS is
   established as shown in Table 3.8, or based on assignment instructions from the assignment
   OPR. AFPC does not change the DEROS of general officers (or selectees) once initially
   established. Send DEROS change requests out of system to AF/DPG for approval and
   reentry into PDS. For all Airmen, when PCS orders show the member elected the
   accompanied tour, the initial DEROS is based on the accompanied tour length, whether or
   not the member arrives with dependents. If the Airman desires to change his or her tour
   election after arrival at the OS duty station, see Table 3.8 and/or Attachment 20.
   3.8.2. Adjustment of DEROS. An adjustment of DEROS is a change (extension,
   curtailment, proration, tour election change, etc.) after initial award. Table 3.8 describes
   those events which necessitate adjustment of DEROS.
   3.8.3. DEROS Election Option or Forecast Notification. All enlisted members assigned OS
   and all officers assigned to Korea only will receive a DEROS Election Option or Forecast
   Notification which reflects several DEROS Options. Officers indicate their DEROS
   elections at the time they are placed on the VML for all overseas locations other than Korea.
   The DEROS Election Option is automated through the vMPF at short tour locations (for
   officers [Korea only] and enlisted) and for enlisted Airmen (only) who are eligible to make
   an OTEIP election (see Attachment 15) at long tour locations. The DEROS Forecast
   Notification is automated through the vMPF at all other locations (that is enlisted at long tour
   locations, except for Airmen eligible to make an OTEIP election). The automation of the
   DEROS election Option and Forecast Notification, its purpose, and DEROS options are
   explained below.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             179


     3.8.3.1. At locations where the unaccompanied tour length is 18 months or more, the
     DEROS Election Option or Forecast Notification is automated through the vMPF
     between 13 to 15 months prior to a Airman’s DEROS.
     3.8.3.2. At locations where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18 months, the
     DEROS Election Option or Forecast Notification is automated through the vMPF 10
     months prior to DEROS.
     3.8.3.3. Both the DEROS Election Option and Forecast Notification require an Airman
     to elect one of the DEROS management options listed in paragraphs 3.8.5. Depending
     on which option the Airman elects, additional actions may be required, such as obtaining
     the required retainability.
         3.8.3.3.1. Airman who are notified of a DEROS Election Option must review it,
         initial next to their preference, sign the RIP, and have their supervisor and
         commander sign it. The RIP must be returned to the MPS within 30 days from date it
         was produced.
         3.8.3.3.2. Airmen who are notified of a DEROS Forecast Notification must review
         their options and elect a DEROS option. The Airman should submit to the MPS the
         elected DEROS option within 30 days from the day they are notified they have a
         DEROS Forecast Notification for their review/action. The MPS will update the
         DEROS option. This update will automatically flow this request to the commander
         for coordination. Once the commander completes the action on the DEROS request it
         will automatically flow to the MPS. The MPS forwards to HQ AFPC. HQ AFPC is
         the final approval authority for all DEROS option requests.
  3.8.4. OS Returnee Counseling Program. All Airmen assigned OS must be advised of the
  specific options available to them. To accomplish this, enlisted Airmen must be gieven the
  Enlisted OS Returnee Counseling Handout and officers must be given the Air Force
  Assignment System Guide (AFAS). The MPS is responsible for providing up-to-date
  handouts to each Airman at the same time in which they receive their DEROS Election
  Option or Forcast Notification RIP. Each AF Airman is responsible for reading the contents
  of the handout or guide and ensuring they understand all their DEROS options or seek
  assistance.
     3.8.4.1. The minimum OS returnee counseling requirements are satisfied when the MPS
     provides the Airman a copy of the handout or guide and confirms the Airman’s
     acknowledgement of receipt. An Airman’s receipt of the handout or guide is the primary
     proof that counseling has been provided. The MPS is encouraged to conduct face-to-face
     OS returnee counseling briefings either individually or by group to supplement the
     information in the handout and guide. MPS’ must arrange individual counseling upon
     request.
  3.8.5. DEROS Options. Most DEROS options (Extensions [to include OTEIP], IPCOTs,
  Indefinite DEROS) are intended to increase the stability of the Airman and family (if
  accompanied), save PCS costs by deferring or eliminating the move of the Airman and his or
  her replacement, and provide continuity to the unit of assignment. Each DEROS Option
  must be reviewed on its individual merits and a recommendation for approval or disapproval
  must be based on a combination of factors. These factors include eligibility, duty
180                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  performance, conduct, adaptability, medical suitability, the impact of continued OS duty on
  the Airman and family, and opportunities for continued local career progression. A
  recommendation for disapproval may not be based solely on the passage of time.
      3.8.5.1. Indefinite DEROS. Airmen who desire to remain at the OS duty location
      beyond their minimum prescribed tour length may elect the indefinite DEROS option.
      The commander may recommend approve, but may disapprove the Indefinite DEROS
      request as long as it is consistent with DOD and AF policy (Airmen may not be
      reassigned based solely on the passage of time). Commanders and Airmen must comply
      with procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8.3.3 to request an Indefinite DEROS.
         3.8.5.1.1. For Alaska or Hawaii, Airmen assigned to a long tour location have their
         DEROS automatically changed to indefinite at the time their DEROS Election Option
         or DEROS Forecast is automated in the vMPF. Airmen’s options are: confirming
         and accepting the indefinite DEROS with their commander’s concurrence; requesting
         reinstatement of the original DEROS; or electing any other option available as
         referenced through the vMPF.
         3.8.5.1.2. Enlisted Airmen with an indefinite DEROS who have OS preferences
         reflected in the PDS will receive continuous consideration for COT selection.
         3.8.5.1.3. Enlisted Airmen with an indefinite DEROS must maintain at least 8
         months service retainability to maintain the indefinite DEROS and receive continuous
         COT consideration. Once an enlisted Airman is within 8 months of DOS, he or she
         will no longer be considered for a COT and will have their DEROS automatically
         established to match their DOS. This, in turn, will cause the enlisted Airman to be
         identified for separation. Enlisted Airmen must obtain and maintain sufficient service
         retainability to avoid establishment of an involuntary DEROS as outlined in
         paragraph 2.29.6.5 and Table 3.11.
         3.8.5.1.4. Eligible enlisted Airmen who want to participate in the OS Tour Extension
         Incentive Program (OTEIP) cannot also elect an indefinite DEROS, and vice versa.
         Participation in the OTEIP requires enlisted Airmen to make an entitlement election
         and agree to a specific period (12 month extension), and the period must have a
         specific start and stop date.
         3.8.5.1.5. To establish a DEROS from an indefinite DEROS, members must request
         a DEROS through the vMPF, self-service actions. The requested DEROS cannot be
         more than 15 months, nor less than 12 months from the date of request. To allow for
         systematic rotation the unit commander or the assignment OPR may approve an
         alternate DEROS that is not more than 15 months or less than 9 months from the date
         selected via the vMPF. Officers with an indefinite DOS who want to separate or
         retire upon completion of their OS tour must request establishment of a DEROS
         which coincides with the date of separation or date of retirement requested. Enlisted
         Airmen who desire to retire should request establishment of a DEROS to coincide
         with their retirement application. Enlisted Airmen who desire to separate will
         automatically have a DEROS established when they get within 8 months of DOS.
         3.8.5.1.6. An Airman’s unit commander can request a DEROS be established from
         an indefinite DEROS for the reasons listed in paragraph 3.8.5, or when such action
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 181


         serves the best interest of the AF. In addition, the assignment OPR may also initiate
         such action. Final decision on any request submitted under this paragraph is the
         assignment OPR.
  3.8.6. Voluntary DEROS Extension. Airmen may request a DEROS extension not to exceed
  the standard accompanied tour length at the current location in a single increment. Upon
  deciding how long to extend, Airmen should consider if they will be eligible to obtain at least
  12 months retainability after the requested DEROS in order to be eligible for a CONUS PCS.
  Also, enlisted Airmen in an SRB AFSC requesting a DEROS extension should be counseled
  in regards to the affect on their SRB due to retainability requirements for the DEROS
  extension. SRB eligible personnel should consider requesting a retainability suspense delay
  as outlined in Table 2.7. All other enlisted Airmen must obtain the appropriate retainability
  as outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.4.6. To request a voluntary DEROS extension, Airmen must
  comply with procedures as outlined in paragraph 3.8.6.6 above.
     3.8.6.1. Approval/Disapproval Authority. Unit commanders may recommend approval
     or disapprove extension requests as outlined in Table 3.9. Approval recommendations
     will be forwarded to the assignment OPR. Assignment OPRs approve or disapprove
     extension requests submitted for consideration.
     3.8.6.2. Enlisted Airmen not recommended for reenlistment or promotion are not eligible
     for voluntary extension of OS tour.
     3.8.6.3. Enlisted Airmen eligible for the OTEIP must apply using their DEROS Election
     Option and ensure their extension request is directly processed and submitted/updated.
     An OTEIP extension is different than other voluntary DEROS extensions. Refer to
     Attachment 15 for further OTEIP guidance.
     3.8.6.4. DEROS extensions for members of military couples (who marry during current
     OS tour) at an OS area without government approved accompanied housing are not
     authorized, except for the purpose of establishing a common DEROS in order to facilitate
     join spouse assignment consideration according to Attachment 8.
     3.8.6.5. Airmen ineligible to obtain CONUS PCS service retainability computed IAW
     Table 2.5 (for example, enlisted Airmen who decline to obtain retainability) will have
     their DEROS involuntarily extended to match their DOS (see Table 3.11).
     3.8.6.6. A DEROS extension request submitted later than 30 days from the day the
     DEROS Election Option or DEROS Forecast Notification is produced must be submitted
     and considered as an exception to paragraph 3.8.3.3.1. This type of request must be
     fully justified and may be disapproved by the commander. When the unit commander
     recommends approval, the request is forwarded to the assignment OPR for a final
     decision.
     3.8.6.7. Airmen surplus to current unit authorizations may request a DEROS extension
     and may be approved if they can be utilized within another MAJCOM at the same
     location. The MPS forwards this type request, along with recommendations of both
     commanders concerned, to the assignment OPR for a final determination. If approved,
     appropriate PCA instructions and DEROS change are flowed via PDS.
182                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      3.8.6.8. Airmen may request cancellation of any part of an approved voluntary DEROS
      extension provided:
         3.8.6.8.1. The new DEROS does not place an enlisted Airman within the OS
         allocation cycle (which is different than the OS returnee cycle) as outlined in
         Attachment 16, EQUAL, or an officer does not have an ASD according to Table 2.8.
         3.8.6.8.2. Airmen have or obtain the full minimum service retainability for a CONUS
         assignment as outlined in Table 2.5.
         3.8.6.8.3. Airmen who have voluntarily extended their OS tour are not involuntarily
         reassigned during the period of extension to any other location without the approval
         of HQ AFPC/DPAPP. If reassignment is mandatory, these Airmen will be reported to
         the appropriate HQ AFPC assignment OPR as available for CONUS assignment.
         3.8.6.8.4. OS DEROS extension is viewed as a commitment to the Airman. Requests
         for cancellation of all or part of a DEROS extension by the Airman’s commander is
         an exception to procedures and must be fully justified to the HQ AFPC assignment
         OPR. Cancellation of an approved voluntary extension should not be taken in lieu of
         appropriate administrative or disciplinary action. Cancellation due to force structure
         changes or authorization deletions does not require additional justification.
  3.8.7. Enlisted Airmen. Enlisted Airmen serving in short tour areas who extend their OS
  tour for a period of 6 or more months and those in long tour areas who extend for a period of
  12 months are given higher assignment priority within their returnee match group as outlined
  in Table 3.13. This is done to encourage enlisted Airmen to ask for voluntary OS DEROS
  extension.
  3.8.8. In-Place Consecutive OS Tour (IPCOT). Airmen may request an additional OS tour
  at their current duty station using procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8.6.6 and Attachment
  4. The IPCOT tour length must be equal to or greater than the tour length currently being
  served. An IPCOT is a new tour, not an extension. The DAS does not change because there
  is no change in duty station. (EXCEPTIONS: An Airman serving an accompanied tour who
  has a change in dependent status and is no longer accompanied by dependents may request
  an unaccompanied IPCOT. In addition, enlisted Airmen may request a standard tour length
  IPCOT if currently serving the extended long tour and single officers with no dependents
  may request a standard unaccompanied tour length IPCOT if serving the accompanied
  equivalent tour length.). Additional guidance on IPCOT is outlined in Attachment 4.
  3.8.9. Curtailment of OS Tour. To offset the costs associated with OS assignments, provide
  operational continuity, and reduce the frequency of PCS, Airmen will serve the full
  prescribed tour length for which they are assigned. Reassignment of Airmen that involve
  PCS earlier than the DEROS month is a curtailment, except when the Airman requests
  cancellation of all or part of a previously approved voluntary DEROS extension (see
  paragraph 3.8.6.8 and JFTR, Vol I, Appendix Q). An IPCOT is a new tour, not an
  extension. The needs of the AF may require curtailment and reassignment before completion
  of the prescribed tour; however, such decisions are kept to an absolute minimum.
      3.8.9.1. Curtailments may be granted on an individual case-by-case basis if that is the
      only recourse available, and the action is clearly in the best interest of the AF. Table
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                183


     3.10 lists those reasons for which curtailment of an OS tour may be considered, who must
     originate requests, and who is the approval authority.
     3.8.9.2. A curtailment request for a reason other than those listed in Table 3.10 is an
     exception and must be processed IAW paragraph 1.5 with full justification. Exception
     curtailment must originate from a general officer or colonel in a wing commander
     position or equivalent. Equivalent is defined as a senior rater, colonel or higher military
     rank only. In addition, curtailment exception requests must clearly show that the AF
     Airman is experiencing an unusual situation in comparison to other Airmen in similar
     circumstances, or that the Airman is being adversely affected more severely than other
     Airmen in similar circumstances, and that the desire to be curtailed does not stem from
     factors over which the Airman had (or should have had) reasonable control or which they
     caused by their own actions. Requests for curtailment as an exception based solely on
     personal reasons will not be considered.
     3.8.9.3. Airman-initiated exception requests for OS tour curtailment may be disapproved
     at any level (commander, installation commander, or assignment OPR). If denied locally,
     the request is returned to the Airman with the rationale for disapproval. HQ
     AFPC/DPAPP is the approval authority for curtailment exception requests or will
     forward to the appropriate level as necessary.
     3.8.9.4. Changes to DEROS for authorized reasons such as proration or an Airman’s
     request to cancel part of voluntary DEROS extension do not constitute a curtailment of
     OS tour (for enlisted Airmen serving an extended long OS tour, cancellation only applies
     to a DEROS extension over and above the full extended tour). However, the adjusted
     DEROS will not be within the enlisted Airmen OS allocation cycle as outlined in
     Attachment 16, and for officers the adjusted DEROS must not result in the officer
     receiving an ASD which is past, unless an exception is requested and approved by the
     assignment OPR (see Table 2.8, rule 3, for the ASD schedule).
     3.8.9.5. In limited circumstances, Airmen may be curtailed and reassigned on COTs
     without having completed the full tour lengths at both the losing and gaining locations.
     Such curtailment/reassignment requests are exceptions and must be originated by a
     general or flag officer (except for humanitarian/EFMP requests. Reassignment must be
     within the same theater. Further, only those exceptions that result in the Airman serving
     at least the equivalent of two unaccompanied tours can be considered for approval by HQ
     AFPC/CC. A request that an Airman serve less than the equivalent of two
     unaccompanied tours can only be authorized by the SAF. Computation of the equivalent
     of two unaccompanied tours is as follows: If an Airman is assigned from a 36/24 month
     tour area within the same theater to a 36/24 month tour area, the Airman must serve not
     less than 48 months total between the two locations before being reassigned from the
     theater. Refer to Attachment 4 for further information on COT assignments.
     3.8.9.6. Terminal leave taken before the DEROS does not result in tour curtailment or
     accelerated replacement action. Ordinary leave taken before DEROS must begin and end
     in the local area; therefore, it may not be taken as a means of accelerating the departure
     before DEROS.
     3.8.9.7. AF/DPG effects curtailments of OS tours for general officers and selectees at the
     direction of the SAF.
184                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  3.8.10. Curtailment of OS Tour or Restriction from OS Duty for Cause. If an Airman and/or
  his or her dependents are involved in a serious incident in the host country which has
  resulted, or could result, in significant adverse publicity to the United States, prompt, positive
  action must be taken. However, curtailment and reassignment must not be used in lieu of
  appropriate administrative or disciplinary action, and should be used only as a last resort.
      3.8.10.1. In most situations misconduct on the part of dependents, in itself, is not an
      appropriate reason to curtail and reassign the military member. Normally, early return of
      dependents due to misconduct is processed under AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel,
      and the JFTR,Volume 1 without curtailment of the military member. The exception is
      when the severity of the incident(s) is such that senior installation leadership believes
      curtailment and reassignment of the Airman is justified due to the strong likelihood of
      adverse publicity to the United States that can only be prevented by removal of the
      Airman and family from the OS area.
      3.8.10.2. Where there is evidence of spousal or child abuse or neglect, involuntary
      curtailment and reassignment may be requested if an effective family advocacy program
      cannot be established locally, or the family's needs exceed local capabilities. In addition,
      these are sensitive issues which could lead to criminal, administrative, or other actions
      that may cause embarrassment or adverse publicity to the United States government. If
      senior installation leadership believes an Airman should be reassigned and the Airman
      does not choose to apply for reassignment under humanitarian provisions, (see
      Attachment 24), then the commander may request curtailment and reassignment of the
      Airman under this provision. The commander must comply with AFI 40-301, Family
      Advocacy, and the following paragraphs.
      3.8.10.3. Requesting Curtailment for Cause. When curtailment for cause is necessary, the
      request must originate or be endorsed by the installation commander. Requests are
      processed through the host OS MAJCOM JA for recommendation to HQ AFPC/DPAPP,
      with information copies to the parent MAJCOM if applicable. NOTE: If the curtailment
      request is based on incidents which have resulted, or could result in significant adverse
      publicity to the United States, also forward a copy of the request to: HQ USAF/JAI, 1420
      Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1420. All requests must include:
         3.8.10.3.1. Airman’s name, grade, SSN, CAFSC (enlisted) or DAFSC (officers),
         DEROS, and unit.
         3.8.10.3.2. Full facts and circumstances warranting curtailment and reassignment or
         other restriction.
         3.8.10.3.3. Details on involvement of host country to include what, if any, adverse
         publicity has occurred.
         3.8.10.3.4. Details regarding jurisdiction over the offense, if appropriate.
         3.8.10.3.5. Administrative or disciplinary action taken or pending against the
         Airman, or why these actions were not deemed appropriate.
         3.8.10.3.6. Installation JA recommendation, to include if any objection exists to the
         reassignment from the area by the host country, the American Embassy, or United
         States military authorities in the country concerned.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  185


          3.8.10.3.7. The number of dependents and whether or not they are command
          sponsored.
          3.8.10.3.8. Reasons why curtailment and reassignment within the theater would not
          be a better solution than reassignment to the CONUS.
          3.8.10.3.9. CONUS assignment preferences.
          3.8.10.3.10. Recommendation whether or not Airman should be restricted from a
          return assignment to the same OS area. Indicate whether this restriction should be
          temporary or permanent.
   3.8.11. If the curtailment and reassignment request is based on dependent misconduct
   include the following in addition to the above required information:
       3.8.11.1. Actions taken by the military member to correct the problem and reasons why
       the sponsor cannot, or will not, solve the problem.
       3.8.11.2. Actions taken by the commander to solve the problem to include administrative
       or disciplinary actions taken against the military member when it is within his or her
       capability to solve the problem. NOTE: While the military member cannot be held
       directly responsible for the misconduct of his or her dependents, lack of action or refusal
       by the Airman without justifiable hardship, humanitarian, or medical reasons, to
       influence the dependents to return, presumptively indicates an attitude that is
       incompatible with the maintenance of good order and discipline. Commanders should
       take appropriate administrative or disciplinary action before requesting curtailment of the
       Airman.
   3.8.12. Requests to Restrict Future OS Assignments Without Curtailment. On occasion
   while assigned OS, Airmen or their dependents may establish an unfavorable record of
   misconduct (that is, on or off base incidents, black-marketing, and so forth) which may
   indicate they should be restricted from specific future OS assignments. Although there may
   be insufficient justification to warrant a curtailment for cause, an intervening length of time
   in the CONUS may be appropriate before the Airman is allowed to return to a specific OS
   base, country, or area. If the installation commander determines that a restriction would be in
   the best interests of the AF, process the request before the departure of the member from the
   OS area as follows:
       3.8.12.1. Requests, including installation JA recommendation, are processed through the
       host OS MAJCOM /JA to HQ AFPC/DPAPP and include the information listed in
       paragraph 3.8.10.3.
3.9. Emergency Leave, Airmen Assigned OS. The criteria for granting emergency leave are
in AFI 36-3003. An Airman granted emergency leave must return OS to complete their OS tour
unless the Airman requests and is granted a curtailment according to Table 3.10. Unit
commanders must carefully assess their manning requirements when considering these
curtailment requests. Curtailment approval is with the understanding that TDY manning
assistance or accelerated replacement will not be provided. If the immediate commander concurs
with the request, he or she may approve the curtailment if, upon completion of emergency leave,
the member has 60 calendar days or less remaining to DEROS. Notify the assignment OPR once
 186                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


curtailment is approved. If the requested curtailment is more than 60 days, then the request must
be processed as an exception IAW paragraph 1.5.
   3.9.1. If an Airman is granted emergency leave after the Airman has received his or her
   CONUS assignment based on the original DEROS, that assignment will usually remain firm.
   The MPS advises the assignment OPR, by e-mail message, of the Airman’s departure date
   from the OS area on leave, number of days leave the commander approved, date to which the
   OS tour is being curtailed by the commander, and the Airman’s leave address and phone
   number. If a second PCS DLA in the same fiscal year is required, refer to paragraph 2.51.
   3.9.2. When an Airman is granted emergency leave during the OS returnee assignment
   cycle, but before receipt of a CONUS assignment, and curtailment of OS tour is requested,
   the MPS sends an e-mail message to the assignment OPR. The e-mail must contain: (1)
   Grade, Name, SSN; (2) DAFSC (Officers) or CAFSC (Enlisted), and additional AFSCs; (3)
   Date Departed CONUS; (4) Date Departed on Emergency Leave; (5) Current DEROS; (6)
   Updated Assignment Preferences, if possible; (7) Reason for Emergency Leave; (8) Leave
   Address and Phone Number; (9) and whether this is the second PCS during the current fiscal
   year.
       3.9.2.1. Upon receipt of the MPS email, the assignment OPR processes the curtailment
       request and, if approved, provides a CONUS assignment by return e-mail message to the
       gaining and losing MP’s. The losing MPS will notify Airman at his or her leave address.
       At the same time, the assignment OPR updates the DEROS and projects the assignment
       in PDS. The losing MPS issues orders unless the assignment OPR authorizes another
       MPS to issue orders. Copies of the orders are forwarded to the Airman at the leave
       address and the gaining MPS.
       3.9.2.2. If the Airman has a DOS or an approved retirement date within 60 calendar days
       of the date departing on emergency leave, he or she is given the opportunity to choose
       early separation or retirement. Before the member leaves the OS area, the MPS gets a
       signed statement of the Airman’s desires. If separation is requested and the commander
       concurs, the Contact Center issues orders assigning the member PCS without PCA to the
       MPS nearest the emergency leave address for accountability while Airman is
       accomplishing separation processing.       These orders must include the remarks:
       "Emergency leave returnee with insufficient retainability for PCS." If curtailment is
       approved and adjustment of an approved retirement or separation date is required, ensure
       compliance with AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements, AFI 36-3208, Administrative
       Separation of Airmen, or AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers.
       3.9.2.3. If the Airman does not request and receive approval of curtailment before
       departure on emergency leave, leave orders must indicate that the Airman is to return to
       the OS unit on completion of emergency leave.
3.10. Involuntary DEROS Extension.         Involuntarily extension of an Airman’s OS tour
beyond the DEROS month is authorized only for those reasons shown in Table 3.11 and IAW
this paragraph. Also refer to paragraph 3.10.6 for situations where the Airman is retained OS
beyond DEROS with no involuntary DEROS extension (and the DEROS is allowed to expire).
   3.10.1. Insufficient Retainability for CONUS Assignment. Airmen are not returned to the
   CONUS with less than the minimum service retainability as provided in paragraph 2.29 and
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               187


  Table 2.5. Airmen who do not have the required retainability are given the opportunity to
  obtain it (except officers with a mandatory DOS or retirement date and enlisted Airmen not
  eligible due to quality reasons or HYT) as part of the OS returnee counseling requirements or
  DEROS option election. Airmen who do not have or are ineligible to obtain the required
  retainability will have their DEROS automatically extended involuntarily to match their DOS
  (see Table 3.11). Airmen who have had their DEROS involuntarily extended to match their
  DOS because of insufficient retainability for PCS will not have their original DEROS
  reinstated solely as the result of acquiring retainability after the established cutoff. The
  DEROS change selection (vMPF) is used as the source document for involuntary OS tour
  extension.
  3.10.2. Involuntary Extension of OS Tour for Cause. DOD and, in turn, the AF permit
  involuntary extension of Airmen in the OS area for limited specific reasons. This paragraph
  provides the losing commander the opportunity to involuntarily extend Airmen in order to
  take appropriate action to rehabilitate, discipline, or separate those Airmen, who by their
  actions or performance, have demonstrated they are unwilling or unable to meet minimum
  AF standards. Involuntary extension is a function of command and the decision to extend
  rests solely with the losing commander. Airmen may be involuntarily extended as indicated
  below, in increments of 30 days, not to exceed a total of 120 days. For reasons not
  specifically listed below, or when the reason in combination with an Airman’s
  accompanied/unaccompanied status is other than shown, or for periods longer than 120 days,
  an involuntary extension request must be submitted to, and approved in advance by, HQ
  AFPC/DPAPP. Requests submitted to HQ AFPC/DPAPP may require further processing to
  DOD for approval as exceptions.
     3.10.2.1. The reasons and authority for involuntary OS tour extensions are limited and
     specific. For the purpose of PCS assignments the term "admin hold" is too general in
     nature; all involuntary extensions must be based on one of the specific reasons authorized
     or approval of the extension received as an exception. Unit commanders must take
     prompt administrative or disciplinary action to reduce the need for involuntary OS
     extension. When more time is necessary to complete an administrative or disciplinary
     action, they may request involuntary DEROS extension. The commander exercising
     Special Court Martial (SPCM) authority (or HQ AFPC/CC) may approve a unit
     commander’s request for involuntary DEROS extension of an Airman serving any OS
     tour (accompanied or unaccompanied, short or long), for the following reasons.
     (Approval authority may not be delegated). When the SPCM authority approves an
     involuntary extension, the MPS must take PDS update action as prescribed in paragraph
     3.10.4 NOTE: Airmen serving an unaccompanied short tour can be involuntarily
     extended for only the following reasons.
         3.10.2.1.1. AFOSI or Security Forces investigation (AAC 17).
         3.10.2.1.2. Court Martial or civil charges preferred (AAC 15).
         3.10.2.1.3. Key and essential (material witness) at courts-martial (AAC 14).
         3.10.2.1.4. Completion of Article 15 action (AAC 12). Does not include suspended
         punishment period.
188                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


         3.10.2.1.5. Completion of Administrative Discharge Actions and/or Article 32
         investigations (AAC 21).
         3.10.2.1.6. Compliance with the host country’s customs regulations.
  3.10.3. In addition to the reasons listed above, a unit commander may request, and the
  commander exercising SPCM authority (or HQ AFPC/CC) may approve, involuntary
  DEROS extension of an Airman serving accompanied, short or long tour, or accompanied or
  unaccompanied at a long tour (see Attachment 1) location for the following reasons.
  (Approval authority may not be delegated). Upon approval, the MPS must take PDS update
  action as prescribed in paragraph 3.10.4.
      3.10.3.1. Enlisted Airmen nonselected for reenlistment (AAC 10, authorized only in
      conjunction with rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary action also being taken).
      3.10.3.2. Control Roster (AAC 16).
      3.10.3.3. Enlisted only. Administrative Demotion (AAC 21).
      3.10.3.4. Enlisted only. Last EPR promotion recommendation is "1" or "2" (authorized
      only if the commander also places the Airman on the control roster with a commander-
      directed EPR at the conclusion of the observation period).
      3.10.3.5. Failure to meet Fitness Standards only authorized if rehabilitative,
      administrative, or disciplinary action is also being taken.
      3.10.3.6. Mandatory retraining action (authorized only if reporting identifier 9A100
      applies).
  3.10.4. Involuntary extension requires a change in DEROS. If an Airman is involuntarily
  extended, the servicing MPS updates PDS to reflect the appropriate AAC from Table 2.1,
  ALC from Table 2.2, and then updates the DEROS according to the PSD Handbook. Local
  updates to involuntarily extend the DEROS must be accomplished prior to the current
  DEROS date reflected in the PDS. If PDS action to involuntarily extend the DEROS is taken
  after the DEROS date on file, the update will reject. In these situations, an e-mail message
  request to the assignment OPR, with an information copy to HQ AFPC/DPAPP is necessary.
  A message request must include full facts and circumstances, to include date action was
  approved by SPCM authority. Assignments on file will not normally be changed or canceled
  unless the Airman is pending assignment on a COT, OS follow-on, or is otherwise
  disqualified according to the assignment instructions, or cancellation is in the best interests of
  the AF. The assignment RNLTD will be adjusted by the assignment OPR as necessary.
  3.10.5. Involuntary Extension of OS Tour for Operational Requirements, Training,
  Education, Unit Deactivation, or Base Closure. Involuntary extension of an OS tour may be
  requested for up to 180 days by an Airman's commander or directed by HQ AFPC/CC, for
  only the following reasons: to meet immediate and critical operational needs (for example, to
  meet contingency requirements of such urgency that STOP-LOSS has been implemented); to
  attend training or education when class start date does not reasonably coincide with the
  Airman's tour completion date; when the Airman is currently assigned to a unit being
  deactivated; or due to base closure. Requests must be initiated at least 90 days prior to the
  current DEROS and contain justification for the action requested including alternatives
  considered and why the alternatives are unsatisfactory. Include all pertinent information on
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  189


   Airman's status (selected for assignment or pending separation/retirement; status of
   dependents; household goods, etc.). Involuntary extension of DEROS will not extend a DOS
   or retirement date. Requests initiated by commanders are submitted to the assignment OPR
   for final decision by HQ AFPC/CC. Voluntary extension should be solicited before
   involuntary extension.
   3.10.6. Retention OS Without Involuntary DEROS Extension. For the following reasons,
   Airmen who are retained in place as ineligible, not qualified, or prohibited from departing on
   PCS, do not require involuntary DEROS extension. The current DEROS is allowed to
   expire, unless the Airman voluntarily extends his or her DEROS according to paragraph
   3.8.6.
       3.10.6.1. Airman is not medically cleared for PCS (AAC 31 or 37), or has no awarded
       AFSC due to disqualification action (RI 9A000, 9A100, and 9A300, and RI 96U0 for
       officers).
       3.10.6.2. Airman has been placed on International Hold (AAC 13).
       3.10.6.3. Airman is serving a confinement sentence OS as a result of court-martial or
       civil court action (Duty Status Codes 04, 05, 16, 17, 56, and 59).
3.11. Tour Proration. (NOTE: This program is suspended due to world events until further
notice.) OS tour proration recognizes OS service at one location in proportion to OS service at
another location with a different tour length. Proration for TDY is an AF policy, not a DOD
requirement. Proration in conjunction with PCS is an AF policy, except DOD may authorize or
direct proration in some instances in conjunction with a change of OS tour length affecting
Airmen currently assigned. When proration is authorized (and not prohibited, see paragraph
3.2), an Airman’s current OS tour (DEROS) could either be lengthened or shortened depending
on the circumstances. Proration may be based on TDY to an OS location where the tour length
is less than the tour length at the Airman’s OS permanent duty station; when reassigned PCS to
another OS location with a different tour length before completing the full prescribed OS tour at
the initial location; when a tour length is changed at the Airman’s duty station during a Airman’s
OS tour; or as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPP. Proration may be suspended or an individual
request disapproved when approval does not serve the best interests of the AF. Enlisted Airmen
serving an OTEIP extension (AAC 77) are not eligible for tour proration.
   3.11.1. Proration Based on TDY. For this type proration, an Airman must perform 60 or
   more consecutive days TDY to an OS location where either the accompanied or
   unaccompanied tour length is less than either the accompanied or unaccompanied tour length
   at their permanent duty station as explained in the JFTR, Appendix Q. If the TDY location
   tour length is not listed in the JFTR, Appendix Q., contact HQ AFPC/ DPAPP for the
   appropriate tour length. Table 3.13 contains the proration formula and several examples are
   provided in the footnotes to assist in understanding the process. EXCEPTION: Proration for
   TDY is not authorized for Airmen assigned to Alaska or Hawaii at locations where both the
   accompanied and unaccompanied tour lengths are 36 months when TDY is to a location
   where the accompanied tour length is 36 months and the unaccompanied tour length is 24
   months. The specific amount of proration is computed according to the instructions in Table
   3.12. Proration based on TDY is not automatic and must be requested by the Airman upon
   return from a qualifying TDY and be approved by the assignment OPR. Proration for TDY
   that results in a DEROS within the OS cycle (for enlisted Airmen see Attachment 16,
 190                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   paragraph A16.5, allocation column, or for officers an ASD as shown in Table 2.8) is not
   authorized. (NOTE: For enlisted Airmen, the cycle referred to is the OS allocation cycle, not
   the OS returnee cycle.) When the authorized amount of proration results in a DEROS within
   the OS allocation cycle for enlisted Airmen or an ASD for officers, then an alternate amount
   of tour proration which results in a DEROS outside the OS allocation cycle or for officers
   which does not result in an ASD may be approved by the assignment OPR. Whenever
   possible, planning for TDYs between locations with different tour lengths and selection of
   personnel to perform TDY should consider both the impact of proration on the mission and
   the benefit Airmen may derive from proration.
   3.11.2. Proration Based on PCS or Tour Length Change. When an Airman is reassigned to
   an OS location with a different tour length than the one currently being served, or a tour
   length is changed and the implementation date affects Airmen currently assigned, then the
   OS tour will normally be prorated (longer or shorter) unless the individual assignment
   instructions or tour length implementation guidance affords the Airman options or prohibits
   proration. For example, implementation guidance for a change of current tour from a shorter
   to longer tour may contain the option for Airmen currently assigned to retain the current
   (shorter) tour or voluntarily serve the longer tour, or it may require serving the longer tour as
   mandatory, or may stipulate proration from the shorter to the longer tour. Usually, a tour
   length change effective date is far enough in advance to allow Airmen already assigned, or en
   route, to serve the existing tour length. Airmen who are to serve the new tour length will be
   selected for PCS based on their eligibility for the new tour length. Proration of DEROS to
   less than 6 months remaining is not authorized when a tour length change occurs and the
   Airman will remain in place, unless an exception is granted by HQ AFPC/DPAPP. This
   allows adequate time for all action related to PCS to occur in a timely manner. When tour
   length will change due to PCS, the Airman will not be reassigned OS if serving a tour of 18
   months or more. The procedure to determine the amount of proration for these reasons is
   outlined in Table 3.12.
3.12. Medal of Honor Recipients and Candidates. Airmen who are recipients, or who have
been recommended for award of the Medal of Honor by their group or higher command will not
be assigned to duty OS in a hostile fire or imminent danger area without the Airman’s consent.
On receipt of the directive awarding, or correspondence recommending award of the Medal of
Honor to an Airman, the MPS advises the assignment OPR by e-mail message for assignment
disposition. Include the Airman's assignment preferences. The assignment OPR immediately
issues instructions reassigning the Airman, or takes action to cancel a projected assignment to a
designated hostile fire or imminent danger area as shown in the DOD Pay and Allowances
Manual. Recipients of the Medal of Honor will have assignment limitation code "E" entered in
PDS. An Airman may request waiver of this assignment restriction by sending a request to HQ
AFPC/DPAPP. File approved waivers in Section III of the Airman’s electronic UPRG until
separation or retirement.
3.13. Citizenship Considerations (Non-US Citizens and Dual Citizenship).
   3.13.1. Security Access for Non-US Citizens. In general, an AF Airman who is a non-US
   citizen is ineligible to be granted security access. Accordingly, these Airmen may not be
   selected for assignment to any position in the CONUS or OS requiring security access. For
   guidance on assigning a non-US citizen with a TAFMSD prior to 1 Nov 82 to a position
   requiring security access (for example, the Airman may have been the subject of a previous
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   191


  background investigation and may be eligible for security access), consult AFI 31-501,
  Personnel Security Program Management.
  3.13.2. OS Assignment Eligibility of Non-US or Dual Citizens.
     3.13.2.1. Officers. All commissioned officers must be a US citizen. However, for OS
     assignment of officers who hold dual citizenship or if their dependents are non-US
     citizens, then comply with paragraph 3.13.3.1.
     3.13.2.2. Enlisted . Non-US citizens with a TAFMSD of 1 Nov 82 and more recent are
     not assigned OS (except to Alaska and Hawaii). In addition to the considerations in
     paragraph 3.13.3, not assigning non-US citizens OS allows these enlisted Airmen the
     opportunity to obtain US naturalization which is required for reenlistment eligibility.
     Further, a non-US citizen may not be eligible for entry into a third country because of
     agreements between the Airman's native country and the third country. Notwithstanding
     paragraph 3.13.3 and the concern for reenlistment eligibility, should assignment OS be
     deemed essential, regardless of TAFMSD, then comply with paragraph 3.13.3 below.
     Also, before authorizing any non-US citizen or their dependents to proceed OS, the
     provisions of DOD Regulation 1000.21, DOD Passport and Passport Agent Services,
     must be met.
     3.13.2.3. To preserve the best interest of the AF and to protect its Airmen and their
     dependents, Airmen may request release from assignment to a foreign country of which
     they are citizens or are former citizens, or to a country where their dependents are citizens
     or former citizens. The request must be submitted to the MPS after official notification of
     assignment and the MPS will immediately reclama the assignment. The decision to
     cancel an assignment under these circumstances will be made by the assignment OPR
     and be based on various factors (volunteer status, sufficient time to select replacement,
     and so on). When a request based on dependents is disapproved, the Airman may be
     required to remain on assignment to serve the unaccompanied tour depending on the
     individual circumstances.
  3.13.3. OS Assignment of Persons Holding Dual Citizenship. Citizenship is the relationship
  between a person and a country under which the person owes allegiance and is entitled to
  protection by the country. The laws of each nation determine who are its citizens.
  Differences in the citizenship and nationality laws of the nations of the world can result in
  dual citizenship; that is, two or more nations claiming the same person as its citizen. Dual
  citizenship most frequently occurs when a person changes his or her citizenship by
  naturalization or is born in one country of parents who are citizens of another country.
  Persons possessing dual citizenship may have legal obligations to both countries and persons
  who are non-US citizens may have legal obligations to their native country, including the
  obligation to pay foreign income taxes, serve in a foreign military service, liability for import
  taxes on household goods or POV, they might be restricted from departure by emigration
  laws, and so on. In most cases, enforcement of these obligations is attempted only if the
  individual enters the territorial boundaries of the other country. In the absence of an
  agreement, the US government cannot assert a legal objection to a foreign government
  applying, within its own territorial boundaries, its internal laws to persons qualifying as
  citizens under its laws. This is true even though the individual may also be a US citizen
  under US law and be serving in the US Armed Forces. The Airman and the assignment
192                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  OPRs must be aware of those circumstances, especially when humanitarian assignment is
  being requested or whenever an exchange or SWAP of assignments is requested.
      3.13.3.1. Actions Required. An Airman who is a US citizen and also holds citizenship in
      another country (dual citizenship) or an Airman who is not a US citizen, will not be
      assigned to the foreign country where citizenship is held unless approval is granted by the
      MAJCOM/JA having OS jurisdiction. A request for approval of assignment is required
      to allow review of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and to determine other legal
      ramifications (such as, would the foreign government choose to hold the Airman to any
      of the obligations mentioned above). NOTE: A request must also be processed when an
      Airman is selected for reassignment to a location where an accompanied tour is
      authorized and his or her dependents are non-US or dual citizens. Failure to obtain
      approval may have serious consequences. The requirement for this review and approval
      will not be waived. The request must include the following information and is forwarded
      by the Airman’s servicing MPS directly to the AFPC assignment OPR:
         3.13.3.1.1. Name, grade, SSN, and AFSC.
         3.13.3.1.2. Gaining unit, AAN, and RNLTD.
         3.13.3.1.3. Country of citizenship.
         3.13.3.1.4. Whether or not Airman has applied for US citizenship.
         3.13.3.1.5. Date and point of entry into the US.
         3.13.3.1.6. Alien dependents of Airman and relationship.
         3.13.3.1.7. Record of any courts-martial.
         3.13.3.1.8. Previous assignment to country of which Airman holds citizenship.
         3.13.3.1.9. Names and addresses of relatives residing in the country of which the
         Airman is a citizen.
         3.13.3.1.10. Country of citizenship of Airman's natural parents.
  3.13.4. AFPC Assignment OPR Actions. On receipt of a request, the AFPC Assignment
  OPR consults with the MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate to determine whether any legal or
  community relations problems exist that could make the assignment objectionable. In
  particular, whether the Airman (or dependents) would be subject to the draft laws of the
  country, restricted from departure by emigration laws, and so on, or if factors exist that
  would present a high risk to continued AF service. The AFPC assignment OPR coordinates
  with the MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate and approves or disapproves the request. When
  assignment of an Airman is disapproved, the assignment OPR immediately reassesses the
  selection using justification for assignment disqualification. When the denial is based on an
  Airman’s dependents, the Airman may remain on the assignment to serve the unaccompanied
  tour.

NOTES:
1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraphs 3.4. and 3.5.

2. Time creditable as OS duty for TDY begins the day of departure from the CONUS port
excluding all leave, hospitalization, and other non-mission periods (i.e. confinement, prisoner,
AWOL periods).

3. Adjustment or award of the ODSD or STRD does not change a member's date arrived
station.

4. The number of days served in TDY status to qualify for award of a new ODSD/STRD is not
the same as a member in PCS status whose OS tour is curtailed (see Table 3.3.).
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    201


  5. The only source document to be used to validate OS TDY is a copy of the paid travel
  voucher for each TDY claimed.

  6. Credit for 2 days or more TDY began on 5 Jan 95. For TDYs prior to this date you must
  have served a cumulative total or 90 or more days in a consecutive 3 year period to earn an
  adjustment to the ODSD/STRD.

  7. PDS update will use country code "ZT" with a tour length of number of days served.

  8. Members who are officially categorized via DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, receive
  credit for at least one short tour, regardless of the length of time served OS. Additional short
  tour credit is awarded in 12 month increments, and any portion thereof, at the time of release/
  return to US control.

  9. Use HQ AFPC/DPAPP correspondence as the source document. Countries comprising the
  AOR are: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Bahrain, Qatar,
  Yemen, Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, and the airspace and adjacent waters of these
  countries.

  10. For OS tour crediting purposes, for this TDY only, begin credit with the day of arrival in
  the AOR and end with the day of departure from the AOR.

 11. OS tour length will be updated to 12 months provided Airman meets minimum award
 criteria.
12. Those Airmen previously awarded short tour credit under the temporary 181-day policy will
keep their short tour credit. Airmen arriving in the AOR prior to 1 Jul 2011 and serving at least
181 days in a hostile fire or imminent danger pay area will receive short tour credit under the
previous criteria. Those arriving in the AOR on or after 1 Jul 2011 will not receive short tour
credit under the 181-day policy.

NOTES:
1. Includes members who return dependents to the CONUS for personal reasons.

2. If an airman is to serve or is serving an extended long OS tour, then the tour length becomes
the type tour indicated plus 12 months. When one member of an enlisted couple is selected as
an extended long tour volunteer, both must serve the accompanied tour plus 12 months.

 3. If members have or acquire dependents and desire government paid travel or dependents,
 shipment of HHG, etc., upon PCS, then the member claiming the dependents must request
 command sponsorship and serve the accompanied tour length.

 4. An exception to rule 6 is a single officer with no dependents who elects to serve the
 accompanied equivalent tour length as provided in paragraph 3.2.14.

1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 3.5. and Table 3.6.

2. Members serving the extended long tour serve the standard tour length (or revised tour

3. If the member reports to the gaining OS duty location before the RNLTD month, the
DEROS will be awarded by adding the OS tour length to the RNLTD month.

4. Aircrew members (accompanied or unaccompanied) serve a 36-month tour plus the length

 NOTES:
 1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 3.8.6. Commanders may not disapprove a
 voluntary extension request based solely on a member’s assignment OS for an arbitrary
 maximum period of time. However, commanders may disapprove extension requests based on
 a requirement for fresh expertise or for reasons such as job stress, personal or family hardship,
 lack of adequate medical or educational facilities, etc.

  2. Normal voluntary DEROS extension criteria do not apply to a member’s request for change
  of OS tour statusfrom unaccompanied to accompanied. Approval of command sponsorship
  and change of OS tour status requires the member to serve the accompanied tour length.
  Therefore, the DEROS change action is an adjustment of DEROS as shown in Table 3.9. (not
  a voluntary extension action), also see Attachment 20.

  3. Travel restriction date (TRD) is six weeks after estimated delivery date (EDD). Establish
  new DEROS as one day after TRD. If new DEROS is 60 days or less from old DEROS, the
  installation commander may approve extension. If new DEROS exceeds 60 days from old
  DEROS, forward request to the assignment OPR. In the case of military couples, the
  installation commander may approve up to a 60 calendar day extension of tour for both
  members as long as the new DEROS of both members is within the same month. The
  commander must notify the MPS immediately so they can make the necessary changes to
  DEROS and other adjusted suspenses.

 NOTES:
 1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 3.8.
 2. Systematic rotation is only for the purpose of spreading the rotation dates for Airmen
 possessing like skills over a greater period of time to ensure continuity of operation.
 3. Travel restriction date (TRD) is six weeks prior to Estimated Delivery Date (EDD).
 Establish the RNLTD to gaining unit as one day prior to TRD. Compute new DEROS by
 subtracting a maximum of 45 days (leave and travel time) from the new RNLTD. If new
 DEROS exceeds 60 days from old DEROS, forward a curtailment request. In the case of
 military couples, the installation commander may only approve curtailment of the pregnant
 Airman. Submit a request to curtail the male military member, depending on period of
 curtailment. Enlisted Airmen who have extension to OS tour approved under the OTEIP are
 not eligible for curtailment except for pregnant Airmen at dependent-restricted locations.
 These Airmen may extend their DEROS beyond the TRD or request early return of (civilian)
 spouse. The commander must immediately notify the MPS so they can make the necessary

  changes to DEROS and other suspenses.
  4. See paragraph 3.9.
  5. Request for CONUS assignment is sent by electrical message to the HQ AFPC OPR
  responsible for Airman’s AFSC (see Table 1.2.) with information copy to AFLSA/JAJM,
  Bolling AFB DC. Request must include date confinement will end and home of record.
  6. See paragraph 2.48. Curtailment as a result of surplus based on promotion permitted only
  when the promotion is to the grade of CMSgt or Colonel.
  7. The assignment OPR may approve cancellation (provided it is not an OTEIP extension) if
  the new DEROS will not place the enlisted Airman in the OS cycle (see Attachment 16
  paragraph A16.5. allocations column) and for officers, the new DEROS must not result in an
  ASD which is past (see Table 2.8., rule 3 for ASD schedule). This does not apply to an
  enlisted Airman serving an extended long tour unless cancellation requested is to an extension
  of the ELT. Requests involving OTEIP extensions must be submitted to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1
  as exceptions according to paragraph 1.5.

 NOTES:
 1. This table must be used in conjunction with paragraph 3.11.
 2. To determine if the TDY location tour length is less than the Airman’s PCS location tour
 length, compare the accompanied and unaccompanied tour lengths at both locations as shown
 in the JFTR, Appendix Q. If the tour lengths for the accompanied and unaccompanied tours at
 the two locations are the same, then proration is not authorized. For example, if the TDY
 location tour length is 36/24 and the Airman’s PCS location tour length is 36/24, then the
 Airman is not TDY to a location with a tour length less than his or her permanent duty station.
 Enlisted Airmen Only: Do not use the extended long OS tour length. EXCEPTION: Proration
 for TDY is not authorized for Airmen assigned to Alaska or Hawaii at locations where both the
 accompanied and unaccompanied tour lengths are 36 months when TDY is to a location where
 the accompanied tour length is 36 months and the unaccompanied tour length is 24 months.

Here are several more examples:
212                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009



a. If the permanent duty station tour length is 24/15 and the TDY location tour length is 24/ 12,
then proration is authorized. Use the unaccompanied tour length of 12 months at the TDY
location for proration computation. A member serving a 24 month accompanied tour is prorated
using the 12 month TDY location tour and a member serving the 15 month unaccompanied tour
at the same location is also prorated using the 12 month TDY location tour, but the length of the
proration will not be the same.

b. If the permanent duty station tour length is 30/18 and the TDY location tour length is 24/ 18,
the proration is authorized, but proration would not affect a member serving an unaccompanied
tour of 18 months at their permanent duty station.

c. If the permanent duty station tour length is 24/12 and the TDY location tour length is 24/ 15,
then proration is not authorized. The basic criterion that the TDY location tour length must be
less than the tour length at the permanent duty station is not met. Therefore, do not prorate the
tour of a member serving a 24 month accompanied tour based on the unaccompanied TDY
location tour length of 15 months.

3. When it is determined the TDY location tour length is less than the member’s PCS location
tour length, then for proration computation purposes, use the TDY location unaccompanied tour
length from the JFTR, Appendix Q. If the TDY location is not listed in the JFTR, Appendix Q.,
contact HQ AFPC/ DPAPP for the appropriate tour length.

4. Compute the prorated DEROS as follows: Provided the Airman meets the requirements of
column A, use columns B and C to determine the correct proration factor from column D.
Multiply the number of days TDY by the proration factor to determine the number of days
proration. The final step is to subtract the number of days proration from the Airman’s current
DEROS to determine the prorated DEROS. For example, SMSgt Stine is serving an
accompanied tour at a 36/24 location and has a current DEROS of 071122. He performs 79
days TDY at an OS location which has a tour length of 24/15. To find the amount of proration,
determine the proration factor from column D. For SMSgt Stine, it is 1.4. Multiply the number
of days TDY (79) by the proration factor (1.4) to determine the number of days proration (79 x
1.4 = 110.6 (round to the nearest whole number, .5 or higher, round up; .4 or lower, round
down). The final step in the computation is to subtract the number of days proration (111) from
the current DEROS to find the prorated DEROS. This can be easily done by converting the
current DEROS to the appropriate Julian date, and then subtracting the number of days
proration. SMSgt Stine's DEROS of 071122 is Julian date 326. Subtracting 111 from 326
equals 215. Julian date 215 is 3 August; therefore, SMSgt Stine's prorated DEROS is 070803.

 5. For one day or more service in a month, count the whole month.

 6. Use DAS for PCS, or effective date of tour length change as new tour start date.

 NOTE:
 Use this table for enlisted Airmen. Apply it to officers when other eligibility and qualification
 factors are equal or similar enough and you need to determine the order to match officers
 against requirements. Within each priority group, match Airmen currently serving a short tour
 who voluntarily extended their tour for a period of 6 or more months, or Airmen currently
 serving a long tour who voluntarily extended their tour for a period of 12 or more months
 beyond their original DEROS, ahead of other Airmen within the same priority group.
 Additionally, each month voluntarily extended beyond the minimum 6 or 12 month period
 raises the Airman’s priority within their priority group. In the event of a tie within a priority
 group, individuals will be matched in the following order:

 Grade (highest grade takes precedence;

Date of Rank (DOR)(earliest date takes precedence);

Total Active Federal Commissioned Service Date (TAFCSD)(Officers only)(earliest date

                        TEMPORARY DUTY (TDY) ASSIGNMENT

4.1. Purpose of TDY. IAW 37 USC 404, this instruction authorizes personnel to be temporarily
assigned to perform duty at a location other than their permanent duty station in support of
contingency operations, exercise, manning assistance as described, and for duty for the
administrative reasons shown. It prescribes policies, procedures, restrictions, and guidance for
selection and effective management of personnel for TDY for these reasons only. TDY manning
assistance may be used to satisfy one-time operational manning requirements of short duration or
to satisfy long-term operational manning requirements on a temporary basis while PCS
arrangements are completed. Administrative TDY is used only for official military reasons to
advise or participate in such activities as briefings, lectures, staff assistance, meetings,
conferences, or to attend a course of instruction of less than 20 weeks. Before directing TDY,
officials must be convinced TDY is essential and the results will pay back the AF for the cost of
the TDY. Further, the cost in terms of unit, member, and family turbulence associated with TDY
must be considered and the TDY deemed essential to satisfy the needs of the AF. TDY for other
reasons, such as, to appear as a witness, for medical evaluation, and so on, is not authorized
under the authority of this instruction. The authority for that type TDY, funding authorization,
criteria for selection of people (if applicable), and so on, should be addressed in the instruction
which authorizes TDY for those purposes. TDY which is not authorized by this instruction or
some other AF instruction may be submitted for consideration as an exception according to
paragraph 1.5. Exceptions must be requested and the TDY approved in advance. Approval of
TDY as an exception does not include funding. The availability of funding may not be the sole
basis for approval of TDY. TDY approved as an exception is on the basis that TDY serves the
best interests of the AF. TDY IAW this instruction, including as an exception, cannot be
authorized solely for personal reasons. Permissive Travel (see Attachment 1) is authorized and
approved according to the criteria in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave. For contingency and exercise
TDY operational procedures, refer to AFI 10-401, Air Force Operational Planning and
Execution, AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution and AFI 36-3802, Personnel
Support for Contingency Operations (formerly AFI 10-215) or contact AFPC/DPW at
dpw.task.mgt@randolph.af.mil.
4.2. Delegation of Temporary Duty (TDY) Assignment Authority. TDY assignment
authority is decentralized for administrative TDY and is hereby delegated to MAJCOMs, or
equivalent. As used here, the term equivalent includes the headquarters of Field Operating
Agencies (FOA), Direct Reporting Units (DRU), and the headquarters level of those other
functions which have been assigned a MAJCOM Identity Code as shown in the USAF Personnel
Accounting System (PAS) Directory. A MAJCOM (or equivalent) may further delegate TDY
authority down to and including squadron level. A MAJCOM (or equivalent) may limit TDY
authority it delegates. For example, a MAJCOM may limit locally originated TDY to within the
CONUS only, except TDY in support of an operation plan (OPLAN).
4.3. TDY Allowances. When an Airman is to be assigned for TDY at a location other than
his/her permanent duty station (regardless of the distance involved), the assistance of the
servicing Financial Services Officer (FSO) should be requested to determine if TDY allowances
accrue to an Airman according to the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), and what the cost
 216                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


will be. When Airmen accrue TDY allowances, that TDY is subject to the restrictions prescribed
by the JFTR and this instruction. When an Airman is directed to take an action for which an
allowance is authorized by the JFTR, that action obligates the AF to pay or reimburse him or her
if the Airman makes a claim. When Airmen accrue TDY allowances in conjunction with TDY,
the JFTR requires TDY orders be issued to record the TDY. TDY orders are issued according to
AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders and AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders. Permissive
Travel (see Attachment 1) is authorized and approved according to the criteria in AFI 36-3003,
Military Leave.
4.4. When to Request PCS or Authorize TDY. When a MAJCOM (or equivalent) has an
operational mission which will exist at a specific location for more than 180 consecutive days,
then consideration should be given to establishing a permanent AF unit at that location,
allocation of manpower authorizations and accomplishment of the mission by assignment of
personnel in PCS status. It is recognized it is not always possible to determine the exact length of
time needed to accomplish a mission and sometimes long-term TDY is necessary because PCS
assignment to a location is not feasible. However, for personnel assignment planning purposes,
the 179 day guideline will normally be used in determining which missions can be met via TDY
and which should be satisfied on a PCS basis. NOTE: As a reminder, normally before an
assignment OPR can assign an AF member OS in PCS status, a Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA) must exist (excluding PCS to Alaska, Hawaii, or a territory or possession of the U.S.),
the OS PCS tour length must be requested and approved per Chapter 3, an AF unit must be
established with manpower positions authorized, and other personnel support actions essential to
permanent assignment of US military personnel must be completed. When the prerequisites for
PCS of personnel have been completed, then a MAJCOM (or equivalent) may request the
assignment OPR assign personnel on a PCS basis (see paragraphs 1.2, 2.8, and 3.8).
4.5. AEF Deployment and Assignment Procedures. The Air Force assignment process will
be managed to coincide with the AEF rhythm (timeline associated with assigned AEF cycles) to
the maximum extent possible. In general, the deployment of AF personnel in support of a
Combatant Commander’s requirement will take precedence over an AF assignment.
Commanders will make every effort to schedule voluntary PCS/PCA departure dates, terminal
leave dates for retirement, and separation dates, to occur during the 3-month period immediately
following the unit’s deployment eligibility period. Table 4.3 contains a matrix that will help
simplify the commander’s decision-making process when a member is selected for assignment at
the same time they are either tasked to deploy or already deployed.
   4.5.1. While Table 4.3 will provide commanders the tools to make decisions regarding their
   personnel, close attention must be paid to proper deployment processing and Duty Status
   updates. Commanders must ensure that members are processing through the MPF prior to
   deployment. The MPS is responsible for updating deployment duty status codes 20, 21 and
   25 (see AFI 36-2134, Air Force Duty Status Program). Usually, if the process works
   properly, the assignment system will not select a member for a non-volunteer overseas
   assignment while they are deployed. The duty status of individuals who deploy (e.g. they
   have been issued contingency orders by the MPS) will be changed in MilPDS.
   4.5.2. To deconflict assignments and deployments, commanders are asked to send requests
   via VML reclama process for officers or if out-of-cycle via e-mail to
   afpc.dpapp@randolph.af.mil and for enlisted assignments via e-mail to
   afpc.dpaa5@randolph.af.mil. Requests will include Name, SSN, AFSC (Core ID, RDTM,
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   217


   Comp Cat, Specialty Shred), Assigned PAS, Projected Assignment, RNLTD, type of request
   (cancellation, extension of RNLTD, extension of DEROS, etc.) with proposed dates,
   justification and AEF library code.
   4.5.3. Commanders are encouraged to address officer PCS and deployment conflicts during
   the Vulnerable Movers List (VML) reclama process. To deconflict PCS and TDY
   deployment actions for officers not within an assignment cycle, an e-mail should be
   submitted directly to the appropriate assignment team.
   4.5.4. Commanders who need to deconflict a PCS and TDY deployment action for enlisted
   personnel  should    submit    a    request   via   email    to     AFPC/DPAA5         at
   afpc.dpaa5@randolph.af.mil. All requests must include full name, SSN, AFSC (CAFSC,
   Assigned PAS Code, Projected Assignment, RNLTD, type of request (cancellation, extension
   of RNLTD, extension of DEROS, etc.) with proposed dates, justification and AEF library
   code.
4.6. Determining TDY or PCS to Attend a Course of Instruction. The following applies
when an Airman is to attend a course of instruction. The JFTR, Volume 1, U2146 establishes
that when an Airman is to attend a course (or courses) of instruction of less than 20 calendar
weeks, then attendance will be in TDY status (use the duration of the course(s) as shown in Air
Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) (https://etca.randolph.af.mil) at
any one location, or total duration of courses when attending two or more courses at the same
location). (EXCEPTION: Assign enlisted Airmen graduating from basic training to school in
PCS status if assigning them directly to a technical school regardless of the course length.) The
length of TDY must not exceed the number of calendar days from the course reporting date to
the final graduation date as shown in the quota allocation, plus all allowable travel time.
Conversely, when an Airman will attend a course (or courses) at one location and the official
length of the course(s) is 20 weeks or more, then the Airman will attend in PCS status. When an
Airman’s attendance status is TDY, but he or she remains at a location for 20 weeks or more (for
example, if an Airman is required to repeat a block of training), the original attendance status of
TDY based on the course length is not changed from TDY to PCS. Similarly, when an Airman’s
attendance status is PCS based on the course length and he or she completes the course (or is
eliminated) in less than 20 weeks, the original attendance status of PCS is not changed to TDY.
Upon determining attendance will be in a TDY status, then see paragraph 2.26.5, Table 4.1,
and paragraph 4.6 below.
4.7. TDY Restrictions. A number of the TDY assignment policies and procedures outlined in
this instruction have been established to specifically comply with, or to comply with the intent
of, Comptroller General Decisions or the JFTR. Erroneous payments to Airmen (regardless of
how the error occurred) are normally recouped as soon as the error is discovered. Further, it is
not always possible to correct errors administratively when they involve allowances.
Accordingly, commanders at all levels and officials responsible for directing and/or approving
TDY must be familiar with and comply with the restrictions established below. Individual
Airmen also have a personal responsibility to confirm their allowances through official sources
such as their supporting FSO.
       4.7.1. Restriction on Consecutive Number of Days TDY to Any One Location.
       Comptroller General Decision, 36 Comptroller General 757 (1957), restricts Airmen from
       being reimbursed for more than 180 consecutive days TDY to any one location (travel
218                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      time excluded), without approval through the Secretarial Process. Also see paragraph
      4.7.2 for restriction on cumulative number of days TDY to the location. See paragraph
      4.7.3 for waiver requests.
      4.7.2. Restriction on Cumulative Number of Days TDY to Any One Location. In
      addition to the consecutive days restriction in paragraph 4.7.1, SAF policy is an Airman
      will not be directed on TDY which will result in more than 180 days accumulation of
      TDY at any one location in a consecutive 12-month period (regardless of the duty to be
      performed), without SAF approval or approval of the commander of a specified or
      unified command. This approval authority may not be further delegated. The
      consecutive 12-month period starts with the Airman's first TDY to a given site and is not
      based on calendar or fiscal year periods. Use 365 consecutive days to determine the "12-
      month" period. This policy is necessary to comply with the spirit and intent of
      Comptroller General Decision B165911, 4 Apr 69, which states a commander may not
      publish separate TDY orders returning an Airman to a TDY point after a "token return" to
      the permanent duty base. An example of token return would be the TDY of an Airman to
      a location for 180 consecutive days, return of the Airman to his or her permanent duty
      station for a day or so, and then again directing the Airman TDY back to the same
      location for another 180 consecutive days. The restriction in paragraph 4.7.1 together
      with the prohibition on token return, facilitates SAF review of continued TDY support of
      a program, project, or mission in lieu of establishing PCS authorizations. See paragraph
      4.7.3 for requests for waivers.
      4.7.3. Requests for SAF Waivers. Requests for waivers (or exceptions) to the restrictions
      in paragraphs 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 are submitted as shown below. For waivers of paragraph
      4.7.1 (more than 180 consecutive days), the unit commander will initiate a waiver request
      and send it to HQ AFPC/DPAPP, for Lt Cols and below and SMSgts and below, to
      AF/DPO for colonels (including selectees), or to AF/DPE for CMSgts (including
      selectees) for processing to the SAF. Requests must be submitted at least 45 days before
      the projected TDY start date or expiration of current TDY. Waivers are considered when
      uncontrollable circumstances develop and a requirement exists for an Airman to be TDY
      longer than 180 consecutive days. For waivers of paragraph 4.7.2 (more than 180 days
      cumulative TDY to the same location in a 12-month period), either the Airman's home
      station unit commander or the TDY location commander may initiate a request. When
      the Airman's home station unit commander initiates the request, it is sent to HQ
      AFPC/DPAPP (or AF/DPO or AF/DPE as appropriate) for processing to the SAF. When
      the request is initiated by the TDY location commander, it is forwarded according to
      instructions issued by the unified or specified command the TDY supports, and may be
      approved by the commander of the unified or specified command. If the request is not
      submitted through unified or specified command channels, then the request may be sent
      to the Airman's home station commander for concurrence and submission to HQ
      AFPC/DPAPP (or AF/DPO or AF/DPE as appropriate) for processing to the SAF.
      4.7.3.1. Date TDY began and date current TDY period ends (including any prior
      waivers).
      4.7.3.2. Justification for the TDY or additional TDY term.
      4.7.3.3. Number of additional days required and new TDY completion date.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              219


     4.7.3.4. Volunteer status of Airman and commander's recommendation.
     4.7.3.5. A statement regarding any hardship the Airman may incur.
  4.7.4. Restrictions on TDY In Conjunction With PCS. Comptroller General Decisions and
  the JFTR place some special restrictions on TDY of Airmen who have also been selected for
  PCS. Accordingly, the AF has established a number of personnel management policies as
  outlined below to avoid TDY which could conflict with restrictions imposed. Requests for
  TDY en route PCS must be approved by the assignment OPR and the authority for funding of
  the TDY verified.
     4.7.4.1. TDY En Route at Current or New Duty Station. TDY at an Airman's current
     duty station (after signing out PCS), TDY at an Airman’s new duty station (before
     signing in PCS), or TDY to a location in proximity to either the old or new duty station,
     will not be authorized as TDY en route PCS. There are no TDY allowances when a
     TDY location is the same as an Airman’s (old or new) permanent duty station and only
     minimal TDY allowances authorized for duty at a location in proximity of an Airman’s
     duty station (old or new). Therefore, the remarks section of the PCS orders may make
     mention of a TDY required in connection with an Airman’s PCS which is to be
     performed at, or in the vicinity of, the old or new duty station, but the TDY will not be
     directed as TDY en route PCS. TDY of this nature is performed before an Airman
     departs the current permanent duty station on PCS, or after arrival PCS at the Airman's
     new permanent duty station.
     4.7.4.2. PCS to the Same Location as TDY, or TDY to the Same Location as PCS.
     Whenever possible, the AF should avoid multiple allowances for TDY when an Airman
     has also been selected for PCS to the same location. An Airman can be "selected for PCS
     to the same location" in two ways as explained below.
         4.7.4.2.1. PCS to the Same Location as TDY. When an Airman is performing TDY
         and is selected for PCS to the same location (regardless of the PCS reporting date),
         then, upon selection for PCS the TDY station becomes the Airman's PCS station if
         there is no military duty requirement for the Airman to return to the old station and
         member does not want to return to move dependents/HHG. If there is a military
         requirement or Airman wishes to return to the old PDS to move dependents/HHG,
         then the Airman continues to be entitled to TDY allowances until completion of the
         TDY. PCS effective date is the DAS at the former TDY (new PDS) location.
         (NOTE: Returning to home station solely for the purpose of PCS out-processing is
         not considered a military duty requirement.) However, when it is determined there is
         a military duty requirement for an Airman to return to the station from which TDY,
         then the Airman continues to be entitled to TDY allowances (see JFTR, Volume 1,
         U7125).
         4.7.4.2.2. Selected for PCS, Then Selected for TDY to the Same Location. When an
         Airman previously selected for PCS (regardless of the reporting date) is directed to
         the same location in a TDY status, then upon arrival TDY allowances terminate and
         the Airman's status becomes PCS if the duties while TDY are the same as they would
         have been upon PCS completion. To preclude this from happening inadvertently, as a
         general policy, an Airman selected for PCS may not be issued TDY orders to the new
         permanent duty station when duties while TDY will be the same as those when PCS
220                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


         is completed. Alternatives include accelerating the Airman's PCS RNLTD or
         selecting someone else for the TDY. Exceptions may be requested per paragraph
         1.5.
      4.7.4.3. TDY Not in Direct Support of a PCS. Normally, only TDY which directly
      supports a PCS will be authorized en route, regardless of the availability of funding.
      Authorizing TDY en route PCS for other reasons such as operational manning assistance,
      to participate in an exercise, and so on, can create unforeseen problems and hardships on
      Airmen with regard to pay and allowances, housing, arrangements for dependents, HHG
      shipment and storage, SOFAs, and so on. Exceptions can be considered according to
      paragraph 1.5.
      4.7.4.4. TDY Cost Chargeable to MILPER PCS Account. According to AFI 65-601,
      Financial Management - Budget Guidance and Procedures, Volume 1, Chapter 12,
      (12.5.15) TDY to be charged to the MILPERS PCS Account must be performed en route
      PCS (not TDY and return), must not exceed 15 days (including travel time) and can be
      authorized only for the reasons shown below. (These reasons apply only to active duty
      Airmen, not family members or civilian DOD employees.) Requests for TDY for other
      reasons (such as briefings, debriefing, orientation, and so on) will be funded by the
      requiring command's O&M funds. Requests for waivers or exceptions may be submitted
      by the MAJCOM (or equivalent) direct to SAF/FMBMM, and include as information
      addressees the assignment OPR and HQ AFPC/DPAPP/DPAPA. Authorization for
      funding of TDY en route PCS when the TDY is required by a DOD activity and is in
      direct support of PCS to (or from) the AF Element (AFELM) of a DOD activity, should
      be requested from 11WG/FMAP, Rosslyn VA. For TDY which meets the criteria in this
      paragraph for approval, HQ AFPC/DPAPP must review on a case-by-case basis any
      request for TDY en route PCS when the TDY is to be charged to the MILPERS PCS
      Account.
         4.7.4.4.1. M-16 rifle training.
         4.7.4.4.2. Medical examination.
         4.7.4.4.3. Obtaining passports.
         4.7.4.4.4. In-processing or out-processing at the host base only when required by
         host/tenant agreement or SOFA. There are no PCS-related AF military personnel
         actions which require an Airman to perform TDY en route.
  4.7.5. Restrictions on Selection of Personnel for TDY and for PCS While TDY. This
  instruction prescribes a framework of restrictions and policies applicable to selection of
  personnel for TDY. When more than one person assigned is qualified and eligible, this
  instruction does not specify an order in which to select personnel for a specific kind or length
  of TDY. Commanders need a reasonable degree of flexibility to balance satisfying the needs
  of the AF with the impact TDY has on assigned personnel and their families. Commanders
  may establish additional criteria to ensure TDY selection of personnel they command is as
  fair and equitable as possible, all factors considered.
      4.7.5.1. Qualifications to Perform TDY. The primary consideration in selecting
      personnel for TDY is an Airman’s qualifications to perform the TDY mission. For TDY
      to attend a course of instruction, selection is IAW guidance furnished for the specific
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 221


     training and to the degree practical, the guidance in this instruction. However, as in
     selection for PCS, there are a number of very important factors to be considered when
     selecting personnel for TDY. To the degree possible, involuntary TDY should be
     distributed equitably among Airmen similarly qualified.
     4.7.5.2. Airmen Who Recently Completed a PCS or Pending PCS, Separation or
     Retirement. Table 4.2 establishes a minimum TOS for selection for TDY (other than for
     training), after PCS and before PCS and before separation (including retirement).
     Normally, Airmen who have recently completed a PCS and those pending PCS or
     separation/retirement should not be sent TDY or permitted to remain on TDY, when the
     departure date or completion date is less than the minimums shown in Table 4.2. It is
     recognized that the minimums in Table 4.2 may not be adequate in all circumstances for
     all Airmen. However, generally the minimums established provide enough time for most
     Airmen and most base agencies to take care of essential processing or other requirements.
     In some instances, essential processing or other actions may need to be completed via a
     power of attorney, by mail or message, or rescheduled on a priority basis due to Airman’s
     absence on TDY. Authority to waive the established TOS minimums is delegated to the
     unit commander provided waiver will not interfere with the Airman meeting the RNLTD
     for a projected PCS, or separation/retirement on the scheduled date. Airmen should be
     given the opportunity to state if a hardship would be created as a result of a waiver and
     commanders should confirm that all required PCS, separation or retirement actions can
     be accomplished. For example, an Airman who has no dependents and resides on-base in
     bachelor quarters may not require 30 days on station immediately preceding separation;
     or, an Airman scheduled to take 30 days leave in conjunction with PCS may agree to
     reduce the number of days leave in order to remain on TDY for an additional period of
     time negating the requirement for TDY replacement; or, if necessary, a commander may
     disapprove delay en route in conjunction with an Airman’s PCS in order to complete the
     TDY and still comply with the RNLTD for a projected PCS.
     4.7.5.3. Retainability.    Normally, Airmen who either possess sufficient service
     retainability or who are eligible to obtain retainability to complete the full period of TDY
     are selected. (NOTE: Officers with an indefinite DOS are viewed as having indefinite
     service retainability. Expiration of an officer's ADSC is not an established DOS or
     established retirement date.) Selection of Airmen who have or can obtain retainability for
     the full period of TDY precludes having to replace Airmen and reduces mission and
     family turbulence. However, when necessary, commanders may direct Airmen to
     perform TDY within the amount of retainability they have. This includes officers who
     established a DOS under 7-day option provisions when notified of TDY selection,
     officers and enlisted Airmen who established a retirement date under 7-day option
     provisions, and enlisted Airmen who declined to obtain retainability for the full TDY
     period.
     4.7.5.4. TDY of Airmen Deferred For Humanitarian/EFMP Reasons. See Attachment
     24 for guidance on selection of personnel for TDY who have approved humanitarian
     (AAC 30) or EFMP deferments (AAC 34 or ALC Q).
     4.7.5.5. Involuntary OS PCS Selection While TDY. While performing TDY under the
     circumstances described herein, either TDY in the CONUS or OS, Airmen should not
     normally be selected for involuntary OS PCS. In addition, following these kinds of TDY,
 222                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       Airmen should not normally be selected for involuntary OS PCS selection with an
       RNLTD less than 120 days after TDY completion date. These provisions apply to
       Airmen TDY OS and reflected in the PDS in DSC 20, 21 and 25, and Airmen TDY in the
       CONUS participating in a contingency, rotational or exercise TDY and reflected in the
       PDS in DSC 20. They do not apply to individuals selected for a voluntary assignment
       (CONUS or OS), involuntary CONUS PCS, or TDY for reasons (DSC) other than those
       listed. MPS’ will reclama PCS selection and/or a reporting date contrary to these
       provisions (see paragraph 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 above for what to include in the reclama).
       When necessary in the best interests of the AF, HQ AFPC/DPA may waive these
       provisions.
       4.7.5.6. PCS Selection While TDY and Airman Requests Hardship Consideration. Any
       PCS selection (voluntary or involuntary) while TDY can at times impose a hardship on
       Airmen. Airmen who are TDY who have a hardship as a result of PCS selection may
       request a change of RNLTD or assignment cancellation through their unit commander to
       the Contact Center. The Contact Center will forward the request to the assignment OPR..
       The request must include the specific details of the hardship, date notified of PCS
       selection, the reason for TDY and Duty Status Code (DSC), operation/exercise name (if
       applicable), location (if unclassified), inclusive dates of TDY, date of selection for TDY
       and date notified, volunteer status for TDY, and whether or not the DSC was updated in
       the PDS at the time of PCS selection. The assignment OPR will evaluate the request and
       take action as appropriate. Approval of Airman’s request is not automatic. The
       assignment OPR may approve, disapprove or take action other than that requested by the
       Airman depending on the circumstances.
   4.7.5.7 Time on Station Minimums for TDY Deployment Selection. Commanders, First
   Sergeants and supervisors should consider Time-On-Station (TOS) minimums when
   selecting Airmen for TDY deployments. If the expected deployment completion date is 30
   or more calendar days before the date of separation (DOS) or PCS the Airman is considered
   available. Commanders may waive this restriction provided the duration of the deployment
   will not interfere with departure dates for separation, retirement, or PCS processing. DOS
   must not expire during the deployment.
           4.7.5.7.1. Airmen currently assigned in the CONUS or overseas who were previously
           assigned from a 365-day TDY, an unaccompanied short tour or unaccompanied
           CONUS-isolated station are ineligible to deploy for six-months following their tour.
           Commanders requesting to waive the six-month deferment period due to operational
           requirements, regardless of an Airman’s volunteer status must obtain approval from
           their MAJCOM/CV (see AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air and Space
           Expeditionary Force Presence Policy).
4.8. Intracommand and Intercommand Manning Assistance TDY (Formerly Palace
Trip). The intent of manning assistance is to assist with AF units (with additional TDY
resources) in the performance of its home base mission. For EXAMPLE: backfilling a critical
one-deep position due to incumbent being hospitalized , a unit instituting an AF special project
(temporary work- load surge), or a temporary work-load surge due to a natural disaster.
Intracommand manning assistance is TDY between units of the same command (support
provided from the same MAJCOM’s resources). Intercommand Manning Assistance TDY is
manning assistance of TDY of personnel from units of one command to support another
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                223


command either CONUS or OS. HQ AFPC/DPAPP is responsible for overall management of the
program. Manning assistance TDY will not be used to assist units when absences are due to
administrative TDY, contingency deployment, or exercises.
4.9. How to Request Manning Assistance TDY Support. Manning assistance requests are
initiated at the squadron commander level and then routed through the appropriate group
commander for validation and recommendation. Requests must be submitted to HQ
AFPC/DPAPP at least 60 days prior to the desired reporting date. Short notice requests require
substantial justification. Manning assistance should not be requested to backfill AEF
deployments as a means to alleviate organizational manning shortfalls as the PERSTEMPO has
increased for all units due to AEF deployments. If an organization foresees local mission impact
due to AEF tasking, the AEF reclama process should be exercised before requesting manning
assistance. The format for the TDY manning assistance request is Figure 4.1. Requesting
manning assistance will be as follows:
   4.9.1. Squadron commander identifies manning shortfalls within the unit and submits
   manning request IAW Figure 4.1. The request is forwarded to the group commander for
   validation. The group commander reviews request and considers installation resources
   before forwarding manning assistance request. Recommend consultation with the Mission
   Support Commander and/or the MPS commander. If validated, forwards the request to HQ
   AFPC/DPAPP (EXCEPTION: requests from AETC units will be forwarded to HQ
   AETC/A1KO). If the request is not validated, the group commander has disapproval
   authority and the request will be returned with no further action.
   4.9.2. AFPC/DPAPP will review request upon receipt to ensure all pertinent information is
   included. The complete request will be forwarded to the AFPC assignment functional
   manager for validation.
   4.9.3. The AFPC assignment functional manager is highly encouraged to consult with the
   MAJCOM functional managers to determine which base-level organizations can support the
   request (consideration for AEF taskings and MAJCOM unique mission requirements). The
   AFPC functional manager will then verify authorized manning requirements at the requesting
   and supporting unit(s) for the AFSC requested. If request is valid and will be supported, the
   AFPC functional manager will identify to AFPC/DPAPP the base(s) tasked to provide
   support.
   4.9.4. If the base cannot support the tasking, the group and/or squadron commanders will
   submit a reclama (see paragraph 4.11) to the AFPC/DPAPP. DPAPP will consult with the
   AFPC functional manager for validation. If the base is relieved of the tasking, another
   organization will be tasked (not necessarily within in the same MAJCOM).
   4.9.5. AFPC/DPAPP will send a tasking message to the Airman’s squadron commander with
   a courtesy copy the group commander and the Airman.
 224                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009

     List all attachments:



                                                           Group Commander Endorsement
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    225


4.10. How to Request Release from Tasking. MAJCOMs (or equivalent) may establish
guidelines for subordinate units which supplement those herein. (NOTE: Units must use the
Reclama Processing Tool IAW AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, to
request release from AEF deployments.
   4.10.1. Requests for release from tasking must be submitted by e-mail message to
   AFPC/DPAPP within 3 duty days from receipt of the tasking.
   4.10.2. Include mission impact statement and reason assigned personnel are not available.
   Include current/projected manning by AFSC as of the Date Required In-Place (DRI), percent
   not available by category, such as, currently deployed, medically disqualified, pending PCS
   departure, projected approved retirement/separation, and so on.
4.11. Commanders ensure TDY orders are issued as shown in AFI 33-328, Administrative
Orders and AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders and AFI 36-3802, Personnel Support for
Contingency Operations (formerly AFI 10-215). Per paragraph 4.3, orders are required per the
JFTR when Airmen accrue TDY allowances. For personnel accounting purposes, Airmen must
provide a copy of the TDY orders to their MPS. Unless firm departure and reporting dates to the
TDY location are directed, commanders determine these dates. Airmen must not arrive prior to
the date they are needed consistent with availability of transportation. For TDY to training
courses, Airmen are normally directed not to arrive more than 1 day prior to the class start date.
When the course ends, the Airman departs as directed in orders or as determined by the school
commander.
4.12. TDY to HQ USAF.           Airmen may be placed on TDY to HQ USAF agencies after
approval is granted by the interested staff office. Approval by the appropriate staff office will
provide the name and location of the office to which the Airman is to report. The address
symbol and location is shown in TDY orders.
4.13. Country Clearance for OS TDY. Official TDY visits to locations in foreign countries
outside the CONUS must be cleared in advance with United States authorities who have
jurisdiction in the area. Usually this clearance is requested 30 calendar days in advance of the
proposed departure date. DOD 4500.54-G, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide,
shows the clearance requirements and controls on travel outside the CONUS. AEF online
provides additional information (reporting instructions) required for contingency TDYs.
Personnel who will perform TDY must read the applicable portions of the guide or be briefed on
its content by personnel processing members for TDY.
4.14. Variation in Itinerary. An authorization for variation in itinerary permits the omission
of travel to any place stated in the travel order and grants changes in the order of places shown as
necessary to accomplish the mission. Usually the purpose of a trip and places of TDY are known
at the time a travel order is published. The authorization for variation in itinerary does not take
the place of good planning. This authority is not to be read as granting blanket travel
authorization.
4.15. Funding of TDY.        The guidelines for funding of manning assistance TDY (not in
conjunction with PCS) are contained in AFI 65-601V1, Financial Management. For funding of
TDY for training, see the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) or

 226                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


paragraph 4.6.4.4. For PALACE TRIP TDY, funding will be furnished by the requesting
MAJCOM. AEF online provides funding guidance applicable to contingency TDYs.
4.16. TDY “Hold” for Airmen En Route PCS. Airmen en route between permanent duty
stations may be placed on official TDY (often referred to as TDY ―hold‖) when they are directed
for official reasons by the assignment OPR to discontinue travel pending further orders.
Commanders or other officials who desire to place Airmen en route PCS in official TDY status
must obtain advance approval from HQ AFPC/DPAPP. This does not mean that HQ
AFPC/DPAPP has approval authority in all cases, but rather this office will determine if TDY or
some other action is appropriate and then request approval from the appropriate authority
depending on the circumstances. Normally, this kind of TDY is intended for use when, based on
change in manning requirements, change in required qualifications or similar assignment related
reasons, Airmen should neither return to their former permanent duty station nor proceed to the
new permanent duty station. In such cases a decision on the Airman’s assignment can usually be
made by the assignment OPR within several days. When the reason to place an Airman on
official TDY en route PCS is other than assignment related (for example, based on a natural
disaster, political unrest, or other reasons), TDY must be requested and approved as an exception
and a funding determination obtained (see paragraph 4.6.4.4).
   4.16.1. When appropriate authority requests an Airman who is en route PCS not be allowed
   to continue travel as planned to the new permanent duty station nor should the Airman return
   to the former permanent duty station, or in other circumstances as an exception, the official
   or his or her designated representative must submit a request by the most expeditious means
   to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for consideration. The request must include the following:
       4.16.1.1. Airman’s name, grade, SSN and projected DAFSC.
       4.16.1.2. Previous unit of assignment and location.
       4.16.1.3. Projected unit of assignment, location, port call (if applicable), and RNLTD.
       4.16.1.4. Reason the requesting official requests the Airman should not return to
       previous duty station and reason Airman should not be allowed to proceed to new duty
       station. Include all pertinent details.
       4.16.1.5. Current location of Airman to include address, contact phone number.
       4.16.1.6. Location of dependents, status of HHG/POV, etc.
       4.16.1.7. Remarks. (Include any additional information having a bearing on the case
       (such as, if action is pending, state the kind of action and the approximate date a decision
       will be made).
       4.16.1.8. Grade, name, duty title, organization, DSN, data fax phone number and e-mail
       address of official initiating the request. When a request is submitted by a POC on behalf
       of the initiating official, include the above information for both persons.
   4.16.2. Upon receipt of a request, HQ AFPC/DPAPP will take action as appropriate. Before
   an approval or disapproval decision can be made, sometimes additional coordination may be
   necessary, a request for approval of funding may be required, or forwarding of the request for
   consideration by a higher authority may be necessary. When a request is approved, the
   approval message will contain the specific instructions for amendment of PCS orders,
   funding instructions and designate what AF installation is responsible for the Airman while

     TDY. Whenever practical, Airmen placed on TDY will be attached for administration
     purposes to the nearest AF installation.

NOTES:
1. If upon being advised of the requirement for training in conjunction with a PCS, a member
alleges attendance will create a personal hardship, the MPS will immediately advise the
gaining MAJCOM of the specifics of the hardship with an information copy to the assignment
OPR. The gaining MAJCOM will evaluate the circumstances and direct action with
information copy to the assignment OPR, or request action by the assignment OPR, as
appropriate.

 2. For courses of 20 weeks or more, members will attend in PCS status. EXCEPTION:
Airmen graduating from basic training who are assigned directly to technical school are
assigned in PCS status, regardless of the course length.
3. Additional restrictions to travel mode are:
a. Do not direct travel TDY and return to the new base after PCS if assigning member OS.
b. Do not direct travel TDY and return to the current OS base before PCS for those returning
from OS to a CONUS assignment.

c. Do not direct TDY en route PCS when member has a COT within the same theater and
training in the CONUS.

d. Direct TDY en route PCS when a member has a COT to a different OS theater and training
in the CONUS.

e. Do not direct TDY en route PCS for members whose TDY location is within commuting
distance of either their losing or gaining base.

4. When more than one TDY option exists the assignment OPR or MPS computes the options
and directs the least costly option. There are times when the directed travel mode may cause a
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  229


 member a personal, financial or dependent hardship. If the member requests deviation from
 the least expensive mode based on hardship, he or she will submit a request substantiating the
 details of hardship to the MPS Commander for final approval/disapproval. Do not approve
 deviations solely for personal convenience.

5. For members performing TDY en route, the PCS also begins upon departure from their
current station, therefore, members must meet all PCS eligibility requirements, (for example,
TOS, second PCS in same FY, etc.) as of their departure date unless the appropriate authority
approves the required waiver (see paragraph 2.26.). Determine if minimum TOS is met per
paragraph 2.25. and the Fiscal Year for DLA (see paragraph 2.51.) based on the date the
member departs on PCS.

6. When assigning members OS who attend a course or courses in TDY en route status do not
include in special orders that the member must depart the training location the day after
graduation from the last course. The number of days leave a member desires (if any) between
course graduation and their port reporting date is managed by controlling the departure date
from the last training location. Travel arrangements and the members arrival at the port must be
in compliance with their port reporting instructions. Members who arrive at the port earlier
than their directed reporting instructions will be charged with leave and could incur additional
expenses while waiting for their scheduled transportation.

7. Include in the special orders a "report not earlier than date (RNETD)" for each scheduled
course. The RNETDs will be one day prior to the announced class start dates. Also, special
orders should contain remarks directing the member to depart not later than one day after the
respective course’s graduation date. The number of days leave a member desires (if any)
between a course graduation and the start of a second or subsequent course will be the
difference between the authorized travel time and subsequent course RNETD. For example, is
a member is travelling via commercial air then the authorized travel time is one day. Therefore,
if the first course graduates on the 1st of February and the subsequent course starts on the 15th
of February, the member will be charged 11 days leave. The 2nd of February is the mandatory
travel day, leave begins on the 3rd of February and continues through the 13th of February, and
leave stops when the member arrives on the next RNETD (14 February—one day prior to the
subsequent course start date).

8. Officers selected to attend missile training with subsequent assignment to a missile unit will
proceed directly from AETC training to operation readiness training, then to unit of assignment
using authorized travel time only. The member must take leave en route, if desired, before
entry into AETC training.

9. If satisfactory completion of training is a prerequisite for the next assignment, then member
is not permitted to make the PCS to the new duty station first and then attend training via TDY
and return to the new base.

 NOTES:
 1. Use the more restrictive rule if member meets two conditions.

 2. When the TDY return date is after the person's DOS or PDD (for PCS) and when necessary
 to fill short notice taskings, commanders can still select the person for the TDY providing the
 TDY orders or amendments reflect the shortened TDY duration and the person returns
 according to the times in this table.

 3. You may assign members to deployable positions upon arrival on station and they may
 remain against a deployable position until their departure.

 4. Commanders may waive DOS/PCS (Cols D and E) selection minimums. However, review
 all other options before committing assigned members on TDY who are separating/retiring or
 making a PCS. When waiving minimums, the TDY completion date must not interfere with
 processing or departure date for PCS or DOS. Severe problems can occur if a person's DOS
 expires while TDY.

 5. Commanders needing to waive the six-month TOS exemption for operational requirements
 must obtain approval from their MAJCOM/CV.

 6. Commanders needing to waive the twelve-month TOS exemption for operational
 requirements must obtain approval from their MAJCOM/CV.

NOTES:

1. Each request will be forwarded to DPAPP for officers or DPAA5 for enlisted as an exception
to policy and requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Commander must justify
why the Airman cannot be replaced on deployment. In case of short notice assignment, later
RNLTD may be appropriate.

2. AFPC will consider later RNLTDs on a case-by-case basis. In addition, for hardship
reasons, cancellation of involuntary assignment may be appropriate. In the event a request is
approved, the Airman will be returned from TDY to out-process for PCS.

3. Projecting the proper duty status codes (DSC 20, 21 or 25) and reporting departure in
MilPDS will prevent the assignment system from selecting Airmen for non-volunteer overseas
assignments.

4. The commander must request a later RNLTD as the only option if the Airman was a
volunteer for assignment. Returning the Airman from deployment is not an option unless the
commander, MAJCOM/PRU and AFPC agree this is in the best interest of the Air Force.

* The mission at the gaining location will ultimately dictate approval/disapproval of
cancellation of assignment. AFPC will determine whether a later RNLTD is possible or if
another Airman is selected for assignment instead.

                                           Chapter 5

                  INDETERMINATE TDY-EXTENDED DEPLOYMENT

5.1. General Information. Certain key positions in the AOR are required to be filled by
Airmen serving on 1-year extended deployment per AF Chief of Staff guidance. Almost every
major career field has positions (requirements) identified as an extended deployment. In addition
there are many ―Any AFSC‖ requirements and both enlisted and officers may be selected (as
volunteers or non-volunteers) to perform duties outside of their Control AFSC (Enlisted)/Duty
AFSC (Officers). Each requirement is a high priority, must fill position. All Airmen should be
prepared to deploy at a moment’s notice.
5.2. Notification Timelines. The following information applies to O-5/E-8 positions and
below. AFPC has the lead in identifying individuals for extended deployments. A minimum of
120 days notice is allocated to source all new extended deployment requirements, whenever
possible. However, there are occasions that notification will be reduced. For instance, when an
Airman falls out at the last minute, the replacement will get very short notice. Also, new
missions may require deployments with less notice, but every effort will be made to maximize
the notification timeline to at least 120 days. AFPC will advertise for volunteers, well in
advance, in an effort to reduce the number of Airmen selected with less than 60 days notice.
Requirements may be viewed on AFPC's website at: https://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/ look for
"365 Day Deployments,"under ―Quick Links‖ then select ―Open 365 day requirements‖ to access
the spreadsheet. Airmen selected for Extended Deployments with an established DOS/PCS must
be allowed at least 30 days for separation/PCS processing upon return (AFI 10-403, Deployment
Planning and Execution, Table A2.1, Note 1).
5.3. Selection Procedures. Airmen must have a minimum of 12 month time on station (from
date of first training or Required Delivery Date [RDD], whichever is earlier.) Selections for
Extended Deployments will be based on most eligible and qualified volunteers first. If none are
available, then selections will be based on most eligible and qualified non-volunteer, IAW with
procedures described in paragraph 5.5. Airmen serving on any stabilized tour, to include AAC
codes 32, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 50, 55, 85, 87 are still eligible to be selected as either a
volunteer or non-volunteer provided they meet other eligibility criteria. Reclamas will be
processed via the Reclama Process Tool (RPT) IAW AFI 10-401, Air Force Operational
Planning and Execution.
   5.3.1. Airmen assigned to Joint organizations: Releasability of all Airman assigned to joint
   organizations is subject to the concurrence of the respective J1 or Personnel division chief.
   Requests for availability will be coordinated with the J1/Personnel division staff prior to
   official notification.
   5.3.2. Airmen Assigned to a Short Tour Location. Airmen currently serving in an O/S short
   tour location may volunteer for an extended deployment; however, are only considered for
   selection if they will PCS to a CONUS location prior to RDD or date of first training. AFPC
   will coordinate selection with the gaining CC for Airmen selected in this situation.
5.4. Volunteers. AFPC will initially solicit volunteers for all positions. Volunteers with less
than 12 months TOS as of first training date or RDD (whichever is earlier) may be considered
for extended deployment, as an exception to policy, with commander concurrence and the
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  235


understanding that they may not be eligible for an advanced assignment (see paragraph 5.11).
Enlisted positions will be advertised using EQUAL Plus Advertisement in AMS. Ads will
normally be posted on EQUAL Plus for 10 days. Officers should contact their appropriate AFPC
Assignment Team for information on available requirements and to volunteer, or go to the AFPC
Extended Deployments website at: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/365.aspx.
   5.4.1. Airmen are encouraged to volunteer for any indeterminate TDY for which they are
   eligible and qualified. Airmen are not required to coordinate or obtain approval from their
   commander to volunteer for an indeterminate TDY. Commanders will make no policies,
   supplementing this instruction, that direct prior approval for volunteering. Once an Airman
   is selected by AFPC, commander coordination is required on the official notification letter.
   5.4.2. . Airmen who volunteer may request to withdraw their volunteer statement prior to the
   advertisement close out date. To withdraw a volunteer statement, the Airmen must contact
   their AFPC assignment OPR, via e-mail or delete the volunteer request on EQUAL Plus in
   AMS (enlisted) prior to the close out of the ad. Requests to withdraw volunteer statements
   after selection will be considered on a case-by-case basis IAW paragraph 2.12. If a
   cancellation request is submitted under this paragraph and subsequently disapproved, an
   Airman is not eligible to request separation or retirement under 3-day option provisions
   (unless they are still within 3 calendar days of official notification.). See paragraph 5.9 and
   Figure 5.2.
       5.4.2.1. Enlisted (E-8 and below): Once the EQUAL Plus Ad expires, AFPC will
       validate all volunteers to ensure they are eligible for selection and meet all identified
       qualifications. Volunteers will be given selection priority as follows:
          5.4.2.1.1. Long Overseas Returnees/COT Volunteers
              5.4.2.1.1.1. Overseas Returnee/COT Volunteers may apply for Equal-Plus Ad if
              the RDD in the Ad matches their DEROS or is within 2 months after their
              DEROS expires. (EXAMPLE: If DEROS equals Jun 07, Airman is eligible for
              Jun-Aug 07 deployment requirements.) NOTE: AFPC will extend Airman’s
              DEROS 13 months from RDD to accommodate the extended deployment and out-
              processing actions upon return.
              5.4.2.1.1.2. Indefinite DEROS Personnel. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS are
              only considered if they have or will have completed their original tour by RDD.
              5.4.2.1.2. CONUS Mandatory Movers (CMM): CMMs may apply for an Equal-
              Plus Ad if the RDD in the Ad matches their Date Of Availability (DOA) or the
              RDD is within 2 months after their DOA expires (See example in paragraph
              5.4.2.1.1.1). CMMs volunteering for an extended deployment with a DOA
              extending beyond the RDD will be prioritized as CONUS volunteers.
              5.4.2.1.3. CONUS Volunteers: Date Arrive Station (DAS) will be the deciding
              factor IAW AFI 36-2110, Table 2.3. Time On Station (TOS) Requirements.
              (NOTE: Airmen are prioritized longest to shortest time on station and must have
              at least 12 months time on station to be considered.)
          5.4.2.1.4. Overseas volunteers with a DEROS extending beyond the RDD: Airmen
          assigned to an overseas long tour with a DEROS extending beyond the RDD are
 236                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


           prioritized last among volunteer catagories. NOTE: This category also includes
           Airmen with an Indefinite DEROS who will not complete their original tour as of the
           RDD.
5.5. Non Volunteers. (NOTE: Airmen will be selected based on their projected grade.)
   5.5.1. For Enlisted: If there are not enough volunteers identified for an advertisement,
   AFPC will use established short tour selection rules IAW paragraph 3.3 and Table 3.1
   (priority for OS short tour selection) to select the most eligible non volunteer. Airmen must
   meet all PCS eligibility criteria to include quality control, time on station, and retainability.
   In addition to the categories listed in Table 3.1, Airmen serving overseas long tours may be
   used as a resource to fill these taskings. Airmen must have sufficient time left on their
   current tour (before DEROS) to be selected as a non-volunteer, i.e. 30 days upon return from
   deployment to out-process from their respective unit. Airmen who are HYT restricted and
   otherwise not eligible for 3 day option (as prescribed in Figure 5.2), may only be selected as
   a non-volunteer if they have at least 7 months retainability following the expected
   deployment return date. Vulnerability dates used to select individuals for short tour
   requirements will also be used in non-volunteer selections for an Extended Deployment and
   can be found on AMS.
   5.5.2. For Officers: If there are not enough volunteers, AFPC will use modified short tour
   selection rules. Non Volunteers are prioritized based on number of short tours, short tour
   return date (STRD) and overseas duty selection date (ODSD). Officers serving overseas long
   tours may be used as a resource to fill these taskings. Officers must have sufficient time
   remaining on their current tour (before DEROS) to be selected as a non-volunteer, i.e. 30-
   days upon return from deployment to out-process their respective unit. Officers not selected
   for promotion that have a mandatory DOS established and are otherwise not eligible for 3
   day option (see Figure 5.2) are not eligible for selection as a non-volunteer unless they have
   at least 7 months retainability following the expected deployment return date.
       5.5.3. Contact the AFPC assignment team for information on potential vulnerability for
       non- volunteer selection. Additional guidance is provided on the Extended Deployment
       website on the AFPC home page (https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/365.aspx) under:
       ―How do I determine if I am vulnerable to be selected as a non-volunteer for a 365-day
       extended deployment?‖
5.6. Post Deployment Deferment Period. Airmen are exempt from extended deployment
selection for 6 months following return from an AEF deployment or an Extended Deployment.
Eligibility is calculated from return date to the date of first training or RDD (at time of selection),
whichever is earlier. Approval authority to deploy Airmen before their deferment period expires
will be for valid mission reasons only and will be approved by AFPC, Director of Assignments.
5.7. AEF Cycle: If an Airman is formally selected/tasked (whether volunteer or non-volunteer)
for an ITDY Extended Deployment (notification memo forwarded to PRF and/or tasking in
DCAPES, whichever is earlier,) it takes priority over a 120/179 day AEF deployment and they
are no longer eligible for selection for an AEF deployment unless they have been released from
the ITDY by the applicable AFPC/DPA Division Chief. If an Airman is formally selected for an
AEF deployment and is within 60 days of departure for the AEF deployment/required associated
training or has already attended required training, then the AEF deployment will take priority.
Use this paragraph in conjunction with ITDY-AEF De-confliction Figure 5.1.

5.8. Notifications. Once selections are made, AFPC will officially notify the Airman’s
servicing MPS, Personnel Readiness Function (PRF) via DCAPES and e-mail containing official
notification letter, stating the location, duty title, training (if required) and RDD of the tasking.
The PRF determines wether or not Airman is eligibile for the 3-Day option provision by
consulting with the Career Development Element and IAW Figure 5.2. This information will be
annotated on the the official notification letter. The official notification letter will be sent to the
unit commander by forwarding within 24 hours. The commander notifies the Airman of
selection for an Extended Deployment upon receipt of the notification letter. Notifications must
be made immediately upon receipt (within 24 hours) of the tasking memo. Airmen on leave
must be contacted immediately (within 24 hours.)
   5.8.1. AFPC will update Assignment Availability Code (AAC) ET ―Extended Deployment‖
   with an expiration date of the Airman’s expected return date.
   5.8.2. Eligible Airmen have a maximum of 3 calendar days to either accept or decline the
   Extended Deployment. The 3 calendar day count begins the day after the date an Airman is
   officially notified and ends at the close of MPS business hours on the third calendar day
   following official notification. If the third calendar day is a weekend or holiday, the official
   notification period is extended to the first duty day thereafter. (For EXAMPLE: Airmen is
   notified on Wednesday. The first day of the count begins Thursday and ends the close of
   MPS business hours on Monday.) If Airman signs the notification stating his/her intent to
   accept the deployment, they can then provide preferences for advance assignment or elect the
   24 month deferment (see paragraph 5.11). If Airman elects to decline and is eligible (see
   paragraph 5.9), they will be processed for separation/retirement.
        5.8.2.1. Medical Pre-Assessment will be required for Airmen attending Combat Skills
        Training (CST). The medical pre-assessment will accompany the tasking notification as
        identified in the DCAPES line remarks. Airmen must complete the pre-assessment and
        include a copy with their signed notification letter.
        5.8.2.2. The commander must recommend/non-recommend (reclama) the Airman after
        the Airman has completed his/her portion of the form. If the commander elects to non-
        recommend the Airman because the tasking would cause sever mission degradation
        he/she must initiate a reclama within 24 hours. (See AFI 10-401, paragraph 10.21.3.)
        Once the commander has made a recommendation on the notification letter, a completed
 238                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       copy of the signed notification letter must be scanned/emailed or faxed back to the AFPC
       assignment OPR. Submission of a reclama is not justification for an Airman to delay
       their statement of intent to accept/decline the deployment.
5.9. Declinations. Airmen selected for an Extended Deployment should refer to Figure 5.2 to
determine 3-day opt eligibility. Airmen who do not have the retainability and do not meet the
criteria to 3-day opt should refer to paragraph 2.29 for retainability declination information.
Those who elect to decline retainability or initiate a 3-day option, will be processed for
separation/retirement under the current policy. (NOTE: Although reclamas for 3 day
opt/retainaibility declination requires Wing CC/equivalent approval (in RPT), this action is for
informational purposes only. The Wing CC/equivalent does not have disapproval authority for 3
day opt/retainability declination. The approval buttin in RPT represents Wing CC/equivalent
acknowledgment in these cases.
   5.9.1. Extended Deployments do not have an associated ADSC; however, there is a
   commitment (to include prior training preparation time plus TDY duration) associated with
   the selection for extended deployments. Therefore, Airmen are eligible to decline that
   commitment in keeping with the intent of the 7-day option procedures established in
   paragraph 2.30 (NOTE: Although the intent mirrors that of 7-day option, for purposes of
   timely notification, the time allotated for declining the deployment to separate or retire is 3
   days, hence ―3-day option‖).
       5.9.2. Commander’s Responsibilities: The commander must ensure Airmen are
       counseled on all aspects of declining retainability for the Extended Deployment (loss of
       promotion line number, re-enlistment ineligibility, promotion ineligibility, etc.). The
       commander must then fax the Official Notification Memo to the AFPC assignment OPR
       with a copy of the AF Form 964, PCS, TDY or Training Declination statement.
   5.9.3. Airman’s Responsibilities: If the Airman does not possess and refuses to obtain the
   required retainability for the Extended Deployment, they must complete the Official

   deferment following an extended deployment. If approved, AFPC will update Assignment
   Availability Code (AAC) ―39‖ to expire 24 months after projected return date for enlisted
   personnel. For officers, the request for an assignment deferment should be worked through
   the AFPC assignment team.
   5.10.2. Elect an advanced assignment upon completion of their extended deployment, but
   must have at least 24 months time on station as of projected RDD to be eligible and must
   have at least 36 months TOS before PCS departure. If approved, AFPC will load the
   assignment information in MILPDS. In order to allow time for reconstitution and out-
   processing, RNLTDs should not be established earlier than 60 days from projected return.
   Airmen electing an overseas Advance Assignment that desire to send their dependents in
   advance must comply with AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.. Dependent travel to a
   designated place must be approved prior to any movement of dependents.
   5.10.3. Airmen may only make one election; either an Advanced Assignment (AA) or a 2
   year PCS deferment. Once the election is submitted, it constitutes the Airman’s preference
   and will not be reconsidered at a later date. If the Airman desires a change, the only option
   available is to request cancellation of such action, return to home station and enter the next
   assignment cycle for which they are eligible.
       5.10.3.1. Airmen must serve long enough on the Extended Deployment to receive award
       of the short tour to preserve the advance assignment entitlement (see para 5.13)
       5.10.3.2. Dependents are entitled to certain travel allowances IAW the Joint Federal
       Travel Regulation (JFTR), Volume I, U4600, while member is filling an extended
       deployment. Once final assignment determinations have been made and loaded into
       MilPDS, ITDY dependent allowances cease. Questions on JFTR dependent allowances
       should be referred to the Base Transportation Management Office (TMO) or base
       Financial Services Office (FSO).
5.11. Students: Airmen selected for an Extended Deployment who are assigned to a Student
PASCODE (AFIT, AFIP, IDE, SDE, etc) must be PCS’d to a valid position at their next
permanent duty station assignment and must PCS to that assignment prior to deploying on their
Extended Deployment. The Airman must return to that same assignment for a tour of duty
following their deployment. For example, an Air War College student is selected for a position
in Iraq and will be given a subsequent assignment to fill a position on the HQ AMC staff.
Airman must depart Maxwell, sign in to the gaining unit at Scott, and out-process for
deployment through Scott. Upon completion of the TDY, they return to Scott for a tour on the
staff.    This is not waiverable due to the significant impact of assigning Senior Raters
(evaluations, promotions, DE, command, etc).
5.12. Deployment Information:
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 243


   5.12.1. Training: Many of these extended deployments require additional TDYs for training.
   These TDYs can range from 1 week to 6 months, usually they are en-route and are in
   addition to the Extended Deployment. For en-route training, Airmen will deploy from the
   training location and should not expect to return to home-station before deploying. Airmen
   are not authorized POVs at en-route TDY/training locations. Airmen and PRFs must follow
   all Line Remarks to include required equipment/supplies before departing for en-route
   training.
   5.12.2. Each Airman must complete all local pre-deployment requirements prior to departing
   for training (i.e. medical clearance, weapons qualification, LOAC, etc.). The Base PRF will
   verify that all local training is completed prior to member departing for training/deployment.
   5.12.3. Deployment of Airmen on Assignment Limitation Code ―C‖: Airmen that have been
   selected for an Extended Deployment (volunteer or non-volunteer) must report to their local
   Military Treatment Facility within 3 duty days of formal notification to process a medical
   exception IAW AFI 41-210 (Patient Administration Functions), para 10.8.3.1. Airmen will
   not delay further deployment out-processing, pending final decision on their exception
   request. AFPC/DPAMM will work with the MTF and deployed SG as necessary to expedite
   a final decision on all exception requests. If the medical decision is that the deployed MTF
   cannot support the members medical condition, then AFPC will select the next most eligible
   Airman.
   5.12.4. Voluntary Extensions: Airmen are expected to complete the entire duration of the
   extended deployment for which they have been selected. Airmen may voluntarily extend the
   length of the deployment, but only with approval from all extended deployment action
   offices (CENTAF/A1, AFPC and losing/gaining Airman’s commander). No additional
   financial incentives are currently being offered by the AF for Airmen extending in the AOR.
5.13. Short Tour Credit/Joint Credit/AEF & Contingency Exemptions:
   5.13.1. Short Tour Credit: Per Table 3.4, Rules 2 and 5 and AFPC/DPA 8106 message
   dated 171955Z Jun 03, Award of PCS Short Tour Credit for TDY, approval is granted to
   award PCS short tour credit after completion of the extended deployment and processing of
   the travel voucher. Questions pertaining to the awarding of joint credit should be addressed
   to AFPC/DPAPPO.
   5.13.2. Joint Duty Assignment (JDA) Credit: There are two types of joint credit involved
   depending on whether the officer deploys to a Secretary of Defense (SecDef) approved
   temporary Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) billet or to the headquarters of a SecDef
   approved operation and location as qualifying for cumulative credit.
      5.13.2.1. If deployed to a temporary JDAL billet, the attached CCDR is responsible for
      tracking and notifying AFPC/DPAPPO (Joint Officer Management) when officers arrive
      and depart the AOR. AFPC will update the officer’s joint clock accordingly with the
      joint start date upon arrival into the AOR, Joint Duty Assignment Management
      Information System (JDAMIS) Number, and stop the joint clock upon departure from the
      AOR. Joint Credit will be awarded based on the time served in the AOR; no automatic
      credit will be awarded for serving less than 10 months; cumulative credit will be awarded
      for serving 10 or 12 months. Full JDA Credit may be awarded for serving the full tour of
      12 months (365 days) and will be considered on a case-by-case basis if verified by the
 244                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       attached CCDR, supported by the officer’s Service, and approved by the SecDef for a
       waiver.
       5.13.2.2. If not deployed to a temporary JDAL billet but are deployed to an operation,
       location, and during the time period approved by the SecDef as qualifying for cumulative
       joint duty credit, the officer can apply for cumulative credit upon return to home station.
       This cumulative joint duty credit cannot be combined with other types of joint duty credit
       and is not considered for promotion boards. Eligibility criteria and a listing of approved
       operations, locations, and dates can be viewed on the JTF self-nomination web page at:
       https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/jtf/owa/jtf_main.home. The following instructions apply to
       officers who completed their tours before 1 August 2005. Officers must follow the
       instructions on that web page in order to self-nominate for the credit. E-mail questions to
       afpc.jtfc@randolph.af.mil. If your deployment is not to one of the approved operations
       listed or is to a subordinate unit to the HQ listed, then it does not qualify for cumulative
       credit. The following are the current SecDef approved operations eligible for cumulative
       credit:
   5.13.3. Post-Deployment Stand-Down Program: Commanders will grant Airmen post-
   deployment stand-down time upon return from the extended deployment to allow Airmen
   time to reconstitute unless otherwise established by home station MAJCOM policy. Airmen
   must adhere to their MAJCOM policy and remain at the permanent duty station during
   reconstitution time.
5.14. Functional Elements . Please refer to the appropriate AFIs for all other functional
actions required in management of the Extended Deployment: Personnel Readiness Functions:

Airman or Airmen—All members of the US Air Force, both officer and enlisted
Allocation—Notification to a MAJCOM/FOA/DRU that an Airman is available for assignment
to that command.
Allowance—Describes conditions under which the United States government provides
reimbursesment for expenses incident to a permanent change of station. Consult the Joint
Federal Travel Regulation to determine government-paid travel of dependents, movement of
household goods, and other payments associated with reassignment of Airmen.
Assigned—An Airman counted as part of a unit's assigned strength.
Assignment—The permanent change of an Airman’s duty station from one location to another.
Also refers to duties performed. (Used alternately with the term ―reassignment.‖)
Assignment Action Number (AAN)—A sequential numbering system used to distinguish one
operational, rotational, unit, or training assignment action from another. It stays the same even if
there are changes in the movement month.
Assignment Instructions—Information, usually provided through the personnel data system,
that accompanies selection for PCS.
Assignment Selection Date (ASD)—The date an Airman is selected by name for assignment by
the assignment OPR; or the date the assignment process begins in order to reassign an Airman on
a scheduled future date (such as upon DEROS, tour completion date from a CONUS maximum
stabilized tour, the date an Airman will become surplus, and so on); or the date an officer (only)
is identified by the assignment OPR as vulnerable for PCS selection.
Attached—Responsibility for an Airman for temporary administration or duty at other than his
or her permanent unit of assignment (and the unit of attachment is other than Airman’s
permanent duty station), for temporary command and control during the Airman’s absence
similar to that exercised at the Airman’s permanent duty station.
Authorization—A funded and validated manpower requirement.
 252                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


Availability Date—The day, month, and year which an Airman is available for assignment. For
assignment purposes, usually only the month and year are used to determine availability.
Basic Military Training (BMT)—Training provided to non-prior service Airmen to effect an
orderly transition from civilian to military life.
Cancellation of Permanent Change of Station (PCS)—Revoking or rescinding assignment
instructions.
Career Airman (Enlisted)—An enlisted Airman serving on their second or subsequent
enlistment.
Career Bachelor OS Tour—A career bachelor is defined as an enlisted Airman with 4 or more
years active duty or an officer, captain or above, with more than 4 years of commissioned active
duty who is single or divorced, and has no legal dependents residing in household on the date
departed CONUS, and the OS tour length to which being assigned is 36 months accompanied
and 24 months unaccompanied. Upon SAF direction, career bachelors may be required to serve
the 36 month tour length.
Career Job Reservation (CJR)—An enlisted Airman's reenlistment quota.
Career Officer—For assignment purposes, officers serving in the grades of captain and above
and who have 4 or more years of commissioned active service on or before the official
notification date, or nomination for assignment, education or training. All other officers are non-
career officers.
Command-Sponsored Dependent—See Dependent, Command-Sponsored.
Commander—Unless otherwise specified, refers to the immediate commander of the Airman
concerned and includes officially appointed squadron section commanders.
Concurrent Travel—Authorized move of dependents at government expense to an OS area at

Continuation of Assignment—A change of a Airman’s end assignment that takes place after a
Airman’s departure from previous duty station, but before arrival at the original new duty station
and before the RNLTD.
CONUS Isolated Station— Those locations where adequate community support facilities and
services do not exist within 50 miles or are over 1 1/2 hours drive, one way, in normal weather
conditions. Community support includes government or non-government facilities and services,
such as: adequate family housing, medical and dental care, essential shopping facilities,
reasonable recreation facilities, and religious services. During such assignments, the member and
their families may experience a significantly greater degree of inconvenience, expense, and
hardship when compared to assignment to other CONUS locations. Also, due to hazardous
weather, marginal roads or lack of commercial transportation, the person is at greater risk when
traveling between the duty station, residence, and support facilities.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 253


Curtailment—Termination of an OS tour before completion of the prescribed length, including
any extensions (except cancellation of a voluntary extension). Terminal leave taken before
DEROS is not a tour curtailment and is not a DEROS change. Ordinary leave begins and ends in
the local area; therefore, it is not a DEROS change or curtailment.
Deferment—A personnel management tool, used to preclude or delay assignment selection of an
Airman or group of Airmen when in the best interest of the Air Force. See Table 2.1. for AACs
for the deferment reasons and periods. When an Airman has an AAC they are ineligible for
reassignment until their date of availability except for a mandatory PCS or when the assignment
OPR waives the deferment.
Delayed Dependent Travel (For EFMP Only)—An OS MAJCOM/SG will delay dependent
travel to the projected OS location when MRS or SES are not available at a specific OS location.
Do not issue travel orders until the OS medical authority determines the required services are
available and can be provided to the dependents concerned.
Denied Dependent Travel (For EFMP Only)—If there is no GMS, the OS medical commander
will deny dependent travel to the projected assignment location.
Department of the Air Force—The executive part of the Department of the Air Force at the
seat of government and all field headquarters, forces, Reserve components, installations,
activities and functions under the control or supervision of the Secretary of the Air Force.

Surplus—When there are Airmen assigned to a location that has zero manpower authorizations
in a career field (for example SMSgt and below in 3S0X1). A surplus does require assignment
action – either there are no authorizations for the career field, manning at that location will not
support them to remain due to manning/requirements at other locations, or they have been
disqualified for duties. An overage does not require assignment action since there are
authorizations for the career field and the manning at that location, as well as overall manning in
the career field, allows them to remain. An overage or surplus situation may be impractical or

                                         Attachment 2
                   BASE OF PREFERENCE (BOP) (ENLISTED ONLY)

A2.1. Purpose. The first-term Airman (FTA) BOP program is a reenlistment incentive under the
CAREERS programs (see AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force). The
career Airman BOP program is an incentive for other Airmen to continue an Air Force career.
A2.2. FTA Program.
   A2.2.1. General Information. In conjunction with reenlistment, FTA may request a PCS
   BOP or a BOP to remain in-place. FTA may also request a BOP in conjunction with
   reenlistment and retraining (see AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program). Airmen may
   request PCS CONUS to CONUS, or PCS from OS to CONUS. Airmen in the CONUS
   (only) may request a BOP to remain in-place. An Airman in the CONUS may apply for a
   PCS BOP and an in-place BOP at the same time. A FTA PCS BOP is not authorized from
   CONUS to OS, or OS to OS, since these assignments are made IAW OS PCS selection
   priorities. An in-place FTA BOP is not authorized for Airmen assigned OS since these
   Airmen have other options to remain at their current OS location consistent with their
   eligibility.
   A2.2.2. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following general eligibility criteria and
   restrictions apply to all FTA BOPs. Additional eligibility criteria and restrictions may apply
   to a specific BOP option as shown below. Airmen who are ineligible or who desire BOP
   consideration other than as authorized may submit a request as an exception to policy as
   outlined in paragraph 1.5.
       A2.2.2.1. Must have a category of enlistment of ―1‖; first term Airman and never applied
       for a FTA BOP.
       A2.2.2.2. Must be selected under the Selective Reenlistment Program (SRP) and have an
       approved CJR.
       A2.2.2.3. Must not have been selected for PCS or have an ASD (see paragraph 2.31 for
       ASD based on a schedule.)
       A2.2.2.4. Must not be in AAC 05, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27 as listed in Table
       2.1.
       A2.2.2.5. Must submit their application prior to reenlistment.
       A2.2.2.6. Consecutive BOPs in any combination are not authorized. For example, a
       FTA who receives an in-place BOP cannot then receive a career Airman PCS BOP. They
       must have an intervening PCS.
       A2.2.2.7. BOP combinations other than those listed are not authorized. For example,
       Airman may not request a consecutive OS tour (COT) as a BOP.
       A2.2.2.8. Military Couples. The join spouse intent code is a major factor when
       considering the BOP request from an Airman of a military couple. Both Airmen of a
       military couple may request BOP consideration in their own right, if both are eligible. If
       the intent code is ―A‖ or ―B‖ then the Airman must request the same locations in the
       same order (including in-place), or both requests will be disapproved. If one Airman is
262                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      ineligible, regardless of the reason, both requests will be disapproved. (EXCEPTION:
      For FTA requesting a BOP in conjunction with retraining or FTA married to another
      FTA, both Airmen of the military couple do not have to be eligible for BOP, however,
      manning must support join spouse to BOP location.) When one Airman of a military
      couple requests a BOP and the intent code is ―H‖ the request will be considered. Refer to
      Attachment 8, paragraph A8.3.10 and A8.5.2 for information on how this action may
      affect future join spouse assignment consideration.
      A2.2.2.9. Withdrawal of an approved BOP (PCS or in-place) due to declining
      retainability constitutes use of the BOP option, and no further BOP consideration will be
      given. A voluntary request by an Airman to terminate the 2-year BOP deferment must be
      submitted through the servicing MPS to the assignment OPR for consideration. NOTE:
      Voluntary withdrawal of a BOP application (PCS or in-place) prior to final decision by
      HQ AFPC does not constitute usage of BOP.
  A2.2.3. Requests Without Retraining.
      A2.2.3.1. CONUS to CONUS, PCS only. (When Airmen desire both in-place and PCS
      consideration, use the in-place (hard-copy) application procedures shown in paragraph
      A2.2.3.2.3).
         A2.2.3.1.1. Must have at least 12 months TOS as of the PCS departure date.
         A2.2.3.1.2. May be considered regardless of overseas vulnerability or stabilized tour
         status and Airman with a CONUS/OS imbalanced AFSC may apply.
         A2.2.3.1.3. Application Procedures.
             A2.2.3.1.3.1. Airmen may not apply for PCS BOP consideration prior to having 8
             months TOS. Airmen may apply using Figure A2.1.
             A2.2.3.1.3.2. Airmen may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference.
             Preferences will be considered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request
             lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place preference, followed by additional
             PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS
             bases only when indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as
             preferences.
             A2.2.3.1.3.3. Requests must be submitted before reenlistment.         Requests
             submitted before reenlistment are processed even if the Airman reenlists before
             the BOP determination is made.
             A2.2.3.1.3.4. Commander. Requests for PCS BOP (only) do not have to be
             reviewed by the commander. If both PCS and in-place BOP consideration is
             being requested, then submit a (hard copy) application IAW paragraph
             A2.2.3.2.3.
             A2.2.3.1.3.5. MPS. The MPS reviews eligibility of the applicant and updates
             hard copy applications via MilPDS.
             A2.2.3.1.3.6. If Airman’s request is approved, ensure the Airman reenlists within

           where the unaccompanied tour length is 18 months or more, or 10 months prior to
           DEROS where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18 months. The RIP
           must be returned to the MPS within 30 days of the day it was produced. Members
           who desire BOP consideration must make an election on their RIP to retain
           current DEROS and must obtain the required PCS retainability for CONUS PCS
264                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


            consideration as shown in Table 2.5. Airmen apply using Figure A2.1. In the
            event approval of a CONUS BOP is not possible, a CONUS PCS will be provided
            as a normal returnee.
            A2.2.3.3.3.2. Commander.       Applications do not have to be reviewed by the
            commander.
            A2.2.3.3.3.3. MPS. Reviews eligibility of the applicant. Updates hard copy

            disapprovals to MPS’ via MilPDS.
  A2.2.4. Requests With Retraining.
      A2.2.4.1. CONUS to CONUS PCS and In-Place. Use this paragraph when Airmen
      desire either PCS or in-place consideration, or both.
         A2.2.4.1.1. Application Procedures.
            A2.2.4.1.1.1. Airman. Airmen request BOP consideration at the same time they
            apply for a CJR and retraining as outlined in AFI 36-2606 and AFI 36-2626.
            BOP consideration is in the AFSC into which being retrained. When a BOP is not
            desired, enter the following statement in the BOP selection of the retraining
            application: ―I have been told about the BOP program for first- term Airmen and
            do not desire to apply. I understand I will not be given another opportunity to
            apply for a first-term Airman BOP.‖
            A2.2.4.1.1.2. BOP preferences are listed in the BOP section of the retraining
            application. Airmen may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference.
            Preferences will be considered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request
            lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place preference, followed by additional
            PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases
            only when indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
            A2.2.4.1.1.3. The action on a Airman’s request will vary depending on
            preferences stated and whether retraining is accomplished by TDY or PCS. For
            example, if the retraining is to a PCS course, then the BOP consideration would
            be for the first assignment after training is completed. If a BOP request cannot be
            approved, then assignment will be based on the needs of the Air Force.
            A2.2.4.1.1.4. Commander. Must recommend member for retraining before BOP
            preferences will receive consideration.
            A2.2.4.1.1.5. The MPS reviews eligibility for the BOP/retraining of the applicant
            and updates hard copy applications via MilPDS.
                A2.2.4.1.1.5.1. When retraining requests are approved, Airmen are required
                to get retainability (reenlist) to accept the retraining action as outlined in AFI
                36-2626, Table 3.3. This amount of retainability is normally less than that
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                265


                 required for a CONUS to CONUS PCS (that is 24 months). Therefore, in
                 order to satisfy the PCS retainability requirement, Airmen must satisfactorily
                 complete the retraining course and then reenlist in the new AFSC before they
                 are permitted to depart from the training location, regardless whether training
                 is attended in PCS or TDY en route status. If an Airman attending training in
                 PCS status refuses to reenlist, then reclama the retraining PCS assignment per
                 paragraph 2.46. When an Airman is attending in TDY en route status, a
                 delay in obtaining retainability for PCS until award of the 3-skill level is
                 authorized as outlined in Table 2.7, rule 3 and note 6. If the Airman refuses
                 to reenlist, then do not permit the Airman to depart the training location and
                 comply with the instructions in Table 2.7, note 6.
                 A2.2.4.1.1.5.2. When an in-place BOP is approved, MilPDS will
                 automatically update AAC 28 with an expiration date 24 months from date of
                 approval.
                 A2.2.4.1.1.5.3. For PCS BOP, the gaining MPS updates AAC 28 upon in-
                 processing with expiration date of 24 months from DAS.
                 A2.2.4.1.1.5.4. If the retraining request is disapproved then the BOP request
                 is not considered. Airmen may request any of the BOP options for which they
                 remain eligible.
                 A2.2.4.1.1.5.5. AFPC. Approves or disapproves in-place BOP requests via
                 MilPDS.
A2.2.4.2. OS to CONUS (With Retraining).

          A2.2.4.2.1. PCS is upon completion of OS tour. DEROS may be extended or
          curtailed depending on retraining class start date.
          A2.2.4.2.2. Must not have been selected for PCS.
          A2.2.4.2.3. Application Procedures.
             A2.2.4.2.3.1. Airman. Airman requests BOP consideration at the same time they
             apply for a CJR and retraining as outlined in AFI 36-2606 and AFI 36-2626.
             BOP consideration is in the AFSC into which being retrained. When a BOP is not
             desired, enter the following statement in the BOP section of the retraining
             application: ―I have been told about the BOP program for first- term Airmen and
             do not desire to apply. I understand I will not be given another opportunity to
             apply for a first-term Airman BOP.‖
             A2.2.4.2.3.2. BOP preferences are listed in the BOP section of the retraining
             application. Airmen may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference.
             Preferences will be considered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request
             lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place preference, followed by additional
             PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases
             only when indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
             A2.2.4.2.3.3. The action on a Airman’s request will vary depending on
             preferences stated and whether retraining is accomplished by TDY or PCS. For
 266                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


              example, if the training is to a PCS course then the BOP consideration would be
              for the first assignment after training is completed. If a BOP request cannot be
              approved, then assignment will be based on the needs of the Air Force.
              A2.2.4.2.3.4. Requests must be submitted before reenlistment.         Requests
              submitted before reenlistment are processed even if the Airman reenlists before
              the BOP determination is made.
              A2.2.4.2.3.5. Commander. Must recommend member for retraining before BOP
              preferences will receive consideration.
              A2.2.4.2.3.6. MPS.
                 A2.2.4.2.3.6.1. When retaining request is approved, Airmen are required to
                 get retainability to accept the retraining action as outlined in AFI 36-2626,
                 Table 3.3. Normally this satisfies the requirement for OS to CONUS PCS
                 retainability when course attendance is TDY en route. If an Airman is to
                 attend a PCS training course they must reenlist upon completion of the course
                 and prior to departure on PCS. If the Airmen refuses to reenlist, then reclama
                 the retraining PCS assignment per paragraph 2.46.
                 A2.2.4.2.3.6.2. The servicing MPS at the BOP location updates AAC 28 and
                 the expiration date is 24 months from the date arrived station.
                 A2.2.4.2.3.6.3. If the retraining request is approved then the BOP request is
                 not considered. Upon receipt of disapproved retraining, Airmen may request
                 BOP PCS consideration in current AFSC as an exception.
A2.3. Career Airman Program.
   A2.3.1. General Information. Career Airmen may request a PCS BOP CONUS to CONUS
   (only) or may request a BOP to remain in-place at a CONUS location. Other BOP
   combinations are not authorized since other assignments are made IAW OS PCS selection
   priorities and OS to CONUS PCS selection priorities. For Airmen currently assigned OS,
   other programs exist to request to remain at an OS location.
   A2.3.2. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following general eligibility criteria and
   restrictions apply:
       A2.3.2.1. Must have at least 41 months TOS (3 years, 5 months) at the time of
       application and at least 4 years TOS before PCS departure. EXCEPTION: If currently
       serving on a minimum stabilized tour of at least 4 years, can apply no earlier than 7
       months before completing the stabilized tour. If serving on a maximum stabilized tour of
       at least 4 years, can apply no earlier than 12 months and no later than 9 months before
       completing the stabilized tour. The MPS submits requests under these exceptions by
       message to the assignment OPR.
       A2.3.2.2. Must have a category of enlistment code of ―2 – Second term Airmen‖ or ―4 –
       Career Airman‖ and be selected under the SRP.
       A2.3.2.3. Must not have been selected for PCS or have an ASD (see paragraph 2.31 for
       ASD based upon a schedule).
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               267


     A2.3.2.4. Must not be in AAC 05, 08, 09, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, or 27 as
     listed in Table 2.1.
     A2.3.2.5. Consecutive BOPs in any combination are not authorized.
     A2.3.2.6. Must have or be eligible to obtain the required retainability.
     A2.3.2.7. Must not be an OS volunteer or have any other voluntary applications pending.
     This does not include Humanitarian or EFMP assignment applications.
     A2.3.2.8. Airmen vulnerable for OS PCS selection may apply, however, OS
     vulnerability will be a factor in approval or disapproval.
     A2.3.2.9. Manning will be a factor in approval or disapproval.
     A2.3.2.10. Airmen may ask for a BOP in an awarded AFSC other than CAFSC;
     however, approval is based on the needs of the Air Force. A request for this
     consideration must specifically be stated in the remarks of the in-system MilPDS request.
     A2.3.2.11. Military Couples. The join spouse intent code is a major factor when
     considering the BOP request from a member of a military couple. Both members of a
     military couple may request BOP consideration in their own right, if both are eligible. If
     the intent code is ―A‖ or ―B‖ then the Airmen must request the same locations in the
     same order (including in-place), or both requests will be disapproved. If one Airman is
     ineligible, regardless of the reason, both requests will be disapproved. (EXCEPTION:
     For FTA requesting a BOP in conjunction with retraining or FTA married to another
     FTA, both members of the military couple do not have to be eligible for BOP, however,
     manning must support join spouse to BOP location.) When one member of a military
     couple requests a BOP and the intent code is ―H‖ the request will be considered. Refer to
     Attachment 8, paragraph A8.3.10 and A8.5.2 for information on how this action may
     affect future join spouse assignment consideration.
     A2.3.2.12. Withdrawal of an approved BOP (PCS or in-place) due to declining
     retainability constitutes use of the BOP option, and no further BOP consideration will be
     given. A voluntary request by an Airman to terminate the 2-year BOP deferment must be
     submitted through the servicing MPS to the assignment OPR for consideration. NOTE:
     Voluntary withdrawal of a BOP application (PCS or in-place) prior to final decision by
     HQ AFPC does not constitute usage of BOP.
  A2.3.3. CONUS to CONUS PCS and/or In-Place (CONUS only).
     A2.3.3.1. Application Procedures.
        A2.3.3.1.1. Airman. Airman may apply for PCS (only) using Figure A2.1. If
        applying for an in-place BOP (only), or both PCS and in-place BOP, they must use
        the (hard-copy) application shown in Figure A2.1.
        A2.3.3.1.2. Airman may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference.
        Preferences will be considered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request
        lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place preference, followed by additional
        PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases
        only when indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
268                                                 AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      A2.3.3.1.3. When a Airman’s request is disapproved, Airmen may resubmit after 6
      months from the date of disapproval when requesting the same locations. The
      member need not wait six months when requesting different locations. There is no
      limit on the number of times an Airman may apply.
      A2.3.3.1.4. Commander. Applications for PCS (only) do not have to be reviewed by
      the commander. If in-place consideration is being requested (or if both PCS and in-
      place is requested), then submit a (hard copy) application using Figure A2.1.
      A2.3.3.1.5. MPS. The MPS reviews eligibility of the applicant and updates hard
      copy applications via MilPDS.
      A2.3.3.1.6. If Airman’s request is approved, ensure the Airman obtains 24 months
      service retainability within 30 days of approval notification. Airmen may request a
      delay in obtaining retainability as outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.8 and Table 2.7.
      A2.3.3.1.7. When an in-place BOP is approved the AAC 28 is automatically updated
      with an expiration date 24 months from date of approval. For PCS BOP, the gaining
      MPS updates AAC 28 upon in-processing with an expiration date 24 months from
      DAS.
      A2.3.3.1.8. AFPC. Considers applications quarterly and approves or disapproves in-
      place BOP request via MILPDS.

 MEMORANDUM FOR UNIT COMMANDER                                                        (date)

 SUBJECT: FOUO - BOP Application - CAFSC

 1. Please consider me for a BOP assignment to one of the bases listed below or please consider
 me for an in-place BOP. The bases listed below were not my last assignment. If it was my last
 assignment, I was not assigned there under any BOP provision. NOTE: Use CONUS bases
 only when indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.

 2. (For Airmen married to other military members only.) I have been counseled on BOP and
 join-spouse assignment criteria. I understand if I request a BOP, I will first be considered for
 assignment to my spouse’s location unless join spouse assignment is not desired (intent code
 H). If I receive an approved PCS BOP, then join spouse assignment to the BOP location for my
 spouse is not authorized. If I proceed on a PCS BOP I understand I am responsible for the
 family separation created. I understand we may each request a BOP in our own right to the
 same location (including in-place), if we are both eligible. I understand approval of a PCS or in-
 place BOP does not result in deferment for my spouse. For FTA retraining under QRP: I
 understand I will have my BOP application considered in preference order and my spouse will
 be considered for a join spouse assignment unless join spouse assignment is not desired (intent
 code H). However, I understand that manning at the requested locations must support both
 myself and my spouse in order for the assignments to be approved.

 3. I understand I will be required to have or obtain the necessary 24 months retainability
 (computed from the RNLTD (Year and month) within 30 days of approval and if I am a FTA I
 must reenlist to suffice this retainability requirement. I also understand that voluntary
 cancellation of an approved BOP on my behalf or refusal to obtain the necessary retainability
 constitutes use of my BOP option.

                     CONUS-ISOLATED ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM

A3.1. Purpose. To establish minimum tour lengths and limit certain assignment combinations
which involve a CONUS-isolated station. (see Attachment 1, Definitions). Cavalier, ND is
currently designated as a CONUS-isolated location. This location is considered to be
geographically separated from adequate personal support facilities and services which may cause
a significant degree of inconvenience, expense, or hardship to Airmen and their families more so
than other CONUS assignments.
A3.2. CONUS-Isolated Designation/Tour Lengths.
   A3.2.1. Stations may be designated as CONUS-isolated when:
       A3.2.1.1. The one-way distance to minimum adequate community support is more than
       50 miles or over 1 and 1/2 hours drive in normal weather conditions from the station.
       Community support includes government or non-government facilities and services, such
       as adequate family housing, medical and dental care, essential shopping facilities,
       reasonable recreational facilities, and religious services.
       A3.2.1.2. Travel between duty station, residence, and support facilities is determined to
       be complicated by hazardous weather, marginal roads, or lack of commercial
       transportation which places the Airman in a greater risk.
   A3.2.2. Minimum tour lengths for CONUS-isolated stations have been established as:
       A3.2.2.1. Fifteen months for single and unaccompanied members. (NOTE: If an Airman
       is assigned to a CONUS-isolated station on a BOP assignment, he or she must serve a 24
       month BOP), or
       A3.2.2.2. Twenty four months for members accompanied by dependents. Airmen will
       serve the accompanied tour if they reside with dependents within 50 miles of the duty
       station. Distances are computed from the standard highway mileage guide available at
       the FSO.
   A3.2.3. The PCS retainability requirements shown in Table 2.5 apply regardless whether the
   Airman will serve a 15 month unaccompanied tour or 24 month accompanied tour. For
   example, an Airman being reassigned CONUS to CONUS requires 24 months retainability
   for the PCS, even though they may choose to serve the 15 month unaccompanied tour.
   Further, in order to be reassigned upon completion of a 15 or 24 month tour, Airmen must
   have PCS retainability prescribed by Table 2.5 for their next assignment. Members who do
   not have the minimum retainability for PCS remain assigned.
A3.3. Airman Actions.
   A3.3.1. To apply for reassignment to a CONUS-isolated station:
       A3.3.1.1. Officers use Figure A3.1 or AFAS guidelines, and Enlisted use Figure A3.1.
   A3.3.2. Airmen already assigned at CONUS-isolated stations receive a RIP about 11 months
   from their DOA (controlled via AAC code 50) established according accompanied status
   (Established DOA will be 15 months from DAS for unaccompanied/24 months from DAS
   for accompanied.) This is their notification that they may apply for reassignment. A request
 272                                                     AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   for reassignment will not be accepted if submitted more than 11 months before an officer or
   Airman’s DOA. To apply for reassignment from a CONUS-isolated station:
       A3.3.2.1. Officers use Figure A3.2 or AFAS guidelines, and Enlisted use Figure A3.2.
       A3.3.2.2. Airmen who delay submitting a request for reassignment from a CONUS-
       isolated station reduce the probability of a reassignment date that coincides with their
       DOA. Airmen may be held beyond the desired movement date to permit adequate time
       for identification and notification of a replacement. AF requirements determine when
       actual reassignment will occur.
A3.4. Commander Actions.
   A3.4.1. Verifies Airman’s assignment eligibility.
   A3.4.2. Sends requests to designate a location as a CONUS-isolated station to HQ
   AFPC/DPAPP for final determination.
A3.5. MPS Actions.
   A3.5.1. Upon receipt of request for PCS to or from a CONUS-isolated station, verifies an
   Airman’s assignment eligibility (ensure Airman does not have an ASD), updates the PDS as
   outlined in the PSD Handbook, and suspenses a copy of the application pending final
   response from the HQ AFPC assignment OPR.
   A3.5.2. Updates AAC 50 as specified in paragraph A3.3.2 upon arrival of an Airman at
   Cavalier, ND.
   A3.5.3. Counsels Airmen at Cavalier ND, who request release from selection for an
   involuntary OS short tour, or who receive a change in assignment, that they remain
   vulnerable for future OS short tour selection.
A3.6. Assignment OPR Actions.
   A3.6.1. Does not involuntarily assign Airmen to consecutive CONUS-isolated stations.
   Airmen may be selected for a CONUS PCS or an OS assignment (short or long tour based on
   their OS vulnerability) when they complete their CONUS-isolated tours.
   A3.6.2. Does not involuntarily assign people to CONUS-isolated stations immediately upon
   completion of an unaccompanied OS short tour unless there is no other reasonable
   alternative.
   A3.7.3. Does not divert an Airman who received one of their choices in the OS returnee
   match to a CONUS-isolated station.
   A3.7.4. Determines if an assignment change request from an Airman who has been selected
   for an involuntary unaccompanied OS short tour from a CONUS-isolated station can be
   supported. If possible, change the assignment to a CONUS or any OS long tour assignment.
       A3.7.4.1. Approval of a change of assignment request must depend on availability of
       other resources to fill the short tour requirement.
   A3.7.5. Reconsideration of a request to depart a CONUS-isolated tour for the same
   assignment preferences will not be considered until 6 months have passed from the initial
   disapproval.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           273


  A3.7.6. Establishes RNLTDs based on manning requirements.           Sends approvals or
  disapprovals to the MPS.
  A3.7.7. Considers volunteers for OS assignments as a mandatory PCS to the extent possible
  upon completion of a CONUS-isolated tour as outlined in Tables 3.1 and 3.2.
  A3.7.8. Considers ODSD and STRD waivers.
 274                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009

                                        Attachment 4
  CONSECUTIVE OS TOUR (COT), IN-PLACE CONSECUTIVE OS TOUR (IPCOT),
          AND INVOLUNTARY CONSECUTIVE OS TOURS (ICOT)

A4.1. COT General Information.
   A4.1.1. The objective of the voluntary COT program is twofold: conserve PCS funds by
   encouraging eligible Airmen to serve consecutive OS tours and reduce PCS turbulence.
   Since OS returnees must move, a move from the CONUS to the OS location is eliminated
   when an OS returnee fills another OS requirement. COTs are authorized for any
   combination of OS assignments (short to long, long to long, etc.).
   A4.1.2. All PCS assignments between OS duty stations must be accomplished as COTs
   except when an Airman is reassigned on a continuation of tour due to being surplus
   (paragraph 2.48). Do not use the abbreviation COT in reference to a continuation of tour.
   A4.1.3. Airmen reassigned on a COT must serve the full prescribed tour at their current
   location and must serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location. Exceptions involving
   curtailment of current OS tour and reassignment on a COT may be requested according to
   paragraph 1.5 and will be considered on a case by case basis.
   A4.1.4. The Airman’s ODSD and STRD (if applicable) will be updated after completion of
   the original tour, plus any approved DEROS extension.
   A4.1.5. For COT, no priority travel of dependents or guarantee of government quarters is
   given over Airmen being assigned from the CONUS.
A4.2. COT Consideration.
   A4.2.1. To receive consideration for a COT, Airmen must be eligible for PCS to include
   having at least 12 months PCS retainability from current DEROS, and meet COT eligibility
   requirements, for example, Table 2.6.
   A4.2.2. Officers. Officers volunteer for a COT using the ADP.
   A4.2.3. Enlisted Airmen volunteer for a COT by updating OS preferences in the vMPF. To
   ensure these are viable COT preferences, the OS EQUAL should be used.
A4.3. COT Selection Priorities/Procedures and Retainability Requirements.
   A4.3.1. COT volunteers receive assignment consideration according to the priorities in
   Table 3.1 and Table 3.2. Intratheater COTs are more economical than intertheater and
   receive consideration ahead of intertheater COTs regardless of the order or preference.
   A4.3.2. Enlisted Volunteers for COT receive consideration for requirements (reporting)
   during their DEROS month plus the following two months (for example, a COT volunteer
   with a June DEROS will receive consideration for requirements with reporting during June,
   July, or August). Airmen with an indefinite DEROS receive continuous consideration for
   COT provided their DEROS remains indefinite, they maintain OS preferences in the PDS,
   they remain eligible for PCS, and they are not within eight months of their DOS. Once an
   Airman is within eight months of DOS, the DEROS is automatically established to equal the
   DOS and COT consideration stops.
 278                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       A4.3.2.1. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS selected for a COT will not depart before
       completing the full current tour, plus any previously approved DEROS extensions.
       A4.3.2.2. Airmen are considered for COT in their CAFSC. Airmen may request
       consideration in an additionally awarded AFSC by message to the assignment OPR..
       Such a request must be submitted prior to ASD and the needs of the AF determine if
       selection is approved in an additional AFSC. Airmen possessing an OS imbalance AFSC
       will normally be considered only in that AFSC. However, if a COT cannot be approved
       in the imbalance AFSC, Airmen may be considered in an additional AFSC. The
       assignment OPR has final approval/ disapproval authority.
       A4.3.2.3. Airmen notified of COT approval have 30 calendar days from notification in
       which to take one of the following actions as outlined in paragraph 2.29: obtain the full
       required retainability for the OS unaccompanied tour; decline in writing (AF Form 964)
       to obtain the additional COT retainability or; request a delay in obtaining the retainability
       from the MPS Commander. Delays can only be considered for the reasons provided in
       Table 2.7.
A4.4. Release From/Cancellation of an Approved COT.
   A4.4.1. The requirement to request concurrent travel (CCTVL) still exists when a COT
   assignment is to an OS location where CCTVL is not automatic. If for some reason CCTVL
   cannot be approved for a COT from one accompanied long tour to another, the MPS
   reclamas the assignment upon receiving the denial of CCTVL.
   A4.4.2. Officers. See paragraph 2.12.
   A4.4.3. Enlisted. Airmen may submit a request for release from a COT based on a change
   of volunteer status for Best Interest of the Air Force or hardship reasons only (this does not
   delay the requirement for Airmen to obtain COT retainability). See paragraph 2.12. In
   these requests the MPS uses PDS to reclama the COT assignment. A reclama request made
   within 150 days of the RNLTD must be sent by e-mail message to the assignment OPR and
   must include full justification for the request. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-
   case basis.
A4.5. COT Allowances (see the JFTR, chapter 7, and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave
Program).
   A4.5.1. Airmen who will serve a COT, and in certain circumstances their command
   sponsored dependents, may be entitled to COT travel and transportation allowances as
   provided in the JFTR, paragraph U7200. In no instance can these allowances be used prior to
   completion of the Airman’s current tour.
   A4.5.2. Leave taken in conjunction with COT travel and transportation allowance is
   chargeable leave.
A4.6. IPCOT General Information.
   A4.6.1. The objective of the IPCOT program is the same as for COT (see paragraph A4.1.1
   above).
   A4.6.2. The IPCOT tour length must be equal to or greater than the tour length currently
   being served. For example, an Airman serving a 36 month accompanied tour may not serve
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               279


   a 24 month (unaccompanied) IPCOT. EXCEPTIONS: An Airman serving an accompanied
   tour who has a change in dependent status and is no longer accompanied by dependents may
   request an unaccompanied IPCOT. In addition, Airmen may request a standard tour length
   IPCOT if currently serving the extended long tour and single officers with no dependents
   may request a standard unaccompanied tour length IPCOT if serving the accompanied
   equivalent tour length.
   A4.6.3. Airmen serving the unaccompanied tour at a location where an accompanied tour is
   authorized may serve an accompanied IPCOT, if desired, provided they have, or are able to
   obtain, retainability to serve the full accompanied tour (plus, for enlisted, 12 additional
   months if selected as an extended long tour volunteer). Airmen must understand that this
   change of tour is effective on completion of the current unaccompanied tour, and any
   previously approved DEROS extension. The use of allowances associated with the
   accompanied IPCOT (transportation of dependents, shipment of HHG, etc.) is not authorized
   until completion of the full unaccompanied tour, plus any extensions.
   A4.6.4. For Airmen with an established DEROS, the IPCOT is effective on completion of
   the current tour, and any previously approved DEROS extension. The IPCOT DEROS is
   computed by adding the full length of the tour the Airman elects to the current DEROS. For
   Airmen with an indefinite DEROS, the IPCOT DEROS is effective upon completion of
   either the initial full prescribed tour, plus any previously approved DEROS extensions, or
   upon approval by the HQ AFPC assignment OPR if the original tour, plus extensions, has
   been completed.
   A4.6.5. The Airman’s ODSD and STRD (if applicable) will be updated after completion of
   the original tour, plus any approved DEROS extension. DAS will not change.
   A4.6.6. For IPCOT, no priority travel of dependents or guarantee of government quarters is
   given over members being assigned from the CONUS.
   A4.6.7. IPCOT approval is based on manning by location, not unit, so the possibility exists
   that the Airman may be reassigned to another unit or command at the same OS location.
A4.7. IPCOT Consideration.
   A4.7.1. To receive consideration for an IPCOT, Airmen must be eligible for PCS to include
   having at least 12 months PCS retainability from current DEROS, and meet IPCOT
   eligibility requirements, for example, Table 2.6.
   A4.7.2. Officers volunteer for an IPCOT using the VML reclama process through their
   commander.
   A4.7.3. Enlisted Airmen with an established DEROS, or those assigned to long tour
   locations in Alaska and Hawaii, request an IPCOT at the time of DEROS forecasting by
   using the DEROS Option RIP. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS may request an IPCOT at
   any time through use of PC III at the MPS.
   A4.7.4. The unit commander must certify Airman’s eligibility, including quality control, and
   recommend approval or disapproval. The unit commander is the final approval/disapproval
   authority.
A4.8. IPCOT Selection Priorities/Procedures and Retainability Requirements.
 280                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A4.8.1. An IPCOT preference is considered ahead of all COT preferences.
   A4.8.2. Airmen are considered for IPCOT in their CAFSC. Airmen may request
   consideration in an additionally awarded AFSC by message to the assignment OPR. The
   needs of the AF determine if selection is approved in an additional AFSC. Airmen
   possessing an OS imbalance AFSC will normally be considered only in that AFSC.
   However, if an IPCOT cannot be approved in the imbalance AFSC, Airmen may be
   considered in an additional AFSC. The assignment OPR has final approval/disapproval
   authority.
   A4.8.3. Airmen notified of IPCOT approval have 30 calendar days from notification in
   which to take one of the following actions: obtain the full required retainability; decline to
   obtain the additional IPCOT retainability (MPS’ only need to reclama the IPCOT, do not
   have the Airman complete an AF Form 964), or request a delay in obtaining the retainability
   from the MPS Commander. Delays can only be considered for the reasons provided in Table
   2.7.
A4.9. Release From, Cancellation of, or Curtailment of an Approved IPCOT.
   A4.9.1. Officers. See paragraph 2.12. In limited cases, if a replacement is available who
   can meet the same reporting date, an IPCOT may be canceled by the assignment OPR
   provided the officer has not entered it.
   A4.9.2. Enlisted. Airmen may request release from an IPCOT provided they have not
   entered into it. The new DEROS will be established as either the original DEROS or 10
   months from the date of cancellation, whichever is greater, unless manning supports an
   earlier DEROS if the cancellation request is approved. An Airman must complete at least the
   initial full prescribed tour, plus any previously approved DEROS extension. If an Airman
   fails to obtain the required retainability for the IPCOT within 30 calendar days from approval
   notification, reclama the assignment but do not have the Airman complete a PCS declination
   statement (AF Form 964).
   A4.9.3. While every effort is made to honor the full length of an approved IPCOT, the MPS
   must advise Airmen that curtailment and reassignment prior to the IPCOT DEROS may
   become necessary due to loss of authorizations, base or unit closure, promotion (only to
   grades of colonel or CMSgt), and so on.
A4.10. IPCOT Allowances (see the JFTR, chapter 7, and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave
Program).
   A4.10.1. Airmen who will serve an IPCOT, and in certain circumstances their command
   sponsored dependents, may be entitled to travel and transportation allowances as provided in
   the JFTR, paragraph U7200. In no instance can these allowances be used prior to completion
   of the Airman’s current tour.
   A4.10.2. Leave taken in conjunction with IPCOT travel and transportation allowance is
   chargeable leave.
A4.11. Involuntary COT (ICOT). Selection of Airmen for ICOTs may be directed by the
assignment OPR, with advance approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPP for lieutenant colonels and below
and all Airmen, or AF/DPO for colonels, including selectees, when necessary to satisfy OS
requirements. ICOTs will only be used after less objectionable alternatives have been exhausted.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               281


Selection for ICOT is accomplished according to the selection order prescribed in Table 3.1 and
Table 3.2.

       HOME-BASING (HB) AND FOLLOW-ON (FO) ASSIGNMENT PROGRAMS

A5.1. Purpose of the HB Program (see paragraph A5.6 for the FO program). The purpose of
the HB program is to reduce PCS costs and increase family stability. It does so by providing
Airmen who meet program criteria and agree to certain conditions an assignment back to the
same CONUS location or long tour location in Alaska or Hawaii from which he or she departs.
A5.2. HB Program Criteria. To be eligible for the HB program, officers must be in the grade of
Lt Col or below and Airmen in any grade must meet the program criteria in this paragraph and
agree to the conditions outlined in paragraph A5.3 and in Figure A5.1. To apply for a HB
assignment, Airmen must:
   A5.2.1. Have been selected for or elected to serve the OS unaccompanied short tour of 15
   months or less, and
   A5.2.2. Not be currently serving an OS tour (unless at a long tour location in Alaska or
   Hawaii) (see paragraph A5.3.3), and
   A5.2.3. Have or be eligible to obtain the PCS retainability for the HB assignment required
   by Table 2.5. Retainability for approved HB assignments is obtained during normal OS
   returnee counseling. (NOTE: As an exception for only a CONUS HB assignment, Airmen
   may apply provided they can obtain at least 7 months retainability upon completion of the
   OS tour (see Table 2.5, notes 5 and 6). For HB requests for long tour locations in Alaska or
   Hawaii Airmen must be able to obtain 36 months retainability in order to serve the full
   prescribed OS tour.), and
   A5.2.4. Not be en route to their first permanent duty station, and
   A5.2.5. Not apply for a Designated Location Move (DLM), and
   A5.2.6. Submit their HB application via the self service application on vMPF not later than
   150 days prior to Projected Departure Date (PDD). If assignment notification is less than
   150 days prior to the PDD, Airmen must make an election within 15 days of assignment
   notification.An Airman unable to submit an application not later than 150 days prior to PDD
   due to mission reasons or emergency leave only (this does not include those that have been
   notified of an assignment with less than 150 days prior to the PDD) may apply immediately
   upon return with justification and commander’s concurrence. Late requests based on reasons
   other than these are not accepted. AFPC considers HB assignments once a month,
   approximately 120 days prior to PDD.
A5.3. HB Restrictions/Limitations.
   A5.3.1. In exchange for advance assignment consideration, Airmen participating in the HB
   program must agree not to use their allowances to relocate their dependents to a designated
   place, such as DLA, or ship and/or store HHG at government expense. Any claim against the
   government for the relocation of dependents, or shipment or storage of HHG will result in
   cancellation of the HB assignment (see paragraph 2.6). However, participating in the HB
   program does not prohibit the Airman from taking any of these actions at his or her own
   expense if so desired. Airmen who want to participate in the HB program must agree to
   these criteria EXCEPT:
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  283


     A5.3.1.1. When the Airman is single, a single Airman parent, or is part of a military
     couple who will serve concurrent and separate unaccompanied short tours. These
     Airmen may store HHG at government expense by the most cost effective means (as
     determined by local TMO). However, any relocation of dependents to a designated
     location must be done at personal expense.
     A5.3.1.2. Airmen denied continued occupancy of government-owned or controlled
     quarters may move their dependents and HHG off base (out of government quarters) only
     within the same city, town, or metropolitan area as prescribed by the JFTR and still retain
     their HB assignment without requesting an exception.
  A5.3.2. When required to reside off-base, Airmen may ship HHG to the unaccompanied
  short tour location if otherwise eligible as determined by TMO, and will also receive single
  rate DLA to assist them with establishing a household. When HHG shipment is authorized,
  or they receive single rate DLA, the Airman may retain the HB assignment without a waiver.
  The losing MPS verifies the requirement to live off-base via AFPC Assignment web page
  (overseas furnishings and quarters availability listing) or by contacting HQ AFPC/DPSSMF.
  A5.3.3. In some instances, Airmen currently serving an accompanied OS tour other than in
  Alaska or Hawaii may request a HB assignment at an accompanied OS tour as an exception
  to policy (for example, when the Airman’s spouse is foreign born and the requested HB
  location is the spouse’s home country, for single Airmen with no dependents and no HHG
  which would require storage (since storage facilities are not available at OS locations), etc.).
  One of the main reasons such assignments are not permitted routinely is that Status of Forces
  Agreements (SOFAs) seldom cover dependents once the Airman departs the OS country on
  PCS. For example, Japan, strictly limits dependents residing without the military sponsor.
  Also, these dependents cannot retain command sponsorship and the Airman can only receive
  the OS station allowances upon special approval of a request according to the procedures in
  AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel. For these and related reasons, Airmen must
  demonstrate the capability to cope before submitting a request for an exception for
  processing to HQ AFPC/DPAPP and the assignment OPR.
     A5.3.3.1. Exception to Policy requests must answer the following questions:
    1. Is Airman married or single?

    2. If they have dependents, where are they located?

    3. If married, is spouse a foreign born citizen? If so, of what country does the spouse hold
    citizenship? As a point of interest, although the dependent may be eligible to proceed to
    the FO location, the dependent will not be command sponsored and housing may not be
    available.

    4. If married, is spouse a U.S. government employee with housing and SOFA entitlements
    in his/her own right?

    5. If married with dependents, will Airman request a Dependents Remaining Overseas
    (DRO) or the relocation of dependents to the OS follow-on location? The Airman should
    be counseled IAW AFI 36-3020, Table 3, Rule 2. A DRO application is not mandatory for
 284                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       Airmen; however, members must be advised of all available options. If Airman desires to
       relocate dependents to an OS FO, they must comply with requirements outlined in AFI 36-
       3020, Table 4, Rule 1 and be provided the appropriate entitlement fact sheet for
       noncommand-sponsored dependents. All dependents must be medically cleared for
       government-funded travel prior to the Airman’s departure. If dependent clearance is
       denied, immediately advise HQ AFPC/DPAA5 (enlisted) or DPAS, DPAM, DPAO
       (officer) via e-mail to ensure the OS FO is canceled. In the same e-mail, indicate Airman’s
       CONUS preferences for reconsideration of FO.

       6. If the Airman will not apply for a DRO or dependent travel to the FO location, where
       will the dependents reside?

       7. In addition, submit all pertinent information that supports the basis for the exception to
       policy request.
A5.4. HB Application Procedures.
   A5.4.1. The MPS counsels all Airmen selected for a dependent restricted OS tour and those
   who elect to serve a 15 month or less unaccompanied OS tour on the HB program during the
   initial PCS relocation briefing. These Airmen must either apply or decline to apply for a HB
   assignment no later 150 days prior to the PDD. If notification is less than 150 days prior to
   the PDD, Airmen must make an election within 15 days of assignment notification. (NOTE:
   For those not able to access the vMPF, see Figure A5.1) Airmen apply for a HB by using the
   self service application available through the vMPF. Airmen must read this application
   closely as it thoroughly explains conditions of the HB assignment and that to which they
   must agree.
   A5.4.2. The MPF/E Career Development Element must suspense all HB requests to ensure a
   reply is received from HQ AFPC. If a final decision on a HB request has not been received
   within 75 days of the Airman’s PDD, the MPS should immediately contact the assignment
   OPR.
   A5.4.3. Airmen receive HB consideration only once, and a HB application takes priority
   over a FO application and is considered first.
A5.5. HB General Information.
   A5.5.1. Allowances. The MPS must advise Airmen that a HB application cannot be used to
   deny an Airman PCS allowances. The application is a voluntary agreement by the Airman
   not to use PCS allowances in exchange for advance assignment consideration. If, after
   approval of a HB assignment, the Airman must use a PCS allowance he or she originally
   agreed not to use, that allowance cannot be denied; however the HB assignment may be
   canceled.
        A5.5.1.1. Some Airmen have personal requirements which may preclude them from
        entering into an agreement not to use PCS allowances. If participating in the HB
        program would cause a financial or personal hardship, Airmen are encouraged to use
        their PCS allowances and not participate in this program. Exceptions to allow Airmen to
        use their allowances and receive advance assignment consideration will not be
        considered. Such exceptions to HB criteria would give a few Airmen an unfair advantage
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               285


     over others who abide by HB criteria. In addition, advance consideration for assignments
     also reduces the available assignments to other OS short tour returnees.
  A5.5.2. Military Couples. When an Airman is married to another military member and will
  serve an unaccompanied OS tour of 15 months or less, the Airman is considered for a return
  (join spouse) assignment to the location of the spouse, unless join spouse intent code ―H‖
  (join spouse not desired) is reflected in the PDS or the member requests FO consideration as
  outlined in paragraph A5.10.2.
  A5.5.3. Approved HB Assignment for any OS Long Tour Location. Airmen with approved
  OS HB assignments who desire to have dependents remain in the OS area must submit a
  Dependents Remain Overseas application IAW AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.
  A5.5.4. PCS Orders. The MPS will not release PCS orders without a final HQ AFPC
  decision on a HB application. PCS orders must reflect the appropriate HB information
  according to AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures, Attachment 5, or per
  paragraph A5.5.5. In addition, the proper assignment remark must be included in item 24 of
  the PCS order to ensure the FSO and TMO take actions consistent with the Airman’s HB
  agreement or advise the MPS to cancel.
  A5.5.5. Notification of Approval or Disapproval of HB Applications. The MPS receives the
  HQ AFPC decision on a HB application. If the Airman declines participation in the HB/FO
  program, include the following statement in item 24 of the Airman’s PCS orders: ―I do not
  desire to apply for a HB/FO assignment and understand I will not have another opportunity
  to apply at a later time.‖
  A5.5.6. Voluntary Cancellation of a HB Assignment. A HB assignment is considered to be
  voluntarily canceled by the member when:
     A5.5.6.1. An Airman applies for a four month or longer extension of their OS tour. The
     MPS updates the extension request and in the transaction remarks indicates the Airman
     has a HB assignment which must be canceled to accept the extension. If the extension
     request is disapproved, the HB assignment remains firm. A request for tour extensions of
     3 month or less must indicate in the transaction remarks the Airman has a HB assignment
     which requires an adjustment to the RNLTD per paragraph 2.27. Also, Airmen who
     extend their short OS tour may require additional retainability for the HB assignment--
     verification of retainability is required.
     A5.5.6.2. An Airman applies for and receives approval of a request for Humanitarian or
     EFMP assignment.
     A5.5.6.3. For Airmen, requests for voluntary cancellation of HB assignment should be
     submitted IAW paragraph 2.12, not later than 150 days prior to Airman’s DEROS.
     Requests submitted within the 150 day time frame should include the humanitarian or
     hardship reason(s).
  A5.5.7. Involuntary Cancellation of a HB Assignment. Unlike a ―normal‖ return assignment
  from OS, a HB assignment is made 14 to 18 months before the reporting date. Although the
  intent is that once a HB assignment is provided it remain firm, individual qualifications and
  AF requirements must remain the primary determinants. When canceling a HB assignment
  becomes unavoidable (due to base closure, unit deactivation, etc.) the Airman is given
 286                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   priority consideration for other assignment preferences. In addition, there are other
   circumstances when involuntary cancellation of a HB assignment may also be appropriate.
   When circumstances arise which may warrant involuntary cancellation of a HB assignment,
   the MPS must immediately notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP and the assignment OPR by message.
   An assignment made under the HB program may be involuntarily canceled when:
       A5.5.7.1. An Airman relocates dependents and/or ships or stores HHG at government
       expense (for reasons other than being denied continued occupancy of government owned
       or controlled quarters), or
       A5.5.7.2. An Airman fails to comply with any of the provisions agreed to in the "Home-
       Basing and/or Follow-on Assignment Application."
A5.6. Purpose of the FO Program. The purpose of the FO program is to reduce PCS costs and
increase family stability. It does so by providing members who meet program criteria and agree
to certain conditions advance assignment consideration. Airmen may request consideration for
assignment to a preferred CONUS location, or an OS long tour location subject to the limitations
below.
   A5.6.1. If currently serving an accompanied OS tour and not currently assigned in Alaska or
   Hawaii, then Airmen may request OS FO consideration for long tour locations in Alaska or
   Hawaii ONLY.
   A5.6.2. If currently serving an accompanied OS tour and not currently assigned in Alaska or
   Hawaii, then Airmen may request OS FO consideration for long tour locations other than
   Alaska or Hawaii ONLY as an exception to policy as shown in paragraph A5.8.4.
A5.7. FO Program Criteria. To be eligible for the FO program, Airmen must meet the program
criteria in this paragraph and agree to the conditions outlined in paragraph A5.8 and in Figure
A5.1. To apply for a FO assignment, Airmen must:
   A5.7.1. Have been selected for or elected to serve the OS unaccompanied short tour of 15
   months or less (includes IPCOTs and COTs), and
   A5.7.2. Have or be eligible to obtain the FO PCS retainability required by Table 2.5 for the
   FO PCS. Retainability for an approved FO assignment must be obtained within 30 days of
   approval notification, and
   A5.7.3. Not be en route to their first permanent duty station as an accession, and
   A5.7.4. Not apply for a Designated Location Move (DLM), and
   A5.7.5. Submit their FO application via the self service application on vMPF not later than
   15 days after assignment notification. An Airman unable to submit an application in the
   specified time period, due to mission reasons or emergency leave only, may apply
   immediately upon return with justification and commander’s concurrence. Late requests
   based on reasons other than these are not accepted. AFPC considers FO assignments once a
   month, approximately 120 days prior to PDD.
A5.8. FO Restrictions/Limitations.
   A5.8.1. In exchange for advance assignment consideration, Airmen participating in the FO
   program must agree not to use their allowances to relocate their dependents and HHG to a
   place other than the FO location, (for a move to other than the FO location), or store HHG at
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                287


  government expense. Any claim against the government for the relocation of dependents or
  shipment of HHG to other than the FO location or, for storage of HHG, will result in
  cancellation of the FO assignment (see paragraph 2.6). However, participating in the FO
  program does not prohibit the member from taking any of these actions at his or her own
  expense if so desired. All members wanting to participate in the FO program must agree to
  these criteria EXCEPT:
     A5.8.1.1. When the member is single, a single member parent, or is part of a military
     couple who will serve concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tours. These
     members may store HHG at government expense by the most cost effective means (as
     determined by local TMO). However, any relocation of dependents to a designated
     location (other than the FO location) must be done at personal expense.
     A5.8.1.2. Airmen denied continued occupancy of government-owned or controlled
     quarters may move their dependents and HHG off base (out of government quarters) only
     within the same city, town, or metropolitan area as prescribed by the JFTR and still retain
     their FO assignment without requesting an exception.
  A5.8.2. Airmen should not ship HHG to the FO location at government expense when they
  do not intend to establish a household within the FO vicinity (daily commuting distance from
  FO base and household) since storage of HHG at government expense is not allowed under
  the FO program. By not establishing a household, storage of the HHG will be required, but
  is not authorized under the FO program. Doing so may result in cancellation of the FO
  assignment.
  A5.8.3. Airmen may ship HHG to the unaccompanied short tour location as shown in the Air
  Force Supplement to the JFTR, Volume 1, Attachment 2, Table 2.2, when required to reside
  off- base and when otherwise eligible as determined by TMO, along with receiving single
  rate DLA to assist with establishing a household. When HHG shipment is authorized or
  single rate DLA is received for this reason, the Airman may retain the FO assignment
  without a waiver. The losing MPS verifies the requirement to live off-base through the
  Overseas Furnishings and Quarters Availability Listing link on the AFPC Assignments web
  page, or by contacting HQ AFPC/DPSSMF.
  A5.8.4. Airmen currently serving an accompanied OS tour other than in Alaska or Hawaii
  may request a FO assignment to an accompanied OS tour (other than Alaska or Hawaii) as an
  exception to policy. For example, when the Airman’s spouse is foreign born and the
  requested FO location is the spouse’s home country. One of the main reasons such
  assignments are not permitted on a routine basis is Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA)
  seldom cover dependents once the member departs a foreign country on PCS. Similarly,
  SOFAs seldom cover dependents that arrive in a foreign country in advance of the Airman’s
  arrival in PCS status. Also, these dependents cannot obtain or retain command sponsorship,
  and the Airman can only receive the OS station allowances upon special approval of a
  request according to procedures in AFI 36- 3020, Family Member Travel. For these and
  related reasons, Airmen must acknowledge these circumstances and provide convincing
  evidence of their ability to cope in their request for an exception. The MPS will forward the
  request to HQ AFPC/ DPAPP for further consideration. Approval may require contact with
  the losing and/or gaining OS MAJCOM and, in turn, the countries involved to verify on a
  case-by-case basis the circumstances dependents might face.
 288                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


A5.9. FO Application Procedures.
   A5.9.1. The MPS counsels all Airmen selected for a dependent restricted OS tour and those
   who elect to serve a 15 month or less unaccompanied OS tour on the FO program during the
   initial PCS relocation briefing. These Airmen must either apply or decline to apply for a FO
   assignment via the self service application on vMPF no later than 150 days prior to their
   PDD. If assignment notification is less than 150 days prior to the PDD, Airmen must make
   an election within 15 days of assignment notification. (NOTE: For those not able to access
   the vMPF, see Figure A5.1) Airmen must read this application closely as it thoroughly
   explains conditions of the FO assignment and that to which they must agree.
   A5.9.2. The MPS Career Development Element must suspense all FO requests to ensure a
   reply is received from HQ AFPC. If a final decision on a FO request has not been received
   within 75 days of the Airman’s PDD, the MPS should immediately contact the assignment
   OPR.
   A5.9.3. Airmen receive FO consideration only once so it is in their best interest that they
   provide the maximum number of choices in priority sequence. Airmen may apply for up to 8
   CONUS locations (either bases, states, or locales) and up to 8 OS locations (bases or
   countries). If both CONUS and OS locations are indicated, OS preferences will be
   considered first. Remember that if an Airman applies for both HB and FO, the HB request is
   considered first. For Airmen of military couples, see paragraph A5.10.2 below.
A5.10. FO General Information.
   A5.10.1. Allowances. The MPS must advise Airmen that a FO application cannot be used to
   deny an Airman PCS allowances. The application is a voluntary agreement by the Airman
   not to use PCS allowances in exchange for advance assignment consideration. If, after
   approval of a FO assignment, the Airman must use a PCS allowance he or she originally
   agreed not to use, that allowance cannot be denied; however the FO assignment may be
   canceled.
       A5.10.1.1. Some Airmen have personal requirements which may preclude them from
       entering into an agreement not to use PCS allowances. If participating in the FO program
       would cause a financial or personal hardship, Airmen are encouraged to use their PCS
       allowances and not participate in this program. Exceptions to allow Airmen to use their
       allowances (other than for relocation to the FO location) and receive advance assignment
       consideration will not be considered. Such exceptions to FO criteria would give a few
       Airmen an unfair advantage over others who abide by FO criteria. In addition, advance
       consideration for assignments also reduces the available assignments to other OS short
       tour returnees.
   A5.10.2. Military Couples. When one member of a military couple is selected to serve a
   dependent restricted tour or elects to serve the unaccompanied OS tour of 15 months or less,
   that Airman is considered for a return (join spouse) assignment to the location of the spouse,
   unless join spouse intent code ―H‖ (join spouse not desired) is reflected in the PDS or one of
   the following applies:
       A5.10.2.1. If no requirement exists at the spouse’s location, the returning Airman’s FO
       preferences will be considered for both Airmen at that time. A requirement must exist for
       both Airmen.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             289


     A5.10.2.2. When both members of a military couple (with join spouse intent codes ―A‖
     or ―B‖) are selected to serve concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tours of 15
     months or less they may apply for FO assignments provided they each list the same
     preferences in the same order on their respective FO applications.
     A5.10.2.3. (Enlisted Only) Airmen selected for an OS assignment, including when a
     requirement exists at their current base upon completion of their unaccompanied OS short
     tour, may request follow-on consideration and join spouse assignment to another CONUS
     location if the spouse who remains at the current CONUS base will have 4 years TOS or
     more as of the DEROS (month/year) of the Airman returning from OS. The CONUS
     spouse’s join spouse intent code must be ―A‖ or ―B‖ and the PDS update must contain in
     the Remarks section: ―Follow-On and Join Spouse Request-4 Years TOS.‖
     A5.10.2.4. (Enlisted Only) . Airmen selected for an OS assignment, including when a
     requirement exists at their current location upon completion of their unaccompanied OS
     short tour, may request follow-on and join spouse assignment consideration to an OS
     location. The CONUS spouse’s join spouse intent code must be ―A‖ or ―B‖ and the PDS
     update application must contain in the Remarks section: ―Follow-On and OS Join Spouse
     Request.‖
  A5.10.3. Approved FO Assignment to any OS Location. Airmen with approved OS FO
  assignments who elect to have dependents remain in the OS area or relocate to the FO
  assignment location must comply with the requirements outlined in AFI 36-3020, Family
  Member Travel. All dependents must be medically cleared for government funded travel
  prior to the Airman’s departure to the unaccompanied short tour location. In addition,
  Airmen who desire to relocate dependents and/or ship HHG to an OS FO location must be
  counseled in detail by the MPS and TMO on how the SOFA may impact unaccompanied
  dependents and HHG in the OS area.
  A5.10.4. PCS Orders. The MPS will not release PCS orders without a final HQ AFPC
  decision on a FO application. PCS orders must reflect the appropriate FO information
  according to AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures, Attachment 5, or per
  paragraph A5.10.5. In addition, the proper assignment remark must be included in item 24
  of the PCS order to ensure the FSO and TMO take actions consistent with the FO agreement
  or advise the MPS to cancel.
  A5.10.5. Notification of Approval or Disapproval of FO Applications. The MPS receives
  the HQ AFPC decision on a FO application. If the Airman declines participation in the FO
  program, include the following statement in item 24 of the Airman’s PCS orders: ―I do not
  desire to apply for a HB/FO assignment and understand I will not have another opportunity
  to apply at a later time.‖
  A5.10.6. Voluntary Cancellation of a FO Assignment. A FO assignment is considered to be
  voluntarily canceled by the Airman when:
     A5.10.6.1. An Airman applies for a four month or longer extension of their OS tour. The
     MPS updates the extension request and in the transaction remarks indicates the member
     has a FO assignment which must be canceled to accept the extension. If the extension
     request is disapproved, the FO assignment remains firm. A request for tour extensions of
     3 months or less must indicate in the transaction remarks the Airman has a FO
290                                                     AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      assignment which requires an adjustment to the RNLTD per paragraph 2.27. Also,
      Airmen who extend their short OS tour may require additional retainability for the FO
      assignment--verification of retainability is required per paragraph 2.29.
      A5.10.6.2. An Airman applies for and receives approval of a request for Humanitarian or
      EFMP assignment.
  A5.10.7. Involuntary Cancellation of a FO Assignment. Unlike a ―normal‖ assignment from
  OS, a FO assignment is made 14 to 18 months before the reporting date. Although the intent
  is that once a FO assignment is provided it remain firm, individual qualifications and AF
  requirements must remain the primary determinants. When canceling a FO assignment
  becomes unavoidable (due to base closure, unit deactivation, etc.) the Airman is given
  priority consideration for other assignment preferences. In addition, there are other
  circumstances when involuntary cancellation of a FO assignment may also be appropriate.
  When circumstances arise which may warrant involuntary cancellation of a FO assignment,
  the MPS must immediately notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP and the assignment OPR by message,
  with an information copy to the losing and gaining MPS’. An assignment made under the
  FO program may be involuntarily canceled when:
      A5.10.7.1. An Airman relocates dependents and/or ships HHG to a location other than
      the FO at government expense, receives DLA for movement of dependents to a location

MEMORANDUM FOR MSS/(OFFICE SYMBOL)

FROM: (Name and functional address symbol)

SUBJECT: FOUO - Home-Basing and/or Follow-on Assignment Application

1. I (grade, name,SSN, AFSC), have an assignment to (location, country) where the
unaccompanied tour is 15 months or less and I have elected to serve the unaccompanied tour
length at that location.

2. I am applying for a (home-basing only; follow-on only; both home-basing and follow-on)
assignment to (list up to eight CONUS bases, regions, locales, states, and/or eight overseas
bases and/or countries in priority sequence). I understand if I request both home-basing and
follow-on assignment consideration I will be considered first for home-basing.

3. I understand that based on my unaccompanied short tour assignment, I have an allowance to
move my dependents and household good (HHG) at government expense; however, as a
consideration of receiving a home-basing or follow-on assignment, I agree not to use these
allowances except as outlined below.

4. I am aware that this is the only application I can submit for home-basing and/or follow-on
assignment consideration and I must return the application within 15 days of my initial PCS
relocation interview or notification of IPCOT/COT approval. For short notice assignments, the
application must be returned within 3 days of initial relocation interview.

5. (For Home-Basing Only) If my request for home-basing is approved, I understand and
agree that I may:

a. Not move my dependents at government expense, but I may move them at personal expense,
and

b. Not ship HHG at government expense (unless I am required to live off base at the projected
assignment location), but I may ship HHG at personal expense, and

c. Not store HHG in nontemporary storage at government expense (NOTE: See paragraph 7e
below for an exception for single members, single member parents and military couples), but I
may store them at personal expense during my unaccompanied OS short tour assignment, and

d. Ship my privately owned vehicle at government expense to the OS location if otherwise
eligible.

6. (For Follow-On Only) If my request for follow-on assignment is approved, I understand
292                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


and agree that I may:

a. Not move my dependents at government expense except to the follow-on location, but I may
move them to any desired location at personal expense.

b. Not claim Dislocation Allowance (DLA) unless I’m moving my dependents to the follow-on
location.

c. Not ship HHG at government expense to other than the follow-on location (and only if I or
my agent will accept delivery of my HHG upon their arrival at the follow-on location) (unless I
am required to live off base at my projected assignment location), but I may ship HHG to any
desired location at personal expense, and

d. Not store HHG in nontemporary storage at government expense (NOTE: See paragraph 7e
for an exception of single members, single member parents, and military couples), but I may
store them at personal expense during my unaccompanied OS short tour assignment, and

e. Ship my privately owned vehicle at government expense to the OS location if otherwise
eligible.

7. (For Both Home-Basing and Follow-on) I understand that:

a. If denied continued occupancy of government-owned or controlled quarters my dependents
and HHG may be moved at government expense only within the same city, town, or
metropolitan area as prescribed by the JFTR, Volume 1, paragraph U5355-C

b. If I take any action contrary to the above agreements without prior HQ AFPC/DPAPPP
approval of a request for exception, my home-basing or follow-on assignment will be canceled.

c. My home-basing or follow-on assignment is subject to cancellation due to unavoidable
changes in Air Force requirements (i.e., base closure, change in mission or weapons system,
etc.) or individual qualifications (i.e., loss of AFSC, promotion, etc.)

d. My home-basing or follow-on assignment is subject to cancellation if I apply for a four
month or longer extension of my OS tour.

e. As an exception, if I am a single member, a single member parent, or part of a military
couple who will serve a concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tour, I can store HHG at
government expense by the most cost effective means (as determined by the local TMO).

8. (For AF join spouse couples) I have been counseled on the rules concerning home-basing
and follow-on assignments and join spouse eligibility (Attachment 8). I understand that since
only one of us will be serving an unaccompanied OS short tour, the first consideration will be a
return assignment to my spouse’s location unless join spouse intent code is ―H‖. I further
understand that if no requirement exists at my spouse’s location, my follow-on preferences will
be considered and my spouse may, if otherwise eligible, apply for join souse assignment to my
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 293


follow-on location.

(Use the following when both members of an AF couple will serve concurrent but separate
OS short tours) I understand I am eligible for a follow-on assignment and confirm my
preferences are the same, and are listed in the same order as my spouse’s. I understand that if I
request different locations from my spouse I am considered to be voluntarily creating a family
separation and a subsequent join spouse assignment or change of assignment (once selected for
a follow-on) to join spouse is not authorized.

Figure A5.2. HB/FO Conditions Fact Sheet.

HB/FO Conditions Fact Sheet

You have recently been selected for a dependent restricted tour or have elected to serve an
unaccompanied short tour of 15 months or less. Because of your PCS selection, you are
authorized certain allowances associated with the PCS. According to the Joint Federal Travel
Regulations, all Airmen selected for a dependent restricted tour or an unaccompanied short tour
are authorized to relocate their dependents, receive Dislocation Allowance (DLA), and ship
and/or store HHG to any place in the CONUS as designated by the Airman. Airmen may also
relocate dependents, and ship and/or store HHG if the designated location is in Alaska, Hawaii,
Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States. However, since these locations
are considered OS by AF definition, Airmen must apply for dependent travel IAW AFI 36-
3020, Family Member Travel. As a note of interest, dependents must be medically cleared for
OS travel prior to your departure to the unaccompanied short tour location. Applications for
dependent travel must be processed through your MPS to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for
approval/disapproval.

Because of the type of OS tour you will serve, you are eligible to apply for a HB assignment, a
FO assignment, or both. If you apply for a HB assignment you are asking to be reassigned back
to your current base. If you apply for a FO assignment, you are asking for an advance
assignment to a desired location (either in the CONUS or OS) prior to your departure to the
short tour location. If you apply for both types of assignment, HB consideration takes priority
and will be considered first.

By electing to participate in the HB/FO program you must agree not to use your PCS
allowances to relocate dependents, receive DLA for your family if moved to a location at your
expense (other than the FO location), and ship and/or store HHG at government expense. Since
the HB and FO programs exist to reduce PCS costs and increase family stability, every effort
will be made to provide you with an advance assignment (consistent with the best interests of
the AF) in exchange for your agreement not to use your PCS allowances. Airmen may take any
of the actions concerning movement of dependents/HHG at personal expense without risking
cancellation of an approved HB or FO assignment. (EXCEPTION: Single Airmen, single
Airmen parents, and members of a military couple who will serve concurrent but separate
unaccompanied short tours may store HHG at government expense by the most cost effective
means [as determined by local TMO]).

Figure A5.1. in AFI 36-2110, Assignments, "Home-Basing and/or Follow-on Assignment
Application," clearly outlines your agreement with the AF. Make sure you read the application
carefully and understand your agreement with the AF. If you don't understand something, ask
your MPS for clarification.

If you receive an approved FO assignment you may move your dependents and HHG to the FO
location at government expense, as well as receive DLA for this move. However, if you move
your dependents to a location other than the FO location you must do so and store all HHG at
your own expense, and not receive DLA as explained above. We realize relocating your
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   295




dependents at your own expense to a location other than the FO may be cost prohibitive. If you
feel this will cause you a financial or personal hardship we encourage you to use your
allowances as outlined in the first paragraph rather than participate in the FO program.

If you do move your dependents and HHG to a location other than the FO at your own expense
while you serve the unaccompanied OS short tour, you may still be authorized some
reimbursement upon your return. The amount will depend on the location where you relocated
your dependents in relation to the FO location. According to the JFTR, reimbursement for
travel and transportation allowances will not exceed the amount you were authorized from the
old CONUS PDS to the new PDS. However, the amount of reimbursement you receive may be
less if the dependent's actual physical location is closer to the FO location than it would have
been from the old CONUS PDS. The following scenarios should help clarify this limitation.

SCENARIO 1: Provides an example of when an Airman is eligible for reimbursement
equaling but not exceeding the amount from the old CONUS PDS to the new PDS.

You are currently stationed at Randolph AFB, TX with an assignment to Korea and a FO
assignment to McGuire AFB, NJ. While you serve your OS short tour you’ve decided to
relocate your dependents and HHG at your own expense to Mom and Dad's home town of
Seattle, WA. You depart for Korea. You return twelve months later and go to Seattle to pick
up your family. You now relocate your family from Seattle to McGuire AFB. Even though the
distance from Seattle to McGuire AFB is greater than that from Randolph AFB to McGuire
AFB, you are only eligible for reimbursement for the amount creditable for the distance from
Randolph AFB (old PDS) to McGuire AFB (new PDS).

SCENARIO 2: Provides an example of when an Airman’s reimbursement will be less than that
from the old CONUS PDS.

You are currently stationed at Randolph AFB, TX with an assignment to Korea and a FO
assignment to McGuire AFB, NJ. While you serve your OS short tour you’ve decided to
relocate your dependents and HHG at your own expense to Mom and Dad's home town in
Pennsylvania. You depart for Korea. You return twelve months later and go to Pennsylvania to
pick up your family. You now relocate your family from Pennsylvania to McGuire AFB.
Based on these circumstances, the government will reimburse you only for the actual dependent
travel from Pennsylvania to McGuire AFB. You cannot claim reimbursement for the travel
done at personal expense from Randolph AFB to Pennsylvania.

Please keep in mind these scenarios only illustrate two different situations involving the
movement of dependents and HHG at personal expense, and the reimbursement you may be
authorized when you complete your FO assignment travel. If neither scenario fits your
situation, contact the MPS Career Development Element for additional counseling prior to
applying for a HB or FO assignment. It is essential you understand all conditions associated
with this program.

                                         Attachment 6
       HOSTILE FIRE AND IMMINENT DANGER AREA REASSIGNMENT OR
                             DEFERMENT

A6.1. Purpose. There are two separate assignment provisions addressed below.
   A6.1.1. One is to allow one or more immediate family members to request reassignment
   from, or deferment from assignment to, a hostile fire or imminent danger area when that
   family has suffered a casualty (see paragraph A6.2.7 below) incident to duty in a currently
   designated hostile fire or imminent danger area.
   A6.1.2. The other policy applies to assignment of members hospitalized because of hostile
   fire action.
A6.2. General Provisions for Immediate Family Members.
   A6.2.1. Airmen must be at least 18 years of age to serve in a hostile fire or imminent danger
   area.
   A6.2.2. Hostile fire and imminent danger areas are designated by geographical area with a
   beginning date and a termination date in the DOD Pay and Entitlements Manual.
   A6.2.3. Assignment to duty in a designated hostile fire or imminent danger area is shared as
   equitably as practical by all similarly qualified Airmen, except as indicated herein or in
   Attachment 9, Aircrew Family Member Assignment and Attachment 11, Sole Surviving
   Son or Daughter. Assignment of military couples, including assignment at the same time, to
   the same or different hostile fire or imminent danger areas is not precluded.
   A6.2.4. Assignment includes TDY or PCS.
   A6.2.5. Only the Airman may initiate a request for deferment or reassignment. A request
   may not be initiated by someone on behalf of an Airman.
   A6.2.6. When a military member is killed or dies, is in a captured or missing status or has
   been determined by the Veterans Administration (VA) or a military Service to be 100 percent
   physically or mentally disabled as a result of an act committed by an individual, group, or
   country hostile to the United States or in direct support of operations against such a hostile
   force while serving in a currently designated hostile fire or imminent danger area, other
   members of the same immediate family (as defined below) will be exempt, upon request,
   from serving in the same or any currently designated hostile fire or imminent danger area, or
   if they are already serving in such an area, they will be reassigned from that area. The intent
   is when a family has suffered a casualty incident to service in a currently designated hostile
   fire or imminent danger area, to not expose the remaining immediate family members to
   further casualties in the same or any other currently designated hostile fire or imminent
   danger area. However, when an area in which a family member became a casualty ceases to
   be designated as a hostile fire or imminent danger area, then members of that family may
   again be assigned to that location. It is not a requirement for the member who was a casualty
   to be living or to still be on active duty, as long as the area in which the member became a
   casualty is still currently designated.
   A6.2.7. For this policy, an Airman’s family members are:
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                      297


       A6.2.7.1. Parents. This includes stepparents, parents by adoption, and those who stood
       in the place of a parent for at least 5 years immediately preceding the initial entry on
       active duty of the member who died, is missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled.
       A6.2.7.2. Brothers and sisters. This includes stepbrothers and stepsisters, brothers or
       sisters by adoption, or half brothers or half sisters in the household at the time the
       member who died, is missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled initially entered active
       duty.
       A6.2.7.3. Spouse.
       A6.2.7.4. Natural child.
       A6.2.7.5. Legally adopted child.
       A6.2.7.6. Stepchild, if the child was a member of the household at the time the member
       or former member died, was missing or captured, or was determined to be 100 percent
       disabled.
       A6.2.7.7. An illegitimate child to whose support a male member or former member has
       been ordered judicially to contribute, or of whom he has been decreed judicially to be the
       father, or of whom he has acknowledged in writing under oath that he is the father.
       A6.2.7.8. A person for whom the Airman stood in place of a parent for at least 5 years
       immediately preceding the date on which the member or former member died, was
       missing or captured, or determined to be 100 percent disabled.
A6.3. Application Procedures. Applications should be submitted using the format shown in
Figure A6.1 within 15 calendar days of notification of selection for PCS or TDY, or as soon
after becoming eligible as practical. Airmen will submit requests to their unit commander.
A6.4. Commander Actions. Commanders will assist Airmen with their requests as necessary.
Commanders may disapprove requests when they do not meet the criteria. When a commander
recommends approval and while a request is pending, the commander will take immediate action
to locally assign the Airman to other than hazardous duty. If this is not possible, a commander
may temporarily assign (TDY) an Airman out of the designated area. When commanders
recommend approval, they will forward requests to the Airman’s servicing MPS.
A6.5. MPS Actions. MPS’ will provide guidance to Airmen on their request and assist
commanders as needed. Upon receipt from a commander of a request recommended for
approval, the MPS will review and forward to the HQ AFPC/DPAPP. For approved requests,
the MPS will update assignment limitation code (ALC) "6," Family Member Restriction (Hostile
Fire Area) per Table 2.2.
A6.6. Exceptions. MPS’ may submit exception to policy requests they recommend be approved
to HQ AFPC/DPAPP. HQ AFPC may disapprove requests for exception or submit those which
merit approval through channels to DOD for final approval/disapproval.
A6.7. General Provisions for Airmen Hospitalized. Airmen who have been hospitalized for 30
or more calendar days because of a specific hostile fire action resulting from combat service will
not be returned to the hostile fire area during the same tour in which they were wounded. Airmen
reassigned under this provision will be eligible for subsequent hostile fire tours. Airmen may
return voluntarily to a hostile fire area earlier if they are medically qualified. This provision does

not apply to Airmen hospitalized for injury, accident, or illness not attributable to hostile fire
action. Self-inflicted wounds and other non-combat causes are specifically excluded.

    HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS ASSIGNMENT DEFERMENT (HSSAD) PROGRAM

A7.1. General Policy. The intent of the HSSAD program is to decrease turbulence and increase
stability for military families with dependent children entering their senior year of high school.
HSSAD policy applies to officers (LtCol and below) and enlisted (SMSgt and below).
A7.2. General Procedures.
   A7.2.1. HSSAD requests are considered on a case-by-case basis with the goal of approving
   as many requests as possible while meeting mission needs.
   A7.2.2. Consecutive deferments may be requested.
   A7.2.3. Airmen approved for a HSSAD are coded in MilPDS with Assignment Availability
   Code (AAC) 85. The availability date is the first day of the second month after the
   dependent’s high school senior graduation date or Airman’s DEROS. For example, if the
   graduation date is 31 May the availability date is 1 Jul or the DEROS date.
   A7.2.4. The appropriate AFPC assignment officer or NCO approves HSSAD requests. The
   AFPC assignment division chief disapproves HSSAD requests that cannot be supported due
   to mission needs.
   A7.2.5. Each Airman of a military couple may apply for a HSSAD if each meets the
   eligibility criteria, their join-spouse intent code is ―A‖ or ―B,‖ and they apply concurrently.
   A7.2.6. Enlisted Airmen selected as the most eligible non-volunteer for a dependent-
   restricted short tour are ineligible to apply for a HSSAD. Dependent restricted, ―NA/12,‖
   includes Korea when not assigned to a Command Sponsorship List (CSPL) or
   unaccompanied key billet position (see AFI 36-2110, paragraph 3.2.11). Airmen selected
   for a ―NA/12‖ tour must proceed on assignment, but may request to return to the same duty
   station IAW AFI 36-2110, Attachment 5, Home-Basing Assignment Program.
   A7.2.7. Because of differences in the officer and enlisted assignment systems, differing
   HSSAD procedures are detailed below:
A7.3 Officer (Lt Col and Below).
   A7.3.1. Eligibility Criteria and Documentation:
       A7.3.1.1. The dependent child must be enrolled in DEERS and residing with the sponsor
       requesting the deferment (must be verified by the MPS Customer Service Element).
       A7.3.1.2. The officer must provide a memo from the dependent’s high school counselor
       confirming the dependent’s current school grade and projected senior year graduation
       date.
       A7.3.1.3. The officer must complete and submit the memo at Figure A7.1. ―Request for
       HSSAD.‖
   A7.3.2. Application Timelines.
       A7.3.2.1. CONUS applicants. May apply for a HSSAD before or after being placed on
       the Vulnerable Movers List (VML). Officers are eligible for the program if they apply
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               301


       NET 1 Oct of the dependent’s high school junior year and NLT 1 July between the
       dependent’s high school junior and senior years.
A7.3.2.2. Overseas (O/S) applicants. Officers requesting an O/S HSSAD may use the DEROS
forecast procedures outlined in AFI 36-2110, paragraph 3.8.3, or apply when placed on the
initial VML. If applying under the DEROS forecast program, officers must request a DEROS
extension, which will accommodate the completion of their dependent’s high school senior year.
Officers requesting to extend their DEROS for the purpose of a HSSAD must handwrite or type
the following statement on their Forecast Notification RIP, "I am requesting a HSSAD extension
to my O/S tour.‖ The DEROS forecast RIP automatically produces as follows:

          A7.3.2.2.1. Airmen serving at locations where the unaccompanied tour length is 18
          months or more receive a forecast notification RIP 13 to 15 months prior to their
          established DEROS.
          A7.3.2.2.2. Airmen serving at locations where the unaccompanied tour length is less
          than 18 months receive a forecast notification RIP 10 months prior to DEROS.
A7.3.2.3. Officers electing to apply for a HSSAD after being placed on the initial VML, as
specified in the AFAS ―Officer Assignment Timelines,‖ must submit the deferment request to
their unit commander NLT 3 calendar days prior to their commander’s VML reclama suspense.

   A7.3.3. Officer’s Actions: Officers assigned to the CONUS or O/S must complete the
   memo at Figure A7.1. A memo must accompany the HSSAD request from the dependent’s
   high counselor confirming the dependent’s current school grade and projected senior year
   graduation date. Officers must complete the entire HSSAD application before obtaining their
   commander’s approval/disapproval recommendation.               Once the commander’s
   recommendation is obtained, one of the following actions must be initiated:
       A7.3.3.1. Eligible officers in the CONUS who are not on the VML must provide their
       HSSAD request, including their commander’s approval/disapproval recommendation, to
       their servicing MPS for final processing.
       A7.3.3.2. Eligible officers O/S who are not on the VML must provide the required
       HSSAD documentation to include their commander’s approval/disapproval
       recommendation in conjunction with the DEROS forecast program as outlined in
       paragraph b. (2) above.
       A7.3.3.3 Eligible officers in the CONUS or O/S who are on the VML must provide the
       required HSSAD documentation to their commander. The commander verifies the
       member’s eligibility and submits a reclama through AFAS to AFPC requesting the
       deferment period. The commander must submit a reclama regardless if he or she
       recommends approval or disapproval of the HSSAD. Rationale for disapproval must be
       included in the reclama remarks to AFPC.
       A7.3.3.4. Eligible officers who have been selected for IDE/SDE who would like to
       request a deferment under HSSAD must follow deferment procedures outlined in the
       IDE/SDE selection PSDM published by HQ AFPC/DPAF. Deferment requests must be
       signed by the member’s senior rater with MAJCOM/A1 endorsement. Deferment
302                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      requests must reach HQ AFPC/DPAF, DSN 665-2103, NLT the established cut off date.
      HQ AFPC/DPAF will coordinate with the officer’s assignment team. The final approval
      authority is the HQ AFPC/CC. Officers deferred under HSSAD who still have IDE/SDE
      eligibility remaining will be required to re-compete for school designation.
  A7.3.4. Commander Actions: Upon receipt of a HSSAD request, unit commanders take the
  following actions:
      A7.3.4.1. CONUS applicants. Determine if the officer is applying prior to or after being
      added to the VML. If the officer is applying prior to being added to the VML, make an
      approval/disapproval recommendation and have the officer submit their request to their
      servicing MPS, PRE for final processing. If the officer is applying after being placed on
      the VML, the commander must process the HSSAD through AFAS and generate a
      reclama. The reclama remarks should clearly indicate member’s eligibility was verified
      using the required documentation outlined in paragraph A7.3.1 and reflect an approval
      or disapproval recommendation. If the HSSAD is not recommended, justification is
      required to support the disapproval action. Reclama action must be taken NLT the
      suspense date reflected on the AFAS, officer assignment timelines ―Field Reclama
      VML‖ column. Officer’s HSSAD request must be kept on file 1 year from the deferment
      expiration date.
      A7.3.4.2. O/S applicants: Determine whether the officer is applying under the DEROS
      forecast program or as a result of being placed on the VML. If officer is applying under
      the DEROS forecast program and has not been placed on the VML, make an
      approval/disapproval recommendation and have the officer submit their request to their
      servicing MPS, PRE for final processing. If the officer is on the VML, the commander
      must process the HSSAD through AFAS and generate a reclama. The reclama remarks
      should clearly indicate officer’s eligibility was verified using the required documentation
      outlined in paragraph A7.3.1 and reflect an approval or disapproval recommendation. If
      the HSSAD is not recommended, justification is required to support the disapproval
      action. Reclama action must be taken NLT the suspense date reflected on the AFAS,
      officer assignment timelines ―Field Reclama VML‖ column. Member’s HSSAD request
      must be kept on file for 1 year from the deferment expiration date.
  A7.3.5. MPS Actions: Upon receipt of a HSSAD request, the PRE verifies the officer is not
  on the VML and processes the HSSAD request based on the member’s duty location.
      A7.3.5.1. CONUS applicants: Verify the officer’s eligibility and documentation (see
      paragraph A7.3.1) If the officer is eligible and has provided all required documentation,
      the PRE E-mails the officer’s request to the appropriate assignment team at AFPC. The
      E-mail must specify the officer is applying for a HSSAD and has submitted all required
      documentation. The E-mail must also include the deferment period and the AAC 85
      expiration date. The PRE should follow-up with AFPC 60 days after E-mail transmission
      if system has not been updated or disapproval notification not received.
      A7.3.5.2. O/S applicants applying under the DEROS forecast program: Verify the
      officer’s eligibility and documentation (see paragraph 2 a., above). If the officer is
      eligible and has provided all required documentation, the PRE ensures the officer’s
      Forecast Notification RIP reflects the HSSAD statement (see paragraph A7.3.2.2).
      Update the officer’s DEROS extension request in MilPDS and include in the trailer
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 303


      remarks of the update, ―Officer is applying for a HSSAD to coincide with his/her
      DEROS and meets all the eligibility criteria.‖ Finally, follow- up with AFPC if a
      response is not received within 60 days of updating the DEROS extension request.
      A7.3.5.3. Officers (CONUS or O/S) who are on the VML: Direct officers on the VML
      to their unit commander for processing of the HSSAD request.
   A7.3.6. AFPC Actions: Upon receipt of a HSSAD request AFPC processes the request for
   final approval/disapproval. If approved, update AAC 85 with an expiration date of the first
   day of the second month after the dependent’s projected graduation date or member’s
   DEROS. If the HSSAD is disapproved, notify the MPS PRE by E-mail transmission or the
   unit commander using the AFAS reclama process.

      senior year. Airmen requesting to extend their DEROS for the purpose of a HSSAD must
      handwrite or type the following statement on their DEROS Election Option or Forecast
      Notification RIP, ―I am requesting a HSSAD extension to my O/S tour.‖ The DEROS
      Forecast RIP automatically produces as follows:
          A7.4.2.2.1. Airmen serving at locations where the unaccompanied tour length is 18
          months or more receive a Forecast Notification or DEROS Election Option RIP 13 to

  memo at Tab 2. A memo must accompany the HSSAD request from the dependent’s high
  school counselor confirming the dependent’s current school grade and projected senior year

      dependent’s high school senior year. Members requesting to extend their DEROS for the
      purpose of a HSSAD must handwrite or type the following statement on their DEROS
      Election Option or Forecast Notification RIP, "I am requesting a HSSAD extension to
      my O/S tour.‖ After completing the RIP, the member obtains their commander’s
      approval/disapproval recommendation and submits the request to the MPS, PRE for
      processing.
  A7.4.4. Commander Actions: Upon receipt of a HSSAD request, unit commanders take the
  following actions:
      A7.4.4.1. CONUS applicants: Verify eligibility and ensure Airman has provided
      required documentation (see paragraph A7.4.1). Make an approval/disapproval
      recommendation and have the member submit their request to the servicing MPS PRE
      for final processing.
      A7.4.4.2. O/S applicants. Verify eligibility and ensure Airman has provided required
      documentation (see paragraph 3 a., above). Make a HSSAD approval/disapproval
      recommendation in conjunction with a DEROS extension approval/disapproval
      recommendation using the DEROS Election Option or Forecast Notification RIP. Ensure
      the required HSSAD statement (see paragraph A7.4.2.2) is annotated on the RIP and
      have the Airman submit the request to their servicing MPS for processing.
  A7.4.5. MPS Actions: Upon receipt of a HSSAD request, the PRE processes the HSSAD
  request based on the Airman’s duty location:
      A7.4.5.1. CONUS applicants: Verify the Airman’s eligibility and documentation (see

      documentation, the MPS, PRE e- mails the member’s request to
      afpc.dpaas3@randolph.af.mil. The e-mail must specify the Airman is applying for a
      HSSAD and has submitted all required documentation. The e-mail must also include the
      deferment period and the AAC 85 expiration date. If the Airman’s unit commander
      recommends disapproval of the HSSAD, submit the request to AFPC for final action.
      The MPS, PRE should follow-up with AFPC for 60 days after e-mail transmission.
      Airman’s HSSAD request must be kept on file 1 year from deferment expiration date.
      A7.4.5.2 O/S applicants (must apply under the DEROS forecast program): Verify the
      Airman’s eligibility and documentation (see paragraph A7.4.1). If the Airman is eligible
      and has provided all required documentation, the PRE ensures the Airman’s DEROS
      Election Option or Forecast Notification RIP reflects the HSSAD statement. If the unit
      commander recommends approval, update the Airman’s DEROS extension request in
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              305

     is applying for a HSSAD to coincide with his/her DEROS and meets all the eligibility
     criteria.‖ If the unit commander recommends disapproval of the HSSAD, justification is
     required to support the disapproval action. Finally, follow-up with AFPC if a response is
     not received within 60 days of updating the DEROS extension request. Airman’s HSSAD
     request must be kept on file 1 year from deferment expiration date.
  A7.4.6. AFPC Actions: Upon receipt of a HSSAD request AFPC processes the request for
  final approval/disapproval. If approved, update AAC 85 with an expiration date of the first
  day of the second month after the dependent’s projected graduation date or DEROS. If the
  HSSAD is disapproved, notify the MPS PRE by e-mail transmission.

                                         Attachment 8
                         ASSIGNMENT OF MILITARY COUPLES

A8.1. General Policy. Each member of a military couple is serving in his or her own right. This
means military couples must fulfill the obligations inherent to all Airmen and they are considered
for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and must perform duties which require the
skills in which they are trained and experienced subject to their PCS eligibility. Provided this
criteria is met, military couples may be considered for assignment where they can maintain a
joint residence. Military couples must share the responsibility for reducing family separation.
They should not make decisions on future service, career development, or family planning based
on the assumption they will always be assigned to the same location or join spouse assignment is
guaranteed. Military couples, like Airmen with a civilian spouse, should expect periods of
separation during their careers. When a join spouse assignment is not in the best interests of the
AF, then, regardless of the provisions in this attachment, join spouse assignment will not be
made.
A8.2. Who Is Eligible for Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. You are eligible for join
spouse assignment consideration if:
   A8.2.1. You are on extended active duty with the AF and your spouse is also on extended
   active duty with the AF or one of the other US military services (excludes military services
   of foreign countries) and you and your spouse are not ineligible for consideration for any of
   the reasons in paragraph A8.3, and
   A8.2.2. You meet all PCS eligibility requirements established in this instruction (such as
   TOS, retainability, quality control, etc.) and
   A8.2.3. You have join spouse intent code ―A‖ or ―B‖ and
   A8.2.4. You or your spouse are not scheduled for reassignment, separation, retirement, or
   release from active duty within 12 months from the date you will join.
   A8.2.5. Join spouse assignments are permitted along with the following voluntary
   assignment programs if the provisions above and the criteria for each assignment program
   are met.
       A8.2.5.1. Reassignment to or from a CONUS-isolated station (see Attachment 3).
       A8.2.5.2. OS tour volunteer program (see paragraph 3.7).
       A8.2.5.3. Humanitarian/EFMP assignment (see Attachment 24 and 25).
       A8.2.5.4. Home-Basing and Follow-on (see Attachment 5).
       A8.2.5.5. VSBAP (Airmen only) (see Attachment 14).
       A8.2.5.6. First-term Airman BOP (see Attachment 2).
       A8.2.5.7. Threatened Person Assignment (see Attachment 12).
A8.3. Who Is Not Eligible for Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. You are not eligible for
join spouse assignment:
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  311


  A8.3.1. If your spouse is an Airman of Air Reserve Components (ARC) whether or not they
  are serving on extended active duty.
  A8.3.2. If your spouse is an Airman in the ARC who is on active duty for training, or on
  active duty to fill a specific manpower authorization or position at a predetermined location
  for a specified period of time. In other words, if your spouse is not subject to the PCS
  criteria outlined in this instruction, then you are ineligible for join spouse assignment
  consideration.
  A8.3.3. If your spouse is active duty Coast Guard.
  A8.3.4. If your spouse is a non-military employee of the US Government (for example, Civil
  Service).
  A8.3.5. If you do not meet all PCS eligibility criteria established in this instruction (such as
  TOS, retainability, quality control, etc.).
  A8.3.6. When join spouse intent code is "H." When one Airman is selected for assignment
  with intent code "H", a join spouse assignment to that location at a later time is not
  authorized. Join spouse assignment will not be considered until the subsequent PCS of you
  or your spouse provided join spouse intent code is "A" or "B." However, you may receive an
  assignment to your spouse's location if you are eligible under some other assignment
  program.
     A8.3.6.1. Changing join spouse intent code to "H" after selection for join spouse
     assignment will not result in automatic cancellation of the assignment. Normal reclama
     procedures apply and the decision to cancel the join spouse assignment will be made by
     the assignment OPR based on the best interests of the AF. An Airman who requests and
     has a join spouse assignment canceled as provided in this paragraph does so with the
     understanding he or she created the family separation. A join spouse assignment to that
     same location at a later time is not authorized. Join spouse assignment will not be
     considered until the subsequent PCS of you or your spouse provided join spouse intent
     code is "A" or "B." However, you may receive an assignment to your spouse's location if
     you are eligible under some other assignment program.
  A8.3.7. If you or your spouse are scheduled for reassignment, separation, retirement, or
  release from active duty within 12 months from the date you will join.
  A8.3.8. To OS locations where there is no government-approved accompanied housing or
  where election of an accompanied tour is not an option for either Airman. NOTE: In the
  event both Airmen should receive assignments (regardless of how it occurred) to the same or
  adjacent dependent-restricted locations, the MPS will reclama the assignment of the Airman
  selected last (includes when the marriage takes place after assignment selection).
  A8.3.9. To locations not considered in proximity or clustered for join spouse assignment
  purposes as described in paragraph A8.7.2. Other options such as retraining (Enlisted, see
  AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program) or DAFSC changes (officers, see paragraph
  2.45) must be considered first as explained in paragraph A8.7.1.
  A8.3.10. Based on intended/planned marriages.
  A8.3.11. If your spouse is attending a training course and has less than 12 months remaining
  until graduation (or will have less than 12 months remaining upon your arrival).
 312                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A8.3.12. Your spouse is an Airman of the military service of a foreign country.
A8.4. Documenting Marriages of Military Couples. The MPS must verify the marriage from the
marriage certificate. Airmen update their join spouse intent code via the vMPF. Any change in
marital or military status must be reported to the MPS by military couples and join spouse
assignment information (and AAC 32) deleted from the PDS upon divorce, legal separation,
death of the spouse, or separation or retirement of the spouse.
A8.5. How Military Couples Receive Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. The
characteristics of the enlisted and officer assignment systems affects how join spouse assignment
consideration is provided. The enlisted assignment selection process makes extensive use of the
computer-match while officer assignment matches are a manual process. For example, the
majority of enlisted assignments to OS locations (regardless of volunteer status) are computer-
matched based on PCS eligibility, grade, and AFSC, and then reviewed and validated by an
assignment NCO. For these computer-matched assignments, the computer automatically
considers the spouse for join spouse assignment, and provided the eligibility criteria are met,
selects the spouse. On the other hand, all officer assignments are manually-worked by HQ AFPC
assignment officers to identified requirements. However, the basic rule that a requirement must
exist for the spouse's AFSC does not differ in either system.
   A8.5.1. Officers. Officers can influence their assignment by indicating they desire join
   spouse consideration on their T-ODP, and ensuring their assignment preferences match.
   They should maintain periodic contact with their respective assignment officers and ensure
   their join spouse intent code remains current.
   A8.5.2. Enlisted. When currently assigned to the same location (provided neither has been
   selected for PCS), an accurate join spouse intent code (updated through vMPF) provides
   continuous join spouse assignment consideration unless coded otherwise (see paragraph
   A8.6.1 for those situations requiring an application). It is the couple's responsibility to let it
   be known in advance they desire join spouse assignment consideration by updating their
   intent code in vMPF. Improper or failure to update the intent code jeopardizes join spouse
   assignment opportunities. Join spouse assignment desires indicated via the vMPF take
   priority over any other individual assignment preferences listed in the PDS (i.e., If your
   intent code is "B" the main consideration is to try and keep you together, not necessarily at a
   base of choice. While location preferences are considered, the join spouse intent code takes
   priority). The update in the vMPF allows Airmen to indicate the extent of join spouse
   assignment consideration desired by use of one of the following join spouse intent codes:
        Code "A" Desire join spouse to CONUS or any OS tour. NOTE: Join spouse assignment
       to the same dependent-restricted short tour location is prohibited, unless one member of the
       join spouse couple is serving in a CSPL. (See paragraph 3.2.10). By having intent code
       "A," if your spouse is selected for reassignment to a dependent -restricted location, you will
       be considered for a concurrent, but separate, reassignment to a dependent-restricted or
       unaccompanied short tour location.

       Code "B" Desire join spouse to CONUS or any accompanied OS tour.

       Code "H" Join spouse assignment not desired.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 313


     A8.5.2.1. When an Airman is selected as the most eligible non-volunteer for an OS
     assignment (where an accompanied tour is authorized) or a CONUS to CONUS PCS, and
     his or her join spouse intent code indicates join spouse assignment is desired (codes "A"
     or "B"), then the spouse will automatically be provided an assignment to the same or
     adjacent location if eligible for PCS and a requirement exists. If a join spouse assignment
     is not possible, narrative remarks in the assignment transaction will be included for the
     Airman originally selected giving the reasons why a join spouse assignment cannot be
     approved so the Airmen can be counseled accordingly. To be eligible for selection for an
     OS assignment as a volunteer with join spouse intent code "A" or "B", requirements for
     both Airmen must have been advertised on the EQUAL for the same or adjacent
     locations.
     A8.5.2.2. While the EQUAL is used by join spouse couples volunteering for OS
     assignments, it is not used for OS returnees. Return join spouse assignments are hand-
     matched because of the many variables involved, such as unique grade and AFSC
     combinations. It is important Airmen keep their assignment preferences updated in the
     event of changes in requirements (but remember join spouse intent code ensures join
     spouse consideration and takes priority over individual preferences). Requirements
     advertised on the EQUAL are for non-join spouse returnees and join spouse members
     with intent code "H" only, so couples returning together should not use EQUAL but
     rather update preferences based on their desires.
     A8.5.2.3. If an Airman is in the CONUS and the spouse is returning from OS, the initial
     join spouse consideration is to return to the spouse’s CONUS location. If there is no
     requirement at the spouse’s CONUS location and the spouse in the CONUS meets PCS
     eligibility criteria, then he or she will be considered for join spouse assignment to the OS
     returnee’s projected CONUS location. Enlisted military couples who desire CONUS or
     OS assignment consideration in conjunction with the OS follow-on program, see
     paragraph A5.10.2.
     A8.5.2.4. When an Airman is serving on a CONUS stabilized tour and the spouse is
     selected for reassignment, the following options apply:
        A8.5.2.4.1. If the spouse is selected as the most eligible non-volunteer for an OS
        assignment to an accompanied tour location, the Airman may request release from the
        stabilized tour for join spouse assignment. If approved, reporting date will depend
        whether or not a replacement is required, reporting date of replacement, etc.
        A8.5.2.4.2. If the spouse is selected as the most eligible non-volunteer for an OS
        assignment to a dependent-restricted location, then join spouse assignment is not
        authorized. The spouse may request a home-basing assignment or, as an OS returnee,
        will receive join spouse assignment consideration to return to the Airman’s stabilized
        tour location.
     A8.5.2.5. When Airmen marry while both are technical training students they should
     apply for join spouse assignment as soon as possible to receive consideration for
     assignment together upon graduation. If necessary, both Airmen are retained at the
     training center pending final join spouse decision by the assignment OPR. When one
     member is a student, he or she may apply to join the spouse at the spouse's permanent
 314                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       duty location, or if the non-student spouse is also selected or scheduled for PCS, join
       spouse assignment to the non-student's new duty station may be requested.
       A8.5.2.6. When one member of an enlisted military couple will serve an unaccompanied
       OS short tour and upon completion of the OS tour a join spouse assignment is desired to
       a location other than the spouse’s current location, assignment consideration in
       conjunction with the assignment follow-on program to a location other than the spouse’s
       current location may be requested in limited circumstances as outlined in paragraph
       A5.10.2.2 (for CONUS) and A5.10.2.3 (for OS).
A8.6. How Military Couples Request Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. There are
different ways to request join spouse assignment consideration. Officers follow procedures
under AFAS guidelines. Updating the join spouse intent code in vMPF provides join spouse
assignment consideration for enlisted members as provided in paragraph A8.6.2. Some
situations require Airmen to submit a letter application (see Figure A8.1) in order to receive join
spouse assignment consideration.
   A8.6.1. Application Procedures. A letter application is necessary to receive join spouse
   assignment consideration:
       A8.6.1.1. Each time the AF member of an interservice military couple desires join
       spouse assignment consideration. When the spouse is notified of assignment and the
       Airman desires join spouse assignment, an application must be submitted. In addition, a
       statement from the spouse indicating concurrence for join spouse assignment must
       accompany each application, or
       A8.6.1.2. When Airmen marry while assigned to separate locations. Provided both meet
       PCS eligibility criteria, either Airman may apply. Regardless of who applies, military
       requirements dictate which Airman is reassigned, or
       A8.6.1.3. When the marriage occurs after the assignment selection of one or both
       Airmen. Airmen who marry while en route to assignments at different locations must
       understand they cannot delay join spouse assignment application until arrival at their
       respective locations. Airmen who marry en route should report to the nearest AF
       installation and submit an application immediately after marriage. The MPS will contact
       the assignment OPR by the most expedient means to request join spouse assignment
       consideration. No reimbursement for any travel in conjunction with such application is
       authorized and status is leave (delay en route) while the application is pending. A change
       in port call and/or RNLTD may be appropriate. When an Airman arrives in the local area
       of assignment, whether or not "signed in," for assignment purposes the PCS is complete
       and TOS requirements and other PCS eligibility criteria must be met before a subsequent
       move to join spouse, or
       A8.6.1.4. When military spouse information is incorrect in the PDS.
   A8.6.2. The applicant must contact the MPS for help in applying for join spouse assignment.
   The servicing MPS makes sure that:
       A8.6.2.1. Airmen meet all PCS eligibility criteria and understand all assignment
       conditions.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                     315


A8.6.2.2. Airmen are counseled on their allowance of dependent travel, shipment of household
goods, and any other information related to the PCS.

       A8.6.2.3. Airmen do not have a pending application for any self-initiated voluntary
       assignment identified in paragraph A8.3.10.
       A8.6.2.4. A statement from the spouse indicating join spouse assignment is desired
       accompanies the Airman’s application in an interservice marriage.
   A8.6.3. In those situations for enlisted couples where the join spouse intent code is properly
   updated but simultaneous assignments did not flow, the MPS will ensure Airman is fully
   aware of join spouse eligibility requirements, and that, if eligible, spouse should immediately
   submit a request for join spouse assignment.
       A8.6.3.1. The MPS checks eligibility, suspenses a copy of the application, and transmits
       the request through PDS to the assignment OPR.
           A8.6.3.1.1. Refer to PSD Handbook for update procedures.
       A8.6.3.2. The assignment OPR makes the assignment decision and establishes the
       RNLTD based on manning requirements. Approval will be transmitted to the MPS by
       PDS.
A8.7. Approval Guidelines. Join spouse assignments are usually approved when the eligibility
criteria are met by both Airmen and assignment is consistent with the needs of the AF (based
primarily on grade and AFSC). Officer join spouse assignments can be more difficult because of
variable qualification factors. Sometimes approval may not be possible, due to limitations and
restrictions involved in each case. Some situations inherently limit join spouse assignment
possibilities, such as when the spouse is in another US military service, is assigned to school for
training, special duty assignment, at a location where the spouse's AFSC is not authorized, on a
stabilized tour, etc.
   A8.7.1. If HQ AFPC is unable to assign the military couple together based on their current
   AFSCs, an Airman may apply for retraining, if eligible, and an officer, if eligible, may apply
   for a DAFSC change to facilitate join spouse assignment. Approval of this type request
   depends on AF requirements. However, retraining or a DAFSC change request while in
   technical training, or within 12 months following graduation, for the sole purpose of join
   spouse assignment is not authorized. NOTE: Enlisted Airmen may request, as an exception,
   an AFSC change during technical training when join spouse assignment opportunities are
   extremely limited or nonexistent because of incompatible AFSCs between the couple. These
   requests may be considered based on the relative need in both AFSCs when the training
   capability exists at the current location, training already received is required for the requested
   AFSC, and no interruption in training will occur.
   A8.7.2. In order to provide optimum consideration for join spouse assignment, CONUS
   assignments to adjacent locations may be approved when the locations are close enough to
   allow establishing a joint household (usually no more than 50 miles apart). OS locations
   have numerous variables involved, such as weather and road conditions, cost of living,
   commute time, and availability of housing, etc. Because of these variables, HQ
   AFPC/DPAPP, in coordination with the OS MAJCOMs, determines which OS locations are
 316                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   within a join spouse cluster. These clusters are considered when reviewing military couples
   for OS join spouse assignments.
A8.8. Miscellaneous Instructions.
   A8.8.1. If the Airmen have dependents, when assignment is to an OS location where an
   accompanied tour is authorized, follow the dependent travel request procedures according to
   the PSD Handbook and AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel. This is necessary to obtain a
   housing availability determination for the family, for household goods shipment, and so
   forth. Where there are severe housing shortages, the initial request for concurrent travel may
   be disapproved; however, there are categories of exceptions, and one of these is usually
   military couples with dependents. A delay in RNLTD for one member of the couple may be
   requested, but couples must be advised to make arrangements for the care of their dependents
   in the event both must proceed as scheduled. If concurrent travel is authorized but later
   becomes impractical (for personal or official reasons), a change of RNLTD may be requested
   from the assignment OPR. Include the specific reasons the change is being requested.
   A8.8.2. Military couples with dependents who have concurrent assignments to separate
   dependent-restricted locations must make dependent care arrangements. Refusal or inability
   to arrange care for dependents may result in disciplinary and (or) involuntary separation (see
   AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans).
   A8.8.3. Military couples selected for reassignment (or assigned) to the same or adjacent
   (clustered) location will each be deferred for 24 months (see Table 2.1). When assigned
   where an accompanied tour is authorized (OS), each must serve the accompanied tour length
   (plus 12 months for enlisted couples if either was selected as an extended tour volunteer)
   regardless of the AAR which applied to either assignment. When assignment is to the same
   or adjacent (clustered) location and members will reside jointly, ensure Block 14 is checked
   to document the join-spouse assignment, regardless of the assignment action reason (AAR).
   This will ensure proper household goods weight allowance, provide documentation for
   update of AAC 32 (see Table 2.1) and ensure correct tour length when assignment is OS.
   When marriage occurs after both are assigned OS at the same or adjacent (clustered)
   location, each may retain the original tour length or volunteer to serve the accompanied tour.
   A8.8.4. Assignment OPRs make the assignment decision and establish the RNLTD based on
   manning requirements. Normally, assignment approvals are transmitted to the MPS by PDS.
   A8.8.5. If assigned OS on a join spouse assignment and you and your spouse do not have the
   same DEROS month, the member with the earlier DEROS must extend if you desire to be
   reassigned at the same time. Failing to match DEROS months reduces the chance for join
   spouse assignment upon completion of your OS tour. Curtailment of the later arriving
   Airman’s DEROS for the purpose of reassignment at the same time is not authorized.
A8.9. Assignment Restrictions. Couples who are assigned PCS to the same or adjacent CONUS
location, regardless of the AAR, are usually not reassigned for a period of 24 months from the
date arrived station of the latest arriving member. The MPS places both Airmen in AAC 32
according to Table 2.1. Any later availability date for other reasons for either member remains in
affect. If married while serving at the same location, the MPS will not update AAC 32.
   A8.9.1. When Airmen are being assigned PCS to separate locations in proximity and will
   establish a joint household, the MPS/DPMAE contacts the MPS/DPMAE at the spouse's
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                317


   location to verify location of assignment and coordinate whether or not update of AAC 32 is
   appropriate. Couples assigned in excess of 50 miles apart will not be placed assigned in AAC
   32 unless specifically authorized by HQ AFPC/DPAPP as an exception.
A8.10. Exceptions. Exceptions (paragraph 1.5) to the criteria in this attachment are considered
only for unique or unusual circumstances which will result in a hardship not usually encountered
by other Airmen. Requests must be fully justified and forwarded through appropriate command
channels to HQ AFPC/DPAPP unless directed otherwise in this instruction.

                      AIRCREW FAMILY MEMBER ASSIGNMENT

A9.1. Purpose. To provide aircrew members an avenue to apply for a PCA or PCS when another
member of the immediate family is in the same unit.
   A9.1.1. For this program, a Airman’s immediate family is defined as his or her parents, to
   include stepparents, parents by adoption, and those who stood in the place of a parent for at
   least 5 years immediately preceding the initial entry on active duty of the member who died,
   is missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled.
   A9.1.2. Brothers and sisters, to include stepbrothers and stepsisters, brothers or sisters by
   adoption, or half brothers or half sisters in the household at the time the member who died, is
   missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled initially entered active duty.
   A9.1.3. Spouse.
   A9.1.4. Natural child.
   A9.1.5. Legally adopted child.
   A9.1.6. Stepchild, if the child was a member of the household at the time the member or
   former member died, was missing or captured, or was determined to be 100 percent disabled.
   A9.1.7. An illegitimate child to whose support a male member or former member has been
   ordered judicially to contribute, or of whom he has been decreed judicially to be the father, or
   of whom he has acknowledged in writing under oath that he is the father.
   A9.1.8. A person for whom the member stood in place of a parent for at least 5 years
   immediately preceding the date on which the member or former member died, was missing
   or captured, or determined to be 100 percent disabled.
A9.2. Aircrew Family Member Criteria. Exposure to a common danger represented by serving
as an aircrew member in the same unit is sufficient reason for all but one member of an
immediate family to request reassignment to a different unit or location. Only aircrew members
may request reassignment.
A9.3. Application Procedures.
   A9.3.1. Airman. Submits application (Figure A9.1) to unit commander.
   A9.3.2. Unit Commander. Reviews request and verifies eligibility based on the definition in
   Attachment 1. When PCS is involved, verifies PCS eligibility by ensuring Airmen do not
   have quality factors, as outlined in paragraph 2.40.
       A9.3.2.1. Recommends approval or disapproval on all requests. When there is a
       question whether to PCA or PCS the member, resolves these situations through the MPS
       (lowest possible level), using PCA when possible.
       A9.3.2.2. Requests recommended for disapproval must provide the specific reasons for
       the disapproval. When disapproval is recommended the request must be forwarded to the
       MPS and then to HQ AFPC.

A10.3.2. Enlisted Airmen with a voluntary COT assignment.

A10.3.3. Enlisted Airmen with an assignment to a selectively manned activity.

A10.3.4. Enlisted Airmen who are projected for separation or retirement.

A10.3.5. Enlisted Airmen with a Humanitarian/EFMP assignment, a Follow-On or Home-
Basing assignment, or a join spouse assignment.

A10.3.6. Enlisted Airmen who don not have a DEROS within the same 3-month period as

A10.3.7. Enlisted Airmen who do not meet quality control criteria as outlined in paragraph
2.40.

A10.3.8. Enlisted Airmen who are projected for formal school training.

A10.4. Application Procedures.
   A10.4.1. An enlisted Airman wishing to participate in the SWAP program must, upon
   receipt of his or her CONUS assignment, visit the MPS. The MPS has locally devised
   templates for which to request a SWAP. The Airman can list up to eight specific bases,
   locales, states, or areas. If an Airman wants to SWAP his or her assignment for any CONUS
   assignment, the eighth preference should state ―CONUS-wide‖. Preferences are considered
   in the order listed, that is the first assignment preference is considered before the second, and
   so on.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                325


  A10.4.2. The following statement must be included on the request; ―I am applying for a
  CONUS Assignment SWAP. I understand this application constitutes a waiver of my 60-day
  order-in- hand rule and that as a result of this application an attempt will be made to change
  my CONUS assignment with another Airman returning from OS in the same returnee cycle
  who possesses the same qualifications and who also applies for an Assignment SWAP. I also
  understand my initial assignment will remain firm unless I am officially notified that this
  CONUS Assignment SWAP has been approved.‖
  A10.4.3. The MPS, in turn, updates the PDS as outlined in AFCSM 36-699, Chapter 5. This
  automatically triggers a computer search at HQ AFPC in an attempt to match the request
  with another Airman who wants a SWAP.
  A10.4.4. Applicants are notified of approval or disapproval about 60 days before DEROS.

                                         Attachment 11
       SOLE SURVIVING SON OR DAUGHTER ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTION

A11.1. Purpose. The sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction restricts an eligible
Airman from duties involving combat with the enemy and precludes assignment (including both
PCS and TDY) to any OS hostile fire or imminent danger area as designated in the DOD
Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual. This restriction does not preclude the
assignment of a sole surviving son or daughter to an OS area where combat conditions are
nonexistent.
A11.2. Definition/Eligibility Criteria. A sole surviving son or daughter is an Airman who is the
only surviving son or daughter in a family where the father, or mother, or one or more sons or
one or more daughters, served in the U.S. Armed Forces, and as a direct result of the hazards of
duty in the Service, the father, or mother, or one or more sons or daughters:
   A11.2.1. Was killed, or
   A11.2.2. Died as a result of wounds, accident or disease, or
   A11.2.3. Is in a captured or missing-in-action status, or
   A11.2.4. Is permanently 100 percent physically disabled (including 100 percent mental
   disability), as determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs or one of the Military
   Services.
   A11.2.5. The requirement that death or disability be a direct result of the hazards of service
   does not require that the family member's death or disability occur in combat or during
   assignment to a designated hostile fire or imminent danger area, but does require that death
   be determined as in the line of duty. (In general, in the line of duty means death or disability
   did not occur while the person was in desertion status or voluntarily absent without authority
   for more than 24 hours or voluntarily absent from a scheduled duty, a formation, a restriction,
   or an arrest; by reason or a condition that existed before service; or as a result of his or her
   own misconduct [the term "misconduct" includes both willful misconduct and gross
   negligence]).
   A11.2.6. An Airman who is an only child (only son or only daughter), in itself, does not
   qualify an Airman for the sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction.
   A11.2.7. The parent through whom an Airman seeks to qualify does not need to be living,
   but the Airman must meet the criteria of sole surviving son or daughter, natural or adopted,
   of that parent.
   A11.2.8. Requests may be submitted on behalf of an Airman by his/her parent or spouse. In
   this case the Airman can waive the parental/spousal request before further processing. If
   waived, return the documentation to the Airman and file a copy of the waiver in the Airman’s
   electronic ARMS record. No further processing is required.
A11.3. Airman’s Request. Airmen selected or notified of PCS or TDY to a designated hostile
fire or imminent danger area who want the assignment restriction and who meet the criteria in
paragraph A11.2 must complete the application available through the self service actions on the
vMPF, print application, and provide to unit commander for recommended approval/disapproval.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  327


Airmen currently engaged in combat may request reassignment to duties not involving combat
and/or those Airmen who are currently assigned PCS or TDY to a designated hostile fire or
imminent danger area may request reassignment, that is, termination of TDY and/or PCS
reassignment from the designated area. If the commander recommends approval, the request is
provided to the MPS for processing.
   A11.3.1. If the documentation required to accompany Airman’s request is not readily
   available, the MPS will assist the Airman as necessary which may include obtaining official
   verification and proof of casualty status through HQ AFPC/DPWC. For the family member
   who meets the criteria of paragraph A11.2, the request must include that person's name,
   service number or SSN, date of death or capture, or date listed as missing-in-action, and
   branch of the Armed Forces in which served or serving. If the family member died after 1
   Jan 1961, state his or her home of record so the appropriate agency may use it in the
   verification of death.
   A11.3.2. Airmen may decide not to request the sole surviving son or daughter assignment
   restriction. Also, an Airman who has received approval of the restriction may request waiver
   of the restriction, in writing, through the unit commander to the MPS commander. Requests
   for waiver will be approved upon request by the MPS commander with information to the
   unit commander and AFPC/DPAPP. An Airman who enlists, reenlists or extends his or her
   period of active duty after the date of notification of the family casualty which qualified for
   the restriction, will be considered as having waived the protective assignment provisions. An
   Airman who has waived the protective provisions (by request, or as a result of enlistment,
   reenlistment or extension) may apply (or reapply) for the restriction, in writing, at any time
   through their commander to the MPS commander.
A11.4. Commander Actions. Commanders will review requests and may consider restricting
duties while the Airman’s request is pending although restriction on an interim basis is not
mandatory until notified of approval. Commanders may disapprove requests when the eligibility
criteria in paragraph A11.2 is clearly not met. Disapproved requests are returned to the Airman
without further action. When commanders recommend approval, they will forward requests to
the Airman’s servicing MPS.
A11.5. MPS Action. MPS will provide guidance to Airmen on their request and assist
commanders as needed. Upon receipt from a commander of a request recommended for
approval, the MPS will review eligibility and ensure all required information is included and as
expeditiously as possible forward to AFPC/DPAPP for approval or disapproval.
A11.6. MPS Action Upon Approval. Upon notification of approval, the MPS notifies the
Airman’s commander and updates assignment limitation code (ALC) ―J,‖ Sole Surviving Son or
Daughter per Table 2.2, which will automatically update DAC 61. The MPS will also notify the
Airman, in writing, and have the Airman acknowledge approval, in writing. The notification of
approval must advise the Airman of both waiver provisions (the automatic waiver provision and
the Airman’s waiver provision after approval), and of the reinstatement provisions. File a copy
of the approval correspondence and Airman’s written acknowledgment in the electronic ARMS
record. After approval, should an Airman later request, in writing, to waive the sole surviving
son or daughter assignment restriction, the MPS commander may approve the waiver and will
advise the Airman’s unit commander. A copy of the waiver and the approval will be filed in the
Airman’s electronic ARMS record. The MPS will advise the Airman’s unit commander of the
 328                                                          AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


approved waiver and remove ALC J and DAC 61. Should the Airman later request
reinstatement, he/she must repeat the original request process and indicate that the request is for
reinstatement. If PCS reassignment is directed, the MPS will process the Airman for PCS as
required.
A11.7. Following are some examples of situations which do meet the criteria to qualify as a sole
surviving son or daughter:
   A11.7.1. The only son and only daughter of a mother or father who meets the criteria in
   paragraph A11.2, both qualify as a sole surviving son and a sole surviving daughter.
   A11.7.2. There are 3 children in a family; two boys and a girl. One of the boys meets the
   criteria in paragraph A11.2, therefore, the two remaining children (one boy and one girl)
   both qualify as a sole surviving son and a sole surviving daughter.
   A11.7.3. An Airman is an only child and one parent is also on active duty. While on
   approved leave, the active duty parent is killed while a passenger in the crash of a U.S.
   civilian commercial passenger aircraft. The parent's death is determined by the Air Force to
   be in the line of duty (see paragraph A11.2.5). Since the criteria in paragraph A11.2 is
   met, the child qualifies as a sole surviving son/daughter. The finding that death was in the
   line of duty meets the requirement that death was as a direct result of the hazards of service.
A11.8. Following are some examples of situations which do not meet the criteria of sole
surviving son or daughter:
   A11.8.1. A family has one child (boy or girl). The child is on active duty in the AF. The
   fact that a child is an only child does not, in itself, qualify the child for the sole surviving son
   or daughter assignment restriction.
   A11.8.2. A family has one child (boy or girl). The child is on active duty in the AF. The
   father (or mother) dies of natural causes. The child is not a sole surviving son or daughter
   since the criteria in paragraph A11.2 is not met.
   A11.8.3. There are 3 children in a family, two sons and a daughter. One son and the
   daughter are Airmen. The son who is not in the AF is killed in a car accident. Neither the
   remaining son nor the remaining daughter qualify as a sole surviving son or daughter since
   the criteria in paragraph A11.2 is not met.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  329

                     THREATENED PERSON ASSIGNMENTS (TPA)

A12.1. General Information. This assignment program rapidly removes the Airman and
dependents from a life threatening situation. Threats of bodily harm or death must have been
made against the Airman or dependents and be of such severity that military and civilian
authorities are unable to provide for the family's continued safety. The threats and circumstances
must be verified as indicated below.
   A12.1.1. Because assignments to OS locations require significantly longer processing time
   (medical clearance, concurrent travel, passport/visa, etc.) normally, only CONUS locations
   are used for this program.
A12.2. Processing Guidelines. The TPA program is not a MPS, unit commander, or Airman-
initiated assignment request. The decision to request a TPA rests with the installation
commander. The installation commander:
   A12.2.1. Convenes a meeting with the MSSQ/CC or MPS Commander, the Security Forces
   Commander, AFOSI representative, the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), and the Airman’s
   immediate commander to assess the case and determine appropriate action.
   A12.2.2. Decides whether to move the individual immediately to ensure personal safety by
   sending the Airman TDY until the threat is resolved, or until assignment instructions are
   received. Do not use permissive travel (see Attachment 1) with this program.
   A12.2.3. Does not request PCS until all other means of providing safety are exhausted. As a
   basic condition for approval the threat must be verified by the AFOSI representative.
   A12.2.4. Decides if reassignment is necessary and provides full facts and circumstances to
   HQ AFPC/DPAPP through the Force Support Squadron commander or Military Personnel
   Element commander with an informational copy to AFOSI using secured channels
   (encrypted e-mail is authorized) for assignment determination.
   A12.2.5. Request must include:
       A12.2.5.1. Name, grade, SSN, and AFSC.
       A12.2.5.2. Unit of assignment.
       A12.2.5.3. Assignment waivers required, if appropriate.
       A12.2.5.4. Assignment action pending, if appropriate.
       A12.2.5.5. Detailed explanation of circumstances warranting assignment. If confirmed
       threats are being made by an ex-spouse and there are children from the marriage, include
       custody and visitation decision by the court which granted the divorce. If the Airman has
       custody of a child and the ex-spouse (parent) has a court order (for EXAMPLE:
       visitation rights), consult with local SJA to determine whether request can be granted
       under AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation.
       A12.2.5.6. Details regarding jurisdiction over the offense, if appropriate.
 330                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       A12.2.5.7. Recommendation of the local SJA, who determines whether local (host
       country authorities and the American Embassy for members stationed OS) or other US
       Military authorities object to the Airman’s reassignment.
       A12.2.5.8. Information relative to temporary disposition, if appropriate.
       A12.2.5.9. Synopsis of pending administrative or disciplinary action, if appropriate.
       A12.2.5.10. Any factors that could disqualify or restrict Airman from performing duty in
       the AFSC or other awarded AFSCs, or being PRP certified.
       A12.2.5.11. Military spouse's name and SSN, if appropriate.
       A12.2.5.12. Airman’s assignment preferences in CONUS.
A12.3. HQ AFPC/DPAPP Actions.
   A12.3.1. Upon receipt of request, evaluates content, confers with AFOSI, Region 4 if needed
   and approves or disapproves the reassignment request. When approved, determines final
   assignment.
   A12.3.2. Provides assignment information to the losing/gaining MPS Commanders by
   secured means.
A12.4. Losing MPS Actions. Process TPAs according to the following instructions:
   A12.4.1. The MPS Commander, or designated trusted agent, must not reveal knowledge of
   the TPA to anyone not having an absolute need-to-know. Provide the maximum assistance
   possible to the Airman during out-processing and advise the threatened Airman to report
   directly to the gaining MPS Commander immediately upon arrival at the new duty station.
   Exercise care when forwarding personnel documents between MPS’ (OPRs, EPRs, UIFs,
   etc.).
   A12.4.2. Do not take any PDS loss action. If the threatened Airman does not report by
   RNLTD, the gaining MPS Commander or trusted agent will notify the losing MPS
   Commander or trusted agent who initiates no-show action. Publish orders according to
   instructions in AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders and AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation
   Procedures, as some items are intentionally left blank.
A12.5. Gaining MPS Actions. Process TPAs according to the following instructions:
   A12.5.1. The MPS Commander, or designated trusted agent, must not reveal knowledge of
   the TPA to anyone not having an absolute need-to-know. Provide the maximum assistance
   possible to the Airman during in-processing. Exercise care when requesting personnel
   documents between MPS’ (OPRs, EPRs, UIFs, etc.).
   A12.5.2. Once Airman has arrived, the gaining unit advises HQ AFPC/DPAPP, who will
   load the assignment. Once the assignment is loaded, the gaining unit may gain to file.
   A12.5.3. The MPS Commander or trusted agent deletes the threatened person from the base
   locator, if so desired, for a maximum of 3 years. The threatened person may request to
   extend this exemption from HQ AFPC/DPAPP.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                331

332                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      A13.4.1.2. Airmen electing to participate must obtain the retainability for the 24 or 36
      month tour no later than 30 calendar days after the official assignment notification.
      Airmen will automatically incur a PCS ADSC equal to the prescribed tour length.
      A13.4.1.3. KAIP payment will begin on the Airman’s date arrived station (DAS) in
      Korea and terminate on the date the Airman departs from Korea for PCS, terminal leave,
      or permissive travel (see Attachment 1) for the purpose of retirement or separation.
      Airmen will be granted one short tour credit for the KAIP tour, except for those serving
      the 36 month accompanied tour.
      A13.4.1.4. Airmen must have a KAIP agreement on file prior to issuing PCS orders.
         A13.4.1.4.1. If the Airman elects to serve the KAIP tour, the following statement
         must be typed in the remarks section of the PCS orders, ―Airman elected to
         participate in the KAIP program.‖ The agreement will be filed in ARMS (electronic
         personnel record) and a copy forwarded to the gaining location along with other
         relocation documents.
         A13.4.1.4.2. If the Airman does not elect to serve the KAIP tour, file the agreement
         as directed IAW AFI 36-2102, Table 1.1Rev 1. A copy of the agreement will be
         forwarded to the gaining location along with the other relocation documents.
         A13.4.1.4.3. The Force Management Ops Element (Inbound Assignments) will use
         the Case Management System (CMS) to identify Airmen participating in KAIP.
         Submit CMS cases directly to DFAS to initiate KAIP payment immediately upon
         receipt of the KAIP from the Airman. A separate CMS case must be submitted to stop
         KAIP payments (update NLT 1 duty day after the Airman’s departure from Korea for
         PCS, terminal leave or permissive TDY for personnel retiring or separating). Ensure
         procedures are in place to track KAIP termination updates.
             A13.4.1.4.3.1. Required information for KAIP CMS cases:
                 A13.4.1.4.3.1.1. Enter Airman’s SSAN
                 A13.4.1.4.3.1.2. In the Case Type block select ―Korea Assignment Incentive
                 Pay (KAIP).‖
                 A13.4.1.4.3.1.3. In the Case Description block enter ―Airman participating in
                 KAIP.‖
                 A13.4.1.4.3.1.4. In the Case Information area under Root Cause of the
                 Problem block select ―New AF Program-No MILPDS DJMS.‖
                 A13.4.1.4.3.1.5. In the Category block select ―Process.‖
                 A13.4.1.4.3.1.6. In the Action/Comments block enter the effective date or
                 stop date of the KAIP
                 A13.4.1.4.3.1.7. In the Action Agency block select ―DFAS AC Korea AIP
                 (AF).‖
         A13.4.1.4.4. Update the gain transaction in MILPDS based on the DoD prescribed
         tour; however, adjust the DEROS to reflect the KAIP tour and use DEROS reason
         code ―YC.‖ For EXAMPLE:
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               333


             A13.4.1.4.4.1. If an Airman is selected for the 12 month unaccompanied tour, the
             tour length entry will be the DoD prescribed tour length of 12 months. However,
             the Airman’s DEROS will be established as 24 months.
             A13.4.1.4.4.2. If an Airman selected for PCS to Korea requests, is offered a CSP,
             and elects to serve the accompanied-by-dependents tour, the DoD prescribed tour
             could be either 24 or 36 months, depending on the assignment location. The
             Airman’s DEROS should be established based on the tour length elected.
  A13.4.2. Airmen electing to participate in KAIP after arriving in Korea must sign the
  ―Korea Assignment Incentive Pay (KAIP) Agreement‖ at Figure A13.2 prior to entering
  their DEROS Forecast window (approximately 60 days after arrival in Korea)/initial VML.
  EXAMPLE: If an Airman arrives on 10 Jan 08, then he/she will enter their DEROS Forecast
  window approximately 1 Mar 08).
     A13.4.2.1. Airmen serving unaccompanied may elect to serve an additional 12 or 24
     months upon completion of their original DEROS.
     A13.4.2.2. Airmen who elected and are serving the 24 month accompanied tour (in areas
     where the 36 month tour is allowed) may make a tour election change to the 36 month
     tour.
  A13.4.2.3 Airmen electing to participate must obtain the retainability for KAIP tour no later
  than 30 calendar days after signing the agreement. Airmen will automatically incur a PCS
  ADSC equal to the completion of the KAIP tour which they are electing.
     A13.4.2.4. KAIP payment will begin on the date the Airman signs the KAIP agreement
     and terminate on the date the Airman departs from Korea for PCS, terminal leave, or
     permissive travel (see Attachment 1) for the purpose of retirement or separation.
     Airmen will be granted one short tour credit for the KAIP tour.
     A13.4.2.5. Force Management Ops will brief the KAIP program at in-processing.
     A13.4.2.6. Force Management Ops will ensure completion of KAIP agreement at Figure
     A13.2 and keep it on file for Airmen electing to participate.
     A13.4.2.7. Force Management Ops will establish the initial DEROS as stated in
     paragraph A13.4.1.4.4; however, use DEROS reason code ―YD.‖ Submit a CMS case
     directly to DFAS to initiate payment as stated in paragraph 13.4.1.4.3 NOTE: If the
     Airman is already gained to file when electing to participate, email AFPC/DPAPP
     (afpc.dpapp@randolph.af.mil) to request a change to the DEROS date and DEROS
     reason. Title the email ―KAIP request after arrival in Korea but prior to entering the
     DEROS forecast window or VML‖ and include the following information: Full name,
     rank, SSAN, new DEROS date. Once the request has been updated, AFPC/DPAPP will
     open a CMS case (for Airmen already gained to file) directly to DFAS to initiate
     payment.
  A13.4.3. Airmen assigned to Korea may elect to serve a subsequent 24 or 36 month KAIP
  tour during their DEROS forecast window (enlisted) or initial VML (officers). Airmen
  electing KAIP will complete the agreement in Figure A13.3.
     A13.4.3.1. Airmen electing to participate must obtain the retainability for KAIP tour no
     later than 30 calendar days after receiving KAIP approval notification. Airmen will

       automatically incur a PCS ADSC equal to the completion of the KAIP tour which they
       are electing.
       A13.4.3.2. Commanders will recommend approval or disapproval for all subsequent
       KAIP tour requests. If the commander recommends approval, the AFPC assignment
       OPR will approve or disapprove the subsequent KAIP tour. Commanders have
       disapproval authority for subsequent KAIP tours
       A13.4.3.3. Subsequent KAIP tours will not begin until after completion of the original
       tour length. KAIP payment will begin on the date the Airman enters the subsequent tour
       and will terminate on the date the Airman departs from Korea for PCs, terminal leave, or
       permissive travel (see Attachment 1) for the purpose of retirement or separation.
       Airmen serving unaccompanied and those serving the accompanied 24 month tour (in
       areas where that is the maximum accompanied tour length) will be granted two short tour
       credits, one credit for the original tour and the second credit for the KAIP tour.
       A13.4.3.4. Force Management Ops will ensure completion of KAIP agreement at Figure
       A13.3 and file the agreement as directed IAW AFI 36-2102, Table 1.1Rev1.
          A13.4.3.4.1. Email AFPC/DPAPP (afpc.dpapp@randolph.af.mil) to request the
          subsequent KAIP tour election. Title the email ―KAIP request in conjunction with
          the DEROS forecast window or VML‖ and include the following information: Full
          name, rank, SSAN, and new DEROS date.
          A13.4.3.4.2. Do not submit CMS case to initiate KAIP in these instances because the
          AFPC assignment OPR must approve or disapprove the subsequent tour. If the
          assignment OPR approves the request, then AFPC/DPAPP will open a CMS case
          directly to DFAS to initiate payment if the subsequent KAIP tour is approved.
A13.5. KAIP Restrictions and additional guidance.
   A13.6.1. Airmen electing to participate in KAIP prior to departing losing base are ineligible
   for the Home basing (HB) and Follow-On (FO) assignment programs IAW Attachment 5
   (Home Basing and Follow-On Assignment Programs), unless they are still within their
   application window. If still within the HB/FO application window, Airmen may complete a
   new KAIP agreement declining to participate and then request HB/FO, as desired.
   A13.6.2. Airmen may not participate concurrently in two separate DEROS extension
   programs (i.e. KAIP and OTEIP).
   A13.6.3. Airmen electing KAIP prior to departing losing station may request cancellation of
   KAIP anytime prior to departing their losing base and will not be given the opportunity to
   apply for a HB/FO assignment unless they can meet the HB/FO application timelines (150
   days prior to RNLTD) IAW AFI 36-2110, Attachment 5. If PCS orders were already
   published reflecting the KAIP statement, the MPS must issue amendments deleting KAIP
   participation and correcting tour length information.
   A13.6.4. Airmen electing KAIP after arrival in Korea will have their HB/FO assignment
   cancelled.
   A13.6.5. Curtailments from KAIP tours are only considered for mission or humanitarian
   reasons IAW Attachment 24 (Humanitarian Reassignment and Deferment Program) and
   Attachment 25 (Exceptional Family Member Program [EFMP]). The Air Force will not
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               335


   recoup any portion of the KAIP if the Airman is curtailed for mission reasons or an approved
   Humanitarian or EFMP reassignment. Airmen curtailed from the overseas area prior to
   fulfilling their KAIP agreement will have their incentive pay stopped effective the date of
   departure from Korea. Curtailment requests for other reasons will be submitted as an
   exception to policy IAW paragraph 1.5 and recoupment will be considered on a case by
   case basis for all other curtailments as determined by AFPC/DPAPP.
A13.7. Career Development and Force Management; Colonels and Chiefs, including selectees,
and Judge Advocate Procedures.
   A13.7.1. Career Development/Force Management must submit KAIP requests for all judge
   advocates, Colonels and Chiefs, including selectees before Airmen are authorized to
   participate in KAIP. This policy applies before and after Airmen arrive in Korea.
      A13.7.1.1. Colonels and selectees must be sent to AF/DPO, Personnel Support Division,
      DSN 664-5039, organizational box (afdpo@pentagon.af.mil). AF/DPO is the approval
      authority.
      A13.7.1.2. Chiefs and selectees must be sent to AF/DPE, DSN 665-8153, email:
      org.afdpe@pentagon.af.mil. AF/DPE is the approval authority.
      A13.7.1.3. For all judge advocates, including colonels, must be sent to AF/JAX, DSN
      224-3021, email: afjax.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. AF/JAX is the approval authority.
 NOTE: As a reiteration, MPS must not permit judge advocates, Colonels and Chiefs, including
 selectees, to sign the KAIP agreement until they receive authorization to participate. If
 previously approved for participation in the KAIP program, use the applicable procedures as
 outlined in this Attachment.

   the stabilized tour DOA.
   A14.3.4. Airmen assigned to a VSBAP location (but not serving on a VSBAP) may apply
   for a 5-year in-place VSBAP. There is no TOS minimum to apply. The deferment is
   effective upon approval of the application.
   A14.3.5. Airmen assigned to a VSBAP location (and serving a VSBAP) may not receive a

                                        Attachment 15
   OVERSEAS TOUR EXTENSION INCENTIVE PROGRAM (OTEIP) (ENLISTED
                             ONLY)

A15.1. Purpose. To save PCS funds by providing specific incentives, as authorized by
Congress and the SAF, to enlisted Airmen in certain skills who extend their OS tour for 12
months.
A15.2. Who is Eligible for OTEIP. To be eligible for OTEIP Airmen:
   A15.2.1. Must be serving in either a CAFSC designated by the SAF (skill
   level/prefix/suffix- specific, and first three positions of DAFSC must match the first three
   positions of the CAFSC) or be serving at a short tour location (tour lengths of NA/12, 24/12,
   24/15) where all AFSCs are eligible, and
   A15.2.2. Must extend their OS tour for a period of 12 months (no more, no less), and
   A15.2.3. Must have or be eligible to obtain the required PCS retainability.
A15.3. Who is Not Eligible for OTEIP.
   A15.3.1. Officers.
   A15.3.2. Airmen who cannot obtain the required retainability.
   A15.3.3. Airmen at long tour locations who do not hold a specific CAFSC designated by the
   SAF, or skill level, prefix and/or suffix do not match designated CAFSC.
   A15.3.4. Airmen who extend their DEROS for a period other than 12 months.
   A15.3.5. Airmen whose DEROS is involuntarily extended (during the involuntary extension
   period only).
   A15.3.6. Airmen who have an indefinite DEROS (Airmen with an indefinite DEROS must
   first establish a DEROS 12 months from the current date and then, if otherwise eligible,
   request an OTEIP extension).
   A15.3.7. Airmen who are required to serve or agree to serve a prescribed tour length or
   period of time in conjunction with an action or program other than OTEIP are not eligible to
   receive the OTEIP tour extension incentive for the same period. For example, an Airman
   serving a 24 month unaccompanied tour who marries and receives approval of command
   sponsorship or receives a join spouse assignment is obligated to serve the accompanied tour
   length. The Airman would not be eligible for OTEIP for the period of time necessary to
   support the accompanied tour length. Also, KAIP renders an Airman ineligible for OTEIP.
A15.4. OTEIP Incentives/Restrictions. Eligible Airmen may elect one of the following incentive
options:
   A15.4.1. Y1 option: special pay of $2,000 lump sum.
   A15.4.2. Y2 option: 30 days nonchargeable leave.
   A15.4.3. Y3 option: 15 days nonchargeable leave and government funded round trip
   transportation from the OS location to the nearest CONUS port (travel provided for the
   military member only).
 346                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A15.4.4. Airmen electing the $2,000 lump sum incentive receive it once they enter the 12
   month OTEIP extension. If an Airman is curtailed before completing the entire extension
   period, recoupment of the unearned portion of the incentive pay may be required as
   explained in paragraph A15.6.
   A15.4.5. Airmen electing either leave option (Y2 or Y3) must take the OTEIP leave
   incentive within 6 months after entering the OTEIP extension according to AFI 36-3003,
   Military Leave Program. Comply with AFI 36-3003 to process OTEIP leave and
   transportation incentives.
   A15.4.6. Once an OTEIP incentive has been approved, any request to change to a different
   incentive requires full justification, to include commander’s recommendation. The same is
   true if an election other than OTEIP was made, and the request is to change to OTEIP.
   Submit these type of requests and attach the original DEROS RIP by e-mail to HQ
   AFPC/DPAPP with an information copy to the assignment OPR.
A15.5. Application Procedures.
   A15.5.1. Airmen who are OTEIP eligible apply for OTEIP at the time of DEROS
   forecasting by using the DEROSO RIP. This RIP will automatically reflect the OTEIP
   incentive options. NOTE: MPS’ should not request DEROSO RIPs for OTEIP eligible
   personnel out-of-cycle (manually). Manually requested DEROSO RIPs do not pass the same
   MilPDS edits and will not reflect the OTEIP options.
       A15.5.1.1. The DEROSO RIP must be signed by the Airman and commander, and then
       forwarded to the MPS within 30 days from the day it was produced. The MPS must
       update and process OTEIP requests through MilPDS.
   A15.5.2. Commanders and the assignment OPR evaluate each extension request and have
   disapproval authority when such action is warranted (quality control, projected authorization
   changes, projected over manning by grade and skill, etc.).
A15.6. Cancellation/Recoupment of OTEIP Incentives.
   A15.6.1. Temporary/Permanent Withdrawal of AFSC. When Airmen are removed from
   their incentive extension CAFSC/DAFSC for cause or for other conditions over which they
   had control (as determined by the commander) and used their incentive, the following apply:
       A15.6.1.1. Recoupment of the unearned part of the incentive pay will be taken based on
       a monthly amount of $166.66, but the DEROS will remain firm unless adjusted by HQ
       AFPC. For example, an Airman serving an OTEIP extension until November 2008 has
       his AFSC withdrawn for cause in May 2008. In this case, the DEROS will remain
       November 2008 and the Airmen will have $999.96 recouped from his monthly pay
       ($166.66 for each month (Jun -Nov) he does not serve in the OTEIP AFSC). The MPS
       must immediately notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP by message (with an information copy to the
       assignment OPR), of the OTEIP AFSC withdrawal action, so recoupment action can be
       initiated through DFAS-DE.
       A15.6.1.2. Nonchargeable leave and/or transportation incentives used will be charged to
       the Airman. DEROS will remain firm unless adjusted by HQ AFPC.
       A15.6.1.3. Airmen removed from their incentive extension CAFSC/DAFSC for reasons
       other than for cause or conditions over which they had no control (as determined by the
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               347


       commander), will usually not be charged for used leave and transportation costs. Those
       who elected the monetary incentive will have the unearned portion recouped as explained
       in paragraph A15.6.1.1. In all cases, the DEROS will remain firm unless adjusted by
       HQ AFPC. NOTE: All Airmen are expected to perform duty in the incentive extension
       AFSC for the complete period of the extension. Any temporary duty outside the CAFSC
       as directed by the commander must first be approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP.
       A15.6.1.4. Incentive benefits will not be withdrawn for those Airmen promoted to a
       grade that results in a mandatory skill level change which may remove him or her from
       the OTEIP AFSC eligibility list.
   A15.6.2. Mandatory PCS.
       A15.6.2.1. When an Airman has entered the 12 month OTEIP extension and now must
       be curtailed due to mission requirements or humanitarian reasons (mandatory PCS), any
       incentives already received/used will normally not be recouped; however, all unused
       incentives will terminate upon departure from the current station. HQ AFPC/DPAPP is
       the final approval authority for determining if the Airman will have to repay the
       government for any unearned incentives.
       A15.6.2.2. When an Airman with an approved OTEIP extension has not entered their
       extension and due to force structure changes, or other mission reasons, the OTEIP
       extension can no longer be supported, the extension will revert to a normal extension.
       The Airman may then request to reinstate his or her original DEROS or establish an
       earlier DEROS which includes the reverted normal extension.
       A15.6.2.3. Once a force structure change is announced mission changes may preclude an
       Airman’s use of OTEIP transportation and leave options. When this occurs, Airmen may
       request, with commander's concurrence, to change their OTEIP incentive to Y1. Such
       requests will be submitted by the Airman to the assignment OPR, through the MPS.
          A15.6.2.3.1. If an announced closure/inactivation date is subsequently delayed,
          Airmen who were OTEIP eligible but were unable to extend the full 12 months
          (based on the initially announced closure/inactivation date) who will now be able to
          complete a 12 month extension, may request OTEIP option Y1 as an exception to
          policy. This exception request may be processed even though the Airman may have
          already served a portion of the extension that makes up the 12 month period. Airmen
          in this situation are not authorized to apply for options Y2 or Y3. These exception
          requests must be submitted through the MPS to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for a final
          decision. Requests must include specific start and stop dates which clearly show that
          the Airman will complete the required 12 month extension period.
A15.6.3. Command Sponsorship. Airmen are not entitled to OTEIP for the additional extension
period when obligated to serve additional time to meet requirements of command sponsorship. If
no additional time is required to comply with current tour, the Airman may apply for OTEIP. If
the Airman has an approved OTEIP, but has not entered the extension and needs additional time
for command sponsorship, the OTEIP extension will be canceled or delayed to coincide with the
completion of command sponsorship extension. If the Airman has entered the OTEIP extension,
 348                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


the special pay may be prorated and cost of leave/ travel entitlements may be charged as outlined
in paragraph A15.6.1.1 and A15.6.1.2.

A15.7. Cancellation Requests. Airmen with approved OTEIP extensions may apply for
cancellation of all or part of the extension prior to entering the extension when unique situations
apply. If approved, all OTEIP entitlements are lost upon approval of the cancellation request,
whether the extension was canceled in full or in part. Requests for cancellation of OTEIP
extensions after entry are normally disapproved unless extreme circumstances warrant the
curtailment. These circumstances include humanitarian or EFMP conditions (see Attachments
24 and 25), or mission changes that prevent completion of the extension. Requests for
cancellation after entry must be processed and approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP and indicate what
incentive benefits have been used or received by the Airman. If a cancellation request is
approved, recoupment of the unearned portion of the $2,000 lump sum or leave/transportation
incentive will be completed as outlined in paragraphs A15.6.1.1 and A15.6.1.2.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 349


                                        Attachment 16
  ENLISTED QUARTERLY ASSIGNMENTS LISTING (EQUAL)AND EQUAL-PLUS

A16.1. What is the EQUAL? The EQUAL listing advertises those enlisted requirements
(assignments) HQ AFPC intends to make to and from OS (through SMSgt). It shows what is
available by AFSC, grade, and location, and allows Airmen the opportunity to align preferences
to actual AF needs. Airmen can review the EQUAL on the AMS web page.
A16.2. When EQUAL is not used. The EQUAL is not used to advertise special duty,
joint/departmental, short notice OS CONUS to CONUS moves or CMSgt requirements (see
EQUAL-Plus in paragraph A16.8). Also, the EQUAL is not used to advertise requirements for
military couples returning from OS who desire join spouse assignment (see paragraph A16.7).
A16.3. How the EQUAL Works. Assignments to and from OS are worked in three month
cycles as shown in paragraph A16.5 and A16.6 below. Using the selection criteria and priority
provided in this instruction, assignments are matched eight times a year, four cycles each going
to and returning from OS and CONUS Mandatory Movers. The CONUS to OS cycle is the first
step in the assignment process. Generally, OS requirements (the number of positions to be
filled) are determined based on the number of Airmen currently OS who have a DEROS falling
within a given cycle who will be returning to the CONUS. HQ AFPC uses this information to
identify and advertise OS requirements on the EQUAL, allow Airmen to volunteer for, and
finally, select Airmen for OS assignments. Once the OS assignments have been matched to
Airmen, HQ AFPC then works to identify those CONUS locations where manning requirements
exist. There is one CONUS requirement identified for each OS returnee and CONUS mandatory
mover (see A16.3.1). These requirements are then advertised on the returnee EQUAL, OS
returnees prioritize the appropriate advertised requirements, and, finally, the requirements are
matched to the returning Airmen according to the selection priority listed in Table 3.13.
   A16.3.1. CONUS Mandatory Movers are also considered during the OS Returnee cycle.
   CONUS Mandatory movers are those Airmen with a maximum stabilized tour deferment
   (AAC 50) whose codes are expiring and are considered ―mandatory movers‖. There is one
   CONUS requirement identified for each mandatory mover. See Figure A16.1 for the CMM
   counseling handout.
   A16.3.2. Using EQUAL to fill all requirements is sometimes not practical, for example, in
   the case of Aircrew Assignments that involve training, therefore not all requirements will be
   publicized on EQUAL.
A16.4. How to Use the EQUAL.
   A16.4.1. Review the OS EQUAL to see what OS assignments will be made. Using that
   information, you can volunteer for up to eight preferences, using either individual base codes
   or country codes from the advertised requirements. However, listing a specific base limits
   your selection as a volunteer to just that base. For example, if the EQUAL lists a
   requirement in your AFSC and grade at both Ramstein AB and Spangdahlem AB, you can
   volunteer for both by listing each separately or by just listing Germany as an OS preference.
   However, if you list only Ramstein AB as a preference and not Germany, we will not
   consider you for voluntary assignment to Spangdahlem AB. If more than one advertised
   EQUAL requirement is listed, all preferences are considered equally for assignment
 350                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   purposes. Provided Airmen are eligible for selection, selections are made according to the
   selection priorities listed in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2.
   A16.4.2. OS returnees and CONUS Mandatory Movers should use the OS Returnee/CONUS
   Mandatory Movers (CMM) EQUAL to align their CONUS assignment preferences to those
   locations listed (military couples see paragraph A16.7 below). It's understood that the
   requirements advertised may not be true "personal assignment preferences," but since
   EQUAL reflects those assignments which will be made, ignoring, or failing to prioritize the
   advertised requirements means you will receive the remaining assignment after all those who
   aligned and provided preferences from the EQUAL are matched (regardless of your return
   priority). You should list your personal preferences only after you prioritize the advertised
   requirements.

A16.7. Military Couples, Join Spouse, and EQUAL
   A16.7.1. Military couples who desire to be assigned together OS (join spouse intent codes
   "A" or "B") where an accompanied tour is authorized should use the OS EQUAL to
   volunteer for OS assignments. If requirements exist for both and one is the most eligible
   volunteer, both will be selected for assignment. However, military couples (with intent codes
   "A" or "B") who are OS returnees do not use the OS Returnee EQUAL as CONUS
   requirements for returning military couples are not advertised. Because of the unique grade
   and AFSC make up of military couples, returnee assignments are hand-matched. Returning
   join spouse couples with intent codes ―A‖ or ―B‖ should maintain matching and current
   CONUS preferences which will be considered during the assignment match. NOTE: These
   procedures do not apply to military couples with intent code ―H‖ (join spouse not desired).
   Airmen with join spouse intent code ―H‖ do participate in the ―normal‖ OS returnee EQUAL
   cycle.
A16.8. EQUAL-Plus. The EQUAL-Plus supplements the EQUAL and is used to advertise
requirements for special duty assignments (SDA), Joint/Departmental assignments, short notice
OS assignments, and all CMSgt assignments. The listing is updated weekly and is available on
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               351


the AMS web page. EQUAL-Plus shows upcoming requirements, any special qualifications an
Airman needs to be eligible for selection, the available locations, reporting instructions, and
POCs you can contact for additional information. Airmen desiring to volunteer for a particular
ad may update their application via vMPF. The application must contain the specific job number
reflected in the EQUAL-Plus ad. In addition, some SDAs also require a hard copy application.
CMSgts apply for advertised requirements by contacting their assignment NCO or the POC
listed on the advertisement.
   A16.8.1. The selection priority for EQUAL-Plus jobs at overseas locations is:
       A16.8.1.1. Local OS volunteers (for OS EQUAL-Plus jobs) with at least 12 months left
       on DEROS and willing to extend an additional 12 months. (Local is defined as currently
       stationed at the same duty location of EQUAL-Plus requisition location.)
       A16.8.1.2. Overseas Returnees/COT volunteers (Intra-theater volunteers then inter-
       theater volunteers) with an established DEROS
          A16.8.1.2.1. Short tour returnees
          A16.8.1.2.2. Long tour returnees
       A16.8.1.3. Overseas Returnees/COT Volunteers (Intra-theater volunteers then inter-
       theater volunteers) with an indefinite DEROS
       A16.8.1.3.1. Short tour returnees

       the same duty location of EQUAL-Plus requisition or those in close proximity to the
       EQUAL-Plus requisition) prioritized by DOR. NOTE: Local volunteers must have 12
       months TOS as of advertised RNLTD to be considered.
       A16.8.2.4. All other volunteers prioritized by DAS

A16.9. Special Duty Assignments (SDAs).
   A16.9.1. General Information. There are certain requirements throughout the AF which
   cannot be satisfied by normal allocation and assignment selection criteria because the duties
   require Airmen with unique qualifications. The requirement for unique qualifications,
   especially when combined with other non-standard considerations, may warrant
   implementation of any of a variety of special manning procedures different from those used
   to satisfy the majority of AF requirements. Designation as an SDA, in itself, does NOT:
       A16.9.1.1. Increase the manning priority of an activity (that is, its entitlement to
       personnel resources), or
       A16.9.1.2. Authorize a stabilized tour, or
       A16.9.1.3. Affect the responsibility of the assignment OPR to distribute and manage
       personnel resources to best serve the overall needs of the AF. While it is true activities
       designated as SDAs may have some similarities in manning procedures, each special
       manning procedure is individually justified and approved as essential. Designation as an
       SDA does not result in automatic implementation of a standard set of special manning
       procedures.
       A16.9.1.4. As with any PCS, an Airman's qualifications to perform the required duty is
       the primary consideration. Most SDA requirements are filled by eligible volunteers and
       volunteers are preferred by most SDAs. There are few duties for which being a volunteer
       is a mandatory prerequisite by law or other directive. While volunteer status is an
       important factor, it is not a substitute for meeting PCS eligibility criteria (except when a
       volunteer is required by law or other directive). Assignment of qualified non-volunteers
       is sometimes necessary to avoid unfilled requirements in an SDA.
   A16.9.2. Some MAJCOMs and organizations are authorized to initiate assignment requests
   on Airmen who have applied for SDAs; such requests require HQ AFPC assignment OPR
   approval of PCS. For other activities, the HQ AFPC assignment OPR both identifies and
   selects Airmen for PCS to the SDA.
       A16.9.2.1. Management of stabilized tours is prescribed by paragraph 2.15 and the
       stabilized tour guide.
       A16.9.2.2. Activities authorized to requisition replacement personnel (that is, those not
       automatically filled by either computer allocation or the assignment OPR), use either the
       procedures below, EQUAL-Plus, and (or) those procedures agreed to when designated as
       a SDA. Department and joint activities work with the AFPC Assignment teams to write
       requisitions for publication on Equal Plus. Requisitions must show the identification data
       of the incumbent and the reason for requisition, such as increase in authorization,
       incumbent selected for reassignment, etc.
          A16.9.2.2.1. For minimum tour activities authorized SDA manning, requisitions are
          submitted only when the incumbent is a known loss such as when selected for PCS,
          approved retirement, etc.
          A16.9.2.2.2. For maximum tour activities, requisitions are submitted with the
          forecast of the incumbent. Requisitions for replacement personnel for CONUS
          activities or those OS are submitted to arrive not later than the 25th day of the 12th
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 353


         month before the required reporting month (if qualification in a foreign language is
         necessary for the assignment, the length of the specific language course should be
         added to this submission requirement).
     A16.9.2.3. Whenever an Airman is relieved from an SDA for cause, paragraph 2.15
     applies to the curtailment of the stabilized tour, and paragraph 2.40 applies.
     A16.9.2.4. When activities do not have enough qualified eligible applicants and are
     entitled to additional personnel, they may request manning assistance from the
     assignment OPR.
     A16.9.2.5. A SDA may require longer service retainability than that required for a non-
     SDA PCS. If an Airman declines, they remain eligible for any PCS for which they
     possess sufficient retainability, and may still be assigned to the SDA if the longer service
     retainability requirement is appropriately waived (see paragraph 2.29.4).
  A16.9.3. Applying for a SDA. Waivers to the following general criteria to permit an Airman
  to volunteer for a SDA are not considered. If it becomes necessary to consider personnel for
  assignment who do not meet the general minimum criteria, HQ AFPC (or the special duty
  activity when authorized by HQ AFPC), will stipulate the criterion which does not have to be
  met and solicit volunteers or identify non-volunteers for possible assignment or actual PCS.
  An Airman who does not meet the normal minimum general criteria to volunteer for SDA
  consideration, but does meet the modified criteria outlined in a solicitation message or
  EQUAL- Plus ad may volunteer for an SDA at that time, or could be selected as a non-
  volunteer when necessary.
     A16.9.3.1. Airmen are not eligible to be selected for an SDA if they:
         A16.9.3.1.1. Have any other self-initiated PCS request pending (BOP, VSBAP, etc.).
         (Airmen may volunteer for normal OS assignment and volunteer for a SDA at the
         same time via updating their preferences through the vMPF).
         A16.9.3.1.2. Have an active UIF, are on the Control Roster, or do not meet criteria in
         paragraph 2.40.
         A16.9.3.1.3. Are not recommended by their commander. The commander's
         favorable recommendation indicates the Airman's past performance and other factors
         clearly show he or she can be expected to perform the duties of the SDA.
         A16.9.3.1.4. Are requesting consideration for a MAJCOM or organization-controlled
         SDA, and do not have an overall rating of at least 3 on their last five EPRs. There
         must be no unfavorable comments regarding the Airman's personal qualities or
         conduct, working relations, job knowledge, personal appearance, or duty performance
         within the EPRs.
         A16.9.3.1.5. Are requesting consideration for an HQ AFPC controlled SDA and do
         not have an overall rating of 3 on their last three EPRs. There must be no unfavorable
         comments regarding the Airman's personal qualities or conduct, working relations,
         job knowledge, personal appearance, or duty performance within the EPRs.
         A16.9.3.1.6. Are pipeline trainees (except the Security Police Academy for duty with
         the USAF Honor Guard, or when HQ AFPC solicits trainee volunteers). Course
354                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


         supervisor recommendation is an acceptable substitute for EPRs for pipeline trainees,
         but not retrainees.
      A16.9.3.2. The following additional prerequisites also apply:
         A16.9.3.2.1. If Airmen are being reported in an AAC listed in Table 2.1, then the
         DOA for reassignment cannot be more than 12 months from the date of application.
         A16.9.3.2.2. Airmen must possess a skill level commensurate with their grade.
         A16.9.3.2.3. Airmen who possess a CONUS/OS imbalanced AFSC will be
         considered for an OS SDA in only the imbalanced AFSC.
         A16.9.3.2.4. Airmen applying for duty in a Special Duty Identifier (SDI) must be
         qualified for entry or award of the SDI according to the AF Enlisted/Officer
         Classification Directory or the prescribing directive for the SDI.
      A16.9.3.3. There is no minimum TOS required to apply for consideration for an SDA.
      However, selection for SDA is dependent on meeting required assignment eligibility
      criteria as specified in Chapter 2. When volunteering for a SDA, Airmen must update
      their application through vMPF, and submit a formal application if required. The
      EQUAL-Plus advertisement or SPECAT Guide will list any unique application
      requirements. Only one special duty application may be submitted for consideration at a
      time. Airmen may submit applications for consideration for SDA as follows:
         A16.9.3.3.1. Airmen assigned OS with an established DEROS can apply for
         EQUAL-Plus ads if their DEROS coincides with the reporting date of the SDA.
         DEROS extensions may be considered for an EQUAL-Plus assignment but not
         curtailments.
         A16.9.3.3.2. Airmen assigned OS with an indefinite DEROS can apply for EQUAL-
         Plus ads provided the advertised RNLTD is after completion of the initial prescribed
         tour. If selected, a DEROS will be established which is consistent with the RNLTD
         of the SDA.
         A16.9.3.3.3. Airmen serving a CONUS stabilized tour may apply for an SDA but
         reassignment will not be considered until after the expiration date of the stabilized
         tour.
  A16.9.4. Application Procedures for a SDA.
      A16.9.4.1. General Information. Some MAJCOMs, organizations, and activities have
      SDAs and are authorized to receive applications from Airmen or advertise SDA
      requirements on EQUAL-Plus. The controlling command or organization may initiate
      assignment requests on Airmen who are applicants, and assignment instructions will be
      provided upon approval of PCS by the assignment OPR. For other SDAs, a formal
      routing application process is neither feasible nor necessary. Because of the large
      number of SDAs, it is not economical or feasible to publish and maintain a grade, AFSC,
      and location requirements list, mission statements, base support information, etc.
      Interested Airmen may obtain such information on their own from the base library, by
      personal correspondence to the activity, from the POC listed in the EQUAL-Plus
      advertisement, from base OPRs for a subject, and so on, to assist them in deciding
      whether or not to volunteer. Airmen volunteering for a specific SDA are considered only
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 355


     for the type of special duty and locations requested unless contacted and they expand or
     change their preferences or type of duty, or they are selected as a non-volunteer. In
     addition to the minimum eligibility criteria listed in paragraph A16.9.3, additional
     eligibility criteria for specific duties are shown in the EQUAL-Plus advertisement, if
     applicable. Waivers to criteria in the EQUAL-Plus advertisement, to volunteer for SDA
     consideration, or actual PCS, may be requested from the controlling command or activity
     for SDAs or the HQ AFPC assignment OPR for SDAs, or the OPR listed in the EQUAL-
     Plus advertisement. After selection for PCS, there may be other factors which could
     render an Airman ineligible or unqualified for PCS.
     A16.9.4.2. Required Actions for MAJCOM or Organization-Controlled SDAs.
        A16.9.4.2.1. The MPS or member provides any documentation required by the
        EQUAL-Plus advertisement. If the applicant is married to another military member,
        include the spouse's identification data (grade, name, SSN, CAFSC, organization,
        location, branch of service) and any information which should be considered in
        conjunction with the application for the SDA PCS.
        A16.9.4.2.2. The application must contain the specific job number reflected in the
        EQUAL-Plus advertisement.
        A16.9.4.2.3. When photographs are required as part of the application process, write
        the name and SSN of the applicant on the reverse of the photograph with a felt-tip
        marker.
        A16.9.4.2.4. When a controlling activity receives an application, they will either
        initiate the assignment request if a requirement exists, or return the application if the
        Airman is unqualified (to include why the applicant is unqualified). Applications for
        professional military education (PME) instructor, recruiter, or AETC instructor may
        be considered for 12 months.
        A16.9.4.2.5. The controlling activity verifies the current status of the applicant
        before initiating an assignment request. The assignment OPR may disapprove an
        activity's request if the Airman's status has changed since the date of original
        application, or assignment is not in the overall best interests of the AF.
     A16.9.4.3. Required Actions for HQ AFPC Controlled SDAs.
        A16.9.4.3.1. Airmen who desire to apply for an HQ AFPC-controlled SDA must
        meet the minimum eligibility criteria listed in paragraph A16.9.2, and any additional
        criteria listed in the EQUAL-Plus advertisement. For some activities no other
        documentation is necessary other than updating the preference through the vMPF. In
        other instances, when required by the EQUAL- Plus advertisement, other application
        procedures may be required.
        A16.9.4.3.2. The application must contain the specific job number reflected in the
        EQUAL-Plus ad.
        A16.9.4.3.3. When photographs are required as part of the application process, write
        the name and SSN of the applicant on the reverse of the photograph with a felt-tip
        marker.
356                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


         A16.9.4.3.4. When a hard-copy application is required, either the assignment
         authority or the gaining activity will initiate reassignment if a requirement exists,
         return the application if the Airman is unqualified with the reason not qualified, or
         retain the application for a future requirement. Applications are not normally retained
         more than 12 months; however, this varies between activities. The current status of
         the applicant should be verified before an assignment request is initiated or
         assignment is directed.
         A16.9.4.3.5. When an application for SDA requires only an update in the PDS (no
         hard copy application/documentation needed), the Airman’s volunteer status remains
         valid until either selected for the SDA or volunteer status is changed.
  A16.9.5. Procedures for Advertising Requirements Through EQUAL-Plus.
      A16.9.5.1. The SDA unit or organization requests to advertise a unique requirement
      through EQUAL-Plus by forwarding the request (with justification) to the AFPC
      Functional Manager Upon review and validation by the functional community, the
      request will be provided to the MAJCOM/DPAA (only for HQ AETC, HQ AIA and Joint
      Staffs-the other MAJCOMs do not coordinate on requests) for further consideration. If
      the request is approved by HQ AFPC, it will be placed on EQUAL-Plus for
      advertisement. Agencies/units will continue to use the standard requisition template to
      request position fills. The template is posted on the AFPC assignments home page.
      A16.9.5.2. Units or organizations with authorizations requiring recurring advertising
      through EQUAL-Plus not already approved, should submit their fully justified requests to
      the functional community of their servicing MAJCOM. After review and validation, the
      functional community will provide these requests to the AFPC Functional Manager for
      further consideration. Since requests of this nature usually necessitate a manning point
      change, they must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAA5 for further processing and final
      disposition.

Figure A16.1. Enlisted CONUS Maximum Tour Completion Counseling Handout (E8 and
Below)
Introduction.

 Enlisted Airmen assigned to CONUS maximum stabilized tours (designated by Assignment
 Availability Code (AAC) of ―50‖) are considered CONUS mandatory movers (CMM). An
 AAC ―50‖ means you are in a maximum tour and you will move on your Date of Availability
 (DOA). The guidance in this handout informs you of options, required actions, suspense dates,
 and consequences if actions are not completed on time. Receipt of this handout is proof you
 were advised of your options and required actions. If you have any questions after reviewing
 this handout, you may seek additional counseling through the Military Personnel Element
 (MPS). Exemptions: All Field Training Detachment (FTD) Instructors, aircrew personnel
 (1AXXX AFSCs), 820th Security Forces Group (3P0X1s only), and those assigned to the
 USAF Air Demonstration Squadron (Nellis AFB NV) are excluded and will not participate in
 the OSR/CMM EQUAL process.

 Options.

 Not later than the first day of the 7 th month before your tour completion month, you must have
 secured an extension to your DOA, have been selected for a voluntary assignment (e.g.
 BOP/Overseas EQUAL cycle/EQUAL Plus), or have an approved separation or retirement date.
 If you have not been selected for an assignment prior to this time you will enter the assignment
 selection process and be matched to a voluntary or involuntary assignment in the appropriate
 CMM cycle (see A16.6). All personnel serving in an SDI (8XXXX or 9XXXX) will receive a
 CMM assignment in their previous AFSC.

 Completion of Maximum Tour Report of Individual Personnel (RIP). Ideally, 12 months prior
 to your current DOA you will receive a notice RIP. Once you receive the RIP, review it
 carefully, consider all your options (see below), sign the RIP, and forward through your chain
 of command. This RIP must be returned to the MPS, Personnel Relocation Element. Failure to
 receive a RIP/Notification does not remove you from assignment consideration. Detailed
 options for all CMMs are outlined below:

 Voluntary Date of Availability (DOA) Extension. You may request a tour extension of 1 to 12
 months. This is your opportunity to extend your DOA to accommodate personal needs, such as
 school age children. Extensions require your commander’s approval and must be processed by
 the MPS within 30 days from the date of the RIP or notification by the unit. Your
 MAJCOM/FOA/DRU has disapproval authority for DOA change requests. If the
 MAJCOM/FOA/DRU recommends approval, your request is sent to HQ AFPC for final
 consideration.

 Maintain Current Date of Availability. Electing to maintain your current DOA means you
 desire to depart upon completion of your current tour.
358                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


First-Term Airman (FTA) Base of Preference (BOP). This program is available to First-Term
Airmen selected for reenlistment and have an approved Career Job Reservation (CJR). You
may apply for a BOP using Figure A16.2. and request up to eight CONUS bases in order of
preference. Preferences are considered in the order listed. DO NOT use regions or states as
preferences. If your request is approved, you are required to reenlist within 30 days after
notification unless a delay is authorized for the reasons in AFI 36-2110, Table 2.7. If the
request is disapproved, you will be notified and matched for a CONUS assignment under the
normal OSR/CMM process using EQUAL. Attachment 2 contains more information on the
BOP program.

Career Airman BOP. This option is available to career airman serving on their second or
subsequent enlistment. CMM personnel serving a maximum stabilized tour for at least 4 years
or have at least 4 years time-on-station are eligible to apply no earlier than 12 months and no
later than 9 months before completing the stabilized tour. Members use Figure A16.2. to list
up to 8 CONUS choices and must meet the quality indicators as outlined in AFI 36-2110. If
you have been selected for PCS or have an assignment selection date (see paragraph 5), then
you are not eligible for a BOP. You must not be an overseas volunteer or have any other
voluntary assignment application pending.

Overseas Tour. While an overseas tour is not a DOA election option, you may be considered
for an overseas assignment by updating your overseas preferences. The preference update must
be on file by the suspense date listed on the Overseas EQUAL cover page.

You may only volunteer for EQUAL overseas requirements in your AFSC and grade (or
projected grade) with an RNLTD during your DOA month and the following two months. For
example, if your DOA is Aug, you will only be considered for requirements with an RNLTD of
Aug, Sep or October. As a CMM, you will have a higher priority for overseas assignments than
other CONUS volunteers; however, if you are not selected for an overseas assignment, you will
be matched to a CONUS assignment under the normal OSR/CMM Process using EQUAL.

Join Spouse Assignment.

If you are married to another military member and you or your spouse would like to be
considered for a join spouse assignment upon completion of your tour, you both must ensure
your intent code is current. You must have the same assignment preferences and your join
spouse intent code must not be ―H‖ (Join Spouse Not Desired). Review your intent code on the
vMPF or contact MPS Customer Service Element for verification of your current intent code.

Extend DOA to match spouse. If you and your spouse are both CMMs and you do not have the
same DOA month, the member with the earlier DOA must request an extension if you desire to
be reassigned at the same time. Curtailment of the later member's DOA for the purpose of
reassignment at the same time is not authorized.

Join Spouse Base of Preference (BOP) Program. If you and your military spouse are eligible to
participate in the BOP program, you must apply as discussed in Para 2c/d above. Each member
of a military couple must be eligible for a BOP ―in his/her own right.‖
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 359



O/S EQUAL. You may use the Overseas EQUAL listing to apply for an overseas assignment.
Join spouse couples volunteering to be stationed overseas together (intent code A or B) will be
provided a join spouse assignment based on a requirement existing for both members. If either
member is selected as the most eligible volunteer, the spouse will receive join spouse
consideration based on manning over the next six-month period from the RNLTD of the
selected member. Approval will be based on requirements versus vacancies. Upon approval
and provided the join spouse member meets all other PCS criteria, the join spouse assignment
will be loaded with the same RNLTD as the selected member.

OSR/CMM EQUAL. While EQUAL is used by join spouse couples volunteering for overseas
assignments, it is not used for a CMM CONUS assignment. Join spouse assignments are hand-
matched because many variables are involved, such as unique grade and AFSC combinations.
It is important your assignment preferences are updated based on personal preference.
Requirements advertised on the OSR/CMM EQUAL are for non-join spouse and join spouse
members with intent code "H" only. Your preferences along with current Air Force needs are
used to determine join spouse assignment approval.

JOIN SPOUSE ASSIGNMENT NOT DESIRED. If you or your spouse changes your join
spouse intent code to ―H,‖ a join spouse assignment will not be considered. If selected for an
assignment and your intent code is ―H‖ and you later change your intent code to join spouse
desired, you cannot have a join spouse move to that location at a later time unless they are
eligible under some other assignment program. It is in your best interest to visit the MPS,
Customer Service Element, and review AFI 36-2110, Attachment 8, Assignment of Military
Couples, to ensure a full understanding of this program. More information about the Join
Spouse Assignment Program can be found in Attachment 8; also available at your MPS.

Service Retainability Requirements.

Service retainability is the amount of obligated active service you must obtain before you can
PCS. Within 30 days of receiving your assignment notification RIP you must:

Obtain the required service retainability to PCS.

Decline retainability in writing by completing an AF Form 964. (NOTE: if you are ineligible to
obtain PCS retainability because of High Year of Tenure (HYT) or quality factors, you do not
have to decline retainability). However, since you are in a mandatory move status a utilization
decision will be made to determine whether an assignment is required even if a PCS declination
is executed.

Apply for retirement to coincide with your DOA, if eligible.

Assignment Selection Date (ASD) and the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing (EQUAL).

Assignment Selection Date (ASD). The ASD is the date the assignment OPR decides you are
officially selected for an assignment. Contrary to belief, you do not have to have an assignment
360                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


on file. This is a suspense window for the AFPC to allocate requirements by AFSC and grade.
Your ASD will be automatically established as the first day of the allocation month for your
DOA. For example, an individual with an DOA of December will have an ASD established as
1 June (See Enclosure 1 - OSR/CMM CYCLE). The ASD enters you in the OSR/CMM
assignment cycle and makes you available for an assignment match unless you already have an
assignment. Therefore, once you enter the assignment cycle, you cannot apply for a BOP,
VSBAP, or any other voluntary assignment. EXCEPTION: You may apply for an EQUAL-
Plus advertised job no later than the day before the OSR/CMM EQUAL is advertised; refer to
paragraph 6 for additional information. Additionally, extensions to your DOA will only be
considered if your request is based on humanitarian/EFMP reasons or unique mission
requirements. Any exceptions must be processed through your commander, MPS,
MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, and HQ AFPC/DPAA. Your commander, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and
HQ AFPC have disapproval authority on any of these requests. Only HQ AFPC has approval
authority.

Enlisted Quarterly Assignment Listing (EQUAL). EQUAL is the listing used to advertise
available overseas and CONUS requirements. This listing reflects available requirements by
AFSC and grade, at particular locations. The OSR/CMM EQUAL cycle provides only
available CONUS assignments; therefore, you should align your CONUS preferences
accordingly. If you want to volunteer for an overseas assignment, refer to paragraph 2e for
additional information.

NOTE: EQUAL may be accessed through the MPS, or the AFPC World Wide Web page
(conduct a search on ―EQUAL‖). We encourage you to seek assistance through the MPS. If
you are TDY or on leave during the advertising cycle, you can contact the nearest
MPS/PERSCO to review the listing. If you are changing your assignment preferences, the MPS
will send a message to your servicing MPS to update your assignment preferences.

Assignment Priority. Before CONUS assignments are matched, overseas returnees and CMMs
are aligned into four groups within each grade and AFSC. You will be in group four.
Assignment priority is a follows:

Group one (highest priority) are those returning from overseas tours of 17 months or less where
dependents are restricted.

Group two are those returning from overseas tours of 17 months or less where dependents are
authorized but the member served unaccompanied.

Group three are those returning from overseas tours of 18 months or more, regardless of
accompanied status.

Group four (your group) are members with AAC ―50‖ (CMMs) regardless of tour length.
These Airmen are aligned by grade (NOTE: Promotees will be considered in projected grade)
DOR/TAFMSD/DOB.

Special Duty Assignment Consideration (EQUAL-Plus).
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    361



EQUAL-Plus is a listing containing requirements by grade and AFSC for special duty
assignments, Joint/Departmental assignments, and short notice requirements. The EQUAL-Plus
Listing is accessed via AMS. You may apply for an EQUAL-Plus advertised job no later than
the day before the OSR/CMM EQUAL is advertised. Assignment selection will be after the
volunteer-by date has expired. You may volunteer for another assignment if the MPS has not
notified you of selection within 45 days after the volunteer-by date. You may volunteer for
only one special duty at a time.

Eligibility requirements are listed in this instruction and specific qualifications are shown in the
advertisement or on the SPECAT Assignment Guide located at the MPS or
http://afas.afpc.randolph.af.mil/procedures/specat.htm. Personnel may apply for special duties
if their DOA coincides with the assignment reporting date plus 60 days.

Retraining in Conjunction with Tour Completion.

AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, and the USAF Retraining Advisory, provides
guidance on eligibility and application procedures. If you are interested in voluntary retraining
contact the MPS Customer Service Element. More information about retraining may be
available at the AFPC web site. If selected for retraining you will not receive an assignment off
the CMM listing as your assignment will be in your new AFSC and provided by the appropriate
assignment OPR.

Humanitarian or Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Assignments.

Humanitarian. If you have a family member who needs assistance and requires your presence,
you may qualify for immediate reassignment to help alleviate the problem. A humanitarian
reassignment request is evaluated on an individual basis.

EFMP. If you have an immediate family member with special needs (medical or educational)
you may qualify for immediate reassignment or have special consideration for your next
assignment.

If you experience such a situation do not rely on your preferences and do not delay submitting
an application until your DOA. Please contact your MPS, Customer Service Element for
counseling on the humanitarian or EFMP program. Separation and Retirement Processing.

Separation. If you intend to separate on completion of your tour, proceed to the MPS Personnel
Relocation Element for counseling once you receive the CMM Stabilized Tour RIP. It is
critical you receive counseling and forecast for separation in a timely manner.

Retirement. If you intend to retire on tour completion, proceed to the MPS Personnel
Relocation Element for counseling once you receive the CMM Stabilized Tour RIP. You may
request retirement to be effective on the 1st day of the month following your DOA, but you
may not apply for retirement more than 12 months before the requested retirement date. If you
are HYT restricted and cannot obtain CONUS PCS retainability, you should request counseling

(For airmen married to other military members only.) I have been counseled on BOP and join
spouse assignment criteria. My spouse and I must be BOP eligible to receive consideration. If
my spouse is not BOP eligible, I understand I will receive assignment consideration under

 AIR FORCE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM (AFAS) (OFFICERS - LT COL AND BELOW)

A17.1. Purpose. The primary goal of the AFAS is to assign the right officer to the right position
at the right time to meet AF mission requirements. Other considerations include an officer’s
professional development, personal preferences and commander’s recommendation. Assignment
of judge advocate officers in the grades of Lt Col and below do not fall under the purview of
AFAS.
A17.2. How AFAS Works. HQ AFPC Officer Assignment Teams are comprised of assignment
personnel who usually hold the same AFSC as the one they’re managing. Having supply officers
work supply officer assignments, fighter pilots work fighter pilot assignments, and so on, allows
for insight into the unique manning and qualification requirements for positions in that specialty.
The AFAS is managed through the Personnel Requirements Display and by use of the officer’s
Development Plan. Both are discussed in the following paragraphs.
A17.3. Personnel Requirements Display (PRD). The PRD is a key component of the AFAS. It
serves as an information source and provides officers a planning tool by displaying assignment
opportunities around the world. It is available through the AMS web page and consists of two
parts, the authorizations listing and the requirements listing.
   A17.3.1. Authorizations Listing. This lists, by AFSC and location, all unclassified positions
   within each specialty across the AF as reflected on AF manpower files, and provides officers
   an idea of the different types of assignments available throughout the AF. Officers and
   commanders may use this listing to aid in completing the development plan, and it can also
   be used to assist in long term career planning. This listing is updated monthly to reflect the
   latest authorization changes.
   A17.3.2. Requirements Listing. This lists projected requirements which HQ AFPC will
   work to fill. It is designed to help officers who are eligible for reassignment. It is important
   to remember that not all requirements will be listed, and also that some requirements listed
   may not be filled via a PCS move. Direct-hire positions and short-notice fills are examples
   of requirements which may not receive visibility. Examples of positions listed which appear
   to go unfilled are those which are filled internally or with an accession. Remember this
   portion of the PRD is only a projection of the assignments which will be worked over the
   next several months. It will be updated and made visible in conjunction with established
   assignment windows.
A17.4. The Airman Development Plan (ADP) The Development Plan is a single source
document created by the officer to communicate career desires to the commander, senior rater,
assignment officer, and developmental team (DT). The Airmen Development Plan (ADP) is a
web-based application containing the Development Plan and other tools to support Force
Development. Until incorporation into ADP, the officer will continue to view DT comments and
career development recommendations using the AMS Website. When an officer completes a
Development Plan for command selection or developmental education, the document can only be
submitted to AFPC by the senior rater. The unit commander/equivalent, except squadron section
commanders, may submit Development Plans pertaining to assignment preferences or vectoring.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   365


  A17.4.1. When to Submit a Development Plan. Officers need to keep their Development
  Plan updated to reflect their current assignment/development preferences at all times. It is
  very important to have current information on a Development Plan as the officer reaches
  developmental milestones such as promotion, developmental education or command.
  Otherwise, Assignment Officers and DTs will not have an officer’s most current input when
  trying to balance Air Force and career field requirements with the officer’s desires.
  A17.4.2. Types of Development Plans to be Completed. The officer has the option of
  selecting from four different purposes for completing a Development Plan. The officer may
  complete a Development Plan for assignment consideration, vectoring, command selection
  (if eligible) and/or career broadening consideration. Once the officer selects one or more
  purposes, the document will be formatted to guide the officer through the completion of each
  applicable section of the Development Plan. The Assignment Preference section will allow
  the officer to communicate their desires for the next 1 to 3 years. The Development
  Preference section permits the officer to define their career plans for the next 3 to 5 years and
  the next 5 to 10 years. The Leadership Opportunities section allows the officer to choose up
  to five command opportunities if available and applicable to the officer’s career field. This
  section should only be completed if the officer is in their window of eligibility. The Career
  Broadening section allows the officer to volunteer for career broadening duties outside of
  their primary AFSC when available. Remember, the Development Plan is not designed to
  create the officer’s next assignment. It is a tool that will be utilized to meet the development
  needs of each officer and Air Force requirements. NOTE: This program has been temporarily
  suspended due to current, real word events.

              TOTAL TIME IN AREA ASSIGNMENT (OFFICERS ONLY)

A18.1 Total Time-In-Area Assignment (Officers Only).
A18.1.1 The total time an officer is assigned to the same CONUS locale can have both positive
and negative impact on an officer and the Air Force. There is no arbitrary maximum period of
time an officer may be assigned to duty stations within a locale. This policy is to ensure the
overall best interests of the Air Force are served when an officer is being considered for:

       A18.1.1.1. PCS between duty stations within a locale, or
       A18.1.1.2. PCS to return to a locale in less than 2 years after PCS of short duration
       outside a locale, such as after an unaccompanied overseas (OS) short tour, PCS after
       completion of professional military education (PME), PCS to attend formal education,
       and so on.
   A18.1.2. When PCS is proposed as outlined in paragraphs A18.1.1.1 or A18.1.1.2 above,
   and an officer’s total time assigned to a locale is projected to be:
       A18.1.2.1. More than 4 years, but less than 5 years, then the PCS must be approved by
       AFSLMO for generals and colonels (including selectees) and AFPC/DPA for officers in
       the grade of Lt Col and below. HQ USAF/JAX approval is required for judge advocates.
       A18.1.2.2. Five or more years, then the PCS must be approved by AFSLMO for generals
       and colonels (including selectees) and AFPC/CC/CD for officers in the grade of Lt Col
       and below. HQ USAF/JAX approval is required for judge advocates.
   A18.1.3. In computing total time assigned within a locale, use 24 months as the projected
   time on station (TOS) at the new location, or the projected stabilized tour length or
   deferment, if applicable, whichever is longer.
       A18.1.3.1. For example, if a member will have 3 years TOS at the time of PCS
       departure, then approval of 5 years total time assigned is required.
       A18.1.3.2. If a member will have 3 years TOS at the time of PCS departure and the
       assignment is to a 3 year stabilized tour, then approval of 6 years total time assigned is
       required.
   A18.1.4. In addition, coordination of the losing/gaining unit commanders at the two duty
   stations within the locale is required prior to approval of a PCS meeting the criteria in
   paragraph A18.1.1.1 or A18.1.1.2 above. NOTE: Local instructions may require approval
   higher than at the losing/gaining unit commander level. For example, a request to PCS to the
   USAF Academy from another base within the Colorado Springs area may require
   concurrence of the Commandant of the USAF Academy.
   A18.1.5. For purposes of this personnel assignment policy only, a locale is:
       A18.1.5.1. Separate cities, towns, or installations (to include detachments, operating
       locations) adjacent or close to each other, between which the commuting public travels
       during normal business hours on a daily basis; or,
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             367


     A18.1.5.2. A group of stations specified by the assignment authority. The following
     locales include the stations specified (and operating locations or detachments which may
     be adjacent or close by):
         A18.1.5.2.1. San Antonio: Lackland AFB, Brooks AFB, Kelly AFB, Fort Sam
         Houston, and Randolph AFB.
         A18.1.5.2.2. Colorado Springs: Peterson Field, Cheyenne Mt., Schriever AFB,
         Buckley Field, and USAF Academy.
  A18.1.6. For PCS between duty stations within the Washington, D.C. area, see Attachment
  19.
NOTE: This program has been temporarily suspended due to current, real word events.

 WASHINGTON, DC AREA TOTAL TIME ASSIGNED MANAGEMENT (OFFICERS
                             ONLY)

A19.1. Washington, DC Area Total Time Assigned Management. Assignments of officers to,
from, and within the Washington, DC area must serve to replenish staff positions with fresh
expertise from the field, provide timely return of officers with staff experience to the field, be in
the best interests of the AF and, to the degree possible, consistent with individual officer
professional development. It is recognized there will be times when an extension of present
assignment or consecutive assignments to the Washington, DC area serve the best interests of the
AF. There is no arbitrary maximum period of time an officer may be assigned within the area.
However, continued assignment or consecutive assignment of officers (line and non-line)
totaling more than 4 years within the Washington, DC area will be carefully managed according
to the guidance herein and in the following paragraphs with approval level of extensions and
reassignments as shown in Figure A19.1 and Figure A19.2. Further, a 2-year intervening
minimum period is required between assignments in the Washington, DC area as explained in
paragraph A19.9 and Figure A19.3.
A19.2. Definition of Washington, DC Area. The Washington, DC area includes the following
locations (this definition does not necessarily coincide with the Washington, DC area as defined
for any other purpose):
   A19.2.1. Washington, DC;
   A19.2.2. In Virginia, the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and
   the cities of Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas and Manassas Park; and
   A19.2.3. In Maryland, the counties of Prince George’s and Montgomery.
A19.3. When Total Time Restarts. The total time assigned to the Washington, DC area restarts
when an officer is assigned for 2 years or more outside the area. See paragraph A19.9.
A19.4. Time Assigned as a Student. Time assigned within the Washington, DC area as a
student (AFIT, PME, formal training course) does not count towards total time assigned. For
example, an officer with no previous assignment in the area is assigned to a stabilized tour in the
Washington, DC area for 4 years and then is assigned to PME also within the area for a period of
9 months. Approval to remain assigned as a student beyond 4 years is not required. However, if
a post-PME assignment is proposed which is within the Washington, DC area and the
assignment is to a 3 year stabilized tour, then total time assigned approval for a period of 7 years
is required. See Figure A19.2.
A19.5. Operational Assignments Within the Washington, DC Area. Operational assignments
(defined as assignment to a unit under the operational control of a MAJCOM) within the
Washington, DC area when no stabilized tour is authorized for the officer's organization or
position, are not within the purview of this policy. Similarly, consecutive operational
assignments within the area are not within the purview of this policy. Officers may remain
assigned in an operational assignment within the Washington, DC area beyond 4 years or be
assigned to consecutive operational assignments without approval of an extension of total time
assigned.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    369


A19.6. Extension of Total Time Assigned. An extension of stabilized tour and extension of total
time assigned in the Washington, DC area are separate and distinct considerations. Both
extensions may be included in the same request, but should address that both a current tour
extension and a total time assigned extension are requested, when applicable. An officer's date
arrived station (DAS) is not always a true reflection of total time assigned to the area; therefore,
the assignment OPR will review an officer's Washington, DC assignment history whenever an
extension of current stabilized tour is requested to determine if a total time assigned extension is
also necessary. For example, a 1 year extension of a current 3 year stabilized tour may, in fact,
be a fifth or sixth year extension of total time assigned to the area. Use Figure A19.1 to
determine the approval level for extension of total time assigned.
A19.7. Stabilized Tour Extension. Stabilized tours are designated as either maximum or
minimum tours (see Attachment 1, definitions).
   A19.7.1. Extensions of minimum tours are not appropriate. Upon expiration of the
   minimum stabilized tour period, officers remain assigned until selected for reassignment
   based on normal PCS selection criteria. Approval of an extension of total time assigned in
   the area is not required for assignment for more than 4 years after minimum tour expiration.
   A19.7.2. Maximum tours require either mandatory reassignment upon tour expiration or
   approval of a tour extension and extension of total time assigned to Washington, DC area,
   when applicable. Officers will not remain assigned to maximum tours after expiration of
   tour without an approved extension of tour and extension of total time assigned.
A19.8. Consecutive Assignments Within the Washington, DC Area. When consecutive
assignments within the Washington, DC area are proposed, the total time assigned upon
projected completion of the proposed assignment determines the approval level required. An
officer's DAS is not always a true reflection of total time assigned in the Washington, DC area;
therefore, the assignment OPR will review an officer's Washington, DC assignment history
whenever a consecutive assignment is proposed to determine if a total time assigned extension is
also necessary. The total time computation is based upon any previous assignments in the
Washington, DC area, the current assignment (stabilized tour or operational assignment) in
combination with the kind of assignment proposed (stabilized tour or operational assignment)
according to guidance above and in Figure A19.2.
A19.9. Interval Between Assignments Within the Washington, DC Area. Following an
assignment in the Washington, DC area, a minimum interval of 2 years is required before a
return assignment to the area. The intent is that officers serve an operational field assignment in
an awarded specialty during the intervening period. An assignment to a school tour where the
member is in a student status is not considered an operational field assignment. When an officer
is being considered for assignment to the Washington, DC area, the assignment OPR must
conduct a review of previous assignment history to determine if an officer has been assigned to
the area within the past 2 years. The approval level required for return assignment with less than
2 years is shown in Figure A19.3.
A19.10. AF/JAX is the approval authority for judge advocates for Washington, DC area total
time assigned requests to include extension of tours, consecutive assignments and assignments
with less than the 2 year interval.

 NOTES:
 1. Officers assigned to an organization which is not authorized a stabilized tour, assigned to an
 organization under the operational control of a MAJCOM, or who are assigned to an
 organization authorized a minimum stabilized tour but the officer's minimum stabilized tour
 AAC has expired, do not require an extension of total time assigned provided they remain
 assigned to their current organization and remain in place.

 2. When assignment is to a DOD activity, the extension must also be approved IAW the DOD
 activity extension approval requirements. If the assignment officer disapproves the extension
 request, it is not processed to the DOD approval authority.

 3. For disapproval, HQ AFPC/DPA may elevate the signature level for disapproval memo to a
 level appropriate for reply to the requester.

 4. For Secretariat and Air Staff tour extensions only, when HQ AFPC/DPA:

 a. Recommends approval then the extension must be finally approved as follows:

 (1) Up to 5 years on current Secretariat tour: The two position office within the Secretariat
 (Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or Director) must approve, with SAF/AAP
 coordination.

 (2) Up to 5 years on current Air Staff tour: The DCS, ACS, or comparable staff level must
 approve, with SAF/AAP coordination.

 (3) For more than 5 years on current Secretariat or Air Staff tour: SAF/AAP will coordinate
 and SAF/MIM must approve.

 b. Recommends disapproval of the extension, the requester may accept the disapproval or
 forward along with HQ AFPC/DPA recommendation to the approval authority (same as shown
 in note 4.1 above), with an information copy of the forwarding memo to HQ AFPC/DPA. If
 the approval authority approves the request, HQ AFPC/DPA may elevate the disagreement to
 AF/CVA for Air Staff, or SAF/ MI for the Secretariat, for resolution.

 NOTES:
 1. An operational assignment is defined as an assignment to a unit under the operational
 control of a MAJCOM and no stabilized tour is authorized for the organization or the Airman’s
 position. If the current organization or Airman’s current position is authorized a stabilized tour
 or projected organization or projected position is authorized a stabilized tour, then use the
 appropriate stabilized tour rule.

 2. Time assigned within the Washington, DC area as a student (AFIT, PME, formal training
 course) does not count towards the total time assigned.

 OS TOUR ELECTION, COMMAND SPONSORSHIP, INDIVIDUALLY SPONSORED
       DEPENDENTS, ACQUIRED DEPENDENTS, AND DEPENDENTS OS

A20.1. OS Tour Election.
   A20.1.1. An Airman with dependents must elect to serve an OS tour either accompanied by
   dependents or unaccompanied when he or she has accepted a PCS to an OS location where
   an accompanied tour is authorized (as shown in the JFTR, Volume 1, Appendix Q), and
   election of such a tour is not restricted (for example, by grade or by a CSPL). The Airman
   accomplishes this election by completing and signing AF Form 965, Oversea Tour Election
   Statement. A copy of the form is scanned and filed in ARMs and the assignment relocation
   folder. The purpose of the form is to record the Airman’s choice of OS tour and their
   understanding of the entitlements associated with their choice. Choosing an accompanied
   tour requires the Airman serve the usually longer accompanied tour length which, in turn,
   affects the amount of service retainability and/or ADSC associated with their election.
   Airmen must obtain any additional service retainability or accept the associated ADSC upon
   signing the AF Form 965 when: approval of concurrent travel (CCTVL) is automatic, when
   command sponsorship (and change of tour election to an accompanied tour) is being
   requested after arrival OS, or within 15 calendar days of the reply to an advance application
   for CCTVL. Airmen must not be permitted to receive or use any of the allowances
   associated with travel of dependents (or command sponsorship) without the full prescribed
   retainability. Airmen who have dependents must be briefed that they should not elect the
   unaccompanied tour at the time of PCS notification unless they are certain they do not, and
   will not at any time during their OS tour, desire to be accompanied by dependents. Airmen
   undecided or uncertain whether or not they want to be accompanied by dependents should be
   advised to elect the accompanied tour. Airmen can change their tour from accompanied to
   unaccompanied before departure on PCS or after arrival OS as shown below, and may
   request cancellation of an extension of enlistment, SPTC executed, or ADSC accepted for the
   purpose of serving an accompanied tour as authorized in the prescribing instruction for these
   actions.
   A20.1.2. Completion of a tour election is not required for an Airman who does not have
   dependents, or when there is no accompanied tour length authorized at the OS location (see
   the JFTR, Volume 1, Appendix Q), or when there is an accompanied tour length authorized
   at the location but the Airman is restricted from electing the accompanied tour (for example,
   when election of the accompanied tour is restricted by a CSPL, by grade, etc.).
   A20.1.3. Travel of dependents at government expense may be authorized concurrently with
   the Airman’s PCS travel when ―automatic‖ CCTVL is authorized as shown in the PCS
   Notification RIP. NOTE: If dependents delay CCTVL for personal reasons, they may travel
   later to the OS location under authority of the initial PCS order, (valid until subsequent PCS
   orders are published) provided Airman has 12 months remaining at the OS location upon
   arrival of dependents to the OS location.
   A20.1.4. When CCTVL of dependents is not automatic, the losing MPS will send an
   advance application requesting CCTVL per the PSD Handbook. The Airman is advised by
   the MPS of reply and is then required to make a tour election. A reply to the advance
374                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  application must be received before the Airman signs the AF Form 965. This advance
  request and reply does not take the place of the AF Form 1466, Request for Family Airman’s
  Medical and Education Clearance for Travel and Dependent Relocation Clearance which
  must be processed before OS travel of dependents may be authorized. The AF Form 1466 is
  used to advise the gaining medical treatment facility (MTF) of any medical or educational
  problems the dependents have so a determination can be made if proper medical care or
  school needs are available. Gaining MTFs reply to advance applications as soon as possible
  to ensure Airmen have the needed information to make a tour election. If the dependents are
  not cleared for travel, the MPS will counsel the member on options outlined in Attachments
  24 and 25, Humanitarian and EFMP. EXCEPTION: Students whose dependents are not
  collocated with them should be encouraged to elect the accompanied tour and obtain an
  approved AF Form 1466 while en route and hand carry it to the OS location.
      A20.1.4.1. If travel of dependents OS is approved but travel is not authorized concurrent
      with the sponsor's PCS travel, then the reply to the advance application must indicate the
      length of delay for dependent travel. The length of delay must be either:
      A20.1.4.2. Less than 20 weeks, in which case the Airman is entitled to move dependents
      at government expense only to the OS location. When it is determined at what time
      dependents will actually be authorized to travel, Airman and/or dependents can arrange
      transportation with the local TMO utilizing PCS orders, or
      A20.1.4.3. Twenty weeks or more, in which case the Airman is entitled to move
      dependents at government expense to a designated place while waiting authorization to
      move to the OS location. When it is determined at what time dependents will actually be
      authorized to travel, the OS MPS will issue dependent travel orders with appropriate
      instructions. If the dependents moved to a designated place awaiting further travel, they
      may move again at government expense to the OS duty location.
  A20.1.5. Before departure on PCS: An Airman who had dependents but initially elected an
  unaccompanied tour and who now wants to change his or her OS tour election to the
  accompanied tour, must be afforded the opportunity to change or make an election as soon as
  possible. This also applies to an Airman who acquires dependents before departure on PCS.
  See Table 3.6 for approval authority. An Airman who delays notifying the MPS of a change
  in status or when the change occurs too close to Airman’s PCS departure to permit routine
  dependent OS relocation processing (that is, as obtaining shots, passport/visa, dependent
  medical clearance, etc.) may have to proceed on PCS without dependents in order to comply
  with the RNLTD. In such cases, dependents may have to travel later to join the member after
  his or her arrival OS and only after dependent OS relocation processing has been completed.
  NOTE: If an Airman is considering moving dependents at personal expense (including to
  the OS area), they should be counseled by the Financial Services Office (FSO) to determine
  if, per the JFTR, they are entitled to reimbursement for expenses before issuance of written
  orders authorizing the movement of dependents at government expense.
  A20.1.6. After departure on PCS: After departure from current base on PCS, but before
  arrival at the next OS duty station, if a change occurs affecting a Airman’s previous tour
  election or requiring the Airman make an election (for example, the Airman gets married), he
  or she must normally wait until arrival at the next permanent duty station to request a change
  of tour election or to make an initial election unless marriage is to another military member
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 375


   who has dependents, then see Attachment 8, paragraph A8.6.1.3. After departure on PCS,
   Airmen who marry another military member who has dependents and the military couple
   wants to be assigned to the same location, must not wait until arrival at their next duty
   station. Although the circumstances vary, it is not practical for an MPS to attempt to assist
   Airmen who are en route PCS with a tour election change. Requesting approval from the OS
   duty station for travel of dependents (unless CCTVL is automatic), processing of dependents
   for OS travel (shots, passport/visa, dependent medical clearance, etc.), obtaining additional
   service retainability or additional ADSC, if necessary, and other actions normally completed
   at the losing base prior to departure are difficult or sometimes impossible to accomplish in a
   compressed period of time at an intermediate location. If an Airman en route PCS requests
   assistance from an MPS with a tour election change, approval of an exception per paragraph
   1.5 is required. Again, if marriage is to another military member, then see Attachment 8,
   paragraph A8.6.1.3; Airmen must not wait until arrival at the next duty station. NOTE: If
   an Airman is considering moving dependents at personal expense (including to the OS area),
   they should be counseled by the Financial Services Office (FSO) to determine if, per the
   JFTR, they are entitled to reimbursement for expenses before issuance of written orders
   authorizing the movement of dependents at government expense.
   A20.1.7. After arrival OS: A request for change of tour election from accompanied to
   unaccompanied must be approved according to the guidelines in Table 3.7. Normally the
   MPS can approve a request when dependents and/or HHG have not joined the member in the
   OS area at government expense. A request for change of tour election from unaccompanied
   to accompanied for the purpose of securing command sponsorship is included as a part of a
   Airman’s request for command sponsorship as shown in paragraph A20.2.
A20.2. Command Sponsorship. Command sponsorship is approval of the OS installation
commander or designated representative for dependents to reside with the Airman at the OS duty
station. See the JFTR, Volume 1, Appendix A, for definitions of dependents. Provided they meet
the eligibility criteria, Airmen will be given every opportunity to be granted command
sponsorship. While an Airman is not entitled by statute to command sponsorship or to serve an
accompanied tour, there are statutory entitlements associated with approval of command
sponsorship. Normally, for an Airman who has dependents at the time of initial PCS notification
and who elects the accompanied tour, approval of command sponsorship entitles an Airman to
receive OS station allowances at the "with dependents" rate, shipment of HHG and/or travel of
dependents to and from the OS duty station at government expense, and authorizes dependents to
receive other benefits and privileges associated with command sponsorship. When dependents
are not entitled to travel and/or shipment of HHG to the OS duty station at government expense
(for example, acquired dependents [see Attachment 1]), or when dependents travel to the OS
duty station at the Airman’s personal expense, then command sponsorship (with concurrent tour
status change) must be requested and approved according to paragraph A20.2.4.
   A20.2.1. An OS installation commander or designated representative evaluates requests
   from eligible Airmen and approves command sponsorship when the Airman satisfies all of
   the following eligibility criteria:
       A20.2.1.1. The Airman is projected to be assigned (or is currently assigned) to a duty
       location where an accompanied by dependents tour is authorized (see the JFTR, Volume
       1, Appendix Q), election of the accompanied tour is not restricted (such as by a
       Command Sponsored Position List (CSPL), by grade, etc.), and the Airman has
376                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      completed an AF Form 965 electing to serve the accompanied tour (may be either a
      change to a previous election or an initial election). EXCEPTION: Airmen assigned to
      Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the
      United States, who marry or adopt a person who is a bona fide resident of the state,
      commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, will be authorized station
      allowances as Airmen "with dependents." A bona fide resident is defined as a person
      who, before becoming a military dependent, made his or her actual and legal domicile in
      the state, commonwealth, territory, or possession. Transportation of dependents will be
      paid at government expense incident to PCS upon Airmen completing at least the
      unaccompanied OS tour length. This also applies to an employee of the United States
      stationed in the respective area. These allowances apply whether or not the Airmen
      elects to serve the accompanied tour length.
      A20.2.1.2. Travel of dependents to the OS duty station at government expense has not
      been prohibited or suspended by appropriate authority for any of the reasons listed in
      paragraph A20.4.3.
      A20.2.1.3. Adequate dependent support can be provided by local facilities if travel of
      dependents at government expense is involved. When an Airman has dependents (at time
      of issuance of PCS orders) and requests travel at government expense to the OS duty
      station, an AF Form 1466 and all supporting documentation must be processed according
      to AFI 40-701, Special Needs Identification and Assignment Coordination. However,
      when travel of dependents at government expense is not requested (for example, travel
      was at the Airman’s expense), or the Airman is not entitled to travel of dependents at
      government expense (for example, dependents were acquired after Airman’s arrival OS,
      or were not initially medically cleared for travel but traveled at Airman’s expense ), then
      an AF Form 1466 for the purpose of approving travel of dependents at government
      expense is not a prerequisite for approval of command sponsorship. However, command
      sponsorship requests not involving travel of dependents at government expense (acquired
      dependents or those that were not initially medically cleared for travel but traveled at
      Airman’s expense) must include the AF Form 4380, Special Needs Screener, and a
      statement of support/clearance from the local medical and/or education activity. The
      purpose of the statement of support/clearance is to enable local officials to identify a
      dependent with special educational needs to include related services incident to an
      individualized education program (IEP), or early intervention services incident to an
      individualized family service plan (IFSP). Identification of dependents who qualify under
      the EFMP ensures the Airman will receive counseling on the availability or lack of
      availability of facilities and will permit EFMP consideration in conjunction with their
      next assignment. Similarly, the statement of support/clearance is to enable local medical
      officials to identify individuals who may have medical problems which cannot be treated
      locally. Identification of dependents with medical problems which cannot be treated
      locally allows medical officials to recommend to the installation commander to deny
      command sponsorship and counsel Airmen in advance of independently sponsoring
      dependents on what they can anticipate in the event of a medical emergency . Installation
      commanders will then use the information and recommendations received to form the
      basis for approving or disapproving an Airman’s request. (NOTE: Command
      sponsorship can only be denied by the installation commander when special needs
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                377


     [medical/educational/developmental] cannot be accommodated at the overseas location as
     determined by the medical authorities.) If the installation commander does not want to
     grant command sponsorship for reasons other than inability to accommodate special
     needs, he/she must forward to the appropriate authority (see paragraph A20.2.3)
     A20.2.1.4. The Airmen possesses or is eligible to obtain the required service retainability
     and serve the ADSC associated with the accompanied tour length. Airmen who are
     ineligible to obtain retainability are ineligible for command sponsorship. It is not
     considered denial of command sponsorship when an Airman cannot satisfy the
     retainability requirements for approval of command sponsorship. This includes Airmen
     that are not permitted to extend their tour to the equivalent of the accompanied tour
     length due to critical impact of the Air Force mission.
  A20.2.2. After arrival OS, approval of a Airman’s request for command sponsorship results
  in an adjustment of DEROS as shown in Table 3.8. A tour election change is not an
  extension of OS tour (although many of the extension procedures are used), and is therefore
  not subject to disapproval for the same reasons as a request for extension of OS tour.
  However, the extension request can be denied by the AFPC functional manager for critical
  impact of Air Force mission. (NOTE: Airmen serving on an unaccompanied extended long
  tour who request and receive command sponsorship must serve the accompanied tour plus 12
  months. The intent is to maintain equity and fairness for the selection priority of those who
  volunteered and were selected for an extended long tour over those that volunteered for a
  standard tour.)
  A20.2.3. Revoking or denying command sponsorship to an Airman who meets all of the
  eligibility requirements may only be authorized by the SAF (this does not include denial due
  to lack of special services, see paragraph A20.2.1.3). Command sponsorship may not be
  disapproved due to quality control problems of either the Airman or dependents or based on
  the criteria normally considered for OS tour extension requests. (EXCEPTION: Command
  sponsorship may be disapproved if Airman is unable, due to critical impact of AF mission, to
  extend their tour to serve at least the accompanied tour length required to grant command
  sponsorship.) A request to revoke or deny command sponsorship must be originated by the
  installation commander with information copy to the MPS. Requests will contain a complete
  description of the situation and address why approval of command sponsorship would not be
  in the best interests of the AF, the Airman, and/or dependents. Requests will be forwarded to
  HQ AFPC/DPAPP. HQ AFPC/DPAPP will make a recommendation and forward to
  AF/A1PPA, who will also make a recommendation and forward to SAF for a final decision.
  A20.2.4. Airmen serving OS on an unaccompanied tour must request and receive approval
  of command sponsorship. Approval of command sponsorship is also approval of an
  accompanied tour election. An Airman’s request must be submitted to the installation
  commander or designated representative and must include:
     A20.2.4.1. Reason for request and justification.
     A20.2.4.2. Date departed last duty station and date departed CONUS.
     A20.2.4.3. If applicable, address to which dependents and HHG were moved incident to
     Airman’s PCS to current location.
378                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


      A20.2.4.4. Name of spouse and name, age, sex, and relationship of all dependents for
      whom command sponsorship is requested.
      A20.2.4.5. Location of dependents and HHG at the present time, and whether dependents
      and/or HHG were shipped to present location at government expense or Airman’s
      expense.
      A20.2.4.6. If applicable, place to which the government last paid for movement of
      dependents and/or HHG if other than as shown in paragraph A20.2.4.3 or A20.2.4.4,
      and include why movement from that place to current location was made.
      A20.2.4.7. Copy of PCS orders directing PCS to current OS duty station including all
      amendments.
      A20.2.4.8. If applicable, the waiting period for move of dependents to the OS area.
      Attach a copy of the reply to the Airman’s advance application for CCTVL.
      A20.2.4.9. If applicable, copy of previous AF Forms 965 executed and a signed copy of
      AF Form 965 with new election.
      A20.2.4.10. Copy of any previous AF Forms 1466 (approved or disapproved) executed
      in connection with PCS to current location, if applicable. As stated in paragraph
      A20.2.1.3, an AF Form 1466 processed in support of the current request (including when
      travel of dependents at government expense is not involved, as in the case of acquired
      dependents) should be included. Requests which do not include an AF Form 1466 or AF
      Form 4380 with medical statement of availability of services will preclude the installation
      commander or designated representative from making a determination on the Airman’s
      request.
  A20.2.5. When an Airman, who has dependents and those dependents were dependents at
  the time PCS orders were issued, requests command sponsorship (and change of tour status
  from unaccompanied to accompanied) and as outlined in Table 3.7 has used the government
  transportation allowance for his or her family and/or HHG, then the Airman must submit a
  request through the installation commander or designated representative with the information
  required by paragraphs A20.2.4 to HQ AFPC/DPAPP. HQ AFPC/ DPAPP will approve or
  disapprove, or it may be necessary to process the request to a higher level. The intent is to
  grant a change of tour only in cases where it is proven that the main reason the Airman chose
  the unaccompanied tour and/or moved either dependents or HHG at government expense,
  was due to official AF actions. The Airman must show that an official AF action caused the
  use of transportation allowances and, had it not been for the AF's action, it would clearly
  have been the Airman’s intent to have dependents accompany him or her at the OS duty
  station. Official AF actions are written directions from AF officials responsible to issue such
  directions as part of their official duty that caused an Airman to use his or her transportation
  allowancess.
  A20.2.6. If one member of a married military couple separates or retires from an OS station
  and remains in the vicinity of the duty station of the military spouse who is serving the
  accompanied tour length, the separating or retiring member may be command sponsored
  effective the day following the last day of active duty. If the military spouse is not serving an
  accompanied tour, he or she must be eligible to request and obtain approval of command
  sponsorship to receive the associated allowances.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  379


  A20.2.7. Command sponsorship of a dependent may be transferred to another military
  sponsor provided the acquired dependent has been command sponsored at least 12 months
  preceding transfer. For example, a command sponsored dependent marries an Airman who
  is serving an unaccompanied tour. The new sponsor does not have to serve an accompanied
  tour in order for the dependent to receive travel at government expense upon completion of
  the new sponsor's tour.
  A20.2.8. Children born to command-sponsored dependent spouses are command-sponsored
  at birth (however, an AF Form 1466 or statement of support/clearance is needed to ensure
  adequate dependent support can be provided by local facilities). Children born to command-
  sponsored dependents that are not the spouse of the member (for example, grandchildren) are
  not eligible for sponsorship, unless they become legal dependents through separate action.
  A20.2.9. An Airman who was accompanied at the current duty station by command
  sponsored dependents and returns dependents early and is later joined by those same
  dependents at the Airman’s expense, may again have the dependents command sponsored
  provided the sponsor (Airman) does not have an ASD for PCS from the current duty station
  and has at least 24 months remaining on his or her OS tour after approval of command
  sponsorship.
  A20.2.10. An Airman who early returns command sponsored dependents as a result of
  divorce may have newly acquired dependents command sponsored. It is not necessary for
  the Airman to obtain additional theater retainability. Command sponsorship carries over to
  the new spouse and/or dependents; however, government funded travel to the OS location is
  not authorized as there are no travel and transportation allowances for acquired dependents.
  (See JFTR, Volume 1, U5203 and Appendix A.)
  A20.2.11. The effective date of approval of command sponsorship is the date by the
  installation commander or designated representative, the date of approval for requests
  forwarded to a higher headquarters, or the date of arrival of dependents in the OS area in
  instances where movement at government expense is involved, whichever is later.
  A20.2.12. Airmen that have dependents at the time PCS orders are issued who initially elect
  an unaccompanied tour and later want to bring their dependents to the OS location, must
  apply for command sponsorship IAW A20.2.4. above. They must serve the accompanied
  tour length for that location and have 12 months left on the tour after arrival of dependents or
  approval date of command-sponsorship, whichever is later. This time is to off-set the cost to
  the government to move the family to the OS location.
  A20.2.13. Airmen that do not have dependents at the time PCS orders are issued and later
  acquire dependents and wish to have them command-sponsored are not authorized
  government travel and transportation allowances (includes HHG shipment) to the overseas
  location. However, they will be authorized travel and transportation allowances (including
  HHG) on their subsequent PCS. They must agree to serve the prescribed accompanied tour
  length and have service retainability. If the member is already serving the equivalent of the
  accompanied tour, command sponsorship shall be immediate upon acquiring dependents or
  upon arrival of the dependents in the overseas area. However, they must still submit the
  command-sponsorship request IAW paragraph A20.2.4 above. (NOTE: Airmen initially
  serving an unaccompanied tour who elect and have entered an OTEIP extension and
  subsequently acquire dependents and apply for command sponsorship will keep their OTEIP
 380                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   entitlement. However, Airmen initially serving an unaccompanied tour who elect and have
   NOT entered an OTEIP at the time of acquiring dependents and applying for command
   sponsorship will have their OTEIP cancelled [see A15.6.3] but will still have to extend to
   fulfill the requirement to serve the equivalent of the accompanied tour length for approval of
   command sponsorship.)
A20.3. Individually Sponsored Dependents and Acquired Dependents. An individually
sponsored dependent (sometimes referred to as noncommand sponsored dependent) is one who
either was not entitled to travel to a Airman’s OS duty station at government expense, or who
may have been entitled to travel at government expense but travels to the OS duty station without
approval of the OS installation commander. An acquired dependent is one who became a
dependent after the start of a Airman’s current OS tour (such as by marriage, adoption, etc.). See
the JFTR, Volume 1, Appendix A, for definition of acquired dependents. This term does not
include persons dependent upon the Airman before the start of Airman’s current OS tour. The
tour status of Airmen with individually sponsored dependents or acquired dependents is not
automatically changed from unaccompanied to accompanied, nor are dependents automatically
granted command sponsorship. When an Airman wants command sponsorship of individually
sponsored or acquired dependents, he or she must submit a request IAW paragraph A20.2 and
receive approval.
   A20.3.1. A change of tour election or command sponsorship is not required when
   dependents are vacationing or visiting OS in a tourist status.
   A20.3.2. See paragraph A20.2.1.1 for members assigned to Alaska, Hawaii, the
   Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States, who marry
   or adopt a person who is a bona fide resident of the state, commonwealth, territory, or
   possession of the United States.
A20.4. Dependents OS. Military dependents are citizens in their own right of the United States
or foreign nations, so the AF is limited in what it may prohibit or direct with regard to dependent
travel.
   A20.4.1. Unless travel OS is prohibited by the Department of State or the host country
   denies entry, military dependents may travel at their own expense to any foreign country.
   When they do so, both the dependents and the Airman should understand that the dependents
   may not be protected by existing Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs).
   A20.4.2. Any dependent residing OS may be requested by a military commander to depart
   the OS location. However, neither the commander nor the AF may require dependents to
   leave a foreign country. Requiring that dependents leave a foreign country is an action which
   may only be taken by the government of the host nation under normal diplomatic protocol.
   However, the AF may take steps within its authority, including Secretarial denial or
   revocation of command sponsorship (which would, in turn, terminate OS station allowances),
   restricting dependents' access to the installation and/or facilities, denial of privileges such as
   use of exchange, commissary, and so on.
   A20.4.3. The decision to authorize dependent travel OS at government expense is based on
   the standard of living, general desirability of the location, adequacy of dependent support
   facilities, political climate in the foreign country, possible adverse affect the presence of
   dependents may have on mission accomplishment, operational readiness, or combat
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             381


  capability. Normally, dependent travel at government expense shall not be authorized to any
  OS location where one or more of the above factors is significantly unfavorable.
  A20.4.4. All dependents in an OS area will be furnished medical care. Medical care is based
  on dependency status, not on command sponsorship. Not all OS locations have adequate
  medical facilities to care for all medical conditions. Accordingly, medical care for
  dependents who are not command sponsored is provided according to medical guidelines and
  priorities.
 382                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


                                        Attachment 21
 ASSIGNMENT OF NON-PRIOR SERVICE (NPS) PIPELINE STUDENTS (ENLISTED
                             ONLY)

A21.1. Assignment Processing Responsibilities and Procedures.
   A21.1.1. HQ AFPC. Distributes available Operational Training Graduates (OTG) to the
   MAJCOMs on an equal basis by matching OTGs to their end assignment and providing
   instructions to the Contact Center through either the PDS or by e-mail. PDD and RNLTD
   will be based upon graduation date plus 25 days for CONUS assignments and graduation
   date plus 40 days for OS assignments.
       A21.1.1.1. Assignment selection criteria for CONUS assignments. Airmen are arranged
       and matched in order of grade, DOR, TAFMSD, date of birth (DOB) (earliest to latest)
       and then, if necessary, in reverse SSN order.
       A21.1.1.2. Assignment selection criteria for OS assignments. Arrange Airmen in the
       same order as above and match volunteers first; then for non-volunteers, reverse the order
       of the list so the junior non-volunteer is selected first and the senior non-volunteer is
       selected last.
A21.2. Training Wing (TRW) Responsibilities.
   A21.2.1. The 319th Training Squadron at Lackland AFB will report basic military training
   (BMT) students classification no later than the end of the fourth week of training.
   Immediately after classification, they will schedule and update in the Air Force Training
   Management System (AFTMS) all training required for award of the 3-skill level
   AFSC.A21.2.2. TRW registrars will report the students entry into operational training
   school, a change in technical training schedule, or completion of technical school to
   2AF/XPAC.
   A21.2.2. Schedule students for wing-controlled follow-on training immediately upon entry
   into the basic course at the training wing.
   A21.2.3. 2AF/XPAC reports any changes to course identification number to HQ
   AFPC/DPAA5 by message or e-mail as soon as possible after the class has been activated.
A21.3. MPS Student Assignment Section.
   A21.3.1. The MPS will notify the student, through the unit commander, of the assignment
   within 5 duty days after receipt. The MPS will also establish a relocation folder and notify
   the training squadron of all necessary actions for the assignment, according to AFI 36-2102,
   Base- Level Relocation Procedures.
   A21.3.2. PCS orders should be accomplished and forwarded to the Airman as soon as
   possible after receipt of the assignment if no special processing requirements exist (i.e.,
   PRP/SCI requirements, medical/dental clearances, AF Form 1466, AF Form 965, etc.).
   A21.3.3. PCS orders for assignments with special requirements or PPCs, such as those stated
   above, will be accomplished upon completion of all mandatory requirements. The chief of
   the student assignments section will establish local procedures to ensure special requirements
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              383


   are accomplished in the most expedient manner. The process for requirements to be
   completed and orders processed for the student should be completed within 15 duty days.
A21.4. Student SWAP Program. This voluntary program was established to afford NPS student
Airmen who are assigned in a PCS status at a TRW or GSU the chance to swap assignments with
another student before they graduate from technical training. Interested students are solely
responsible for finding another student who wants to swap assignments. A SWAP involves two
or more NPS students (AB through A1C). NOTE: If a TTG has an approved follow-on
assignment he/she is ineligible to swap, unless extenuating circumstances apply.
   A21.4.1. Eligibility Criteria. Airmen must:
       A21.4.1.1. Not have been notified of pending elimination from training.
       A21.4.1.2. Be projected graduates of the same course.
       A21.4.1.3. Meet or be able to satisfy all special requirements and PPC requirements
       before graduation.
       A21.4.1.4. Have the same Air Force specialty code (AFSC) including the same prefix
       and/or suffix (this does not apply to Airmen who are attending the same phase I core
       course that is common to more than one AFSC).
       A21.4.1.5. Have a class graduation date within 30 calendar days of each other.
       A21.4.1.6. Not have an assignment as a result of a SWAP (AAR SS). NOTE: Only one
       approved swap is permitted.
       A21.4.1.7. Be a US citizen if assignment is to OS (with exception of Alaska and
       Hawaii). Non- US citizens are ineligible for a SWAP to an OS assignment (other than
       Alaska or Hawaii).
       A21.4.1.8. Be a US citizen if the assignment requires access to classified information.
       Non-US citizens are ineligible for a SWAP to an assignment requiring access to
       classified information.
       A21.4.1.9. Not have a UIF or have administrative actions pending which will result in
       the establishment of a UIF, if the assignment is to an OS area.
A21.5. AB through A1C may swap assignments with each other.              (There are no grade
restrictions for NPS students).
A21.6. SWAP Procedures:
   A21.6.1. The SWAP request must be submitted to the MPS student assignment section not
   later than 4 workdays after the student is notified of his or her assignment.
   A21.6.2. The MPS reports SWAP requests by e-mail within 3 duty days to DPAA5 for
   processing. The MPS ensures all pertinent information is contained in the reporting of
   SWAPs. The following format will be used: NAME/SSN/OLD GPAS/NEW GPAS/AAN/
   AFSC/GRAD DT/REMARKS.
   A21.6.3. A change of either assignment after a SWAP has been approved does not cancel
   the SWAP action (i.e., if either Airman’s assignment was changed the other would continue
   to the swapped assignment).
 384                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A21.6.4. Within 3 duty days, DPAA5 will process the request for a SWAP and either
   approve and update the PDS, or contact the MPS/GSU notifying them of disapproval.
   A21.6.5. As an exception to the above, students attending Phase II medical training in
   AFSCs 4H0X1, 4J0X1, 4R0X1, 4T0X1 or 4T0X2 may apply for a SWAP regardless of their
   training location. These Airmen must be reported to DPAA5 in the same manner described
   above by the MPS servicing the training location. (NOTE: Both MPS’ will maintain a copy
   of the SWAP request of each Airman and the MPS servicing the Airman whose last name
   occurs first in alphabetical order will submit the requests to the assignment OPR.).
   A21.6.6. The Airmen involved must concur with the SWAP assignments in writing.
A21.7. Follow-on (FO) Assignment Program.
   A21.7.1. TRW’s will refer to Attachment 5, for complete guidance on the FO assignment
   program. Airmen selected for a dependent-restricted assignment (NA/12 locations), or who
   elect an unaccompanied short tour (24/15 or 24/12 locations) will be briefed during their
   initial assignment briefing.
   A21.7.2. TRW’s will allow Airmen 3 duty days to complete their application or decline
   participation in writing.
   A21.7.3. Airmen may apply for up to 16 preferences (8 CONUS and 8 OS, which can reflect
   specific bases, states, regions, locales, or countries).
   A21.7.4. Method of submitting requests from the technical training wing to HQ AFPC will
   vary based on the Airman’s PDD. Airmen with a PDD of more than 150 days from the ASD
   will have their requests updated by the TRW via PDS, utilizing the remarks area to identify
   requested state or region/locale areas, if desired. The transaction will generate an in-system
   request to the appropriate assignment OPR approximately 120 days prior to the Airman’s
   PDD. In-system approval or disapproval from the assignment OPR will take place through
   PDS within 10 duty days after receipt. Airmen with a PDD within 150 days from ASD
   should have their preferences forwarded to the assignment OPR by e-mail or fax. The
   assignment OPR will process these requests through the appropriate assignment OPR within
   5 duty days and, if necessary, advise the TRW of disapproval through message, CRT, or e-
   mail.
   A21.7.5. Airmen must receive approval or disapproval prior to departure and those with
   approved FO assignments must have the pertinent information reflected in their PCS orders.
A21.8. Deferment of NPS Students.
   A21.8.1. BMT Students. The following deferments or conditions prohibit the PDS from
   automatically classifying and matching BMT student assignments.
       A21.8.1.1. Medical/Dental Hold. Deferred with AAC 31, Table 2.1 and DOA as set by
       the Medical/Dental Facility.
       A21.8.1.2. Recommended for Separation. Defer with AAC 73 with DOA 6 months from
       date of recommendation. If previously classified, cancel projected assignment to
       technical training wing and update the Primary, Control, and Duty AFSC to 9T000.
       A21.8.1.3. HQ USAF or MAJCOM Hold.             Airmen identified by the Airman
       Classification Squadron as having unique needs which will have a bearing on their
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               385


      assignment. On approval from 2AF/XPAC, the Airman is placed in AAC 70 with a
      DOA equal to their graduation date from BMT. If not resolved by that date, the Airman
      Classification Squadron Commander will place a statement on the DD Form 4,
      Enlistment/Reenlistment Document, Armed Forces of the United States, waiving the
      problem. The DOA must never exceed the BMT graduation date.
      A21.8.1.4. Airman Classification Squadron Assessment Branch. Airmen identified for
      special processing by the assessment branch will be placed in AAC 25 with a DOA 1
      workday before classification of the week group. A later DOA may be input manually.
      A21.8.1.5. Enlisted Under the Guarantee AFSC Program. Airmen are placed in AAC 71
      with a DOA equal to BMT graduation date.
      A21.8.1.6. Join Spouse Applicants. Airmen are placed in AAC 69 with a DOA equal to
      BMT graduation date. The Airman Classification Squadron will ensure a join spouse
      requirement is considered during classification so that compatible AFSCs are selected.
      A21.8.1.7. Other. Airmen in a duty status code other than present for duty (code 00) are
      not considered for classification or reassignment.
A21.9. Delaying a PCS Move for a NPS Student. PCS moves for NPS students may not be
delayed except:
   A21.9.1. When a humanitarian or EFMP assignment request is pending.
   A21.9.2. When a join spouse application is pending.
   A21.9.3. When PCS involves a female Airman who is pregnant or an Airman whose wife is
   pregnant, consistent with pregnancy deferment procedures in this instruction (see
   paragraphs 2.38 and 2.39).
   A21.9.4. When the student is under consideration for a selectively manned or special-duty
   assignment.
   A21.9.5. When pending completion of additional assignment processing actions required by
   a PPC or awaiting approval to proceed on assignment.
   A21.9.6. When pending a response to an application for concurrent travel.
   A21.9.7. When the student is placed on Commander Directed Hold (AAC 21) or Under
   AFOSI/ Security Forces Investigation (AAC 17). Commanders will validate the need to
   retain a student for further observation or contemplated administrative action. Once
   validated, the commander must immediately initiate a request to place the Airman on hold.
   The commander’s request includes: grade, name, SSN, CAFSC, student status (projected
   graduation date, date eliminated, and so forth), applicable AAC from Table 2.1 (if different
   than AAC 21), rationale for action, and DOA. The request must be hand-carried or
   electronically transmitted/faxed to the MPS student assignment section to prevent student
   departure. If the commander determines the Airman is about to depart the base, notify the
   MPS student assignment section telephonically to prevent departure. In these cases, written
   confirmation as described above is required within 1 duty day. If there is a disagreement
   between the commander and the MPS regarding a request, it is elevated to the next higher
   level of command until resolved.
 386                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


       A21.9.7.1. MPS’ must establish procedures to make sure action is taken to prevent
       departure of an Airman upon receipt of a commander’s request. In addition, commanders
       will set up procedures to ensure the hold request is provided to the MPS student
       assignment section.
       A21.9.7.2. When circumstances which required the Airman to be delayed cease to exist
       and the Airman is qualified for reassignment, the commander takes immediate action to
       release the Airman, in writing. This notification is provided to the MPS student
       assignment section.
A21.10. Assignment of Military Couples Involving TTGs. (See Attachment 8 for complete
guidance on the join spouse assignment program).
   A21.10.1. In those situations where the student was married to another military member
   prior to BMT and intent code was updated via vMPF, no further action is needed to affect
   join spouse consideration. However, when the marriage occurs at the training location or
   after graduation, the following applies:
   A21.10.2. Airmen must update join spouse intent code and submit a ―hard-copy‖ join spouse
   application (see Figure A8.1) to request join spouse assignment consideration as soon as
   possible after the date of marriage.
       A21.10.2.1. The MPS verifies the Airman’s eligibility, update PDS, suspenses a copy of
       the application, and notifies DPAA5 via e-mail (info spouse’s MPS, if applicable).
       Notification should include the following information on each Airman:
          A21.10.2.1.1. Name (Last, First, Middle Initial).
          A21.10.2.1.2. Grade.
          A21.10.2.1.3. SSN.
          A21.10.2.1.4. CAFSC.
          A21.10.2.1.5. Graduation Date.
          A21.10.2.1.6. Current unit of assignment.
          A21.10.2.1.7. Requested assignment location.
          A21.10.2.1.8. Date of marriage and Join Spouse Intent Code.
          A21.10.2.1.9. The following mandatory statement: ―The marriage certificate has
          been verified and join spouse application is on file in the MPS.‖
          A21.10.2.1.10. If one spouse is a member of another branch of the Armed Forces,
          written confirmation from that member confirming that join spouse is desired must be
          submitted with the join spouse application. Include the spouse’s rank, name, SSN,
          AFSC or MOS, job title, current duty location, and, if known, the name, rank, and
          DSN of spouse’s assignment clerk.
   A21.10.3. HQ AFPC/DPAA5 provides the MPS the final decision via e-mail. The MPS
   uses this authority to reassign students. Students must not depart until the MPS receives the
   final decision from the assignment OPR. PDS notification confirming approval (PTI 517)
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  387


   will follow depending on proximity of graduation date (NOTE: Do not delay processing
   pending PDS confirmation).
   A21.10.4. Students indicating they will marry en route PCS must be counseled not to delay
   applying for join spouse assignment until arrival at the new duty location. Advise them to
   report immediately to the nearest AF installation to apply. The Airman will not be
   reimbursed for travel in conjunction with such application and will remain in leave status
   (delay en route) while the application is pending.
   A21.10.5. Airmen will not be retrained for the sole purpose of making a join spouse
   assignment for 12 months after graduation from technical training. However, with approval
   of 2AF/XPAC, they may be transferred to another course before school entry or if the
   training already received is applicable to the new course.
A21.11. Student Quality Control Procedures.
   A21.11.1. Airmen (including graduates, eliminees, and unqualified students) who cannot or
   will not meet acceptable standards of conduct or duty performance are identified and
   separated from the Air Force.
   A21.11.2. All administrative or judicial actions, initiated or contemplated, are completed
   before the Airman is reassigned.
   A21.11.3. NPS student assignments are mandatory PCS moves, but only to CONUS
   locations.
   A21.11.4. The losing commander notifies the gaining commander, in writing, when a
   student is recommended for assignment and administrative action has been established.
   Include an explanation of the Airmen’s situation and the specific actions taken. If further
   action is desirable, but impractical, the specific reason for precluding further action must be
   fully explained.
   A21.11.5. Airmen (including graduates, eliminees, and unqualified students) are not
   assigned to or allowed to leave for any OS location or any CONUS location where a quality-
   control-oriented PPC applies AAC 10-21, excluding 14 (this does not include PRP), without
   the approval of HQ AFPC/ DPAPP.
A21.12. Security Clearance and Access to Classified Information.
   A21.12.1. Only those TTGs requiring a security clearance for award of an AFSC should be
   placed in involuntary hold status. MPS’ must ensure that SCI nomination packages are
   forwarded to the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) by the local Security Police
   Investigative Office.
   A21.12.2. MPS’ will establish procedures to ensure security clearance requests for
   investigation are initiated no later than 3 duty days after receipt of the assignment
   notification. All initial clearance processing will be completed no later than 30 days after
   receipt or the graduation date, whichever is sooner.
A21.13. Return of Graduated Students En Route PCS.
   A21.13.1. Commanders have the ultimate responsibility of ensuring only quality personnel
   are retained in the AF and permitted to be reassigned. When an individual has departed on
   PCS but not arrived at the gaining location, the decision to cancel his or her assignment for
 388                                                         AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   the purpose of returning to the previous duty station must serve the overall best interests of
   the AF. Due to the PCS cost and personal hardship that may result, an individual who has
   departed on PCS will only be directed to return to the previous duty station upon approval of
   the assignment OPR and DPAA5 after it is determined the action for which return is
   requested cannot be completed at the gaining unit. Requests to return an individual for the
   purpose of administering disciplinary actions (Article 15, Letter of Reprimand, or Control
   Roster) will normally be disapproved. The gaining commander can administer these actions.
   Airmen may, however, be returned for involuntary separation, court-martial, completion of
   an OSI investigation, etc. It is the decision of the assignment OPR to cancel an Airman’s
   assignment that actually causes the Airman’s return to the previous duty station.
   A21.13.2. A commander considering requesting the return of an individual who has departed
   PCS but who has not arrived at the gaining location must:
       A21.13.2.1. Contact the local Staff Judge Advocate to determine the legal sufficiency
       and determine if return is necessary.
          A21.13.2.1.1. If determined to be legally sufficient, contact the MPS Commander
          who will provide HQ AFPC/DPAPP the specifics of the case for their
          approval/disapproval. These actions are normally completed on the same day of the
          request.
       A21.13.2.2. If return is approved, the commander notifies the individual by telephone or
       overnight express mail. Telephonic notification is recommended as long as the
       conversation is witnessed and an appropriate memo for record is prepared. The
       commander must give the individual a specific RNLTD for his or her return. If the
       individual lacks funds for the return trip, advise him or her to report to the nearest
       Financial Service Office (FSO) with original PCS orders to obtain necessary funds and/or
       commercial tickets for the return travel.
       A21.13.2.3. Airmen returning must in-process through the MPS. If involuntary
       separation or commander hold (AAC 21) is being initiated, the individual must be
       notified in writing of the action and its ramifications prior to implementation.
       A21.13.2.4. Upon Airman’s return, the MPS (Personnel Employment Section) will gain
       the Airman back to file. The original orders must be rescinded with a statement in the
       remarks that the Airman was ordered to return to the losing base (CONUS base) from
       their leave address (state location) by the commander. The MPS will ensure the FSO
       receives a copy of the rescission orders.
A21.14. Disposition of First Time Technical Training Eliminees.
   A21.14.1. NPS students who eliminate from their training course will be evaluated for
   retention in the Air Force. If the behavior or action that resulted in the elimination from
   training is grounds for separation, proper action is taken. If, after evaluation, it is decided to
   retain the Airman, then the following applies:
       A21.14.1.1. The MPS sends a message or e-mail to 2AF/XPAC with an information
       copy to HQ AFPC/DPAA5 (AETC/SGPS on Airmen eliminated from medical training)
       within 3 duty days after the elimination is formally approved, or 3 duty days after the
       decision to retain the Airman was made. Report disqualified Airmen according to AFI
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                               389


     36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). Message or e-mail will
     include the following:
         A21.14.1.1.1. Grade, name, SSN, AFSC, physical profile (PULHESX), color vision
         normal (yes or no), depth perception normal (yes or no), and whether the Airman
         possesses a current state driver’s license (yes or no).
         A21.14.1.1.2. Course from which eliminated. Include the course length, start date,
         and date of final elimination action. For unqualified students, indicate only the AFSC
         for which Airman is unqualified.
         A21.14.1.1.3. Reasons for elimination as stated in the counseling records.        For
         unqualified students, indicate the reasons for disqualification.
         A21.14.1.1.4. Up to 6 AFSC preferences for which the Airman qualifies. If
         applicable, include a summary of the individual’s experience or interests that may
         assist in reclassification.
         A21.14.1.1.5. If further technical training is not recommended, give specific
         rationale why administrative separation action was not taken.
         A21.14.1.1.6. A complete account of all actions contained in the Airman’s UIF, if
         applicable.
         A21.14.1.1.7. Any other facts, recommendations, or information that will assist in
         determining a disposition that is in the best interest of the AF. Comments should
         include whether the Airman is PRP certifiable, Airman’s attitude and motivation,
         along with any other pertinent factors. Also, include commander’s recommendation.
  A21.14.2. If reentry into another technical training course is decided, 2AF advises the MPS
  and DPAA5 of the reclassification AFSC and course data. DPAA5 will update the PAFSC
  and CAFSC and the MPS will update the DAFSC to the new AFSC using PDS. If training is
  at an alternate location, DPAA5 will provide assignment instructions for the PCS or TDY
  (depending on the course length) to the appropriate TRW.
  A21.14.3. To ensure prompt disposition, 2AF and DPAA5 will complete their required
  actions after receipt of eliminee or unqualified student reports. Each level of review must
  complete their action within 3 duty days after receipt.
  A21.14.4. Commanders must avoid multiple (more than once) reclassification of students
  who clearly do not meet acceptable standards. This includes standards of academics,
  performance, conduct, bearing and behavior, discipline, medical, or any characteristic that
  does not promote accomplishment of the AF’s mission. When students are recommended for
  reclassification more than once, the approval authority is the group commander.

                                       Attachment 22
PCS OF MEMBERS DIRECTED UNDER AUTHORITY OF ANOTHER PRESCRIBING
  INSTRUCTION (LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND BELOW AND ALL ENLISTED)

A22.1. Introduction. While the term ―assignments‖ is frequently used to describe all PCSs, the
fact is there are various types of PCS moves directed by OPRs not within the HQ AFPC
Directorate of Assignments which are made under the authority of another prescribing
instruction. As a reminder, with the exception of patient assignments, assignment OPRs within
the HQ AFPC Directorate of Assignments are responsible for only operational, rotational, force
structure, and training PCSs.
A22.2. PCS in Conjunction With Other Actions. The following PCSs, with the exception of
some patient assignments, are directed by OPRs outside the HQ AFPC Directorate of
Assignments. The OPR for the action concerned is the OPR for the PCS and is the PCS
Authority.
   A22.2.1. Accession PCSs (except for medical officers which is HQ AFPC/DPAM). OPR is
   HQ AFPC/DPPA. With the exception of those designated at the discretion of the Secretary
   and Chief of Staff, assignments of all USAF Academy graduate accessions or members
   cross- commissioning from other Service Academies will be assigned at or below the wing
   level.
   A22.2.2. PCS in conjunction with separation and retirement (includes for processing of
   administrative separation/discharge). OPR is HQ AFPC/DPPR.
   A22.2.3. PCS of patients to a medical treatment facility (MTF) or between MTFs. OPR can
   be either the gaining MTF Commander or HQ AFPC/DPAMM, Medical Standards Branch
   IAW AFI 41-210. Upon release from assignment to the MTF, Airmen will be reported to
   HQ AFPC/DPAMM who, in turn, will request the assignment OPR direct reassignment as
   appropriate.
   A22.2.4. PCS of prisoners to a confinement facility (including from OS to a CONUS
   facility) or between confinement facilities. OPR is AF Corrections.
   A22.2.5. PCS of Airmen to locations near their HOR who are placed in appellate leave
   status incident to court-martial conviction. OPR is AF/JA.
   A22.2.6. PCS or TDY related to judicial proceedings (court-martial or other reasons when
   directed by the MAJCOM/JA) according to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice.
   OPR is AF/JA.
A22.3. How PCSs Differ. The PCSs listed in paragraph A22.2 (frequently referred to as
assignments) differ from those authorized by this instruction in the following major ways:
   A22.3.1. The selection process (qualifications, ODSD/STRD, DAS, TOS, retainability, and
   so on) prescribed in this instruction to determine which individual will be selected for PCS
   does not apply.
   A22.3.2. The purpose of the PCS is not to fill a valid manpower authorization at the gaining
   location and/or the have the Airman perform duty in his/her AFSC.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    391


   A22.3.3. The PCSs are not projected in the PDS and do not need an operational, rotational,
   or training AAN. The Airman is ―assigned‖ using unprojected gain procedures provided in
   the PSD Handbook.
   A22.3.4. It may not be appropriate for the cost of the PCS to be charged to the same PCS ID
   codes used for operational, rotational, and training assignments.
   A22.3.5. It is incorrect to cite AFI 36-2110, Assignments, as the ―authority‖ for the PCS.
   A22.3.6. 7-day option procedures do not apply.
A22.4. Similarities of the PCSs. Similarities do exist between the PCSs listed in paragraph
A22.2 and those authorized by this instruction and directed by the assignment OPRs shown in
Table 1. They include:
   A22.4.1. The Airman may change unit of assignment and/or make a permanent change of
   station.
   A22.4.2. Most of the moves involve an order directing the PCS.
   A22.4.3. The PCS allowances Airmen may accrue may be different for each kind of PCS.
   A22.4.4. Because relocation is involved, MPS’ assist those agencies directing the PCS and
   in processing the Airman for PCS.

                                        Attachment 23
       ADVANCE ASSIGNMENT/DEFERMENT FOR DEPLOYED AIRMEN (AAD)
                       (ENLISTED AND OFFICERS)

A23.1. Purpose. The AAD program is designed to allow all Airmen (enlisted and officer) who
otherwise qualify to request an advance assignment or an in-place 24 month assignment
deferment once they become eligible. The program recognizes a commitment to our Airmen
who have served an uncharacteristically long tour of arduous duty in service to the United States
of America.
A23.2. Eligibility Criteria.
   A23.2.1. Must have served a tour of duty of at least 300 consecutive days in a 365 day
   period in a location that is authorized hazardous duty pay.
   A23.2.2. CONUS based Airmen must have a minimum of 36 months TOS as of PCS
   departure date if advanced assignment is to another CONUS location. If advanced
   assignment is to an overseas location, then Airmen must have 24 months TOS by PCS
   departure. Airmen stationed overseas must complete their current prescribed tour prior to
   PCS.
   A23.2.3. Airmen otherwise qualified for advance assignment/24 month assignment
   deferment under Extended Deployment (Indeterminate TDY [ITDY]) rules are not eligible to
   apply under this AAD program.
   A23.2.4. Airmen currently assigned overseas and electing an advance assignment to another
   overseas area (consecutive overseas tour (COT)) may not receive entitlements unless
   otherwise eligible under the provisions of the COT program outlined in Attachment 4.
   A23.2.5. Must be eligible for PCS and have no quality force factors that would otherwise
   make them ineligible (advance assignment only).
   A23.2.6. Join Spouse consideration if applicable should be processed IAW, paragraph 2.31,
   and Attachment 8 (advance assignment only).
   A23.2.7. Airman must have sufficient retainability to serve the associated PCS ADSC
   (advance assignment only).
   A23.2.8.                                           program does not affect eligibility to
   participate in the First Term Airman or Career Airman BOP program at a later date provided
   eligibility criteria is met.
A23.3. Application Timelines.
   A23.3.1. If an Airman has or will have over 24 months time on station as of return/projected
   date of return from deployment, they must apply no later than 60 days upon return from
   deployment.
   A23.3.2. If an Airman has or will have less than 24 months time on station as of
   return/projected date of return from deployment, they must apply no later than 60 days upon
   return or at their 24 month time on station point whichever is later.
A23.4. Application procedures.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                393


  A23.4.1. Airmen will apply or decline to apply for the AAD program within 15 calendar
  days of their acceptance (as documented by their signature on the notification letter) through
  their home station unit commander using the form at Figure A23.1                 (NOTE: If
  election is not made within 15 calendar days of acceptance, the request will be processed as
  an exception to policy IAW paragraph 1.5        .
  A23.4.2. For Airmen who elect the 24-month assignment deferment, if approved, AFPC will
  update the Assignment Availability Code (AAC) ―39‖ to expire 24 months after projected
  return date.
  A23.4.3. For Airmen who elect an advanced assignment, if approved, AFPC will load the
  assignment information in MILPDS.
  A23.4.4. Once selections have been made for an Advanced Assignment (AA) or 2 year
  assignment deferment, this will constitute the member exercising his/her option and will not
  be reconsidered. If the member desires a change, the only option available is to request
  cancellation of such action, return to home station (if applicable) and enter the next
  assignment cycle for which they are eligible.
  A23.4.5. Desires of the Airman will be heavily considered, however unit manning and needs
  of the Air Force must be a deciding factor.

                                       Attachment 24
               HUMANITARIAN REASSIGNMENT AND DEFERMENT

A24.1. Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Policy.
   A24.1.1. Waivers to these provisions require prior approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPH.
   A24.1.2. The Comptroller General has ruled that the move of Air Force members from one
   place to another may not be made at government expense based solely on humanitarian
   reasons. The determining factor in the approval of a request for reassignment is the needs of
   the Air Force.
   A24.1.3. A request for humanitarian reassignment or deferment is considered based on
   individual merit taking into account the human factors involved, the applicant’s skills and
   length of service, and manning priorities and requirements. A request may be approved
   when it is clearly in the best interest of the Air Force.
   A24.1.4. A request for humanitarian reassignment may warrant giving assignment
   preference to the applicant based on the facts presented. The fact that the move would
   increase the morale and effectiveness of the Air Force member may be considered in
   authorizing PCS in these circumstances, but assignment on this fact alone is not authorized.
   A24.1.5. The reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member concerned.
   A request initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not accepted.
   A24.1.6. Emergency or ordinary leave is to be used first as a means of easing family
   hardships or problems before applying for humanitarian reassignment.
   A24.1.7. All Air Force personnel must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and
   whenever called upon to do so. The Air Force is also committed to equal distribution of
   overseas assignments. Therefore, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment
   cannot be considered. If a reassignment or temporary period of deferment is approved, the
   member must thereafter revert to worldwide assignable status.
   A24.1.8. A humanitarian request is approved on its own merit, and will not be disapproved
   based solely on the member’s substandard performance and (or) conduct. Members will only
   be delayed from departing PCS when they are required to remain for completion of
   investigation and trial by US military or civil authorities, administrative actions under the
   Uniformed Code of Military Justice, or AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures
   for Commissioned Officers, or AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen. When a
   reassignment request has been approved and administrative separation is not deemed
   appropriate, the losing commander must formally notify the gaining commander, in writing,
   of any incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and provide a comprehensive
   analysis of the member’s job related or personal problems.
   A24.1.9. A humanitarian reassignment or deferment is normally a one-time action to solve a
   problem within a reasonable period of time.
   A24.1.10. For colonels and below and all airmen (except those attending initial technical
   training), requests must be submitted via the virtual MPF (vMPF) with supporting
   documentation to the Total Force Service Center-San Antonio (TFSC), HQ AFPC/DPTO.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  397


   Once a request is complete it will be provided for consideration to HQ AFPC/DPAPH.
   Large volume requests may be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPTO, 550 C Street West, Suite B111,
   Randolph AFB TX 78150. For colonels (including selectees), and chiefs (including
   selectees) while requests are submitted initially to HQ AFPC, the final approval authority is
   AF/DPO and AF/DPE, respectively. Requests will be provided to the appropriate OPR for
   consideration once the required medical or legal review is obtained. Throughout this
   attachment when HQ AFPC/DPAPH is referred to, substitute AF/DPO if the applicant is a
   colonel or colonel selectee, and AF/DPE if the applicant is a chief or chief selectee.
A24.2. For the Purpose of Humanitarian Consideration, the Following Terms are Explained.
   A24.2.1. Family Member: Limited to spouse, child, father, mother, father-in-law, mother-
   in- law, stepparent, person in loco parentis, or other persons actually residing in the
   household who are dependent for over half of their financial support. While siblings
   (brothers and sisters of the member or spouse) are not within the definition of family member
   in this attachment, requests involving the terminal illness of a sibling may be forwarded for
   consideration as an exception to policy.
   A24.2.2. Person in ―Loco Parentis:‖ A person in loco parentis refers to one who exercised
   parental rights, duties, and responsibilities and, in fact, raised a member or spouse for a
   minimum of 5 years in place of a mother or father because of death of the parent, or in the
   parent’s continued absence from the home before the member’s or spouse’s 21st birthday, or
   before the member’s entry on active duty, whichever is earlier. The relationship must have
   been such that the member or spouse looked upon the person as a parent, not merely as a
   temporary guardian. The mere presence of a person in the home for a number of years,
   during which time they exercised a degree of custodial, but not parental responsibility, does
   not constitute loco parentis. Also, in order for the child to have been in the care and control
   of one acting in place of the parent, the parent cannot have also resided in the same home
   (unless the parent was mentally incompetent).
       A24.2.2.1. A request based on loco parentis status must include affidavits from all
       parties (to include other family members, neighbors, clergy, or family friends) involved
       stating the details of the custody, control, care, and management of the member or his or
       her spouse. In addition, submit copies of any documents that may have been created at
       the time loco parentis status was established relating to the custody, control, care, and
       management of the member or spouse (court documents, tax returns, report cards signed
       by the loco parentis ―parent,‖ etc.)
A24.3. Identifying and Reporting Humanitarian Conditions.
   A24.3.1. A member desiring humanitarian deferment must formally submit his or her
   request to the Air Force Contact Center (AFCC) within 30 calendar days from PCS
   reassignment notification, nomination to HQ AFPC, or selection for TDY in excess of 30
   calendar days.
   A24.3.2. Should humanitarian conditions arise after PCS notification or other event
   notification, the Airman must submit his or her formal request to the TFSC for consideration
   within 30 calendar days of learning of the condition (or a diagnosis).
   A24.3.3. If an Airman submits a request for reassignment or deferment and the
   circumstances change prior to a final decision or the Airman’s departure on assignment, he or
 398                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   she must immediately inform either the MPS or the TFSC, who in turn notifies HQ
   AFPC/DPAPH. A message reply will be provided with final disposition instructions.
A24.4. Spirit and Intent of the Humanitarian Program.
   A24.4.1. The Humanitarian Program was established to assist members in resolving severe
   short-term problems involving a family member. Members must be effectively utilized in
   their duty (officer) or control (enlisted) AFSC.
   A24.4.2. When a request involves reassignment, it will normally be to the closest location to
   where the family member concerned resides so the member can provide the family member
   maximum support, consistent with the manning needs of the Air Force. As a general rule,
   reassignment into a special duty position is not considered since the selection process for
   such duties can be quite involved and often requires an application to the ―hiring authority.‖
   Also, retraining into a special duty position is not considered based on the lack of training
   capability.
A24.5. Basic Eligibility Criteria for Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment. In addition to
substantiating a humanitarian problem, the following basic criteria must be met before a request
can be approved.
   A24.5.1. A vacancy must exist at the new duty station if a PCS is involved and the member
   must meet service retainability requirements for PCS.
   A24.5.2. The member must be experiencing a problem involving a family member (see
   paragraphs A24.2.1 and A24.2.2) that is more severe than usually encountered by other Air
   Force members with a similar problem.
   A24.5.3. The member’s presence must be absolutely essential to alleviate the problem.
   A24.5.4. The problem can be resolved within a reasonable period of time (normally 12
   months).
A24.6. Humanitarian Conditions Usually Warranting Approval. It is impractical to try to list all
the conditions for which a humanitarian reassignment or deferment may be approved. The
factors to be considered vary from case to case and the number of possible situations and
circumstances are almost infinite. However, requests substantiating problems arising from any
of the following circumstances usually warrant approval:
   A24.6.1. The recent death (within 12 months) of the member’s spouse or child, including
   miscarriages of 20 weeks or more gestation. Humanitarian reassignment is normally
   approved on the death of a child or stepchild under the age of 18 who is living in the
   member’s home at the time of death. A request based on a child or stepchild who is over the
   age of 18 will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Reassignment made under this
   provision will normally be considered to only one of two locations -- either near extended
   family for support or to the closest available base to the burial site.
   A24.6.2. The member has a serious financial problem not the result of overextension of
   personal military income (such as loss of primary home of residence where member or
   spouse and children currently reside, or loss of possessions through fire, theft, or natural
   disaster), and the member will suffer a substantial financial loss unless his or her presence or
   continued presence can be ensured. It must be shown that the problem cannot be resolved by
   leave, correspondence, power of attorney, or by any other person or means.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 399


   A24.6.3. The member is serving an unaccompanied OS tour and his or her spouse abandons
   their children. It must be shown it is not possible for the children to join the member at the
   OS location when an accompanied tour is authorized and that the member’s presence is
   necessary. The assignment location under this provision will be based on the needs of the Air
   Force.
   A24.6.4. The terminal illness of a family member (see paragraph A24.2.1 and A24.2.2 for
   definition of family members for the purpose of humanitarian reassignment) when death is
   imminent within 2 years. A doctor's prognosis of a terminal illness must be fully supported
   and substantiated by clinical data. In such cases, the member’s presence is considered
   essential regardless of the availability of other family members to assist.
   A24.6.5. An authorized state or local agency places a child in the member’s home and
   deferment is necessary to comply with state or local laws to complete final adoption.
   Reassignment to pursue adoption is not normally authorized.
   A24.6.6. Reassignment or deferment is essential in establishing or operating an effective
   family advocacy program according to AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy. Documentation from
   the base Family Advocacy Officer is required. NOTE: While requests for humanitarian
   consideration must be initiated by the member, there are some instances involving family
   advocacy issues where the member does not desire assignment or assignment cancellation
   and there are no quality control factors that would support such action. In these situations,
   the member’s commander can request assignment or assignment cancellation via
   humanitarian deferment when the basis is to continue or obtain treatment for family
   advocacy issues. The request must be fully documented and endorsed by the local Family
   Advocacy Officer (see paragraph 3.8.10.2 for personnel assigned overseas).
   A24.6.7. When the request for reassignment of an active duty Airman who has experienced a
   sexual assault has been considered and approved in accordance with criteria established in
   AFI 36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program. As reflected in
   AFI 36-6001, the reassignment request requires the commander's and vice wing commander's
   approval, and the commander's letter must include a PCS recommendation based on, but not
   limited to, the nature and circumstances of the offense and the victim's reasons for the
   request. Refer to AFI 36-6001 for further guidance. Additionally, all requests disapproved
   according to AFI 36-6001 will be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPH for final administrative
   processing.
      A24.6.7.1. For requests involving a member's spouse or child, it must be determined and
      fully substantiated by appropriate medical authority that remaining in the area where the
      incident occurred would be detrimental to the welfare of the family member.
      A24.6.7.2. Airmen may request a specific base for reassignment in these types of
      requests. However, manning must fully support the Airman's desired location as the
      main consideration is to relocate away from where the incident occurred. Retraining is
      considered for this type request on a case-by-case basis.
A24.7. Reasons Humanitarian Requests are Usually Disapproved. Requests for reassignment or
deferment are usually disapproved when it is probable that the problem will exist for an
indefinite period of time, or the request is based on one of the following circumstances:
 400                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A24.7.1. A desire to provide physical, emotional, or other support to help with the activities
   of daily living to a parent or parent-in-law due to age, non-terminal or chronic illness or
   disability, or recent death in the family.
   A24.7.2. Problems associated with child care arrangements, or a single parent’s desire to
   make or facilitate either short or long term child care arrangements.
   A24.7.3. Psychoneurosis (such as various psychic or mental disorders characterized by
   special combinations of anxieties, compulsions, obsessions, phobias, and motor or sensory
   manifestations) resulting from family separation incident to military assignment.
   A24.7.4. Normal pregnancy, threatened miscarriage, breech birth, Cesarean section, or RH
   incompatibility.
   A24.7.5. The existence of a housing shortage or home ownership problems.
   A24.7.6. A financial problem, to include bankruptcy, resulting from over-extension of
   military income.
   A24.7.7. A financial or management problem related to off-duty employment, the spouse’s
   employment, private business activities, or to settle an estate.
   A24.7.8. Passport or visa problems involving newly acquired family members.
   A24.7.9. Threatened separation, divorce action, or the desire to pursue child custody.
   A24.7.10. The problem existed or was reasonably foreseeable at the time of latest entry on
   active duty without a break in service, or prior to departure on PCS.
   A24.7.11. For the purpose of seeking or providing family support except as outlined in
   paragraphs A24.6.1 or A24.6.4.
   A24.7.12. A consecutive PCS or deferment based on continuation of the same circumstances
   (does not include a request to extend a current deferment--see paragraph A24.11).
   A24.7.13. A request based on the medical condition of the Air Force member. (Assignment
   for this reason is initiated by local medical authorities when it is determined the situation
   warrants such action.)
   A24.7.14. Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been
   selected and notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days. A deferment request for
   an officer can be considered based on the member’s appearance on the Vulnerable Mover
   List (VML) if coordination with the appropriate assignment officer confirms assignment
   selection is highly likely.
A24.8. Processing Humanitarian Requests.
   A24.8.1. The final approval/disapproval authority is HQ AFPC/DPAPH. A request cannot
   be approved or denied at a lower level.
   A24.8.2. The applicant submits the request through the TFSC via the vMPF. All required
   information according to Figure A24.1., plus supporting documentation, is necessary or the
   request cannot be processed.
       A24.8.2.1. A member desiring humanitarian reassignment who also has a spouse or
       child(ren) enrolled in the EFMP must include appropriate medical or educational
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   401


       documentation concerning the EFMP situation with the humanitarian request (i.e., DD
       Form 2792, plus addendums, DD Form 2792-1, IEP, etc.). A humanitarian reassignment
       cannot be approved unless the projected assignment location can meet the needs of the
       exceptional family member.
       A24.8.2.2. Once the TFSC receives the complete request, to include supporting
       documentation, from the Airman, it must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPH no later
       than the next duty day.
   A24.8.3. Forwarding endorsements and correspondence must include:
       A24.8.3.1. Recommendation by commander to include additional information or
       evidence of material value. If the commander recommends disapproval, complete
       justification must be provided.
       A24.8.3.2. Both members of a military couple must submit a request if the same
       assignment consideration is desired.  When both apply, respective commander
       endorsements are required.
A24.9. Available Options When a Request is Disapproved. When a request is disapproved the
MPS must counsel the member on the following options: Members may apply (if eligible) for
retirement, retirement under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers) resignation
or release from active duty. For those who are pending reassignment a request under this
paragraph must be submitted within 7 calendar days following receipt of the correspondence
disapproving the request.
A24.10. Withdrawing a Request. If an Airman wants to withdraw his or her request before a
final decision or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the
MPS or the TFSC, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPH immediately. Once an Airman has
departed on a humanitarian reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn.
A24.11. Humanitarian Assignment/TDY Restrictions.
   A24.11.1. The TDY assignment authority will not select a member for TDY exceeding 30
   calendar days while in humanitarian deferment (AAC 30, Table 2.1). If provided a
   humanitarian reassignment, members will not be reassigned PCS for at least 12 months from
   date arrived station. A deferment will initially restrict members from PCS or TDY for a
   maximum of 12 months. The initial period of assignment/TDY restriction for humanitarian
   reasons may be extended at the member’s request provided the total period does not exceed
   18 months. If a terminal illness is involved, deferment may be extended up to a total of 24
   months. Requests for such extensions are submitted using Figure A24.1 and must
   substantiate that:
       A24.11.1.1. Every possible effort has been made to overcome the problem.
       A24.11.1.2. The condition warranting assignment/TDY restriction still exists.
       A24.11.1.3. The problem can be resolved within the extended period of assignment/TDY
       restriction.
   A24.11.2. If an Airman’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration of
   the assignment restriction, he or she is considered for intracommand reassignment to another
 402                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   organization on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty exists on base, or if the
   base is being deactivated, reassignment instructions will be provided by HQ AFPC/DPAPH.
A24.12. Applicant Responsibilities.
   A24.12.1. Emergency or ordinary leave must be used first as a means of resolving the
   problem.
   A24.12.2. Submits the request through the TFSC via the vMPF and electronically attaches or
   faxes all required endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPTO. Large
   volume requests may be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPTO, 550 C Street West, Suite B111,
   Randolph AFB TX 78150.
   A24.12.3. A member stationed OS and requesting reassignment OS must agree to serve the
   prescribed tour length at the new location or at least a tour length equal to the combined
   unaccompanied tour lengths at the old and new locations, whichever is greater. FOR
   EXAMPLE, if you are serving on a 30/18 month OS tour and receive approval for
   reassignment to a 36/24 month OS tour, you must serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining
   location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the combined unaccompanied tour
   lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS locations before reassignment from
   the theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the greatest combined OS
   tour period being served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of time you
   have been assigned to the current location.
   A24.12.4. For Airmen enroute PCS, they may discuss the problem with the nearest MPS
   commander, the TFSC, or AFPC/DPAPH personnel to assist in deciding whether or not to
   submit a request. There is no reimbursement authorized if the Airman decides to travel to the
   nearest base with an MPS and an Airman's status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if
   they decide to submit a request. The Airman must comply with current reporting instructions
   if the assignment authority denies suspension of movement; however, a request still can be
   submitted (see paragraph A24.15.6.).
   A24.12.5. If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the member’s
   foreign- born spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be
   included in the humanitarian request. If reassignment is approved, a request for a designated
   location move (DLM) to the native country must be processed per AFI 36-3020, Family
   Member Travel.
   A24.12.6. If the circumstances of the situation change and the request is still pending, or a
   reassignment has been approved but the Airman has not departed, the Airman must notify his
   MPS. An approved humanitarian reassignment is normally canceled if the situation for
   which granted ceases to exist before the Airmen’s departure. In this instance the Airman
   must provide information and supporting documentation to show what actions have been
   taken regarding the reassignment. The MPS will provide this information to the TFSC, who,
   in turn, provides it to HQ AFPC/DPAPH who will make the final decision and provide a
   response by message.
   A24.12.7. Once a request has been approved the member must notify the MPS when the
   situation upon which approval was granted ceases to exist. Once notified the MPS deletes
   AAC 30 and the accompanying deployment availability code.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             403


A24.13. Total Force Service Center Responsibilities.
   A24.13.1. Counsels members desiring to submit a request for reassignment/deferment on
   humanitarian provisions.
   A24.13.2. Ensures the member’s request has all pertinent documentation as outlined in
   Figure A24.1 and this attachment.
   A24.13.3. Processes and forwards to HQ AFPC/DPAPH complete requests no later than the
   next workday after receipt from the Airman. Reasons for exceeding this standard must be
   explained/provided in the forwarding correspondence.
   A24.13.4. Acts as liaison between HQ AFPC/DPAPH and the applicant.
A24.14. Commander Responsibilities.
   A24.14.1. Recommends approval/disapproval of the humanitarian request and includes any
   information that helps HQ AFPC make a decision. All disapproval recommendations must
   be fully justified.
   A24.14.2. Does not select members assigned or deferred for humanitarian reasons for TDY
   in excess of 30 calendar days while they are in AAC 30.
   A24.14.3. When the criteria for immediate reassignment are met (for example, death of a
   dependent child), commanders will ensure appropriate officials (e.g., medical, legal, OSI,
   etc.) are aware of the member’s reassignment request and the probability of approval and
   immediate departure on PCS.
A24.15. MPS Responsibilities.
   A24.15.1. Processes requests for delay in reporting when applicant’s projected departure
   date is within 30 days.
   A24.15.2. Assists the member with accessing the vMPF applications. Processes requests
   submitted by initial technical training students.
   A24.15.3. Sends a message providing full facts and circumstances to the TFSC when the
   reason for the request ceases to exist before the applicant departs PCS.
   A24.15.4. Using MilPDS updates the AAC and DOA as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPH.
   A24.15.5. Counsels the applicant on other available options if the approval authority
   disapproves the request. See paragraph A24.9.
   A24.15.6. Deletes an AAC or deployment restriction when appropriate. The member must
   inform the MPS when the circumstances on which a request was approved ceases to exist and
   the MPS deletes the restriction or AAC.
   A24.15.7. When a member is PCS enroute to or from an OS area, or is TDY in the CONUS
   from OS, the nearest MPS commander may be contacted for assistance by phone or mail.
   There is no reimbursement authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest base
   with an MPS. A member's status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if he or she decides
   to submit a request. The MPS commander will assist the member in submission of a formal
   request for humanitarian reassignment or deferment. The MPS commander may request to
   suspend the movement of the member; however, members must be advised that their status
404                                                     AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  remains unchanged (for example, leave) if the request for suspension is granted while a
  request is pending. These requests must be forwarded by message to HQ AFPC/DPAPPH
  with information copies to the losing and gaining activity and include:
      A24.15.7.1. The member’s name, grade, SSN, SAFSC (officers) or CAFSC (airmen),
      port call date (if applicable), date of humanitarian submission (if any), date departed
      losing organization, losing and gaining unit of assignment, and RNLTD.
      A24.15.7.2. A brief summary of the situation and any relevant supporting information.
      A24.15.7.3. Counsels the member on the provisions of AFI 36-3003, Military Leave
      Program, if the member has an advance (negative) leave balance when suspending
      movement or when submitting the request. NOTE: The time between the request
      submission and the approval authority’s final action is considered leave.
      A24.15.7.4. If the request for suspension of movement is denied, the member may still
      elect to submit a humanitarian request but also must comply with the current reporting
      instructions. Requests for a new port call date or a change in RNLTD will not be
      submitted after denial of the request for suspension of movement.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    405

               EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY MEMBER PROGRAM (EFMP)

A25.1. EFMP Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Policy.
   A25.1.1. Waivers to these provisions require prior approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPPH.
   A25.1.2. All Air Force personnel must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and
   whenever called upon to do so. The Air Force is also committed to equal distribution of
   overseas assignments. As a result, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment
   cannot be considered. If a reassignment or temporary period of deferment is approved, the
   member must thereafter revert to worldwide assignable status.
   A25.1.3. The reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member concerned.
   A request initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not accepted.
   A25.1.4. An EFMP request is approved on its own merit, and will not be disapproved based
   solely on the member’s substandard performance and (or) conduct. Members will only be
   delayed from departing PCS when they are required to remain for completion of
   investigation and trial by US military or civil authorities or administrative actions under the
   Uniformed Code of Military Justice, or AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures
   for Commissioned Officers, or AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen. When a
   reassignment request has been approved and administrative separation is not deemed
   appropriate, the losing commander must formally notify the gaining commander, in writing,
   of any incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and provide a comprehensive
   analysis of the member’s job related or personal problems.
   A25.1.5. For colonels and below and all airmen (except those attending initial technical
   training), requests must be submitted via the virtual MPF (vMPF) with supporting
   documentation to the Air Force Contact Center (AFCC), HQ AFPC/DPSCC. Once a request
   is complete it will be provided for consideration to HQ AFPC/DPAPPH. Large volume
   requests may be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPSCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph
   AFB TX 78150. For colonels (including selectees), and chiefs (including selectees) while
   requests are submitted initially to HQ AFPC, the final approval authority is AF/DPO and
   AF/DPE, respectively. Requests will be provided to the appropriate OPR for consideration
   once the required medical or legal review is obtained. Throughout this attachment when HQ
   AFPC/DPAPPH is referred to, substitute AF/DPO if the applicant is a colonel or colonel
   selectee, and AF/DPE if the applicant is a chief or chief selectee.
A25.2. For the Purpose of the EFMP, the Following Terms are Explained.
   A25.2.1. Exceptional Family Member: Limited to the member’s spouse, child, or other
   person actually residing in the member’s household who is dependent on the member for
   over half of his or her financial support, and who meets DOD criteria for enrollment in the
   EFMP.
   A25.2.2. Special Needs Coordinator (SNC): A medical officer assigned to the medical
   treatment facility (MTF) who is appointed as the SNC by the MTF Commander.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                  409


      A25.2.2.1. Family Member Relocation Clearance (FMRC) Coordinator: A medical
      technician or civilian assigned to the MTF who is appointed as the FMRC Coordinator by
      the MTF Commander.
   A25.2.3. General Medical Services (GMS): Encompasses all types of physiological,
   psychological, or social conditions of a chronic nature that have been medically diagnosed
   and that require specialized treatment.
   A25.2.4. Special Educational Services (SES): Specially designed instruction to meet the
   unique educational needs of a handicapped child, including education provided in school, at
   home, in a hospital or in an institution, physical education programs, and vocational
   educational programs.
   A25.2.5. Early Intervention (EI) and/or Related Services (RS): DODI 1342.12, Provision of
   Early Intervention and Special Education Services to Eligible DOD Dependents, provides
   guidance for EI and RS. Transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other
   supportive services as required to assist a child, from birth to 21 years, inclusive, with a
   disability to benefit from special education under the child's Individualized Family Service
   Plan or Individualized Education Plan. EI and RS can include speech-language pathology
   and audiology, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation
   including therapeutic recreation, early identification and assessment of disabilities in
   children, counseling services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility
   services, and medical services for diagnostic or evaluative purposes. Special Education
   Services can also include: school health services, social work services, parent counseling and
   training. The sources for these services are the home or community (natural setting), school
   (least restrictive environment), and medical treatment facilities.
   A25.2.6. Structural Accessibility: Encompasses design modification and enhancements that
   permit safe access to or from military housing IAW the provisions of the Architectural
   Barriers Act of 1968 (42 USC, 4151). The immediate nonavailability of structural
   accessibility requirements at a projected location will not be a limiting factor for assignment
   purposes.
A25.3. Identifying and Reporting EFMP Conditions.
   A25.3.1. Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory and requires the identification of all family
   members requiring long term general medical, special educational, early intervention (EI)
   and/or related services (RS), or modified housing. Members with family members who
   require general medical, special educational, EI and/or RS, or modified housing must contact
   the Special Needs Coordinator in the MTF for a complete evaluation, assessment, and
   possible enrollment. Likewise, the Special Needs Coordinator must be advised immediately
   following the identification of a family member who has a long term condition requiring
   general medical, special educational, EI or RS, or modified housing. The Air Force is
   committed to meeting the needs of this unique segment of our Air Force community and
   must be informed of the special needs of our members’ families.
   A25.3.2. A member desiring EFMP deferment must formally submit his or her request to the
   AFCC within 30 calendar days from PCS reassignment notification or nomination to HQ
   AFPC.
 410                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A25.3.3. Should EFMP conditions arise after PCS notification or other event notification,
   the member must report them to the Special Needs Coordinator and MPS immediately. If
   appropriate, the member must submit his or her formal request to the AFCC for consideration
   within 30 calendar days of learning of the condition (or a diagnosis).
   A25.3.4. If a member submits a request for reassignment or deferment and the circumstances
   change prior to a final decision or the member’s departure on assignment, he or she must
   immediately inform either the MPS or the AFCC, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPPH.
   A message reply will be provided with final disposition instructions.
A25.4. Spirit and Intent of the EFMP.
   A25.4.1. EFMP actions are designed to help an Air Force member who has a family member
   with special needs that meet DOD enrollment criteria. These problems are usually
   permanent or long term, and the family may need continued assistance. A member may need
   EFMP assignment consideration throughout an entire Air Force career.
   A25.4.2. The EFMP is distinct from humanitarian policy and is based on the personnel
   (manning) requirements of the Air Force. The two programs are not interchangeable and the
   EFMP should not be interpreted as a base of choice program. The intent of the EFMP
   assignment policy is to use the Air Force member, based on current or projected manning
   requirements, at locations where required medical, educational, early intervention, or related
   services are available either through the military medical system, through civilian resources
   utilizing TRICARE, or a combination thereof and local resources. HQ AFPC/DPAPPH, in
   coordination with the AFPC Medical Staff, assignment OPR, and base level Special Needs
   Coordinator, determines a suitable assignment.
   A25.4.3. The EFMP provides an initial 12-month deferment for a newly diagnosed condition
   when the member’s presence is essential in establishing and/or participating in the treatment
   program. Deferment from reassignment may also be appropriate if a treatment program is at
   a critical juncture and the member’s continued presence is absolutely essential to continuing
   the treatment program. The EFMP also provides reassignment when a member is assigned to
   an area and a new medical, special education, related service, or early intervention need
   arises for which the needed services are not available within the assignment locale. Once a
   treatment program is established, whether formally through the EFMP or on the member’s
   own initiative, the member is then considered worldwide assignable.
   A25.4.4. Enrolling a family member in the EFMP does not negate the member’s
   responsibility to serve his or her share of overseas duty, or in meeting deployment
   requirements.
A25.5. Basic Eligibility Criteria for EFMP Reassignment/Deferment.           Members may be
provided an EFMP reassignment or deferment if:
   A25.5.1. The member has a family member with a medical or educational requirement that
   meets the DOD criteria for enrollment in the EFMP (Assignment Limitation Code ―Q‖ in the
   MilPDS).
   A25.5.2. The Special Needs Coordinator has determined that adequate facilities/resources to
   meet the family member’s medical, educational, related service, or early intervention
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                    411


   requirements do not exist and cannot be reasonably provided within the current assignment
   locale.
   A25.5.3. The member’s presence is determined to be essential in establishing, participating
   in, or continuing a medical regimen or educational program in the present area of assignment.
   Normally, only one deferment for the continuing condition of the same family member is
   permitted and a TDY deferment (when determined necessary) is normally only provided
   during the initial assignment deferment period.
   A25.5.4. The member was denied family member travel by the gaining MTF based on
   processing the AF Form 1466 and other documentation. A facility determination inquiry
   must be completed to the gaining location and a copy of the denial document must
   accompany the EFMP request. Deferment is not normally granted for this situation;
   however, cancellation of assignment may be provided or, if the member is in a mandatory
   move status (see Attachment 1), an alternate assignment provided. The abbreviated EFMP
   application reflected in Figure A25.2 should be used.
A25.6. Assignment Considerations for Members with Exceptional Family Members. Requests
for EFMP consideration are submitted in the following circumstances:
   A25.6.1. The member was denied family member travel (members projected to PCS
   CONUS to CONUS or overseas (OS) to CONUS) by the gaining MTF based on processing
   the AF Form 1466 and other documentation. A facility determination inquiry must be
   completed to the gaining location and a copy of the denial document must accompany the
   request. Deferment is not normally granted for this situation; however, cancellation of
   assignment is provided or, if the member is in a mandatory move status, an alternate
   assignment provided. Use the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application reflected in Figure
   A25.2 and provide the documentation concerning the denied family member travel (AF Form
   1466, DD Form 2792, etc., that identify the needed resources), and any other documents that
   were used in the initial family member clearance process.
   A25.6.2. If serving OS accompanied by command sponsored family members, a member
   may request reassignment within the OS theater if an unforeseen medical or educational
   requirement arises after arrival at the OS base. For an EFMP reassignment within the same
   OS theater, the member must agree to serve the full prescribed OS tour length at the gaining
   location or at least a tour equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths, whichever is
   greater, prior to being reassigned from the theater. For example, if serving on a 30/18 month
   OS tour and approval is received for assignment to a 36/24 month OS tour, the member must
   serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal
   to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS
   locations before reassignment from the theater, whichever is greater. The computation
   resulting in the greatest combined OS tour period being served is the required minimum. The
   variable is the amount of time the member has been assigned to the current location.
   A25.6.3. If serving OS accompanied by command sponsored family members, a member
   may request reassignment to the CONUS before DEROS if an unforeseen medical or
   educational requirement arises after arrival at the OS base and reassignment under
   paragraph A25.6.2 is impractical. If the reassignment request is based on inadequate
   medical or educational resources, the request must include the AF Form 1466 and the
   document, if other than the AF Form 1466, that approved family member travel to the
412                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  present location. NOTE: If the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF
  Form 1466 violation, either by falsifying or omitting information which led to the approval
  of family member travel, unless the member’s presence is absolutely essential for treatment,
  the family member should be returned to the CONUS and the member will be required to
  complete the remainder of the OS tour established by the original tour election.
  A25.6.4. If selected for an OS long tour regardless of volunteer status, and family member
  travel is disapproved based on the unavailability of early intervention or related services
  and/or special educational services, (see paragraph A25.2) the member may seek release
  from the assignment. To do this, the member must submit the appropriate abbreviated EFMP
  application reflected in Figure A25.2 to the AFCC within 7 calendar days of receipt of the
  disapproval of family member travel. A copy of the AF Form 1466, MAJCOM/SG
  determination, and other supporting documentation disapproving family member travel must
  be included as attachments to the request for assignment cancellation. However, if a
  pinpointed assignment (a location with the required services) is identified by the
  MAJCOM/SG, and a manning requirement exists at that location, a member selected as the
  most eligible non-volunteer will be required to proceed to the pinpointed assignment.
  A25.6.5. If selected for an OS long tour as a non-volunteer and family member travel is
  disapproved based on the unavailability of general medical services (see paragraph A25.2),
  a member may volunteer through the AFCC for an unaccompanied short tour in an effort to
  minimize family separation. Use the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application reflected in
  Figure A25.2. If there are no current or projected short tour requirements available, the
  unaccompanied long tour length must be served at the projected OS location. After arrival
  OS, the existing condition will not be considered in support of a curtailment and early return
  to the CONUS unless the condition significantly worsens and the member’s presence is
  considered essential.
  A25.6.6. If not in a mandatory move status and selected as a volunteer for an OS long tour
  and family member travel is disapproved for any reason, a member may request cancellation
  of the assignment through his or her assignment NCO, or officer assignment team.
  Supporting documentation would be the denial of family member travel. (If in a mandatory
  move status, a formal request to the AFCC is required, using the appropriate abbreviated
  EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. The request must include the documentation
  that denied family member travel). Although approval of the request is not automatic, every
  effort will be made and consideration given to approve such requests consistent with the
  needs of the Air Force.
  A25.6.7. If selected as a non-volunteer for an OS short tour to an area where family
  members are authorized (for example, Turkey, Azores, etc.), a member is required to serve
  the unaccompanied tour length when family member OS travel is denied, regardless of the
  reason.
  A25.6.8. If selected for an OS unaccompanied short tour (15 months or less), members may
  and are encouraged to apply for a home-basing assignment (Attachment 5) to effect
  continuation of the established EFMP. The request for home-basing should include trailer
  remarks that state the member is applying to effect continuation of an established EFMP.
  Those not selected for home- basing assignment may request EFMP reassignment through
  the AFCC to the same location as an OS returnee for continuation of the established EFMP.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                413


   Such a request must be submitted no earlier than the 10th month and no later than the 8th
   month before DEROS.
A25.7. Reasons EFMP Requests are Usually Disapproved. HQ AFPC/DPAPPH will not
usually approve requests for reassignment/deferment under the following circumstances:
   A25.7.1. If the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF Form 1466
   violation, either by falsifying or omitting information which led to the approval of family
   member travel. Unless the member’s presence is absolutely essential, the family member
   should be returned to the CONUS and the member must complete the OS tour length
   prescribed based on his or her status.
      A25.7.1.1. Reassignment when the member initially elects and proceeds on the
      unaccompanied all-others overseas tour at a location where family members are allowed
      and then, after arrival, desires to change to an accompanied tour and the required medical
      or educational resources are not available to meet his family member’s previously
      identified special needs.
      A25.7.1.2. Reassignment when the member circumvents or disregards the family
      member clearance process by bringing noncommand sponsored family members, at
      personal expense, to an overseas location where the required medical resources do not
      exist to meet their known needs.
   A25.7.2. Reassignment in order to establish a treatment program based on the availability of
   a preferred or optimal program in an area other than where currently assigned when adequate
   facilities or services can be, or are, provided within the current locale. Also, EFMP
   deferments are not granted for family members to remain in a preferred or optimal program
   when adequate services are available within the projected assignment locale.
   A25.7.3. Reassignment for the purpose of obtaining extended family support.
   A25.7.4. Reassignment based on the availability of a free or lower cost program in an area
   other than where currently assigned when the current duty location can provide adequate
   services on base or through the local community. EXCEPTION: When required services are
   being received off base and are causing a significant financial hardship, a member can apply
   for reassignment as an exception to policy. Documentation provided with such a request
   must clearly document the hardship. This provision does not apply to a dependent
   parent/parent-in-law since they are not eligible for coverage under TRICARE (see A25.7.11).
   A25.7.5. Reassignment based on the climatic conditions or geographical area adversely
   affecting a family member’s health, and the problem is of a recurring nature (such as asthma,
   allergies, eczema, etc.). EXCEPTION: Reassignment as an exception to policy can be
   requested if the continued presence of the family member in such a climate/environment is
   medically determined to be clearly life threatening.
   A25.7.6. The request is based on mental disorders (for example, anxieties, compulsions,
   obsessions, phobias, and motor or sensory manifestations or combinations thereof) resulting
   from family separation incident to military assignment.
   A25.7.7. A request based on an intellectually or athletically gifted child. Intellectually or
   athletically gifted children do not qualify under the provisions of Public Law 95-561,
   Defense Dependents’ Education Act of 1978, DOD instructions, and EFMP procedures.
 414                                                      AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A25.7.8. The family member is in an institution, unless institution officials certify frequent
   and regular visits will be medically beneficial to the family member, or if admittance to or
   retention in the institution requires establishing, continuing, or renewing state residency.
   A25.7.9. The disability is due to a short-term illness or injury, or when the prognosis for
   complete recovery is satisfactory without the benefit of reassignment or deferment.
   A25.7.10. Reassignment from the CONUS to OS for the sole purpose of establishing a
   treatment program.
   A25.7.11. A request for reassignment to a location with a greater capability to provide space
   available care in a MTF for a member with a dependent parent/parent-in-law when the
   required care is available within the current assignment locale.
   A25.7.12. A request based on the medical condition of the Air Force member. (Assignment
   for this reason is initiated by local medical authorities when it is determined the situation
   warrants such action.)
   A25.7.13. Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been
   selected and notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days. A deferment request for
   an officer can be considered based on the member’s appearance on the Vulnerable Mover
   List (VML) if coordination with the appropriate assignment officer confirms assignment
   selection is highly likely.
   A25.7.14. Deferment from reassignment when the required resources are available within
   the projected assignment locale.
A25.8. Processing EFMP Requests.
   A25.8.1. The final approval/disapproval authority is HQ AFPC/DPAPPH. A request cannot
   be approved or denied at a lower level.
   A25.8.2. Submits the request through the AFCC via the vMPF and electronically attaches or
   faxes all required endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPSCC. Large
   volume requests can be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPSCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111,
   Randolph AFB TX 78150.
       A25.8.2.1. Once the AFCC receives the complete request, to include supporting
       documentation, from the member, it must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPPH no later
       than the next workday.
   A25.8.3. Forwarding endorsements and correspondence must include:
       A25.8.3.1. Recommendation by commander to include additional information or
       evidence of material value. If the commander recommends disapproval, complete
       justification must be provided. If the request is based on a spouse’s inability to manage
       the household in the member’s absence due to unique family situations (as defined in AFI
       36-2908, Family Care Plans), the commander’s endorsement must include information
       about the existence of (or lack thereof) of the documented family care plan required by
       AFI 36-2908.
       A25.8.3.2. The local Special Needs Coordinator must review and provide input on all
       EFMP requests. Input must address the availability of required resources within the
       current assignment locale.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   415


       A25.8.3.3. Requests for reassignment from members serving accompanied OS
       assignments that are based on a lack of the medical, educational, related services, or early
       intervention services required by the family member must include a copy of the AF Form
       1466 and the document approving/disapproving family member travel.
       A25.8.3.4. Both parties of a military couple must submit a request if the same
       assignment consideration is desired. Respective commander endorsements are required.
A25.9. Available Options When a Request is Disapproved. When a request is disapproved, the
MPS must counsel the member on the following options. Members may apply (if eligible) for
retirement, retirement under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers) resignation
or release from active duty. For those who are pending reassignment a request under this
paragraph must be submitted within 7 calendar days following receipt of the correspondence
disapproving the request.
A25.10. Withdrawing a Request. If a member wants to withdraw his or her request before a
final decision or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the
MPS or the AFCC, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPPH immediately. Once a member has
departed on an EFMP reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn.
   A25.10.1. A request to withdraw an approved EFMP reassignment that was provided based
   on either a lack of required medical resources within the current locale or on environmental
   factors that were having a life threatening affect on a family member will not be favorably
   considered unless the situation has significantly changed since initial approval. For this type
   withdrawal request, input from the Special Needs Coordinator/Chief of Medical Staff is
   required along with the member’s request.
A25.11. EFMP Assignment/TDY Restrictions.
   A25.11.1. A member reassigned or deferred under the EFMP is placed in AAC 34 for 12
   months as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPPH. If granted a reassignment, members will not be
   reassigned PCS for at least 12 months from date arrived station. A deferment will initially
   restrict members only from PCS for a maximum of 12 months.
   A25.11.2. TDY restriction does not automatically apply to EFMP requests unless
   specifically addressed in approval correspondence from HQ AFPC/DPAPPH. A member
   subject to TDY and requesting a restriction must obtain a statement from the attending
   medical or therapy provider. The statement must specify the need for the member’s presence
   and the duration of the requirement. This statement, along with a request according to the
   example shown in Figure A25.1, are forwarded to the AFCC. A TDY restriction request is
   normally approved only on an initial EFMP request. When a TDY restriction is requested
   and approved, the MPS will place the member in DAC 44 as directed by HQ
   AFPC/DPAPPH.
   A25.11.3. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration of
   the assignment restriction, he or she is considered for intracommand reassignment to another
   organization on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty exists on base, or if the
   base is being deactivated, reassignment instructions will be provided by HQ
   AFPC/DPAPPH.
 416                                                       AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


A25.12. AF Form 1466, Request for Family Member’s Medical and Educational Clearance for
Travel.
   A25.12.1. All members who have a family member enrolled in the EFMP (assignment
   limitation code ―Q‖) must complete an AF Form 1466 upon selection for any PCS to a
   location family members are allowed. The AF Form 1466 and other required documentation
   will be forwarded by the Special Needs Coordinator (SNC) or Family Member Relocation
   Clearance (FMRC) Coordinator at the member’s current duty location to the SNC/FMRC at
   the projected assignment location to determine if adequate facilities will be available for the
   member’s exceptional family members. If family member travel is denied, see paragraph
   A25.6.
   A25.12.2. As mandated by Public Law, public schools and early intervention services are
   required to provide appropriate educational services. While mandated by law, the Air Force
   requires a member to process the AF Form 1466 for a CONUS assignment even though the
   only need may be for special educational, early intervention, or related services. A
   nonrecommendation for family member travel from the gaining location’s Chief of Medical
   Staff will not result in cancellation of the assignment unless requested by the member.
   However, if the member elects to continue with a CONUS assignment in this situation, he or
   she may not later request EFMP reassignment based on a lack of services (unless the request
   is based on a newly identified need).
   A25.12.3. All requests for reassignment or tour curtailment will normally be disapproved
   when it is determined the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF Form
   1466 violation, either by falsifying or omitting information. Unless the member’s presence is
   deemed essential, their family members should be returned to the CONUS and the member
   will be required to complete the remainder of the OS tour established by the original tour
   election.
   A25.12.4. The AF Form 1466 investigation results will be provided to the losing and gaining
   commanders by message for possible disciplinary action against a member who caused or
   contributed to the commission of an AF Form 1466 violation.
A25.13. Applicant Responsibilities.
   A25.13.1. Submits the request through the AFCC via the vMPF and electronically attaches
   or faxes all required endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPSCC.
   Large volume requests can be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPSCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111,
   Randolph AFB TX 78150.
   A25.13.2. A member stationed OS and requesting reassignment OS must agree to serve the
   prescribed tour length at the new location or at least a tour length equal to the combined
   unaccompanied tour lengths at the old and new locations, whichever is greater. FOR
   EXAMPLE: if you are serving on a 30/18 month OS tour and receive approval for
   reassignment to a 36/24 month OS tour, you must serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining
   location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the combined unaccompanied tour
   lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS locations before reassignment from
   the theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the greatest combined OS
   tour period being served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of time you
   have been assigned to the current location.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                417


   A25.13.3. For members en route PCS, they may discuss the problem with the nearest MPS
   commander, the AFCC, or AFPC/DPAPPH personnel to assist in deciding whether or not to
   submit a request. There is no reimbursement authorized if the member decides to travel to
   the nearest base with an MPS and a member's status remains unchanged (for example, leave)
   if they decide to submit a request. The member must comply with current reporting
   instructions if the assignment authority denies suspension of movement; however, a request
   still can be submitted (see paragraph A25.16.6).
   A25.13.4. If the circumstances of the situation change and the request is still pending, or a
   reassignment has been approved but the member has not departed, the member must notify
   his MPS immediately. An approved EFMP reassignment is normally canceled if the
   situation for which granted ceases to exist before the member’s departure. In this instance
   the member must provide information and supporting documentation to show what actions
   have been taken regarding the reassignment. The MPS will provide this information to the
   AFCC, who, in turn, provides it to HQ AFPC/DPAPPH who will make the final decision and
   provide a response by message.
A25.14. Air Force Contact Center Responsibilities.
   A25.14.1. Counsels members desiring to submit a request for reassignment/deferment on
   EFMP provisions.
   A25.14.2. Ensures the member’s request has all pertinent documentation as outlined in
   Figure A25.1 or A25.2 and this attachment.
   A25.14.3. Processes and forwards to HQ AFPC/DPAPPH complete requests no later than
   the next workday after receipt from the member. Reasons for exceeding this standard must
   be explained/provided in the forwarding correspondence.
   A25.14.4. Acts as liaison between HQ AFPC/DPAPPH and the applicant.
A25.15. Commander Responsibilities.
   A25.15.1. Recommends approval/disapproval of the EFMP request and includes any
   information that helps HQ AFPC make a decision. All disapproval recommendations must
   be fully justified.
   A25.15.2. Does not involuntarily select members TDY deferred for EFMP reasons for TDY
   in excess of 30 calendar days while they are in DAC 44.
A25.16. MPS Responsibilities.
   A25.16.1. Processes requests for delay in reporting when the member’s projected departure
   date is within 30 days.
   A25.16.2. Assists the member with accessing the vMPF applications. Processes requests
   submitted by initial technical training students.
   A25.16.3. Sends a message providing full facts and circumstances to the AFCC when the
   reason for the request ceases to exist before the member departs PCS.
   A25.16.4. Counsels the member on other available options if the approval authority
   disapproves the request. See paragraph A25.9.
418                                                     AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


  A25.16.5. Using MilPDS updates the AAC, DAC, and DOA as directed by HQ
  AFPC/DPAPPH.
  A25.16.6. Updates or deletes ALC ―Q‖ from the MilPDS as directed by HQ
  AFPC/DPAPPH or upon receipt of written confirmation from the base Special Needs
  Coordinator.
  A25.16.7. When members are PCS en route to or from an OS area, or are TDY in the
  CONUS from OS, the nearest MPS commander may be contacted for assistance by phone or
  mail. There is no reimbursement authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest
  base with an MPS. A member's status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if they decide
  to submit a request. The MPS commander will assist the member in submission of a formal
  request for EFMP reassignment or deferment. The MPS commander may request to suspend
  the movement of the member; however, members must be advised that their status remains
  unchanged (for example, leave) if the request for suspension is granted while a request is
  pending. These requests must be forwarded by message to HQ AFPC/DPAPPH with
  information copies to the losing and gaining activity and include:
      A25.16.7.1. The member’s name, grade, SSN, SAFSC (officers) or CAFSC (airmen),
      port call date (if applicable), date of EFMP submission (if any), date departed losing
      organization, losing and gaining unit of assignment, and RNLTD.
      A25.16.7.2. A brief summary of the situation and any relevant supporting information.
      A25.16.7.3. Counsels the member on the provisions of AFI 36-3003, Military Leave
      Program, if the member has an advance (negative) leave balance when suspending
      movement or when submitting the request. NOTE: The time between the request
      submission and the approval authority’s final action is considered leave.
      A25.16.7.4. If the request for suspension of movement is denied, the member may still
      elect to submit an EFMP request but he or she must comply with the current reporting
      instructions. Requests for a new port call date or a change in RNLTD will not be
      submitted after denial of the request for suspension of movement.
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   419

FROM: (Functional Address Symbol)

SUBJECT: FOUO - EFMP (Reassignment) (Deferment) (TDY Deferment) Request

IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU FULLY DOCUMENT AND SUBSTANTIATE YOUR
REQUEST. FAILURE TO PROVIDE ALL REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL DELAY A
FINAL DECISION



 1. I request (reassignment) (deferment) in order to (establish) (continue) an EFMP. The
 circumstances are: (Give specific reasons why you cannot establish or continue the EFMP at
 the current or projected location. If requesting a TDY restriction, justify why your presence is
 required and specify expected duration. Give all relevant information.)

 2. I have taken the following actions/steps to improve my worldwide availability: (NOTE:
 Information concerning the existence of a viable family care plan according to AFI 36-2908
 must be included in this paragraph if the request is based on a spouse’s medical or emotional
 problems that make his or her ability to manage the household questionable in your absence.
 Information addressing why a care plan was not established or why an existing one is no longer
 viable is required.)

 3. I submit the following supporting information:

 a. Organization and Location (current and projected), E-mail address, fax phone number, and
 phone number where you can reach me:

 b. Name, Date of Birth (of children), and Home Address of Exceptional Family Member
 Concerned:

 c. Current leave address, date leave expires, leave telephone number, and E-mail address:

 4. I have (not) been previously (reassigned) (deferred) (TDY restricted) for EFMP reasons. If
 so, indicate date and reason.
420                                                        AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009


5. I understand my EFMP assignment will depend on manning requirements at the time I am
available for reassignment. If Air Force manning needs allow and required services are
available, I prefer reassignment to                         .

6. (Members serving OS.) If reassigned to another OS location within the same theater, I do
(not) volunteer to serve either the full accompanied tour length at the gaining location, or at
least a tour length equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths specified for the losing
and gaining locations, whichever is greater, prior to being reassigned from the oversea theater.

7. I do/do not have an active duty spouse. If so, I understand he/she must either submit a
separate request or sign this request. In either case, an endorsement from both commanders is
required. I understand that my spouse will not receive assignment/deferment consideration
without the appropriate endorsements and signatures.

8. (Airmen Only) (While retraining is not normally done on an EFMP request, it is sometimes
necessary.) I will (not) accept voluntary retraining (if necessary) for approval of my request. I
understand I will incur an assignment restriction due to my retraining. I also understand future
assignment or utilization in a previously held specialty will depend on Air Force manning
requirements and that I may be required to remain in the retraining AFSC for an indefinite
period.


9. I understand if changes occur to the situation presented, whether prior to a final decision, my
departure, or after approval, I must advise either the Military Personnel Flight or Air Force
Contact Center immediately.


                                                             Signature of Applicant
                                                             Name, Grade, USAF, SSN

This memorandum contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which must be
protected under the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.
Attachments:
1. AF Form 1466*
2. Special Needs Coordinator Input
3. DD Form 2792 with applicable addendums
4. Individualized Education Plan and/or Individualized Family Service Plan (Required when
request is based on special education needs)
5. Any other documentation your want considered
NOTE: You must include statements from medical and educational providers (as appropriate).
When the program involves a need for a combination of these services, it is especially important
you include all pertinent data to ensure proper assignment decision. If the EFMP request is for
reassignment, the Special Needs Coordinator must state whether or not adequate services are
available anywhere within the local area. *The AF Form 1466 is required only if request is for
reassignment from either an overseas or CONUS location due to inadequate medical care or
educational services. In this situation attach a copy of the AF Form 1466 and the document (if
AFI36-2110 22 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                 421


other than the AF Form 1466) which approved family member travel to that area. If request is
for assignment diversion or cancellation based on disapproved family member travel, include a
copy of the AF Form 1466 and the denial determination. If request is based on a need for
reassignment due to a condition diagnosed after arrival at the assignment location and there are
no other special needs of family members, an AF Form 1466 is not required.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE APPROVAL AUTHORITY CAN ONLY
CONSIDER WHAT IS SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW.
