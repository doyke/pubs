   Arms field units will enter data into SFMIS and keep it current.
   2.2.3. Reference Library. Combat Arms sections will establish and maintain an up to date
   reference library (may be electronic or a combination of electronic and hard-copy) containing
   applicable DoD and Air Force publications, TOs, US Army manuals, commercial manuals,
   copies of MAJCOM and locally produced supplements/Operating Instructions (OIs), as well
   as other guidance required to perform the Combat Arms function. Periodically check Air
   Force indexes for changes to publications and TO indexes for new or changed manuals
   covering tools (e.g., hand and power), equipment (e.g., binoculars, scopes, night vision
   devices [NVD], machinery, etc), gauges, ammunition, weapons, mounts, etc. to ensure
   proper guidance on maintenance, repair, and handling is available. Attachment 1 contains a
   listing of references relating to the Combat Arms function. Combat Arms unit type codes
   (UTC) may use an electronic reference library.
   2.2.3. (ACC) The Combat Arms NCOIC will ensure section reference libraries are verified
   current during the months of June and December. The senior ranking person on Combat
   Arms unit type codes (UTC) will assistance the unit deployment manager to ensure
   deployable electronic reference libraries are verified current within 45 days of deployment.

     safety. Most parts are coded as pilferable items and are subject to Air Force audit review.
     This audit trail will accurately track the requisition of parts (from Combat Arms),
     accountability, and disposition of the end item. At a minimum, Combat Arms will
     conduct an inventory of all weapons parts annually (every 12 months). A non-Combat
     Arms, disinterested NCO should observe and validate this inventory.
     2.2.5.16. (ACC) Unit commanders may direct the annual weapons’ parts inventory be
     conducted in quarterly increments. During quarterly inventories, 25% of all weapons
     parts will be inventoried. Subsequent inventories must not include previously inventoried
     parts. The unit commander will appoint a disinterested person in the grade of E5 or
     above to conduct all weapons parts inventories. A disinterested person is someone who
     does not have access to or responsibility of ordering, receiving, or disposing of weapons
     parts. All inventory results will identify which parts, by weapons model, item
     nomenclature, and the quantity found to ensure 100% of all weapons parts are inventoried

     Allocation Module (FAM) of the Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMST).
  2.2.10. Weapons Maintenance Log. Combat Arms will maintain a permanent weapons
  maintenance log (may be electronic) of all maintenance performed and parts replaced on
  each weapon repaired (all maintenance must be recorded even if parts are not used). The
  weapons maintenance log will provide a historical record of parts used and maintenance
  performed. The maintenance log must include the model, type, serial number, owning
  organization, maintenance accomplished, stock number/nomenclature of parts replaced, and
  total man-hours used to complete the repair for each weapon repaired. This log will be
  separate from SFMIS and must support data entered into SFMIS. Weapons maintenance
  actions will also be documented on the weapon’s Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form
  105, Inspection Maintenance Firing Data for Ground Weapons, IAW TO 11W-1-10,
  Recording of Historical Data for Small Arms using SFMIS.
  2.2.11. At least annually, obtain a serialized listing from the base Logistics Readiness
  Squadron/Unit of all small arms assigned to the installation, identified by unit. If automated,
  this listing can be used in a spreadsheet format as an individualized weapon status report,
  which will provide a working resource for individual weapon actions such as inspections.
  2.2.12. Maintain Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) documentation
  provided by the PMEL office for all weapon inspection gauges in use by the Combat Arms
  section.
  2.2.13. Weapon Inspection Reports. Describe the type of inspection (e.g. Semi-Annual, Pre-
  Embarkation, Pre-Issue, Turn-In, etc.), total number of weapons inspected, identified by type
  and status of weapons (extended storage, in-use or deployed). List all weapons with
  uncorrected discrepancies and include the weapon model, caliber, serial number,
  discrepancy, and required corrective action. Document discrepancies corrected at the time of
  inspection by the type and number of weapons and a brief description of the discrepancies.
  For example: "Three M4 carbines found with firing pins installed incorrectly--Corrected at
  time of inspection.‖
     2.2.13.1. Combat Arms sections will accomplish a weapons inspection report for all
     types of inspections (e.g. Semi-Annual, Pre-Embarkation, Pre-Issue, Turn-In). The
     Combat Arms NCOIC will prepare the initial report within five duty days of completing
     the inspection. Address the report to the weapon custodian of the unit possessing the
     weapons, with a realistic suspense date to correct the discrepancies (not to exceed 30
     calendar days). Ensure the cover memo or report instructs the custodian to receive their
     unit commander’s endorsement on the report after all discrepancies are corrected and
     before returning it to the Combat Arms NCOIC. If owner user maintenance or corrective
     action is required, Combat Arms must complete a follow-up inspection within 30
     calendar days of the initial report date. The Combat Arms NCOIC must complete a
     report (if open discrepancies continue to exist) or memorandum to the inspected unit
24                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        weapon custodian (if all discrepancies are corrected) for all follow-up inspections, using
        the previous guidance for initial inspection reports. Refer to the HQ AFSFC/SFXW
        website for an example of a weapons inspection report and memo.
        2.2.13.2. If no discrepancies are noted, the Combat Arms NCOIC will prepare a memo to
        the unit weapon custodian indicating the date and type of inspection, as well as listing the
        quantity (by model), model, and storage status of weapons inspected. The memo should
        inform the unit that no further action is needed.
        2.2.13.3. The Combat Arms section will maintain copies of the last two unit inspection
        reports for each type of inspection and maintain pre-embarkation inspections until
        deployed weapons return to home station. The Combat Arms NCOIC will maintain a
        record of all man-hours used to schedule and conduct weapons inspections and will
        maintain statistics on inspections conducted in SFMIS.
        2.2.13.3. (ACC) The Combat Arms NCOIC will develop a tracking system to ensure all
        deployed weapons receive a post-embarkation inspection once returned.
     2.2.14. Combat Arms Scheduling. The Combat Arms NCOIC will maintain records of unit
     annual training requirements, requests for training, weapons qualification training statistics,
     class/range schedules, and range utilization data. Combat Arms will develop a scheduling
     handbook for unit scheduling officials that explains the process and identifies local
     requirements for obtaining Combat Arms training quotas, as well as briefing unit
     representatives on these items.
        2.2.14.1. Training Schedules. Develop weapons training schedules to ensure maximum

        training/evaluation, instructor proficiency firing, and unit sustainment/proficiency
        training programs.
        2.2.14.2. The Combat Arms section will receive an annual training forecast from each
        supported unit. This forecast will identify the number of personnel requiring weapons
        qualification training each year by weapon and course, and must include the
        commander’s rationale or justification for the training (in-garrison/peace time arming
        requirement, permanent change of station [PCS] overseas or deployment to a combat
        zone/designated hostile fire area). Refer to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force for Air
        Force Personnel, for additional guidance on arming plans. Unit annual training forecasts
        will provide the basis for the Combat Arms training schedule. Combat Arms must
        schedule a sufficient number of classes for each weapon and course throughout the year
        to ensure unit training requirements are supported.
        2.2.14.3. Combat Arms will use the following priorities for scheduling individuals for
        training. The Combat Arms organizational commander may modify these priorities when
        base mission requirements dictate.
            2.2.14.3.1. Qualification training of individuals identified by name by their
            commander to fill a deployment tasking to a combat zone in time of war or a
            designated hostile fire area (actually deploying, not merely subject to deployment).
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                         25


         2.2.14.3.2. Qualification training of individuals being permanently reassigned
         overseas with a personnel processing code requiring small arms qualification.
         2.2.14.3.3. Qualification training of individuals defined as Arming Group A in AFI
         31-207.
         2.2.14.3.4. Qualification training of any other individuals requiring arming to support
         operational missions.
         2.2.14.3.5. Unit sustainment/proficiency training.
     2.2.14.4. Unit scheduling officials will schedule personnel for training through the
     Combat Arms section using SFMIS. Although other systems may exist that perform
     similar functions, SFMIS is the only official database for MAJCOM and Air Staff
     agencies to access small arms qualification training and range utilization data.
     2.2.14.5. If no-shows or poor range utilization become a concern, the Combat Arms
     NCOIC will establish an effective ―no-show‖ program, at the discretion of the Combat
     Arms organizational commander. The program should involve no-show letters,
     attendance statistics, or unit range utilization data. The key to this program is ensuring
     maximum use of available facilities and personnel to provide support for all base small
     arms training needs.
     2.2.14.5. (ACC) The ACC Combat Arms training minimum acceptable show rate is
     90%. The Combat Arms NCOIC will submit training statistics to the SF commander at
     the end of each month. When a unit’s show rate for the month goes below 90%, the SF
     commander will send a memorandum to the effected unit commander requesting
     assistance in correcting the trend.
  2.2.15. Trespass Notices. Annually, place legal notices to the public in the base bulletin and
  base newspapers. Place similar notices in local area newspapers if the base is considered an
  open installation or all or part of the range impact area lies outside secured base perimeters.
  In such notices, give the location of the range or ranges, and state trespassing is not only
  illegal but also dangerous because of gunfire. Include in the notice: the office address,
  personnel to contact, and phone numbers to call in case there is a valid need for entry.
  Notices are not required at overseas locations where tensions are high and the local threat
  could cause such notices to bring undue attention to the base or for fully contained ranges.
  2.2.16. Firearms and Ammunition Protection and Control. Use established standards for
  protecting sensitive conventional arms, major weapons parts and assemblies, ammunition,
  and explosives in the custody of any component of DoD. AFPD 24-2, Preparation and
  Movement of Air Force Materiel, AFI 31-101, AF Installation Security Program, and DOD
  5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives,
  outline protection standards. Combat Arms must also refer to the base OPLAN to ensure all
  local policies are followed.
  2.2.17. Annual Range Safety Inspection Reports. The Combat Arms NCOIC will prepare a
  report of the annual range safety inspection and forward the report to the Combat Arms
  organizational commander, after coordination with the base safety office and all other
  agencies who participated in the inspection.              The report must include any
  discrepancies/safety items noted during the inspection and corrective action needed.
26                                              AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


2.3. USAF Range Use: Safety is paramount when operating Air Force firing ranges. At least
two personnel must be present when conducting any live-fire operation. The host base Combat
Arms section is responsible for the military combat arms range program. Combat Arms sections
will develop a ―range book‖ for use on the firing range during all live-fire operations. It will
include all items necessary to safely operate the range; this book will remain on the range while
the range is in operation.
     2.3.1. Air Force units/personnel will not conduct any live-fire training on a range unless it is
     certified for Air Force use. This certification is not required for ranges managed and
     operated by other DoD components. If required to use non-USAF firing ranges (host nation,
     DOE, FBI, local civilian, etc.) for weapons qualification or proficiency training, the local
     Combat Arms NCOIC and the local base safety representative will conduct a range
     certification inspection per the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Evaluation of Existing
     Range Facilities guide and checklist contained in HQ AFCESA Engineering Technical Letter
     (ETL) titled Small Arms Range Design and Construction and any future versions of this
     publication. The Combat Arms NCOIC must develop a localized version of the ORM
     checklist and consider unique items that are not included in the example. This inspection, at
     a minimum, will cover basic range safety and Air Force training requirements. Non-USAF
     facility managers are not obligated to install equipment or modify their facilities to
     accommodate USAF courses. The range certification inspection ensures the facilities meet
     the intent of USAF training programs and do not expose Air Force personnel to unmitigated
     conditions or endanger others. Document the certification and provide a copy to the
     MAJCOM/A7S.
     2.3.2. Military Use. Combat Arms live-fire qualification training of military/DoD civilian
     and contract personnel has priority over any other use of the range. This includes test firing
     of repaired weapons and zeroing firearms for operational use.
        2.3.2.1. Support Agreements (SA) - Training Support. The host Combat Arms section
        will provide weapons qualification training to those AFRC tenant units without their own
        AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312, or DoD civilian equivalent personnel assigned. Tenant AFRC
        units without sufficient numbers of their own AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312, or civilian
        equivalent personnel assigned and present during a Unit Training Assembly (UTA),
        request host Combat Arms support to augment their personnel during qualification
        training through the host-base Security Forces commander. If host Combat Arms
        manpower support is required, it will be provided if manpower permits. For AFRC units,
        this support will include complete access to all items necessary to conduct weapons
        qualification training. Unless specified in the SA, and agreed upon by the host Security
        Forces commander, this support will not include ammunition. Formalize this training
        and/or support through an agreement according to AFI 25-201, Support Agreements
        Procedures. Tenant AFRC units will have range and facility priority on scheduled UTA
        weekends over non-Air Force users and non-mission essential training.
        2.3.2.2. Unit Sustainment (Proficiency) Training.           Organizations with approved
        proficiency training munitions IAW AFCAT 21-209 are permitted to use the range on an
        ―as available‖ basis. Combat Arms sections will promote this program and should
        facilitate flexible scheduling as long as this training does not interfere with qualification
        training. The Combat Arms NCOIC must approve all live-fire courses that units will use
        on the base range to ensure they are safe and within the limitations of the range. Units
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        27


     with courses approved by the Combat Arms NCOIC and certified range safety officials as
     outlined in the following paragraphs may use the range without Combat Arms
     supervision, at the discretion of the Combat Arms organizational commander.
     2.3.2.3. All units using the range will have personnel task certified by the Combat Arms
     NCOIC. Units require the following range safety officials, a chief range officer (CRO),
     in the grade of E-6 or above, and range safety officers (RSO) in the grade of E-5 or above
     or DoD civilians of equivalent grade. The CRO has overall responsibility for all range
     operations and safety. The RSO(s) supervise shooters on the firing line and maintain
     shooter safety during firing. The ratio of RSOs to shooters will be 1:3 for non-combat
     arms personnel conducting unit sustainment training for rifle, handgun, and shotgun.
     2.3.2.3. (ACC) All other weapons will require a 1:1 ratio.
     2.3.2.4. Combat Arms sections will develop a comprehensive training and certification
     program through a range operations certification workshop or similar program. At a
     minimum, range certification will include opening and closing procedures, weapon
     safety, RSO ratios, firing line procedures, tower operator duties, weapon-clearing
     procedures, range limitations, and emergency notification procedures. This certification
     must include evaluation during live-fire. Combat Arms personnel must periodically spot
     check units during range use to ensure they follow proper procedures. The Combat Arms
     organizational commander will approve all range safety official training plans.
     2.3.2.5. Document task certification of Air Force members on AF Form 1098 and all
     personnel on AF Form 483. Range safety officials must have an AF Form 483, signed by
     the CA NCOIC, on their person while operating the range. Maintain a locally developed
     training log of all personnel certified to operate the range(s) and indicate when their
     certification expires (refresher training is due) at the Combat Arms section.
     2.3.2.6. Range safety officials must be appointed in writing by their commander and
     approved in writing by the Combat Arms organizational commander. Combat Arms will
     maintain a copy of the appointment letter at the Combat Arms section. This certification
     is valid for one year and only pertains to the host Combat Arms ranges. Personnel must
     complete refresher training annually to maintain their certification. The Combat Arms
     NCOIC will revoke certifications if individuals fail to follow established guidance or
     operate the range in an unsafe manner.
     2.3.2.7. Range safety officials are responsible for safe range operations and will remain
     on the firing range until all weapons have been cleared and removed from the range.
     Units/individuals using the range for this purpose are liable for damage caused during
     their use.
  2.3.3. Recreational and Nonmilitary Use. The Combat Arms organizational commander
  may authorize range use for recreational shooting activities including the firing of privately
  owned firearms. This activity will not interfere with the completion of military training to
  meet mission requirements. Before granting approval, local security forces and staff judge
  advocate office (liability reasons) must coordinate on official nonmilitary range user’s
  requests to fire privately owned weapons (POWs) on base firing ranges. Use a support
  agreement or memorandum of agreement/understanding with organizations to ensure
28                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     controls and reimbursement for wear-and-tear or damages. Recreational shooters will
     provide their own targets, first aid kit, and other associated supplies/equipment.
        2.3.3.1. When firing is conducted on Air Force ranges for recreational purposes, no less
        than two people must be present. As a minimum, the CRO will have been briefed by
        Combat Arms personnel on range safety, operation policies and procedures, and possess
        written certification. The other person must be a minimum of 18 years old and capable of
        summoning assistance, if needed. Firearms and ammunition fired on Air Force ranges
        will not exceed range limitations. The owner will ensure the weapons are serviceable and
        approved by Combat Arms to fire on the range. When shooting competitions are
        conducted on Air Force ranges, instructors, safety personnel, and those managing the
        event will brief participants on operating procedures, methods, and commands. All
        personnel, including spectators, are under the control of the tower operator while on the
        range complex. Combat Arms personnel are not required to be safety officials or tower
        operators for non-military purposes.
        2.3.3.2. Authorized civilian shooting groups may use Air Force ranges during those
        times when they are not required for Air Force or other military purposes. These
        organizations will ensure sufficient personnel receive certification training outlined in
        paragraphs 2.3.2.2. through 2.3.2.7. from the Combat Arms NCOIC to safely operate the
        range.
        2.3.3.3. Civilian police agencies using Air Force small arms firing ranges must comply
        with the requirements of paragraphs 2.3.2.2. through 2.3.2.7.
        2.3.3.4. Recreational Use of Range Property. Base agencies such as CE real property,
        CE environmental flight, ground safety, and security forces, in coordination with the staff
        judge advocate, are responsible for safe implementation of this authorization.
        2.3.3.5. Recreational activities on range complexes must not conflict with weapons
        training requirements. The installation Combat Arms section will control and schedule
        range areas in case of changes in training or emergencies.
        2.3.3.6. Personnel, both military and civilian, must first demonstrate their firearm safety
        and proficiency to designated officials before they are allowed to use the range area for
        hunting. Local requirements dictate the course content and scope of examinations for
        hunters.
        2.3.3.7. If the range area is used for recreational purposes, post the date and hours recre-
        ational use is permitted and the range point of contact (POC) in the installation base
        bulletin and/or other news sources once a week. After the recreational season is over,
        return the range area to a no-trespass basis and place this information in the base bulletin
        for at least three consecutive weeks.
        2.3.3.8. Non-DoD civilian shooters and range safety officials must sign a hold harmless
        agreement relieving the Air Force and DoD from any liability resulting from injuries or
        death of these personnel while utilizing the base range(s). This hold harmless agreement
        must be approved by the installation Judge Advocate office and will be maintained in the
        Combat Arms section. Non-DoD civilians are not authorized to use the range or
        supervise range operations without this agreement.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            29


2.4. Range Safety: Combat Arms and units using the range must apply the ORM process
before conducting live-fire training. Use the information in the following paragraphs as a basis
for this process. Local conditions may require additional safety precautions.
   2.4.1. Range Facility. Range conditions could constitute safety hazards and cause bounce
   backs or ricochets. Excessive rains may erode berms and bullet catches so they do not
   contain bullets; overhead and ground baffles rot or become damaged and no longer stop
   bullets; and electrical wires become frayed and are no longer properly insulated. Backstops
   (earth or metal) can develop a build-up of residue and pose ricochet hazards. If unsafe
   conditions are detected, report the safety deficiencies to the appropriate civil engineer section
   and ground safety official(s). Inspect ranges for safety deficiencies before firing each day. If
   unsafe conditions are discovered, correct them before the start of firing. On impact ranges,
   check entry points for unauthorized entry and, where possible, inspect the impact area before
   the start of firing to make sure personnel or equipment are not in the impact area. Ensure
   barriers and fences are in place. Post a range safety plan on every range tower.
   2.4.2. Range Safety Plan. A detailed plan of those predetermined hazards that could result in
   death or injury to any person at the facility and preventive measures. Include by hazard all
   preventive measures, first aid, emergency contact information and reporting instructions. A
   checklist format is permitted. Use ORM principles to develop the plan.
   2.4.3. Range Safety Rules. Prominently display range safety rules on the firing range. The
   sign will include, but is not limited to, the following:
       2.4.3.1. Treat all weapons as if they are loaded.
       2.4.3.2. Holster, clear, or secure all weapons when they are not in use.
       2.4.3.3. Keep the muzzle of the weapon under control at all times.
       2.4.3.4. Never point the weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.
       2.4.3.5. No horseplay while on the range or while handling weapons.
       2.4.3.6. Do not handle weapons while personnel are down range.
       2.4.3.7. Do not handle weapons until instructed to do so by the range official.
       2.4.3.8. No smoking within 50 feet of the firing line.
   2.4.4. Road Guards. Post road guards along frequently traveled trails or footpaths, at places
   where anyone might enter into range danger areas, and where adequate fences or barriers do
   not exist.
   2.4.5. Range Communications. Firing ranges will have effective communications equipment
   for emergency notification and communicating with students and instructors. Ensure the
   systems are checked before live-fire operations. Do not operate any firing range without the
   ability to contact emergency services.
   2.4.6. Display of Flag and Streamers. Display a red streamer and/or a rotating red beacon at
   each range complex entry point. A rotating red beacon is required for use during night firing.
   This streamer or beacon indicates the range complex is in operation and firing is scheduled.
   Place a sign near the range complex entry point, which reads ―DANGER, FIRING IN
   PROGRESS WHEN RED FLAG IS FLYING (OR RED BEACON IS FLASHING).‖
30                                              AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     Streamers may be ordered or locally manufactured. Flagstaffs used to display the streamer
     will be no less than 20 feet in height. Flagstaffs used to display a rotating red beacon must be
     at a height (depending on local conditions) allowing it to be visible to all personnel
     approaching the range complex. If multiple ranges exist, each individual range will display
     an additional red flag (at least 2 feet by 3 feet) and/or a rotating red beacon while the range is
     in operation. Fully contained ranges, with controlled access through secured doors, do not
     require streamers or beacons. Instead, place a removable sign at the facility entrance to alert
     personnel firing is in progress.
     2.4.7. Emergency Equipment. Ensure serviceable fire extinguishers are readily available
     during range operations and munitions movements. Ensure a serviceable first aid kit and a
     serviceable vehicle (military or civilian) is immediately available (on the range) any time the
     range is in operation. Provide and approved eyewash station for students and instructors in
     locations where chemical are used for weapon maintenance. During range operations, at
     least one individual must be present at the range who has received and can administer Self-
     Aid and Buddy Care. All Combat Arms personnel will receive Self-Aid and Buddy Care or
     equivalent first aid training as a minimum; this does not prevent an individual from working
     the firing line while awaiting training.
     2.4.8. Unsafe Acts and Conditions. Range personnel have the responsibility to enforce
     proper safety procedures on firing ranges. They have the prerogative, authority, and duty to
     remove any person(s) from the firing line or the range whom they deem unsafe. Using
     appropriate military bearing and behavior, immediately remove any person(s) from the firing
     line who disregards instructions, or violates safety practices. In the event an individual
     refuses to leave the range, contact on-duty security forces for assistance. If a person is
     removed, provide a written summary to the individual’s commander with a courtesy copy to
     the commander of the Combat Arms section. Accomplish this within five duty days and
     before the individual is allowed to return for training.
     2.4.9. Safety Equipment. Units/sections will budget and forecast for the procurement of
     mandated personal safety equipment.
        2.4.9.1. Issued to Combat Arms Instructors:
            2.4.9.1.1. Combat Arms personnel will wear a red baseball type cap with the words
            COMBAT ARMS embossed with 1-inch black letters while performing duties on the
            range complex. This allows students, visitors, and shooters to rapidly identify
            Combat Arms personnel for assistance and to report safety issues. It is only to be
            worn while performing duties on the range complex and will not be worn outside the
            range complex.
            2.4.9.1.2. Eye protection with side protection, or wrap around in design and meeting
            OSHA standards, is mandatory for all instructors working or observing live-fire
            operations. Combat Arms personnel are authorized two pair of high-quality non-
            prescription or prescription shooting glasses IAW Allowance Standard Code (ASC)
            538, Section J. Prescription shooting glasses are authorized IAW AFMAN 23-110,
            Volume 5, Chapter 16, Section 22.
            2.4.9.1.3. To decrease the risk of permanent hearing damage, Combat Arms
            personnel must be issued quality-hearing protection, meeting the level of protection
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           31


          determined by bioenvironmental health officials and based on the decibel ratings of
          the range environment and exposure time. Electronic, noise cancelling hearing
          protection should be considered, as well as hearing protection that provides two-way
          communication between range personnel. Bioenvironmental Engineering officials
          can provide specific guidance.
          2.4.9.1.4. Firing line officials are authorized and should consider wearing protective
          nomex gloves during live-fire operations for safety and protection from the elements.
          Thin gloves protect the hands and allow work on weapons during immediate action
          procedures, clearing and repairing jammed weapons.
       2.4.9.2. Provide to the students:
          2.4.9.2.1. During live-fire training, all personnel will wear hearing protection. Dual
          hearing protection may be necessary (for students and instructors) depending on
          decibel levels and exposure time. Bioenvironmental Engineering officials will
          determine the protection level needed based on the noise levels and exposure time.
          2.4.9.2.2. Eye protection meeting OSHA standards must be available for all trainees
          (maintain adequate quantities for all firing positions and observers) who desire it
          during live-fire and is mandatory if firing at steel targets, if exposed steel target
          supports/holders are used, or if course directions require them.
          2.4.9.2.3. Brass deflectors for rifles will help reduce the possibility of students being
          burned by hot brass.
2.5. Live-fire Procedures: Clear all weapons transported to and from the firing range. Pistols
may be transported to the range cleared, holstered, and secured. Weapons may be transported to
the range by each shooter once cleared by Combat Arms personnel. Before firing begins, the
tower operator or certified CRO will give a range safety briefing to all personnel scheduled to
fire.
   2.5.1. Prefire Briefing. Brief all students on each order of fire. This briefing will include,
   but is not limited to, each phase of fire, position to be used, time limits, number of rounds,
   rounds per magazine, and number of magazines used.
   2.5.2. Ready Line. The ready line is normally a yellow line placed to the rear of the firing
   line. Shooters will remain behind the ready line and at assigned firing positions until they are
   given further instructions. The tower operator notifies the shooters when to proceed from the
   ready line to the firing line.
   2.5.3. Firing Line. The firing line is normally a red line where the shooter occupies a
   predetermined position and fires a course or order of fire. Firing line officials must observe
   all personnel approaching, occupying, or departing the firing line as this is one of the times
   when a breach of safety is likely to occur. Ground weapons at the firing positions with the
   actions open, safety on, and muzzles pointed downrange. Shooters will handle the weapons
   only on the tower operator's command. Do not permit anyone forward of the firing line until
   the line is declared ―safe.‖ ―Safe‖ means weapons are visually inspected for safe conditions
   by range personnel, grounded with actions open, safety on, or holstered and secured. Pistols
   may be holstered under the ―hot range‖ (weapons loaded with a round in the chamber)
   concept providing line officials ensure pistols remain secured in place in between orders of
32                                              AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     fire. During orders of fire, range personnel must ensure no one assumes a firing position in
     front of the firing line and all shooters are aligned. Firing is only permitted from the firing
     platform when using a partially contained baffled range. Authorization may be given to
     coaches to occupy the firing line during special events or training, as required. Once firing
     has been completed, all weapons will be cleared by range officials prior to the weapons being
     removed from the firing line.
     2.5.4. Target Scoring. Range officials will score and record student targets for qualification
     evaluation phases. Each shot not fired for any reason, other than ammunition or weapon
     malfunction, is counted as a miss. In the case of re-fires for malfunctions, the time allowed is
     prorated for the number of rounds remaining and the orders of fire. Return all serviceable
     rounds not fired for any reason (example: shooter does not fire all rounds within the time
     limit) to ammunition stocks for future use. Annotate this in the remarks block of the AF
     Form 710, Combat Arms Training Record. If a score is questioned, the highest ranking
     Combat Arms individual on the range will make the final decision.
     2.5.5. Range Policing. When practical, students will police the range for spent brass, litter,
     and other materials. Range officials will make sure the students in their area police the
     range. The tower operator or a designated instructor will make sure other range facilities,
     such as classrooms and cleaning areas (used by students during the training day), are cleaned,
     and policed.
     2.5.6. Range Commands. Range commands listed below are the normal commands for
     conducting rifle, handgun, and shotgun courses of fire. Additional or substitute commands
     may be given when they do not violate safety rules or cause safety hazards. Normal range
     commands are: CLEAR THE RANGE! IS THE RANGE CLEAR? THE RANGE IS
     CLEAR! SHOOTERS MOVE FORWARD TO THE ______POSITION! YOU MAY
     HANDLE YOUR WEAPONS! SHOOTERS, THIS ORDER OF FIRE IS _____, YOU
     WILL FIRE ______ ROUNDS IN _____ SECONDS OR MINUTES! WITH ________
     ROUNDS LOAD! (It may be necessary to repeat orders of fire, positions, number of rounds,
     and time limits to ensure all shooters understand the orders of fire.) IS THE LINE READY?
     THE LINE IS READY! NOT READY! FIRE! CEASE-FIRE! (see paragraph 2.5.7.) ARE
     THERE ANY ROUNDS REMAINING? INSTRUCTORS, TAKE CARE OF YOUR
     ALIBIS! CLEAR, GROUND, OR HOLSTER AND SECURE ALL WEAPONS! MAKE
     THE LINE SAFE! IS THE LINE SAFE? THE LINE IS SAFE! GO FORWARD FOR
     TARGET ANALYSIS or (SCORE/ REPAIR/CHANGE TARGETS).                              Examples of
     additional or substitute commands: IS THE BAY CLEAR? THE BAY IS CLEAR!
     SHOOTERS, YOU MAY SAFELY HANDLE YOUR WEAPON AND MAKE ANY
     SIGHT CORRECTIONS.
     2.5.7. Cease Fire Commands. The tower operator gives cease-fire commands with the use of
     a distinctive loud whistle, buzzer, horn, verbally over a public address (PA) system, or the
     disappearance of the target through a turning or dropping of the target by a target control
     system. If there is an emergency, such as an accident, unsafe condition or aircraft within the
     range airspace, anyone who sees it, whether it is range personnel, shooter, or spectator,
     immediately yells, "cease fire!" in a loud, clear voice. The tower operator repeats the cease-
     fire command and then commands, "make the line safe!‖ Regardless of who gives the cease-
     fire command, all shooters must cease firing immediately. After range personnel correct the
     condition causing the emergency, firing may resume.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                              33


2.6. Range Safety Inspections: The Combat Arms section will inspect ranges and other
facilities using a locally developed guide and checklist following the ORM Evaluation of
Existing Range Facilities guide and checklist contained in HQ AFCESA Engineering Technical
Letter (ETL) titled Small Arms Range Design and Construction and any future versions of this
publication. During range inspections, ensure all potential problem areas are identified for
maintenance. Minor shot damage, erosion, peeling paint, etc., may become serious problems if
not repaired early.
   2.6.1. The Combat Arms section will visually inspect the range(s) each day before the start
   of firing and when firing is completed. Look for obvious indicators of potential safety
   problems (e.g., exposed rocks exceeding the size permitted on the range, loose boards on
   overhead baffles, debris in the backstop/bullet trap, insect nests, walkways, etc.). Postpone
   firing until unsafe conditions are corrected.
   2.6.2. Schedule other inspections to coincide with programmed range inspections, such as
   quarterly self-inspections. Document range condition and list maintenance needed. Submit
   work requests through coordination channels to civil engineers.
   2.6.3. Annually, the Combat Arms NCOIC, base safety official, CE environmental
   representative, CE maintenance representative, and a bioenvironmental engineering
   representative will conduct a formal range inspection. The Combat Arms NCOIC prepares a
   report of the inspection as outlined in paragraph 2.2.17. The Combat Arms NCOIC ensures
   corrective actions are taken to ensure safe range operation. The Combat Arms NCOIC along
   with CE personnel ensures all corrective actions and repairs comply with Engineering
   Technical Letter (ETL) titled ―Small Arms Range Design and Construction‖ criteria
   published by HQ AFCESA. MAJCOM and local Combat Arms officials may add inspection
   requirements as necessary to meet their particular situation. As a minimum, inspect the items
   listed below.
       2.6.3.1. Backstop Condition. Dirt backstops will be regularly checked for erosion. If
       installed, check the bullet deflector/bullet catch for bullet holes and ensure the structure is
       firmly attached to the backstop. Check for erosion both behind the targets and at all
       points facing the shooters. Heavy lead buildup could cause ricochets. To test for
       excessive leading of the dirt backstop, tap a 3/8-inch rod at least 4-feet long into the
       earthen backstop using a 4-pound (maximum) hammer. Repeat this test on impact area
       from all firing points. The rod must pass unimpeded through the 3-foot layer of topsoil.
       If the rod will not pass, the Combat Arms NCOIC must coordinate required maintenance
       (removal of built-up lead or addition of earth) before continued use of the range. The
       Combat Arms NCOIC will ensure this inspection is accomplished and documented. The
       Combat Arms NCOIC will also maintain the last two inspection reports.
       2.6.3.2. Deterioration of Baffles and Supports. Overhead and canopy baffles must
       completely stop all direct-fired rounds of the caliber/type with the greatest penetration
       authorized for use on the range. Visually check each baffle to make sure rounds are not
       passing through them. Baffles that are not stopping fired rounds will be modified to stop
       the rounds or firing will be postponed until the base CE can repair or upgrade them.
       2.6.3.3. Exposed Rocks. On baffled ranges, remove rocks larger than 3/8-inch in
       diameter from the range floor, backstop, side berms (from the range floor to the top of the
       berm). Closely inspect these areas after severe weather as topsoil may erode and expose
34                                            AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        rocks. For impact ranges, remove large rocks and boulders creating hazards to shooters
        on the range or people on adjacent ranges.
        2.6.3.4. Bullet Traps (Baffled Ranges with Metal Backstops). Check for excessive lead
        build-up in trap area. Cleaning schedule depends on the amount of use. Mining of a
        bullet catch is the removal of bullet residue (lead and jacket material). Coordinate with
        the local Civil Engineer environmental engineers to ensure compliance with federal,
        state, and local requirements for disposal of hazardous material. Unless certified to
        handle hazardous material, Combat Arms will not remove or handle bullet residue from
        the bullet trap or filtration system. Use of contractors for these actions is preferred.
        Inspect and maintain commercial backstops IAW manufacturer guidance.
        2.6.3.5. Cracks in Metal Bullet Traps and Support Brackets. If cracks are detected in
        metal bullet traps or their supports, repair the area in question as soon as possible. If
        there are dimpled areas in the steel, fired bullets could return toward the shooter or be
        deflected out of the bullet trap. When making repairs, welds may not be permitted in the
        impact area directly behind the target, depending on the design and manufacturer’s
        guidance. Welds will be finished and ground to the same angle as the original surface.
        Constant bullet strikes on a metal trap may cause fatigue cracks in the support brackets.
        When repairing support brackets, do not change the angle of the trap from the original
        design.
        2.6.3.6. Impact ranges must posses an adequate SDZ from any location that shooters fire
        from to ensure rounds fired remain within range boundaries. Additionally, the ranges
        SDZ and VDZ must be plotted on base maps to prevent encroachment.
2.7. Range Maintenance: The Combat Arms section and CE organization are responsible for
upkeep and maintenance of ranges and range facilities. All ranges require comprehensive
regular and routine maintenance. A proactive maintenance and self-help program will benefit
the Combat Arms section in maintaining safe, professional, and long-standing facilities. The
Combat Arms NCOIC is responsible for ensuring range facilities are maintained in a safe
condition and necessary repairs or upgrades are identified to the appropriate agencies in a timely
manner.
     2.7.1. The Combat Arms NCOIC will include time for this maintenance in the monthly
     schedule. CE provides materials to the Combat Arms section for approved minor
     maintenance and self-help projects. Deteriorated wooden material removed from the firing
     range may contain lead projectile residue. Check with the environmental flight before
     disposing of such material. Combat Arms personnel will not perform range maintenance if a
     risk of exposure to hazardous materials exists without guidance from bioenvironmental
     engineering. Contracting this function to a company that specializes in this type work, may
     be more cost effective and safe.
     2.7.2. The CE organization provides facility board-approved maintenance to ensure
     continued operation of the range and range facilities. This maintenance includes, but is not
     limited to, the replacement of eroding earth, mowing of large grass areas on the range
     complex, repair or replacement of baffles and baffle supports, and emergency maintenance.
     The CE scheduling office and the Combat Arms section will jointly schedule required range
     maintenance. The need to de-lead or resurface backstops/ bullet traps, replace or overhaul
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            35


   baffles, surface and repair range roads, parking lots, and range floors, paint range and range
   facilities, and repair or replace facilities will be identified for scheduled maintenance.
   2.7.3. Mining of Backstops. The CE environmental flight and the bioenvironmental
   engineering flight/element will advise on environmental protection requirements and health
   risk management/health hazard exposure controls, respectively, for de-leading and/or
   cleaning bullet traps and backstops. Compliance with environmental cleanup and residue
   disposal is mandatory. Contract service for cleanup is preferred. The frequency of de-
   leading and residue removal depends upon the amount of lead accumulated, and the potential
   for unsafe conditions due to excessive lead build up. Combat Arms personnel will not
   attempt to perform de-leading projects. Specific hazards are associated with exposure to lead
   and bullet residue.
   2.7.3. (ACC) The Mission Support Group commander will ensure funds are available for
   backstop/bullet trap clean up.
2.8. Range Closures: When a range is to be closed for more than 120 days, the Combat Arms
organizational commander must notify the MAJCOM/A7S by memorandum, e-mail, or message
(during MINIMIZE, use mail).           At a minimum, coordinate with base safety, CE,
bioenvironmental engineering, and other applicable base/wing agencies. Include the following
information as well as updating the range status in SFMIS:
   2.8.1. Date closed or planned closure date.
   2.8.2. Length of closure.
   2.8.3. Projected reopening date.
   2.8.4. Reason for closure (if possible include costs of repairs).
   2.8.5. Type of training and number of people due training during period of closure.
   2.8.6. Nearest military and civilian installation with available range facilities.
   2.8.7. Actions taken to continue training.
   2.8.8. Date and length of time the range was last closed and reason.
2.9. Range Design and Support Facilities Criteria: Use the most current ETL titled ―Small
Arms Range Design and Construction‖ criteria published by HQ AFCESA when planning,
constructing, and rehabilitating any type of range or range complex. The ETL is directive in
nature. MAJCOMs may require additional criteria before projects are approved. Range
construction will take into account the need to fire tracers (as part of a course or accidentally in
repacked ammo), target positions/distances (e.g., 10 meters for machine gun (M/G), 7, 15, 25
meters for others), target width (e.g. M/G 10 meter target), and shooters positions (e.g. prone,
kneeling, standing, barricades) used to engage the targets at varying distances. If the range will
use firing stalls or divided firing points, they must be designed to allow block officials and the
tower operator an unobstructed view of the firing line and shooters. Ranges will not be designed
for exclusive use of frangible ammunition and must be designed to contain operational (ball)
ammunition. HQ AFSFC/SFXW and HQ AFCESA/CEOA must approve all new range designs
and major renovations (changes to the type or function of the range). This approval also applies
to portable or trailer type ranges. HQ AFSFC/SFXW is the approval authority for deviations or
waivers from design criteria and will coordinate requests with HQ AFCESA/CEOA.

2.10. Facility Certification: Certify new and rehabilitated range facilities as meeting required
specifications. Conduct and document this certification and trial operation per HQ AFCESA
ETL. All non-USAF firing ranges certified must be loaded into the SFMIS range module. If this
cannot be completed at base level, the MAJCOM Combat Arms program manager will be
contacted to complete this task. Combat Arms sections maintain these certifications for the life
of the range or until the next certification is accomplished. The Combat Arms section must
update SFMIS with the status of all ranges at least annually and within five duty days after
changes occur.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                         37


                                          Chapter 3

            TRAINING MANAGEMENT OF COMBAT ARMS PERSONNEL

3.1. Purpose: This chapter explains requirements for all Combat Arms instructors.
3.2. Combat Arms Training Requirements: Combat Arms personnel assigned to perform
Combat Arms duties either at home station or deployed must meet criteria for training and
qualification identified in the AFECD. The Combat Arms NCOIC will ensure all assigned
Combat Arms personnel are trained, evaluated, maintain skill proficiency, and participate in
continuation training. For upgrade training, unit-training managers will enter newly assigned
3P031B personnel into the appropriate upgrade training status code IAW AFI 36-2201, Air
Force Training Program. AFSC 3P031B personnel should be utilized in their new specialty at
the Combat Arms section to ensure effective and timely on-the-job training (OJT) and
advancement to the 5-skill level.
   3.2.1. Civilian personnel as Combat Arms Instructors. In order to perform Combat Arms
   duties, traditionally performed by 3P0X1B or SEI 312 personnel, civilian instructors must be
   graduates of the Combat Arms Apprentice Course (or previous/future versions of the course).
   If not a prior 3P0X1B/SEI 312 they must attend the Combat Arms Apprentice Course once
   hired, regardless of previous experience. HQ USAF/A7S will manage the Combat Arms
   civilian force as part of the Security Forces civilian police job series 083. Similar to their
   military counterparts, they will be civilian police first and Combat Arms instructors second.
   When developed, HQ AFPC will provide core position descriptions including medical
   requirements to accommodate the unique health risks associated with Combat Arms duties.
3.3. Instructor Evaluations: Combat Arms personnel who perform lead instructor duties must
successfully complete a lead instructor evaluation on each weapon for which they provide
training before being task certified to instruct the weapon without supervision. Thereafter they
must have regular evaluations to maintain training standards. Use the instructor evaluation
checklist posted on the HQ AFSFC/SFXW web site. Modifications to the checklist are not
allowed without approval of HQ AFSFC/SFXW.
   3.3.1. Lead Instructor Evaluations. This evaluation is required once the individual has
   successfully completed two training evaluations. Satisfactory completion of this evaluation
   authorizes an individual to perform lead instructor duties without supervision. The evaluator
   must be present for the entire program of instruction.
   3.3.2. Once an instructor is lead instructor task certified on one weapon, they need only
   satisfactorily complete a lead instructor evaluation for additional weapons on which they
   conduct training. The trainer or Combat Arms NCOIC may conduct training evaluations for
   additional weapons; however, they are not required. Newly assigned instructors who were
   previously task certified on a weapon and completed a lead instructor evaluation do not
   require another lead instructor evaluation on the same weapon, but must satisfactorily
   complete a lead instructor evaluation for weapons they are not certified to instruct.
       3.3.2.1. Lead instructor evaluations must cover the complete Air Force qualification
       course training program to include performance of tower operator duties and evaluating
       preventive maintenance.
38                                            AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        3.3.2.2. All tasks performed for lead instructor evaluations are rated on the evaluation
        checklist for certification. The instructor being evaluated must achieve at least a
        satisfactory rating on all areas to receive task certification.
     3.3.3. Once lead instructor certified, each Combat Arms instructor will receive at least one
     ―No-Notice‖ evaluation each calendar year to ensure continued quality of instruction and
     training. This annual evaluation must be conducted on a different weapon each year
     (evaluations cannot be on the same type weapon for consecutive years). This evaluation
     must meet the same requirements as lead instructor evaluations. Additional no-notice
     evaluations are encouraged.
     3.3.4. Conducting evaluations. The Combat Arms NCOIC conducts lead instructor and
     annual no-notice evaluations. The individual’s trainer will conduct training evaluations. The
     immediate supervisor or someone higher in the chain of command will conduct evaluations
     on the Combat Arms NCOIC. Instructors subordinate to the NCOIC will not conduct official
     evaluations on the NCOIC (the MAJCOM/A7S may approve use of any task certified lead
     instructor [even if subordinate to the NCOIC] to conduct evaluations on the Combat Arms
     NCOIC when necessary). Other instructors may perform informal evaluations on any
     instructor to provide additional feedback on their performance. Higher HQ Combat Arms
     officials may also accomplish lead instructor and ―no notice‖ evaluations. The evaluator will
     critique each instructor evaluated. Feedback must be provided within 2 workdays following
     the evaluation. The instructor, supervisor, and evaluator should be present during the
     feedback session. If instructor performance was unsatisfactory, include the NCOIC in the
     feedback session.
     3.3.5. Document all instructor and weapon maintenance evaluation results on the
     individual’s AF Form 1098 in AFTR. Combat Arms sections may use SFMIS to record and
     track when evaluations are accomplished. Completed evaluation forms must be filed in the
     Combat Arms section. Maintain completed evaluation checklists for one year from
     completion date, then dispose of them or return them to the individual. Retain the evaluation
     checklists for one year after unsatisfactory areas are upgraded to satisfactory.
     3.3.6. Remedial Training. Provide additional training for an instructor rated unsatisfactory
     for any area. Give a follow-up evaluation within 30 days (ARC members have 2 UTAs to
     meet this requirement). Instructors must satisfactorily accomplish the evaluation before
     permitting the individual to perform lead instructor or tower operator duties.
     3.3.7. If an instructor receives an unsatisfactory rating on both formal evaluation and the
     follow-up evaluation, the Combat Arms NCOIC will make a recommendation to the
     commander whether the individual should receive further training or have their instructor
     status (B-shred or SEI) revoked. These individuals are not allowed to instruct classes or
     perform tower operator duties until the commander reaches a decision. Ensure the supervisor
     completes thorough documentation of remedial training in AFTR.
3.4. Weapons Maintenance Evaluations: The Combat Arms NCOIC will establish a system to
ensure initial and annual evaluations for their personnel who conduct weapons inspections and
maintenance. This evaluation may be conducted during actual inspections. Use the ―GO/NO-
GO‖ scale to rate each item. Combat Arms personnel must satisfactorily complete a weapon
maintenance evaluation on each weapon before being task certified to perform inspections or
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             39


maintenance without supervision. The individual’s trainer or any Combat Arms member who is
task certified to perform maintenance on the weapon may conduct the evaluation.
   3.4.1. Use the weapon maintenance evaluation checklist posted on the HQ AFSFC/SFXW
   web site. Modifications to the checklist are not allowed without approval of HQ
   AFSFC/SFXW.
   3.4.2. Establish instructor proficiency folders to maintain evaluations for senior non-
   commissioned officers who require evaluations but do not require an AF Form 623,
   Individual Training Record Folder. Evaluations include, but are not limited to,
   accomplishing and identifying procedures for:
       3.4.2.1. Scheduling weapons inspections and maintenance.
       3.4.2.2. Use of TOs, proper sequence, required gauges, fixtures, tools, etc.
       3.4.2.3. Troubleshooting suspected weapon malfunctions.
       3.4.2.4. Function firing of repaired weapons, when applicable.
       3.4.2.5. Completing required documentation; i.e., weapons parts accountability, AFTO
       Form 105, Inspection Maintenance Firing Data for Ground Weapons, and appropriate
       Department of Defense forms.
3.5. Firearms Qualification: The NCOIC is responsible for weapon qualification training of
assigned Combat Arms personnel.          Combat Arms instructors will maintain live-fire
qualifications on all weapons and courses of fire on which they are lead instructor certified.
They will also maintain qualification on any weapon for which they have an armed duty/UTC
requirement.
   3.5.1. Instructors performing Combat Arms duties who are lead instructor certified or who
   qualify strictly to maintain instructional skills are not required to attend classroom training or
   participate in the 6 month recurring training (classroom only) sessions for weapons with this
   requirement.
   3.5.2. Personnel assigned to a QFEBL will accomplish task certification on all weapons
   designated by the QFEBL Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP). Training for unique
   weapons not provided/available at home station and maintenance training certification can be
   accomplished at AETC formal schools or at regional training centers. Live fire qualification
   is not required for Combat Arms assigned to the QFEBL as the UTC is designated for
   maintenance support and not training. When practical, it is highly recommended proficiency
   ammunition be used to increase instructor weapons skills and knowledge of all weapons
   supported by the QFEBL.
3.6. Combat Arms Proficiency Training: The NCOIC will establish policies and schedule use
of authorized Combat Arms proficiency ammunition for assigned Combat Arms personnel (See
AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1). These policies should permit and encourage assigned Combat
Arms personnel to gain additional firearm proficiency and become a more skilled instructor.
Proficiency rounds are to be expended throughout the fiscal year. Proficiency firing will be
conducted quarterly. Instructors should not wait until the last month of the fiscal year to expend
the annual allotment authorized. Combat Arms proficiency ammunition is authorized for
Combat Arms proficiency only. Ensure weapons proficiency and in-house training times for
Combat Arms are included in monthly schedules.
40                                          AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


3.7. Safety Training: Combat Arms personnel will be trained to use all authorized equipment
and know the potential hazards of the workplace, review AFOSH Standards, and be familiar with
the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all hazardous products used in the section. Such
hazards include exposure to noise, airborne lead, cleaning solvents, various chemicals, and
improper range, or cleaning room ventilation. The squadron training section ensures all Combat
Arms personnel receive periodic training in ground/weapons safety, use of force, and self-
aid/buddy care. Annotate all completed training as directed in AFI 91-301 and any locally
directed records.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           41


                                           Chapter 4

      FIREARMS TRAINING PROCEDURES AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

4.1. Purpose: This chapter provides information to assist Combat Arms personnel in preparing
for classroom and range activities. Security Forces Combat Arms personnel are charged with
providing the Air Force with trained personnel who are confident and capable of effectively
employing Air Force weapons. The significance of this responsibility cannot be overstated. As
such, Combat Arms operations must be executed with the utmost professionalism and
consciousness, with emphasis on continued improvement. Weapons’ training requires individual
mental and physical skills. Personnel must pass all objectives by demonstrating their ability to
safely employ and maintain the weapon(s) as well as effectively engage targets prior to being
certified.
4.2. Classroom Procedures: Good classroom procedures enhance student learning. Remove or
reduce controllable distractions within the classroom. Ensure all material is adequately covered;
shortcuts are not authorized. Every class must include all objectives outlined in AFMAN 36-
2227, Volume 1, Combat Arms Training Programs Individual Use Weapons, or AFMAN 36-
2227, Volume 2, Combat Arms Training Programs Crew Served Weapons, as applicable.
Ensure assistance is provided to students especially those having difficulty with the material.
   4.2.1. Instruction Procedures. Instructors will only use Air Force approved lesson plans
   (approved by HQ AFSFC/SFXW) when conducting training. They will make sure all
   information in the lesson plan (both left and right columns if preprinted from HQ AFSFC) is
   presented so students will acquire intended knowledge and skills. It is the responsibility of
   Combat Arms instructors to ensure learning is achieved. Additional information that does
   not conflict with Air Force policy or procedure and is approved by the Combat Arms
   NCOIC, above what is contained in the lesson plan, is highly encouraged.
   4.2.2. Breaks. Provide breaks in the presentation at regular intervals (typically every 50
   minutes) to prevent ―information overload.‖
   4.2.3. Instructors will ensure all necessary preparations are accomplished prior to starting the
   class. Failure to do so demonstrates a lack of professionalism and detracts from the learning
   process.
   4.2.4. Continually evaluate all elements and materials to support training and ensure
   effectiveness.
   4.2.5. Primary Instructors (PI). The lead instructor must possess either a Primary AFSC
   (PAFSC) 3P051B, be a task certified 3P031B, SEI 312, or DoD civilian equivalent, and be
   qualified on the weapon and course of fire on which they are providing training. For OJT
   purposes, a 3P031B may perform as lead instructor under the direct supervision of a 3P051B,
   SEI 312, or DoD civilian equivalent until task certified.
   4.2.6. Tower operators must possess either a PAFSC of 3P051B, be a task certified 3P031B,
   SEI 312, or DoD civilian equivalent.
4.3. Assistant Instructors (AI): AIs perform key duties during weapons qualification training,
to include safety, resource protection, and coaching trainees. In the classroom, they augment the
primary instructor during portions of training requiring physical handling of weapons and during
42                                              AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


performance evaluation sessions. They assist trainees by reinforcing correct techniques and
helping to promote a positive learning environment. On the firing line, they help maintain a safe
training environment for trainees and fellow instructors. They are responsible for coaching and
assisting shooters as necessary during the practice phases of qualification training. Clear
communication between the tower operator and firing line officials is key to effective firing line
operations. Table 4.1. outlines student to AI ratios for classroom and range activities.
     4.3.1. AIs are 3P0X1B/SEI 312, DoD civilian equivalent, or task certified Group A per-
     sonnel qualified on the weapon and course of fire for which they are providing training.
     Group A personnel must have a 5-skill level and can only be used when insufficient numbers
     of Combat Arms personnel are assigned to the Combat Arms parent organization.
     4.3.2. As a standard, firing line officials (block officers) are 3P0XlB, SEI 312, or DoD
     civilian equivalent personnel. However, Group A personnel with a 5-skill level, task
     certified on firing line official duties by the Combat Arms NCOIC and qualified on the
     weapon and course of fire may perform as a firing line official. Leadership should not
     overuse this option and should not allow it to become standard practice. The preferred
     method is to use Combat Arms instructors for this duty. These individuals perform a critical
     role in training and coaching shooters and these skills take experience and significant time to
     develop.
        4.3.2.1. Combat Arms sections will develop a comprehensive training and certification
        program to certify individuals as firing line officials. At a minimum, firing line official
        training/certification will include weapon safety, range safety, role of the tower operator,
        role of firing line officials, range operations, range commands, course of fire
        requirements/procedures, firing line official duties/responsibilities, coaching techniques,
        firing line evaluation techniques, shooter errors, target analysis, and emergency
        notification procedures. This certification must include evaluation during live-fire. The
        Combat Arms organizational commander will approve all firing line official training
        plans.
        4.3.2.2. Document task certification of firing line officials on AF Form 1098. Maintain a
        locally developed training log of all personnel certified as firing line officials and indicate
        when their certification expires (refresher training is due) at the Combat Arms section.
        4.3.2.3. Firing line officials must be approved in writing by their commander and the
        Combat Arms organizational commander. Combat Arms will maintain a copy of
        approval letters at the Combat Arms section. This certification is valid for one year and
        only pertains to host Combat Arms ranges and ranges operated by the host Combat Arms
        organization. Personnel must complete refresher training annually to maintain their
        certification. The Combat Arms NCOIC will revoke certifications if individuals fail to
        follow established guidance or perform duties in an unsafe manner.

NOTE: A minimum of one AI is required for all classroom instruction. If class size dictates a
need for multiple AI’s, additional AIs are only required during the weapon
performance/evaluation portions of the class.
    4.3.3. During live-fire training sessions, Combat Arms may supervise up to three students
    for semi-automatic day fire phases for weapons specified under rule 1 in Table 4.1. without
    the presence of a tower operator. When four or more students are on the line, a tower
    operator must be present. This only pertains to rifle, pistol, and shotgun training programs.
    Instructors must be task certified AFSC 3P031B, 3P051B, SEI 312, or DoD civilian
    equivalent. All other safety requirements apply. When Combat Arms (B shred, SEI 312, or
    civilian equivalent) personnel are firing their own instructor qualification training or
    proficiency ammunition, the Combat Arms NCOIC may establish written procedures to
    conduct firing of up to six Combat Arms personnel using only a tower operator. Line
    officials are required for Combat Arms Apprentice Course graduates in 5-level upgrade
    training until task certified on the weapon and course.
4.4. Instructor Skill Level: Certified instructors are responsible for the safety of all personnel
participating in weapons qualification training. Table 4.2. outlines instructor skill level
requirements.

equivalent until task certified.
4.5. Weapons Safety: Combat Arms will ensure a safe weapons handling environment at all
times. Refer to AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, for additional guidance.
4.5. (ACC) Weapons Safety:All ACC Combat Arms sections will have a clearing barrel(s)
located outside the entrance(s) to classrooms, properly marked in accordance with (IAW)
AFMAN 31-229, Standardized Weapons Handling Procedures. Students bringing weapons into
the classroom must clear their weapon, under supervision, IAW AFMAN 31-229 prior to
entering the classroom.
     4.5.1. Primary instructors are not permitted to have live ammunition while performing lead-
     instructor duties. Only instructors performing resource protection duties are permitted to be
     armed in the classroom or weapons cleaning area. Negligent discharge incidents can be
     avoided when sound safety precautions are observed. Students with their assigned duty
     weapon will have their weapons cleared (no live ammunition present) before entering the
     classroom. Instructors will ask students if they have live ammunition, dummy rounds, or
     blank rounds on their person before allowing the weapon to be brought into classroom.
     Other than rounds carried by resource protection personnel, no live ammunition is ever
     allowed in the classroom.
     4.5.2. Use only dummy ammunition authorized in AFCAT 21-209 or empty cartridge cases
     for instructional purposes. Dummy ammunition boxes/containers will be inspected for live
     rounds before daily classroom use.
     4.5.3. Combat Arms sections should maintain two sets of training web gear for rifle and
     pistol classes. Training gear used in the classroom should not be intermingled with the live-
     fire gear used on the range. Combat Arms officials must ensure the gear is purged of live
     ammunition before returning the gear to the classroom environment.
     4.5.4. Trainees are to use their issued duty gear, providing no ammunition is introduced into
     the classroom. Personnel completing small arms qualification training are encouraged to fire
     the applicable course(s) of fire wearing individual combat equipment (ICE) every time they
     fire. This is a requirement for pre-deployment and all handgun training covered in Chapter 5.
4.6. Lesson Plans: Maintain a hard or electronic master copy of all HQ AFSFC approved
lesson plans in the Combat Arms office for weapons and/or courses where training is provided.
The NCOIC will review/ update the master whenever changes (TO or Field Manuals [FM]) are
required. Instructors will maintain their own updated personalized lesson plans to use during
instruction. A personalized lesson plan has questions, transitions, examples, training aid
correlation, personal notes and anything else necessary to assist or enhance training. The
NCOIC will certify each master and personalized lesson plan for accuracy by reviewing all
lesson plans every year or whenever changes (HQ AFSFC, TO, or FM) occur. Document proof
of lesson plan review on a form letter, general-purpose worksheet, or MAJCOM approved lesson
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        45


plan review form. The NCOIC will place a copy of the lesson plan review form in the master
and each personalized copy.
4.7. Training Aids: Many types of training aids (including firearms training simulators) are
available to Combat Arms and units. Good training aids and techniques can shorten the time
needed for teaching, learning, and proficiency. Training aids stimulate student interest and get
them actively involved. Instructors should use them wisely and with ingenuity. The Army
Training Command and most Training Support Agencies found on Army installations are
possible sources for firearms related training aids. Additionally ―Dry- fire‖ practice is an
excellent method of reducing the cost of training.
4.7. (ACC) Training Aids:All ACC Combat Arms sections will have an appropriate number of
clearing barrels in or near the classroom to teach proper weapons clearing procedures for all
weapons except the M203 grenade launcher, MK19 grenade machine gun, and M2 machine gun.
All students will be required to demonstrate proper procedures using the clearing barrels during
the weapons clearing and loading portion of instruction. These clearing barrels must be capable
of containing a negligent discharge.
4.8. Weapon Cleaning Procedures: Students must clean the weapons they use for training.
They will be taught how to properly maintain their firearm(s) IAW procedures and equipment
listed in operator manuals.
   4.8.1. The Security Forces or Combat Arms organizational commander may establish an
   alternate weapons cleaning procedure using approved cleaning tanks and solvents meeting
   specific military standards for use on weapons if they are within environmental compliance.
   Personnel may use only cleaning solutions and lubricants approved in the applicable weapon
   TO. However, students must still be trained on the cleaning procedures included in the Air
   Force approved lesson plans. All solvents and approved cleaning tanks must meet Air Force
   and local environmental requirements for safe handling and proper ventilation.
   4.8.2. Personnel will not be permitted to use unauthorized cleaners/solvents, such as
   automotive cleaners, degreasers, or unauthorized equipment.
   4.8.3. Brief students about any safety precautions contained in the MSDS and the location of
   the MSDS for the type of solvent or lubricant used. The MSDS must be available to students
   upon request.
   4.8.4. Do not allow eating, drinking, or tobacco use in the cleaning area. This reduces the
   chances of ingestion of transferred lead/heavy-metals residue or splattered cleaning solvents
   during cleaning operations. At a minimum, brief students to wash their hands with soap and
   water before eating, drinking, or smoking (including smokeless tobacco).
4.9. Student Evaluations: Instructors will evaluate students on weapons safety, the course of
fire, all required operator skills, preventive maintenance, and function check of the firearm in
accordance with the TOs. If an individual fails any evaluation in the training program, the
individual is unqualified with the weapon until able to pass the failed portions of the
evaluation(s). Reasons for failure will be entered on the AF Form 522, USAF Ground
Weapons Training Data, in SFMIS. Students must perform all tasks without assistance to pass
evaluations.
46                                              AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


4.10. Student Critique: Provide students the opportunity to accomplish a written critique of all
phases of their training. The primary instructor will inform students of this program at the
beginning of training and will ensure student critique forms are made available. The Combat
Arms NCOIC will review critiques and provide requested answers to any concerns noted.
4.11. Documentation of Training: Proper documentation is necessary to ensure accurate
ammunition accountability and proof of firearm qualification. The Combat Arms section will
use SFMIS to document all firearms training. If SFMIS is offline, all entries must be in ink or
typed electronically on the most current Information Management Tool (IMT) versions of AF
Form 710 and AF Form 522. Combat Arms must enter the data from manually completed
documents into SFMIS when it becomes available, not to exceed one duty day from when the
system is back online. The example forms provided in this instruction are the SFMIS versions.
The IMT versions are almost identical and will be completed using the same guidance. When
AF Forms 710 and 522 information are entered into SFMIS, printed copies of these forms are not
required and the Combat Arms lead instructor verifies the accuracy of the information before
closing out the class. Combat Arms must ensure that units/agencies that require printed copies of
the AF Form 522 are provided access to SFMIS to produce the form.
     4.11.1. AF Form 710 is a class roster, record of individual qualification, ammunition expen-
     diture, range utilization, and firearm use. Complete the form according to Figure 4.1.
     Students will initial next to their printed name after training is completed and the rounds
     used, score, and status blocks are completed (not required for SFMIS version). The lead
     instructor will sign in the ―Certificate of Expenditures‖ block after all students have initialed
     and ammunition expenditures are finalized. In SFMIS, the lead instructor verifies that all
     information is entered for the class and that it is accurate before closing out the class. If
     copies of the form are needed after closing out the class in SFMIS, enter ―//SIGNED//‖ in
     this block. This form is not to be used as a weapons issue roster/hand receipt. File manually
     completed (IMT) AF Forms 710 in the Combat Arms office as the primary record of
     ammunition expended and training conducted.
     4.11.2. Use AF Form 522 to document training. If a hard-copy is desired, the individual’s
     unit may print the form and maintain it to provide a record of training, use as a scheduling
     aid, or provide a crosscheck of qualification training. Organizations will use SFMIS for
     validation of qualification, previous training, or pre-deployment training. A completed
     SFMIS, AF Form 710, AF Form 522, or manually completed (IMT) version signed by
     Combat Arms (3P0XlB, SEI 312, DoD civilian equivalent), are the only allowable source
     documents for current or past qualifications. Complete AF Form 522 according to Figure
     4.2. The form may be initiated during the first period of training. Annotate rounds fired,
     score, status, and both student’s and range official’s signatures (student and range official
     signatures only required on manually prepared form) after completion of training. Instructors
     do not sign the SFMIS generated version of the form, as the system enters ―SFMIS
     Authenticated‖ in the signature block. Combat Arms personnel must also annotate if the
     student qualified wearing ICE (pre-deployment training) and/or the types of holsters the
     student is qualified to use in the remarks section. The AF Form 522 reflects the qualification
     status, type of firearm, date of qualification, and if appropriate, the individual's qualification
     for the award of the Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (SAEMR).
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                    47


  4.11.2. (ACC) The Combat Arms section will provide Airmen who are deploying within
  three duty days of training a copy of their AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training
  Data, showing training was completed.
  4.11.3. To ensure students receive the appropriate type of training (initial, recurring or
  remedial), student training records will be obtained from SFMIS or the student’s hard copy
  AF Form 522. If the student’s status cannot be determined, they will qualify under initial
  training guidelines.

                                             Chapter 5

                                     WEAPONS TRAINING

5.1. Purpose: This chapter defines policy and procedures for the execution of the Air Force
small arms training program. Only task certified Combat Arms personnel (3P0X1B, SEI 312, or
DoD civilian equivalent) or others identified in this instruction are authorized to conduct
weapons qualification training programs implemented by this instruction. Personnel who receive
training (based on mission need) may be military, DoD civilian or civilian contractors in support
of Air Force missions. Weapon qualification requirements are based upon in-garrison/peacetime
arming requirements, weapon qualifications required by certain Air Force specialties, and
deployments to combat zones/designated hostile fire areas.
5.2. General Requirements: Completion of small arms qualification training is not an
authority to be armed; unit commanders are the sole arming authority (see AFI 31-207 Arming
and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel). Weapons qualification training certifies an
individual’s ability to properly employ a firearm.
     5.2.1. Air Force weapon qualification courses listed in AFMAN 36-2227, Volumes 1 & 2,
     provide the minimum training and evaluation requirements necessary for Air Force members
     to employ individual and crew-served ground weapons.
     5.2.2. Due to resource limitations non-mission essential weapons training is prohibited. It is
     incumbent on the requesting unit commander to ensure only personnel with an arming
     requirement attend Combat Arms qualification training. Combat Arms sections will establish
     a practice of coordinating this validation with unit schedulers.
     5.2.3. Personnel who report for weapons training must be able to perform all physical
     requirements, to include assuming all firing positions, unassisted. Personnel are not
     permitted to cover their non-shooting eye with patches, cloth, or other material to control eye
     dominance problems.
        5.2.3.1. Members who are on a temporary physical profile (e.g., wearing a cast or leg
        brace) may be permitted to live-fire if their injury does not prevent them from meeting
        course objectives, assuming proper firing positions, or detracts from safe weapons
        handling.
        5.2.3.2. If a pregnant member does not have live weapons firing or range duties excluded
        on an AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, they are permitted to participate
        in these functions.
     5.2.4. If live-fire cannot be accomplished the same day, students must complete qualification
     training evaluations (live-fire) within 30 days of completion of mechanical and pre-
     marksmanship training (this also applies to remedial training).
     5.2.5. Assistant machine gunners must complete the same training program and meet the
     same qualification standards as primary machine gunners.
     5.2.6. HQ AFSFC/SFXW must approve all weapon training courses provided at
     expeditionary skills training courses (e.g. Common Battlefield Airmen Training, Air and
     Space Basic Course) or other formal training courses. Additionally, if HQ AFSFC/CC
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                         53


   approves use of other Service courses for qualification of Airmen, HQ AFSFC/SFXW must
   approve the courses (other than training provided as outlined in paragraph 5.15.). This
   ensures all weapon training provided to Airmen is consistent and based on the same common
   skills and techniques. Air Force personnel must be initially qualified as directed in this
   instruction on any weapon prior to attending any other weapon training courses or programs.
   5.2.7. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring all their unit members scheduled for
   any type of weapon training are in compliance with the Gun Control Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C.
   § 922(d)(9) and (g)(9)/Lautenberg Amendment), as outlined in AFI 31-207. Combat Arms
   personnel will not verify compliance or complete required documentation in regard to the
   Gun Control Act, as this is a unit responsibility and Combat Arms personnel cannot
   determine the status of individuals in regard to this act.
   5.2.7. (ACC) Unit schedulers will verify compliance prior to scheduling Airmen for
   weapons training.
   5.2.8. Combat Arms personnel will provide Use of Force and Rules of Engagement basics
   training during all qualification training classes. This training does not replace any other
   training requirements and is specifically designed as additional training. The goal is to
   provide students with a general understanding of Use of Force and Rules of Engagement
   guidelines as well as the differences between the two. This training is for familiarization
   only and students will not be evaluated on comprehension. Combat Arms will use the slide
   presentation approved by HQ AFSFC/SFXW available on the HQ AFSFC web site
   (https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/) to conduct this training.
   5.2.8. (ACC) Unit commanders must ensure weapons qualification and additional use of
   force training has been successfully completed prior to authorizing an individual to bear
   firearms and the individual is fit to bear arms IAW AFI 31-207.
   5.2.9. Combat Arms personnel will also provide training on individual small arms
   accountability and security requirements during all qualification training classes. This
   training ensures all personnel are aware of their responsibilities to properly safeguard Air
   Force small arms. Combat Arms will use the slide presentation approved by HQ
   AFSFC/SFXW and available on the HQ AFSFC web site (https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/)
   to conduct this training.
   5.2.10. (Added-ACC) Non-arming Group A airmen/units classified as enablers, those who
   routinely deploy multiple times each year, have a Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP)
   or Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement requiring short notice deployments are
   considered arming Group B. Wing commanders, using historical deployment data, may
   require a specific percentage of these airmen to maintain annual weapons qualifications and
   UoF/ROE training. The goal is to train only those airmen needing training, not every airman
   within the wing for the sake of flexibility. Sustainment/proficiency training is not required.
   This qualification will be valid for one year and pre-deployment weapons’ training is not
   required. This process does not apply to ACC aircrew who will follow qualification
   guidelines IAW 11-series Mission Designed Series (MDS) Ready Aircrew Program (RAP)
   Tasking memoranda. All ACC airmen deploying on Joint Expeditionary Taskings will be
   required to qualify per reporting instructions.
5.3. Individual Equipment Requirements:
54                                            AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     5.3.1. Airmen will train and qualify with their authorized issued duty holster, whether the
     holster is part of their field gear or concealed wear. The process for getting holsters
     authorized is outlined in the AFSAMP posted on the HQ AFSFC website. The evaluation
     phase of an Air Force qualification course will be fired as the holster qualification course.
     When individuals are authorized additional Air Force approved holsters by their unit
     commander (concealed carry, shoulder holster, etc.), Combat Arms will use the procedures in
     the next paragraph to qualify them. Document qualification and holster type(s) in the
     remarks section of the AF Form 522. Individuals will live fire with their primary holster,
     unless prohibited in the next paragraph.
     5.3.2. When commanders authorize the use of a shoulder, cross draw, or concealed carry
     holster, Combat Arms will use the following procedures to certify individuals to use them.
     Other than the exceptions in this paragraph, individuals will not complete live-fire using
     shoulder, cross draw, or concealed holsters. Combat Arms will include a combination of
     classroom and range dry-fire training on the proper techniques for drawing the weapon from
     these type holsters (all personnel will be performance tested on their ability to safely and
     correctly draw from a cross draw/concealed holster). Combat Arms will have individuals
     practice drawing in the classroom and satisfactorily complete performance evaluations on the
     range, without ammunition in the weapon. Once this training has been completed, personnel
     will use the standard belt and M12 holster or their primary holster (if not shoulder, cross
     draw, or concealed carry) if using multiple holsters, to qualify on the appropriate course of
     fire. If an individual is authorized multiple holsters, Combat Arms will use this classroom,
     dry-fire, and performance evaluation method to certify them on each type holster.
     EXCEPTIONS: Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) agents and Security
     Forces investigators will utilize their standard concealed duty holster and are authorized to
     live-fire using a cross draw/concealed weapon on the firing line. Combat Arms is authorized
     to live fire using a cross draw/concealed weapon only while qualifying on the AFOSI courses
     of fire. Personnel reporting for Combat Arms training who are authorized concealed carry
     must present documentation from the authorizing official to Combat Arms personnel to
     receive concealed carry training (a properly completed and current AF Form 523, USAF
     Authorization to Bear Firearms, indicating concealed carry meets this requirement).
     5.3.2. (ACC) ACC Security Forces primary duty holster is the SO4 Safariland® holster
     attached to the Air Force law enforcement ensemble. Security Forces investigators will
     qualify with the SO4 as their primary holster and the model 6281 concealed carry holster as
     their alternate holster.
     5.3.3. Deploying personnel will qualify wearing the individual combat equipment (ICE) they
     will use at their deployed location. As a minimum, ICE must include helmet, individual
     body armor (IBA), load bearing apparatus, magazine pouches (if not incorporated in a vest),
     and holster/magazine pouches for the handgun if applicable. Commanders may require other
     unique ICE to be worn during firing, with approval from the Combat Arms NCOIC to ensure
     range safety is not compromised. Logistics Readiness Squadron/Unit and Security Forces
     Squadron/Combat Arms organizational commanders will develop a process that will
     accommodate one stop for shooters to comply with equipping and training requirements.
     5.3.4. Individuals will bring their own protective mask and documentation that they are
     certified in its use in accordance with AFI 10-2501, AF Emergency Management (EM)
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           55


   Program Planning and Operations. Combat Arms sections do not maintain these items and
   they are issued through the installation readiness section.
5.4. Weapon Qualification:
   5.4.1. Due to various limitations such as munitions and facilities it is necessary to divide the
   Air Force population requiring weapons training into groups based on their arming potential.
   DoD Directive 5210.56, Use of Deadly Force and the Carrying of Firearms by DoD
   Personnel Engaged in Law Enforcement and Security Duties, and AFI 31-207 identify the
   minimum training requirements and frequency of qualification training needed to arm
   personnel. These guidelines govern peacetime/in-garrison arming and specifically state
   requirements do not apply to contingencies and designated hostile fire zones. Air Force
   weapons qualifications do not expire during deployments to combat zones or designated
   hostile fire areas, regardless of the length of deployment, providing qualification training was
   successfully completed as required by this instruction.
   5.4.2. Computer based training (CBT) modules for the M16 rifle and M9 pistol are available
   on the AETC Advanced Distributed Learning System website and individuals are encouraged
   to complete these courses prior to attending Combat Arms qualification training.
   Commander’s and unit training personnel may also use this training to augment qualification
   training and as part of unit sustainment training programs.
   5.4.3. Mechanical weapons training is a highly effective way to increase weapons familiarity
   and should be accomplished at unit level by NCOs qualified on the weapon. AFMAN 10-
   100, Airman’s Manual, also contains a weapon skills section that unit NCOs can use to
   provide unit level training to their personnel.
5.5. Arming Groups and Qualification Frequencies: Air Force Career Field Managers
(AFCFM) and Air Staff functional area directors establish overarching arming requirements for
their personnel, which include arming groups, weapon types, any specialized training. If an
AFCFM wishes to change the arming group of personnel under their functional area, they must
coordinate their request with HQ AFSFC/CC for approval. All Air Force personnel are
categorized into the following arming groups. If an individual changes arming groups from
Group B to Group A and their current qualification has exceeded 12 months or they are not
qualified, they must complete qualification training before being armed. All qualifications will
expire on the last day of the month.
   5.5.1. Air Force personnel who are armed to perform their in-garrison duties or as a
   requirement of their PAFSC are Group A. As an example, this group includes Security
   Forces, Security Forces augmentees, AFOSI agents, RED HORSE, Prime Base Engineer
   Emergency Force (BEEF), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel (RED HORSE,
   Prime BEEF, and EOD directed Group A by their AFCFM), and Battlefield Airmen AFSCs.
   Battlefield Airmen AFSCs include Combat Rescue Officers (13DXA), Special Tactics
   Officers (13DXB), Pararescue Airmen (1T2X1), Combat Control Airmen (1C2X1), Tactical
   Air Control Personnel (1C4X1), Special Operations Weather Team Airmen
   (1W0X1)/Officers (15WX) and Battlefield Weather Airmen (1W0X1)/Officers (15WX). HQ
   AFSFC/SFXW will post a listing of Group A career fields and those requiring unit live-fire
   sustainment training on their website, https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/, on the Combat Arms
   Branch page. Group A personnel will complete weapons qualification training once every 12
   months on all weapons with which they are armed. Training consists of classroom and live-
56                                               AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     fire qualification. Security Forces, Battlefield Airmen AFSCs, and others directed by their
     AFCFM are additionally required to complete mandatory unit live-fire sustainment training 5
     to 7 months after completion of qualification training on their primary weapon(s). Unit
     sustainment training is at the option of the AFCFM. For Group A individuals who require
     unit live-fire sustainment training, their qualification will expire on the first day of the eighth
     month after qualification training if unit sustainment training is not accomplished and
     documented by unit training officials.
     5.5.1. (ACC) Airmen assigned to the 3rd and 5th Combat Communications Groups are
     classified as Arming Group A. All airmen assigned to ACC active and gained rescue
     squadrons who perform airborne operations are classified as Arming Group A.
     Sustainment/proficiency training is not required. This qualification will be valid for one year
     and pre-deployment weapons’ training is not required. Group A Airmen who are required to
     complete unit level proficiency/sustainment training between 5 and 7 months after
     qualification, but fail to perform the training, may be granted a onetime 120-day qualification
     extension by their commander IAW AFI 31-207, paragraph 2.11.1. Once the training is
     completed, the Airmen’s AF Form 522 will reflect an expiration of the original qualification
     month, not exceeding one year.
        5.5.1.1. Security Forces and Battlefield Airmen AFSCs will qualify annually using the
        specialized qualification course (rifle/carbine and handgun as applicable) or advanced
        phases/orders of the Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) when implemented.
        Individuals who are only armed occasionally and are not identified by their AFCFM are
        exempt from completing unit sustainment training. An example is Security Forces
        augmentee personnel. Unless otherwise identified on the HQ AFSFC/SFXW listing,
        these individuals will qualify annually using the AFQC and are not required to complete
        the advanced phases/orders when implemented. Qualifications will expire on the last day
        of the month, 12 months from the date of qualification (e.g. individual qualifies on 10
        Mar 08, their expiration date will be 31 Mar 09).
        5.5.1.2. Exceptions to the above frequencies are the MK19 and M2 machineguns. Live-
        fire qualification on these weapons is valid for 12 months. M2 and MK19 gunners must
        complete mechanical training five to seven months after live-fire training. Gunners are
        unqualified on the first day of the eighth month if mechanical training is not
        accomplished however, personnel who complete mechanical training any time between
        the eighth month and before the annual qualification expiration date will once again be
        considered qualified until the annual expiration date. At the 12-month point, individuals
        must complete the full course again including live-fire. Individuals are not required to
        complete mechanical training and performance evaluations while deployed and their
        qualification remains valid for the entire length of the deployment. Any other unique
        qualification frequencies will be indentified in the applicable chapter of AFMAN 36-
        2227, Volumes 1 & 2.
        5.5.1.3. Unless otherwise directed by mission requirements (i.e. Security Forces
        Investigator) or the Security Forces commander, the primary duty weapon for all Security
        Forces personnel is the M4 carbine or M16 series rifle (M16A2, GAU, or GUU-5P).
        Individuals must train more frequently with the particular weapon type they routinely
        carry.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        57


     5.5.1.3. (ACC) The primary duty weapons for all ACC Security Forces without a
     protection level 1 mission will be the M4 carbine and the Air Force service pistol. ACC
     Security Forces will maintain qualifications on both weapons to meet in-garrison and
     deployment duty requirements.
     5.5.1.4. Credentialed Security Forces investigators will be assigned, as a minimum, the
     Air Force service pistol as their primary duty weapon. Security Forces investigators must
     qualify on the handgun AFQC with Air Force law enforcement ensemble (AF-LEE)
     standard issue gear. Security Forces investigators must qualify on the Air Force Office of
     Special Investigations (AFOSI) Practical Pistol Course (PPC) using the approved AFOSI
     concealed carry holster. Security Forces investigators must qualify on the AFOSI PPC
     prior to being authorized to carry a concealed firearm. If mission requirements dictate an
     immediate need for an authorization for concealed carry, the AFOSI PPC will be fired
     prior to carrying the Air Force service pistol concealed without regard to the previous
     AFQC qualification date. Once initial AFOSI PPC qualification has been completed, and
     with commander approval, the AFOSI PPC will continue to qualify the Security Forces
     investigator for concealed carry.
     5.5.1.5. Graduates of the Security Forces Apprentice Course depart school dual qualified
     on the carbine and pistol. This qualification is valid for the current cycle they fired and
     expires at the end of the following qualification cycle at their gaining base (12 months
     maximum). Graduates who arrive at their first permanent duty station during the unit
     sustainment training firing cycle should be scheduled to fire the sustainment course
     (carbine and/or pistol) with their assigned weapon before the end of the cycle. Do not
     fire personnel out of cycle to meet the intent of advanced/specialized programs.
     5.5.1.6. AFOSI agents will qualify annually with the AFOSI issue handgun. Agents will
     fire the AFOSI PPC using the handgun AFQC objectives in addition to the PPC
     objectives. Agents must fire the unit sustainment training course as specified in
     AFOSIMAN 71-113, Firearms, Use of Force, and Apprehension Tactics.
        5.5.1.6.1. All AFOSI active duty, reserve, and civilian special agents and support
        personnel identified to deploy will be qualified on a specific M16 series weapon
        (M16A2, GAU, GUU, M4 carbine). NOTE: AFOSI support personnel are
        considered Group B.
        5.5.1.6.2. AFOSI agents are responsible for meeting other requirements as specified
        in AFOSIMAN 71-113.
        5.5.1.6.3. Changes to the AFOSI PPC and special weapons courses are authorized
        when approved by HQ AFOSI/XI and the United States Air Force Special
        Investigations Academy Commander (USAFSIA/CC). Changes must be coordinated
        with HQ AFSFC/SFXW.
        5.5.1.6.4. Combat Arms units with range and maintenance capability are to provide
        support for specialized/specific AFOSI weapons and courses coordinated and
        approved by HQ AFSFC/SFXW. AFOSI is to make any specialized/specific
        weapons available to Combat Arms to conduct instructor training, maintenance
        training, and qualifications. Combat Arms units not directly assigned to AFOSI are
        not authorized to order these AFOSI specialized/specific weapons for this purpose.
58                                          AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        AFOSI is to provide any specialized/specific targets (not already used for normal
        qualification courses) and any special equipment required for their courses.
        5.5.1.6.5. Agents reporting for weapon qualification will be in either agent or casual
        civilian attire. Civilian attire for AFOSI PPC is mandatory.
        5.5.1.6.6. Joint Drug Enforcement Teams (J-DETs), while assigned to AFOSI, will
        qualify on both the AFQC and AFOSI PPC. J-DETs subject to recall by the security
        forces commander will maintain Air Force service pistol qualification. J-DETs will
        only make the transition to the M11 if there is no possibility of recall to their Security
        Forces unit.
     5.5.1.7. Air National Guard (ANG) Group A personnel must qualify annually on the
     rifle/carbine advanced/specialized courses/phases, as a minimum. ANG/A7S has waiver
     authority on the night fire portions of advanced/specialized courses.
     5.5.1.8. Newly assigned Group A personnel and Group A personnel with individually
     assigned weapons replaced or having major repairs affecting the sight setting of the
     weapon (e.g. replaced barrel, upper receiver, sights, etc.) will be provided the opportunity
     to zero their assigned weapon prior to being armed with it. Combat Arms must forecast
     for these munitions IAW AFCAT 21-209 and ensure the range and needed Combat Arms
     personnel are available to conduct this operation.
     5.5.1.8. (ACC) Combat Arms must be present when zeroing weapons that had major
     repairs performed. Newly assigned Group A personnel may zero their weapons with any
     range certified person present.
     5.5.1.9. Aircrew members armed for air operations security (e.g. antihijacking) or other
     aircrew arming missions are classified as Group A. MAJCOMs may link Group A
     aircrew firearms qualification training to an aircrew ground training cycle program with a
     training frequency not to exceed 24 months. Management of the aircrew ground training
     cycle is the responsibility of the aircrew OPR. Aircrew small arms qualifications may be
     linked to their appropriate airframe-specific ground cycle training program identified in
     the applicable AFI 11-2 series aircrew training publication. Combat Arms personnel will
     enter an expiration date 24 months after the month of qualification on the AF Form 522
     in SFMIS. Aircrew personnel using this process may complete recurring qualification
     training during the 15th to 24th month after qualification. If firearms training is not
     linked to an aircrew ground training cycle program, the standard Group A qualification
     length of 12 months applies. These individuals will qualify using the AFQC and are not
     required to complete the advanced phases/orders when implemented.
     5.5.1.9. (ACC) ACC aircrew will be assigned to Arming Group B and follow
     qualification guidelines IAW 11-series MDS RAP Tasking memoranda.
     5.5.1.10. All personnel assigned (including support personnel) to a Tactical Air Control
     Party (TACP), Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), or Control and Reporting Center
     (CRC) UTC may be classified as Group A, at the discretion of the unit commander and
     based on mission requirements. If classified as Group A, these individuals must meet all
     Group A qualification requirements, including unit level sustainment training if
     applicable. Personnel assigned to Combat Camera squadrons are classified as Group A.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            59


   5.5.2. Individuals/AFSCs who are not armed in-garrison and are only armed for
   contingencies are Group B. These individuals will complete weapons qualification only
   when they are identified by name by their commander to fill a deployment tasking to a
   combat zone in time of war or a designated hostile fire area (actually deploying, not merely
   subject to deployment). Group B individuals must qualify on the rifle/carbine or handgun
   AFQC and any other weapons identified in their deployment tasking. These individuals will
   complete qualification training as outlined in paragraph 5.13. Group B qualifications will be
   valid for 12 months or the length of the deployment, whichever is longer. If required to
   qualify for reasons other than a contingency deployment, such as overseas assignment or
   non-contingency deployment, Group B qualifications will be valid for 12 months.
   Qualifications will expire on the last day of the month, 12 months from the date of
   qualification (e.g. individual qualifies on 10 Mar 08, their expiration date will be 31 Mar 09).
   5.5.2. (ACC) Airmen who are deploying to non-combat or non-hostile fire areas do not
   need to conduct live-fire qualification training. The only exceptions will be if line remarks
   required weapons qualification or the airmen will be performing armed duties.
   5.5.3. Staff personnel assigned at group level and above, who would normally maintain
   firearms qualification by virtue of their AFSC, are not required to maintain firearms
   qualification unless designated for armed duty or deployment tasking. However, the staff
   agency director may establish qualification training requirements.
   5.5.3. (ACC) HQ ACC staff personnel are considered Arming Group B.
5.6. Firearms Training Programs: The Air Force courses listed in AFMAN 36-2227,
Volumes 1 and 2, provide the minimum training and evaluation necessary for Air Force
members to employ individual and crew-served ground weapons. Should an individual initially
fail to meet standards, the person’s unit will determine if the person will be rescheduled for
remedial training or if the person’s arming requirement is revoked. Combat Arms may provide
same day refire attempt(s) on the evaluation portion the individual failed, resources permitting
(this is not considered remedial training). Group A personnel who fail any second attempt of the
evaluation portion, will be immediately scheduled for remedial training. The Combat Arms
section will notify the appropriate commander of the option of granting a 30-day qualification
extension IAW paragraph 5.10.3. of this AFI. Instructors may determine the number of zero or
practice rounds (if any) to expend before the student attempts to qualify.
   5.6.1. Personnel are not authorized to fire government procured ammunition using privately
   owned weapons. Personnel are not authorized to fire privately owned ammunition using
   government weapons. If possible, individuals are to fire and qualify with the actual assigned
   military firearm with which they are or will be armed. Do not remove firearms from
   extended storage packaging solely to comply with this requirement, unless the individual is
   deploying with the weapon.
   5.6.2. Where applicable, the Air Force has adopted US Army Field Manuals as instructor
   guides and references for most weapons. Combat Arms sections will use them as a guide for
   conducting the training programs. However, Air Force publications and policies take
   precedence when there are conflicts in guidance or procedures.
   5.6.3. Do not mix initial or recurring students with remedial students in the same classes.
60                                              AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     5.6.3. (ACC) Group A and Group B students may be trained together to ease scheduling
     issues.
5.7. Handgun Orientation Training: Handgun orientation training may be conducted for
United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Cadets, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC)
officer accessions and Air Force Basic Military Training (BMT) enlisted accessions. This
training consists of classroom instruction in general firearms safety, basic operation, and
marksmanship fundamentals. After completion of classroom training, students participate in a
live-fire session by completing phase II (evaluation) of the handgun AFQC. Trainees earn the
Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (SAEMR) if they achieve an expert score. This
program does not qualify an individual for armed duty. If qualification is required, personnel
must meet the full objectives and requirements in AFMAN 36-2227 for the handgun AFQC
training program.
5.8. Rifle Orientation Training: Rifle orientation training may be conducted for USAFA
Cadets and ROTC officer accessions. This training consists of classroom instruction in general
firearms safety, basic operation, and marksmanship fundamentals. After completion of
classroom training, students participate in a live-fire session by completing the zero and
evaluation portions of the rifle AFQC. Trainees earn the SAEMR if they achieve an expert
score. This program does not qualify an individual for armed duty. If qualification is required,
personnel must meet the full objectives and requirements in AFMAN 36-2227 for the rifle
AFQC training program.
5.9. Initial Firearms Live-Fire Qualification:
     5.9.1. Initial weapons training will be completed through live-fire training and qualification
     for individual, gunner, and assistant gunners. Initial full distance qualification is mandatory
     for first time qualification on the MK19 and M2 machine guns. Initial full distance
     qualification is the preferred method for the M60 and M240 machine guns, and the M249
     automatic rifle. MAJCOMs may implement initial 10-meter (10m) qualifications when local
     full distance ranges are not available for M60, M240, and M249 weapons training programs.
     The Combat Arms organizational commander may implement initial 10-meter (10m)
     qualifications when local full distance ranges are not available, or their use is cost
     prohibitive, for M60, M240, and M249 weapons training programs. The Security Forces
     commander will inform the MAJCOM/A7S when they are using initial 10-meter
     qualification.
     5.9.1. (ACC) Full distance training is the preferred method for initial and recurring machine
     gun and automatic rifle training. 10-meter qualifications will only be used when filling short
     notice, 30 days or less, deployment/contingency requirements or when full distance ranges
     are more than two hour away (one way).
     5.9.2. Initial live-fire qualification is detailed, in-depth training designed to give an
     individual the knowledge and skills necessary to meet qualification standards to be armed for
     a specific type of firearm. The firearms program evaluates the individual’s marksmanship
     and operator skills. Individuals who have an arming requirement (peacetime or wartime)
     must satisfactorily complete the appropriate qualification course for the type of firearm(s)
     they will be required to employ. Officer accessions at the Air Force Academy are to receive
     initial handgun and rifle live-fire qualification. Officer accessions at Officer Training School
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            61


   are to receive initial handgun live fire qualification. Air Force enlisted accessions complete
   initial rifle live-fire qualification during BMT.
5.10. Recurring Qualification Training: Personnel required to maintain weapons qualification
must successfully complete qualification training at a frequency specified for their arming group.
They must have already been initially qualified (live-fire) on the weapon. Combat Arms can
verify qualification using SFMIS or the individual’s AF Form 522. Recurring qualification is
not usually as detailed as initial or remedial training and is used to counter proficiency and skill
retention lost over time.
   5.10.1. Weapons safety procedures and the training objectives (performance tests) in
   AFMAN 36-2227, Volume 1, are the minimum mandatory items required for Group A
   recurring training on the M16 series rifle, M9 pistol, and shotgun.
   5.10.2. A ―training session‖ is defined as one trip to the classroom/range to receive weapons
   qualification training. ―Re-fires‖ are defined as additional attempts during a qualification
   training session (occurs when a student fails to qualify). If a student fails to qualify only one
   re-fire is permitted, then the student must be scheduled for remedial training.
   5.10.3. Unit commanders may grant a 30-day qualification extension to individuals who
   were qualified at the time they reported for training, but failed the course. This extension
   will not cause the individual’s qualification to exceed 12 months, or 24 months for Group A
   aircrew personnel when the MAJCOM has elected to link small arms qualification to an
   aircrew ground training cycle program. Unit training sections will ensure qualification
   extensions are annotated in the remarks section of the individual’s printed AF Form 522 and
   provide the Combat Arms organizational commander with a courtesy copy of the extension
   letter. Since this extension can only be granted by the individual’s current commander, it is
   not transferable if the individual changes units and does not require entry into SFMIS. This
   30-day extension gives commanders some flexibility in meeting home station peacetime
   arming requirements. This option does not permit personnel to deploy to high threat areas.
   If a person fails to qualify after the second attempt, the person is considered unqualified at
   the time of the second failure and not authorized an extension. NOTE: This provision is not
   automatic. It can only be administered on a case-by-case basis with the written approval of
   each individual’s unit commander/designated official.
   5.10.4. Individuals who fail to meet a specific qualification training standard during multiple
   phase courses may continue to fire the entire course before receiving an on the spot re-fire
   attempt on the phase they failed. Group re-fire attempts may be administered after the entire
   course is fired or anytime between phases. However, accurate ammunition expenditures
   must be included on the AF Form 710.
5.11. Remedial Firearms Training: This is in-depth training to emphasize shooting
fundamentals. Remedial training sessions are kept small, or individualized, to focus on specific
problems and afford the trainee an opportunity to improve.
   5.11.1. Instructors may issue additional ammunition for use during remedial
   zeroing/teaching phases. Conduct ball and dummy exercises or simulator training, as
   needed, before evaluation.
   5.11.2. Students are permitted one re-fire during the remedial training session(s), if they fail
   on the second attempt; schedule them for a second and final remedial class.
62                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     5.11.3. If a student fails to qualify and has been scheduled for remedial training, the firing
     line official will prepare a written assessment of the shooter’s problems. This evaluation will
     assist future instructors to focus efforts on the problems. Maintain the assessment until the
     next scheduled remedial training class.
     5.11.4. If the student fails to qualify after the final remedial class, the Combat Arms NCOIC
     will provide the individual’s unit commander a written summary of probable causes of the
     failures. If the commander determines the individual’s duties require arming and
     recommends the individual for additional training, the student will attend a remedial class
     with no more than two attempts at qualifying.
     5.11.5. The Combat Arms NCOIC will provide a progress report to the commander for
     review after each training session.
     5.11.6. If the member still fails to qualify after additional training, the commander needs to
     make a determination regarding the need to consider the individual for armed duty or
     contingency deployment.
5.12. Overseas Firearms Qualification Information:
     5.12.1. Some Air Force personnel require small arms qualification training for assignment to
     overseas areas. A Personnel Processing Code (PPC) will identify personnel if an assignment
     requires them to be weapons qualified. Personnel with questions about PPCs or overseas
     firing requirements should contact their local Military Personnel Element (MPE) or gaining
     command for guidance on this personnel action. The Combat Arms section only provides
     weapons qualification training not interpretation of the codes or justification. For unique
     situations, refer to AFI 31-207 for qualification extensions.
     5.12.2. MAJCOM PPC identified individuals from either arming group with overseas
     assignments normally receive either rifle/carbine qualification training (enlisted) or handgun
     qualification training (officer) unless function or mission dictate otherwise. The goal is for
     these individuals to meet live-fire qualification training standards. However, if an individual
     fails to qualify after three attempts, the losing MPE should contact the gaining command for
     guidance.
     5.12.3. When an assignment has a PPC assigned requiring an individual to be small arms
     qualified, the MPE personnel relocation element sends a letter to the individual’s unit
     commander specifying when to complete the training. If training is not entered in SFMIS,
     the individual or the individual’s unit ensures the AF Form(s) 522 is provided to the MPE for
     transfer to the new assignment. During in-processing, the gaining MPE will ensure the AF
     Form(s) 522 is given to the member’s new unit. See the MPE for further guidance.
     5.12.4. When identified by a PPC code, Air Force personnel receive firearms training before
     departing for an overseas assignment. While assigned overseas, individuals receive recurring
     firearms training according to established training policies. Personnel requesting weapons
     qualification training for a PCS will provide proof of impending assignment along with out-
     processing worksheet.
5.13. Pre-Deployment Firearms Qualification Training Requirements: This section
provides guidance on the minimum firearms qualification training required for Air Force
personnel deploying to a contingency operation. NOTE: Combatant commanders may impose
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                         63


more stringent requirements and unit deployment managers must verify reporting instructions to
ensure their personnel receive required training within the specified time.
   5.13.1. All personnel identified by name by their commander to fill a deployment tasking to
   a combat zone in time of war or a designated hostile fire area (actually deploying, not merely
   subject to deployment) will complete live-fire qualification training on all individual
   weapons (e.g. rifle, carbine, handgun, grenade launcher, shotgun, submachine gun, automatic
   rifle, etc.) identified for the deployment within 120 days (180 days for crew-served weapons)
   of the date they final out-process their home station for deployment. This qualification will
   be valid for 12 months or the entire duration of the deployment, regardless of length. The
   weapon training requirement will be identified on the individual’s deployment orders.
   Students must present a deployment tasking letter signed by their unit commander when
   reporting for training.
   5.13.2. Due to more frequent and advanced training, Group A personnel who have
   successfully completed live-fire qualification training, wearing ICE, within 180 days of
   deployment final out-processing are considered deployment weapons qualified and do not
   require any additional qualification training. However, these individuals must complete live-
   fire zero with the weapons and sights (optics) they will take on the deployment, prior to
   leaving home station.
   5.13.3. If the deployment departure is delayed, for any reason, the individual will remain
   deployment qualified.
   5.13.4. If after returning from deployment, more than 12 months has passed since
   qualification the individual must complete live-fire qualification prior to being armed in-
   garrison. Group A individuals are exempt from unit live-fire sustainment training while
   deployed. Personnel armed with the MK19 and M2 machineguns are exempt from six-month
   mechanical recurring training while deployed.
   5.13.5. All personnel completing small arms qualification training, in preparation for
   deployment, will fire the applicable course(s) of fire wearing individual combat equipment
   (ICE). The ICE requirement includes those who will be issued ICE at their deployed
   location. As a minimum, ICE must include helmet, individual body armor (IBA), load
   bearing apparatus, magazine pouches (if not incorporated in a vest), and holster/magazine
   pouch for the handgun if applicable. Equipment must be the same as that used at the
   deployed location. Individuals must perform all reloading portions in the course of fire using
   the magazine pouches or vest they expect to use when deployed. Commanders may require
   other unique ICE to be worn during firing, with approval from the Combat Arms NCOIC to
   ensure range safety is not compromised. For ranges where helmets cannot be worn during
   live-fire due to hearing protection requirements, Combat Arms will perform dry-fire training
   with students wearing helmets in the classroom and on the range and conduct performance
   evaluations to ensure proficiency. These individuals will then complete live-fire without the
   helmet.
   5.13.6. This policy applies to all individuals with an arming requirement at the deployed
   location, whether they take weapons or have them issued in theater.
64                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     5.13.7. Aircrew personnel who will not perform any ground combat duties at the deployed
     location or use ICE are exempt from this requirement. If they have an aircrew arming
     requirement, their live-fire qualification must be current before deployment departure.
     5.13.8. Individuals who regularly deploy to hostile fire areas multiple times during a 12-
     month period are not required to complete qualification training prior to each deployment. If
     the individual has completed live-fire qualification wearing ICE during the previous 12-
     month period and they must deploy again, after returning to their home station, they will be
     considered deployment qualified. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring their
     personnel do not abuse this policy by using it as a way to circumvent the intent of ensuring
     Airmen are prepared for combat.
     5.13.9. Units/bases unable to comply with these requirements must contact the
     MAJCOM/A7S for guidance on alternate methods of accomplishing the training. The
     MAJCOM/A7S will coordinate with HQ AFSFC/CC to facilitate action to meet this
     requirement.
     5.13.10. There are locations with pre-positioned weapons and firing the actual weapon
     before the deployment is not feasible. In these cases, if possible, the installation/site
     commander at the deployed location should make allowances for conducting zero firing soon
     after the deployed personnel arrive. Combat Arms personnel should make provisions for
     individuals deploying with a weapon from extended storage to zero their weapon if already
     qualified or if their weapon has been changed for some reason. Group A personnel must
     complete live-fire zero with the weapons and sights (optics) they will take on the
     deployment, prior to leaving home station if they used a different weapon to complete
     qualification training.
5.14. Virtual Training Systems (VTS) Use for Weapons Qualification Training: Virtual
Training Systems (VTS) are efficient and time/cost effective tools to provide real world training
at the unit level in the following areas: use of force, theater or command specific rules of
engagement, tactical and judgmental scenarios. VTS are very good for initial through advance
marksmanship and remedial training. Personnel are encouraged to utilize VTS to practice
marksmanship fundamentals prior to qualification training. Approved courseware is authorized
for Air Force use and encouraged for training at the unit level.
     5.14.1. Arming groups that do not fire on an annual basis are encouraged to use VTS.
     5.14.2. ANG/A7S may continue to use simulators if range firing is not possible. This
     approval will require a written waiver request through the wing commander.
     5.14.3. When approved by MAJCOM/A7S, VTS firearm simulators must:
        5.14.3.1. Perform in all respects like the actual weapon. The intent of the simulator is to
        allow realistic training to increase survival skills and to ensure instinctive reactions when
        needed.
        5.14.3.2. Have adjustable noise and recoil simulation to make the experience as real as
        possible.
        5.14.3.3. Make the student use the same physical skills and actions needed to fire the
        actual weapon.
        5.14.3.4. The firing line must mimic an actual firing line.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           65


5.15. Firearms Qualifications for Air Force Personnel Assigned to Other Services: Air
Force personnel permanently assigned to sister service installations and directly supporting joint
service missions, such as Tactical Air Control Party or Air Support Operations Center personnel,
are authorized to use sister service approved firearms qualification courses conducted by host
service personnel as their primary method of accomplishing qualification training during their
tour of duty. Units with personnel receiving qualification training from other Services must
arrange to have their qualification data entered into SFMIS. The Combat Arms section at the
installation providing administrative support is responsible for updating weapons qualification
data submitted by the unit. This will ensure a record of qualification is visible within in the Air
Force system.
   5.15.1. Other Service qualifications will not be used to arm Air Force personnel for in-
   garrison arming missions on Air Force installations. Members who are reassigned from a
   sister service installation to an Air Force installation must complete Air Force firearms
   qualification training to remain qualified.
   5.15.2. Units using this option must ensure individuals receive basic Use of Force and Rules
   of Engagement training during qualification training. Unit training personnel may provide
   this training following the guidance in paragraph 5.2.8.
5.16. Pre-Deployment Qualification Training by Other Services: In short notice or
unanticipated circumstances, Airmen may have no alternative other than to report to pre-
deployment training conducted by another Service or agency (e.g. US Army Power Projection
Platform) without prior Air Force qualification. This must be the exception to policy and only
after all efforts to get the Airmen qualified by Air Force Combat Arms have been exhausted.
   5.16.1. When an Airman reports to pre-deployment training conducted by another Service or
   agency under such conditions, training and qualification by the host Service may be required.
   Commanders may use one of two courses of action to offset this shortfall: send Air Force
   Combat Arms personnel to the training location to qualify Air Force members, or if not
   feasible, request approval from HQ AFSFC/SFXW to utilize host Service training,
   qualification courses, and training personnel to qualify Air Force personnel.
   5.16.2. If leadership selects the second option above, qualification training must satisfy the
   training objectives for the appropriate weapon(s) as listed in the applicable volume of
   AFMAN 36-2227. Additionally, other Service qualifications under these conditions are only
   valid for the specific mission requiring the training and may not be used for in-garrison
   arming of Air Force personnel.
5.17. Weapons Training by other than Air Force Combat Arms Personnel: Other than
individuals addressed in paragraphs 5.15. and 5.16., Air Force members must be live-fire
qualified by Air Force Combat Arms personnel before participating in any other live-fire
weapons training including training provided by another Service, agency, or contractor.
5.18. Unit Live-Fire Proficiency/Sustainment Training: This section describes an innovative
concept to facilitate increased hands-on weapons training. The intent is to permit the user to
create a weapons training program more in-line with their operational needs. This effort will not
replace periodic Air Force weapons qualification requirements but is additional training to
maintain perishable skills by affording personnel more live-fire time. Individuals must be
currently qualified on the weapon prior to participating in the proficiency/sustainment program.
66                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


For this initiative to be effective Combat Arms sections must be open-minded and creative
without sacrificing safety. Combat Arms must be responsive to the unique training requirements
of other specialties and able to identify training capabilities within the restrictions of the firing
range. Only Combat Arms personnel are authorized to conduct weapons qualification training,
but anyone range official certified by the Combat Arms NCOIC can conduct proficiency or
sustainment training.
     5.18.1. Units with authorized proficiency munitions, per AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, may
     use Air Force small arms ranges to conduct their proficiency/sustainment training on an as-
     available basis. The Combat Arms NCOIC will establish procedures for scheduling and use
     of the firing range.
     5.18.2. Air Force specialties, which previously maintained semi-annual and quarterly
     weapons qualification requirements, may use this provision to supplement their annual
     qualification training.
     5.18.3. Units who are authorized proficiency/competition ammunition are responsible for
     managing their individual ammunition supply accounts, to include disposition of munitions
     residue. Combat Arms is not required to provide ammunition, manpower, or weapons to
     conduct unit proficiency/competition training programs.
     5.18.4. Combat Arms sections will assist units with development of their weapons training
     program.
     5.18.5. Before conducting live fire training, Combat Arms must approve courses/type of fire
     for each weapon used on their range to ensure range safety limitations are met.
     5.18.6. The unit training section can establish a unit level proficiency weapons training
     program at the discretion of the unit commander in accordance with this instruction. This
     program should focus training on advanced weapons tactics, techniques, and
     procedures. This program should also be progressive in nature to encourage a continual
     improvement in weapons handling skills and tactics proficiency.
     5.18.7. Unit commanders are also encouraged to institute a small arms training program that
     does not include live-fire. Unit NCOs who are qualified on the weapon being trained can
     provide training to their personnel using AFMAN 10-100 as a reference. Individuals are not
     required to be qualified in order to participate in non-live-fire small arms training.
     5.18.7. (ACC) Personnel conducting training with simulated marking cartridges, where the
     upper receiver or barrel of the issued weapon has been changed (e.g., Dye Marking
     Cartridge), must be qualified on the weapon.
     5.18.8. Unit training managers will document all required proficiency/sustainment training
     in SFMIS.
     5.18.9. Individuals range safety officer certified by the Combat Arms NCOIC may conduct
     unit live-fire sustainment training as outlined in paragraph 2.3.2.2.
5.19. Firearms Competitions/Courses: Commanders may approve Air Force personnel to use
duty weapons and approved munitions to participate in military and civilian shooting
competitions and courses. AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, provides allowances for matches
conducted as outlined in AFI 34-227, Excellence-In-Competition, and other competitions
between security forces units and local law enforcement agencies.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            67


5.20. Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (SAEMR):
   5.20.1. Award the SAEMR to the following personnel:
       5.20.1.1. Personnel who live-fire qualify with an expert score on the handgun/rifle
       AFQC, the rifle TRQC (see AFMAN 36-2227, Volume 1), or the AFOSI PPC.
       5.20.1.2. Personnel who are unable to fire the AFQC and achieve an expert score
       (through live-fire) on another Service's qualification program such as the U.S. Army M16
       rifle qualification course. This course must be pre-approved by an Air Force MAJCOM
       for Air Force personnel/units physically assigned to another branch of the military.
       5.20.1.3. Personnel who live-fire qualify with an expert score on the rifle or handgun
       orientation training identified in paragraphs 5.7. and 5.8. of this instruction.
   5.20.2. The AF Form 522 is the basis for the SAEMR award. The individual awarded the
   SAEMR is responsible for bringing the AF Form 522 to the MPE Awards and Decorations
   section. The MPE enters the award on the individual's automated personnel record.
   5.20.3. AFI 36-2803, Individual and Unit Awards and Decorations, prescribes authority for
   the award of this ribbon. AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
   Personnel, shows proper wear of the SAEMR.
   5.20.4. One Bronze Service Star can be awarded in addition to the SAEMR when an
   individual qualifies as expert with both the rifle and a handgun. Only one award per weapon
   type (rifle or handgun) is made no matter how many times the individual qualifies as expert.
   5.20.5. Individuals may not fire the handgun or rifle AFQC, rifle specialized courses or
   phases/orders from the AFQC when implemented, USAFSIA/FT PPC, or another Service’s
   qualification program, for the sole purpose of obtaining the expert ribbon.
5.21. Non-Lethal Munitions Qualification with Firearms: Personnel identified by their unit
commander to be armed with non-lethal munitions must initially qualify on the AFQC or
specialized course as applicable; then fire the non-lethal course, phases, or orders outlined in
AFMAN 36-2227 V1 or V2. Students should wear full riot control gear when possible/practical.
Non-lethal qualification training is documented as a separate qualification in SFMIS and on the
individual’s AF Form 522 and expires on the weapons AFQC expiration date. Combat Arms
personnel are not required to be qualified as non-lethal instructors in order to train on non-lethal
munitions.
5.22. Blank Fire and Exercises: Air Force personnel engaged in training with blank
ammunition such as field exercises, military working dog teams, and honor guard are not
considered armed as defined by AFI 31-207. Therefore, they are not required to maintain
firearms qualification. Individual units will provide their own training to emphasize safe
handling, weapon operation, use of blank ammunition and operator maintenance as directed in
AFMAN 31-229. This training should be documented on AF Form 1098 or AF Form 797.
   5.22.1. Bird/wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. Combat Arms should assist
   unit trainers in OJT task certifying their personnel. These personnel are not certified to go
   ―solo‖ until, they have completed training as outlined in the approved local BASH plan.
68                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     5.22.2. Individuals who carry the weapon with ammunition that fires any type of projectile
     (including shot) must complete the appropriate complete qualification course before carrying
     the weapon with this type ammunition.
5.23. Deviations:
     5.23.1. Deviations from program or facility criteria are categorized as permanent or
     temporary waivers.
        5.23.1.1. A permanent deviation is given when a condition makes it impossible to
        comply with program or facility criteria or a training objective, and it is impossible or too
        expensive to correct the condition. The deviation must not create an unsafe situation.
        5.23.1.2. A temporary deviation is for a correctable condition temporarily making it
        impossible to comply with program or facility criteria or a training objective.
     5.23.2. The Security Forces commander/Combat Arms organizational commander submits
     deviation requests to the appropriate approval authority for all facility and equipment
     limitations preventing full compliance with or accomplishment of program or facility criteria.
     The request for deviation must:
        5.23.2.1. Specify the reasons why a deviation is needed.
        5.23.2.2. Explain what is being done to lessen the impact and meet criteria.
        5.23.2.3. Include plans to correct the situation.
5.24. General Exceptions:
     5.24.1. Individuals stationed in countries or areas within a country where customs, laws, or
     international agreements make it difficult or impossible to receive firearms training are not
     required to have firearms training for the duration of the assignment, not to exceed 24
     months. This provision does not preclude MAJCOMs from maintaining qualification
     intervals at established TDY locations. NOTE: Individual weapons qualifications must be
     current prior to being granted the 24 month extension.
     5.24.2. HQ AFRC/A7S and HQ ANG/A7S may implement approved training initiatives to
     help manage their programs. There is a possibility approved initiatives may not coincide
     with active duty requirements. Refer to their specific publications/supplements for additional
     guidance.
     5.24.3. Students attending technical training courses at Lackland AFB are exempt from
     firing weapons phases/orders requiring chemical warfare protective equipment (i.e., gas mask
     and gloves). Students are considered qualified if they achieve a qualifying score and their
     AF Form 522 is annotated with a ―Q‖ in the status block. Although not required, students
     may fire these phases/orders upon arrival at their first duty station. Individuals must fire
     these phases/orders before deployment to a hostile fire area.
     5.24.4. HQ AFOSI will manage use of Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC)
     certified instructors and task certified AFSC 7S0X1 individuals to ensure sufficient numbers
     of personnel to support the USAFSIA Combat Arms Program.
        5.24.4.1. When insufficient numbers of Combat Arms or civilian equivalent personnel
        are available, USAFSIA/CC may authorize FLETC firearms instructors at the USAFSIA
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           69


      who have successfully completed the Firearms Instructor Training Program and Law
      Enforcement Instructor Training Program to perform lead instructor, tower operator,
      assistant instructor, and firing line official duties for Air Force qualification training of
      AFOSI students/agents at the USAFSIA on the AFOSI issue handgun, M-16 series
      rifle/carbine, and the AFOSI issue shotgun. FLETC firearms instructors must
      successfully complete the live-fire qualification course before conducting training and
      annually thereafter. These personnel must be trained and evaluated by a task certified
      Combat Arms instructor whenever possible.
          5.24.4.1.1. FLETC firearms instructors must follow the guidance in this instruction
          as well as the guidance in the appropriate chapter of AFMAN 36-2227, Volume 1
          and/or AFOSIMAN 71-113 (for the AFOSI PPC) while conducting Air Force
          qualification training. FLETC firearms instructors will use Air Force approved lesson
          plans for this training.
          5.24.4.1.2. FLETC firearms instructors that meet the requirements outlined in
          paragraph 5.24.4.1. may certify AFSC 7S0X1 personnel to perform assistant
          instructor and/or firing line official duties at the USAFSIA following the guidance in
          paragraph 5.3. and subparagraphs.
      5.24.4.2. If Air Force Combat Arms weapon maintenance support is unavailable (lack of
      assigned Combat Arms personnel or not reasonably available at a nearby Air Force
      installation), USAFSIA/CC may approve use of the FLETC Gunsmith Shop to inspect
      and repair student/agent Air Force weapons. Weapons will be inspected/repaired IAW
      chapter 6 of this instruction and the applicable AFTO for the weapon. When FLETC
      gunsmiths perform inspections or maintenance, they will provide a copy of the inspection
      report and/or repair documents to the office designated by USAFSIA/CC for entry into
      SFMIS. All inspections and repairs of Air Force weapons must be entered into SFMIS
      on the weapon AFTO Form 105.
5.25. General Deviations:
   5.25.1. Personnel who live-fire qualify on one type of shotgun may carry another shotgun
   type once they have successfully completed mechanical training and performance evaluations
   conducted by Combat Arms. Combat Arms will document mechanical training as a separate
   qualification in SFMIS or on the individual’s AF Form 522. Qualification expires on the
   weapon AFQC expiration date.
   5.25.2. Personnel live-fire qualified on the GAU, GUU-5P, or M4 carbine may carry the
   M16A2 once they complete mechanical training and performance evaluations on the M16A2.
   Individuals qualified on the M16A2 may not arm with the GAU, GUU, or M4 carbine
   without live-fire qualification. Qualification will consist of academic training on the
   differences between the weapons, live-fire zero and the M68 orders/phases of the
   qualification course only. Document this training as a separate qualification on the
   individual’s AF Form 522 and align the expiration date with the dates of the weapon actually
   fired for qualification.
   5.25.3. The Combat Arms organizational commander may approve temporary use of
   qualified Group A personnel to help the Combat Arms section when there is not enough
   Combat Arms (3P0XlB, SEI 312, DoD civilian equivalent) manpower at the installation to
70                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     meet the workload. These personnel may serve as assistant instructors or firing line officials
     only as outlined in paragraphs 4.3.1. and 4.3.2.
5.26. Installation-Level Deviations:
     5.26.1. Firearm qualification extensions authorized IAW AFI 31-207.
     5.26.2. Temporary facility criteria deviations. When the installation is unable to construct or
     maintain ranges according to specified criteria, installation commanders may approve a
     temporary deviation not to exceed 12 months. The Combat Arms NCOIC, in coordination
     with civil engineers, base ground safety, and, if necessary, bioenvironmental engineering
     develops the request and forward it through the security forces commander to the installation
     commander. Ensure the MAJCOM Combat Arms functional manager receives a courtesy
     copy of the temporary deviation. If the deviation cannot be resolved within 12 months,
     forward deviation request, through installation channels, to MAJCOM Combat Arms
     functional manager.
5.27. MAJCOM Deviations: MAJCOMs can:
     5.27.1. Approve qualification extensions IAW AFI 31-207.
     5.27.2. MAJCOM/A7S may waive night fire familiarization/qualification training if the
     night fire course of fire cannot be fired as intended due to range limitations, mandatory quiet
     hours, etc.
     5.27.3. Modify specialized courses of fire if warranted by local installation capabilities and
     mission requirements. HQ AFSFC/SFXW approves all deviations to all courses of fire
     contained in AFMAN 36-2227, Volumes 1 and 2. HQ AFOSI/XRJ has approval authority
     for deviations to the AFOSI specialized weapons courses.
     5.27.4. Together, MAJCOM security forces, civil engineer, and safety submit Combat Arms
     facility waivers to HQ AFSFC/SFXW if local installation deviations cannot be resolved
     within 12 months or a permanent deviation is necessary. Base level Security Forces units
     must coordinate requests through safety, civil engineers, and other base agencies responsible
     for facility criteria. Provide a coordinated copy of the waiver request to HQ AFSFC/SFXW
     for approval consideration and coordination with HQ AFCESA.

                                            Chapter 6

                                 WEAPONS MAINTENANCE

6.1. Purpose and Program Overview: This chapter provides guidance on the installation’s
ground weapons inspection and maintenance program. Base Combat Arms personnel are
responsible for the inspection and maintenance of all military ground weapons assigned to the
installation and those required by an approved support agreement. Conduct weapon inspections
and repairs as outlined in applicable Air Force Technical Orders (TO), Time Compliance
Technical Orders (TCTO), Technical Manuals (TM), and applicable safety messages.
6.1. (ACC) Purpose and Program Overview:Combat Arms instructors will not inspect or
repair privately owned weapons.
   6.1.1. Air Force ground weapons are to be repaired by tasked-certified Combat Arms
   personnel only. Personnel assigned to the Air Force Gunsmith Shop may perform weapon
   maintenance (to depot-level) and test fire ground weapons with proper training and
   certification. Air Force units/personnel are not authorized to contract or hire civilian
   gunsmiths or other non-Combat Arms personnel to repair, inspect, or modify Air Force
   weapons. Modification of any kind to Air Force weapons is not authorized without approval
   from the Small Arms Program Office, WR-ALC and HQ AFSFC/SFXW. When assigned to
   other U.S. military installations, units are to receive support from the servicing Air Force
   installation Combat Arms. If the servicing Air Force installation’s Combat Arms support is
   unavailable, the MAJCOM/A7S may approve use of other Service qualified (Combat Arms
   equivalent) personnel to inspect and repair Air Force weapons, after coordination with HQ
   AFSFC/SFXW. The Small Arms Program Office, WR-ALC, may approve or establish
   repair of Air Force weapons through contracts when requested by the unit. When other
   agencies perform inspections, maintenance, or modifications, the owning unit of the weapons
   will provide a copy of the inspection report and/or repair documents to the host Combat
   Arms section. The host Combat Arms section will enter the action performed on each
   weapon into SFMIS.
   6.1.2. On a case-by-case basis, non-Air Force military and commercial ammunition may be
   approved and procured through the Air Force ammunition control point at the 784 CBSG Hill
   AFB UT (OO-ALC). Air Force TOs specify the Additional Authorization List (AAL) items
   and authorized munitions for each type of firearm. The Allowance Standard Code (ASC)
   538 identifies additional equipment items approved through depot for use with Air Force
   firearms. Units requesting non-standard commercially purchased items (commercial parts,
   services, accessories [grips, slings, lights, etc], ammunition) not specifically identified for use
   in applicable TOs will follow the guidance in the next paragraphs, as well as additional
   guidance established by the Air Force logistics support community.
   6.1.3. Air Force Small Arms and Associated Equipment Requirements, Procurement,
   Modification and Improvement Process: A solid need coupled with senior leadership
   involvement is essential when establishing a requirement, acquiring a new weapon
   system/accessory or identifying a needed modification or improvement. Needs or capability
   gaps should be identified by the MAJCOMs and pushed forward to the appropriate Air Staff
   functional agency so a coherent picture is presented when working acquisition strategies.
72                                         AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     6.1.3.1. If there is a need, requirement, capability gap or new mission, which cannot be
     supported by current types, amounts and capabilities of Air Force small arms, associated
     equipment or munitions, unit commanders will identify the need to their respective
     MAJCOM functional manager. Use of MAJCOM functional area management will
     allow all needs to be checked and authenticated, while also allowing all doctrine, tactics,
     techniques, procedures, training and guidance to be screened for possible solutions before
     equipment, modifications or accessories are funded and procured.
     6.1.3.2. The MAJCOM evaluates the shortfall and/or validates the need to determine if a
     change in tactics, doctrine, or training would be appropriate to resolve the deficiency. If
     changes in tactics, doctrine, and training cannot satisfy user needs, a new weapon or
     improvement to an existing system may be required.
     6.1.3.3. The MAJCOM will develop an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) or a
     Capabilities Development Document (CDD). The MAJCOM will forward proposals to
     HQ AFSFC/CC or more directly to HQ AFSFC/SFXW for advance staffing, coordination
     and forwarding to appropriate agencies.
     6.1.3.4. HQ AFSFC/SFXW will forward the capabilities document to the appropriate Air
     Staff functional agency with a recommendation for use of existing Air Force or DoD
     weapons/ accessories that will satisfy the need or non-developmental item
     (NDI)/commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions if they are known and available from
     industry. HQ AFSFC/SFXW will also coordinate with the JSSAST to determine if other
     services have potential solutions.
     6.1.3.5. The evaluation process will include coordination with the Small Arms Program
     Office, WR-ALC. Authorization for existing systems may follow, if the Air Staff
     functional agency validates the mission need and solutions are available in the inventory.
     Acquisition of new items will follow established procedures for procurement.
     6.1.3.6. The Air Force Weapons Configuration Board (AFWCB) will manage this
     process, provide oversight, and act as the Executive Council for HQ USAF/A7S. HQ
     AFSFC/SFXW chairs the board and the board includes an Air Staff representative from
     every functional area that has a requirement for small arms as core members. Shell
     members will include personnel from the Air Logistics Centers (Warner Robins and
     Ogden), IL, LG, Air Force Nonnuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB), MAJCOM
     small arms representatives, and other agencies relevant to the Air Force small arms
     program and logistical support tail. This cross-functional board and its supporting
     members will streamline acquisition, fielding, and support of all small arms, associated
     equipment, and munitions. The board will also ensure commonality and supportability
     (training and maintenance) of all Air Force small arms and accessories. (HQ
     AFSFC/SFXW will publish details and supporting guidance on the process in a future
     directive and update this document as appropriate.)
     6.1.3.6. (ACC) ACC units will not purchase/acquire weapons parts or accessories unless
     approved by the Air Force Weapons Configuration Board. Only Combat Arms and other
     authorized agencies will purchase approved weapons parts or accessories.
        6.1.3.6.1. Acquisition process:
            6.1.3.6.1.1. Lower echelons (unit, group, wing) – identify need
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        73


              6.1.3.6.1.2. MAJCOM – validate need/capabilities gap

          procurement dollars and program support dollars and Air Staff representative for
          program management and oversight.
          6.1.3.7.2. HQ USAF/A7S staff and HQ AFSFC/SFXW, Combat Weapons
          Superintendent; provides user input/support and requirements solutions to activities
          related to the development, systems integration, test, evaluation, and fielding of Air
          Force small arms and related requirements such as fire-control, optics, modifications,
          associated equipment, accessories, munitions and critical maintenance tools/gauges.
          Works closely with Air Logistics Centers, battlelabs or other entities, as required.
          Represents the Air Force at Joint Services Small Arms Program and works with US
          Army Program Executive Officer offices. Monitors research, development and
          testing to incorporate Air Force requirements.
          6.1.3.7.3. The Small Arms Program Office, WR-ALC; provides overall life cycle
          logistic management of Air Force small arms and takes funding direction from HQ
          USAF/A7SX (PEM). Responsible for acquisition and sustainment of all USAF
          handguns, rifles, carbines, shotguns, machineguns, grenade launchers, ceremonial
          weapons and mortars. Supports warfighters’ needs based on funding, direction, and
          valid requirements. Works closely with HQ USAF/A7S and HQ AFSFC/SFXW.
          6.1.3.7.4. HQ USAF/A4RE, Vehicle, Equipment and Fuels Management, is
          responsible for procedures, policies and documents for the management of
          equipment, to include the accountability of small arms, under USAF integrated
          logistics systems.
NOTE: This does not apply to tools and fixtures used for weapon repairs by Combat Arms.
Once approved, all non-standard commercially purchased items must be installed and inspected
by Combat Arms personnel regardless of owning organization. Commercial munitions must
have Air Force NNMSB approval and will be sought by HQ AFSFC/SFXR. Weapons are to be
procured through approved Air Force logistics channels only. Organizations are not authorized
to use government credit cards to purchase firearms or ammunition.

6.2. Ground Weapon Categories and Storage Definitions:
     6.2.1. Service Weapons. Any hand, shoulder, or crew-served weapon generally issued to
     troops in the field. Crew-served weapons are any ground weapon designed to fire a projectile
     and normally require more than one person to properly operate. In the Air Force, crew-
     served weapons include the M60, M240, M2 and MK19 machine guns. Combat Arms
     personnel must obtain a complete listing of all ground weapons assigned to their installation
     from base supply (para 6.6.). This listing includes types and quantities of firearms, owning
     organizations (account codes), and points of contact.
     6.2.2. Match Grade Weapons. Any hand or shoulder weapon designed, modified, or
     manufactured for use in competitive shooting.
     6.2.3. Ceremonial Weapons. Military service and non-service model weapons used for drill
     team and honor guard purposes. These weapons may or may not be inert (design altered to
     prevent live-fire use) depending on the need to fire blank ammunition.
     6.2.4. Storage Definitions:
        6.2.4.1. In-Use: Any weapons not stored and packaged according to applicable Special
        Packaging Instructions (SPI) as outlined on https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/sindex.cfm are
        considered in-use and fall under one of two sub-categories. Regardless of the sub-
        category, they are still classified as in-use weapons.
            6.2.4.1.1. Active: An active weapon is a weapon issued for duty within a period of
            90 days. The weapon may or may not be assigned to an individual.
            6.2.4.1.2. Inactive: An inactive weapon is a weapon that has been stored for a period
            of 90 days without use. The weapon may or may not have been assigned to an
            individual.
        6.2.4.2. Extended Storage/Preferred Packaging: Only weapons stored and packaged
        according to applicable SPI as outlined on https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/sindex.cfm fall
        into this category. All others are considered In-Use. Weapons removed from special
        packaging become in-use until they are properly returned to storage following the
        applicable SPI.
6.3. Levels of Firearms Maintenance:
     6.3.1. Depot Maintenance. Maintenance on weapons beyond base level Combat Arms
     capabilities (may include complete rebuilding of parts, assemblies, and end items). This
     could include parts manufacture, parts and weapon modifications and testing, and parts and
     weapon reclamation. Usually, depot maintenance is done in support of the Air Force supply
     system. HQ USAF/A4R has depot maintenance policy responsibility. Air Force Materiel
     Command (AFMC) and WR-ALC are supporting agencies. Depot-level maintenance on Air
     Force weapons is usually done by other Services through contracts from WR-ALC. The Air
     Force Gunsmith Shop at Lackland AFB, Texas, has limited depot maintenance capability.
     6.3.2. Field Maintenance (Organizational, Direct Support, and General Support).
     Inspections and maintenance authorized for and accomplished by Combat Arms personnel in
     direct support of using organizations. This includes all inspection and maintenance of
     ground weapons assigned to the installation and governed by support agreements. This
     maintenance is limited to the repair of end items or unserviceable assemblies in support of
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        75


  using organization. Combat Arms personnel must ensure all weapons parts are properly
  secured when not in use. These inspections and maintenance procedures are a detailed and
  time intensive process requiring special training and equipment to adequately and properly
  perform. Owners of unique weapons systems are responsible for providing funding to
  procure required gauges/tools/parts through supply or depot channels for
  inspection/repair/replacement by Combat Arms.          Combat Arms will ensure PMEL
  inspections are performed on gauges procured for these weapons. Weapon parts for unique
  weapons not used for base or personal defense should not be stocked. Owning units will
  provide funds as needed to purchase replacement parts. Installation Combat Arms sections
  are authorized to perform the following maintenance:
  6.3.2. (ACC) Weapons systems are considered unique when they are not normally used by
  other units on the installation. An example would be when only one unit has M107 long
  range sniper rifles assigned. Units possessing unique weapons systems are responsible for
  providing funding to procure three sets of required gauges, one set of required tools and all
  required parts, per technical order (T.O.), through supply or depot channels for
  inspection/repair/replacement by CA.
     6.3.2.1. Service Weapons (non-match grade). Inspect and repair within applicable limits
     of the TO pertaining to the weapon. Combat Arms are authorized to stock weapon spare
     parts for maintenance levels below depot. Every Combat Arms member is responsible
     for practicing supply discipline. Use historical data, maintenance records, and anticipated
     mission needs to assist in determining stock levels of weapon replacement parts. Keep in
     stock at least one of any item when a known requirement exists. This includes parts
     requiring infrequent replacement. Use the total number of "in use" and packaged
     weapons, where maintenance support is provided, to establish a spare parts inventory.
     6.3.2.2. Match Grade Weapons. Inspections, to include gauging, must be performed
     IAW applicable TOs by Combat Arms personnel. For inspection and repair/replacement
     of specialized or fitted parts outside the scope of normal Combat Arms sections, owning
     units are to refer these items to depot or the Air Force Gunsmith Shop for support. Those
     Air Force shooting team members with weapons needing specialized inspection/repair
     must coordinate with HQ AFSVA/SVPAF, 10100 Reunion Place Ste 402, San Antonio
     TX 78216-4138, DSN 487-5470, for shipment of weapons. The mailing address of the
     Gunsmith Shop is 1520 Service Road, Suite 1, Lackland AFB TX 78236-5722. All other
     requests for match grade specialized inspection/repair must go through Small Arms
     Program Office, WR-ALC.
     6.3.2.3. Ceremonial Weapons. Inspections, to include gauging, must be performed IAW
     applicable TOs by Combat Arms personnel on all ceremonial weapons capable of firing a
     live or blank ammunition cartridge. Additional support is limited to those inspections to
     ensure units are conducting proper operator maintenance, and replacement of broken or
     worn parts preventing the proper operation of the weapon, or posing a safety hazard.
     Replacement parts for some of these non-service model weapons (e.g., M1 Garands, 1903
     Springfields) are not always available through routine military supply channels. The
     owner/user is responsible for coordinating maintenance outside the scope of local
     Combat Arms sections with Small Arms Program Office, WR-ALC.
76                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        6.3.2.4. EOD Weapons. Inspections, to include gauging, must be performed IAW
        applicable TOs by Combat Arms personnel on all EOD weapons. Additional support is
        limited to those inspections to ensure units are conducting proper operator maintenance,
        and replacement of broken or worn parts preventing the proper operation of the weapon,
        or posing a safety hazard. EOD is responsible for coordinating maintenance outside the
        scope of local Combat Arms sections with Small Arms Program Office, WR-ALC.
     6.3.3. Operator Maintenance (Individual). This is weapons maintenance performed by
     individuals and/or assigned unit. This maintenance is limited to authorized disassembly,
     assembly, cleaning, lubricating, preserving, tightening some screws, adjusting sights,
     replacing slings, spare barrel bags, etc., and performing preventive maintenance checks
     according to applicable TOs. Using organizations will not order or bench stock weapon
     parts, as this is outside the scope of operator maintenance. NOTE: Using organizations will
     not procure commercial weapons parts, accessories (grips, slings, holsters, lights, etc.). The
     base Combat Arms section is the focal point for all authorized weapon parts procurement and
     replacement. Using organization can transfer funds to the Combat Arms account so Combat
     Arms can control ordering of replacement parts for service weapons. TO references to
     "Organizational Maintenance" refer to Army maintenance levels. In the Air Force, Combat
     Arms personnel perform this level of maintenance.
     6.3.4. Weapons Cleaning. Each unit possessing firearms is responsible for their own
     weapon preventive maintenance (PM) cleaning and lubrication program (to include
     magazines, spare barrel kits, tripods, etc.) IAW weapon TOs for both in-use and extended
     storage weapons. Combat Arms will advise custodians on cleaning frequency if local
     conditions warrant more frequent cleaning. Combat Arms sections will develop a weapon
     custodian handbook listing the needed cleaning items and general information needed in
     support of service weapons. This handbook must also outline weapon custodian
     responsibilities and procedures in regard to Combat Arms related requirements.
        6.3.4.1. Units are responsible for developing a standardized method of documenting their
        required cleaning. Units may use an Air Force general purpose form for documenting
        this cleaning. The AFTO Form 105 will not be used to document this cleaning. Combat
        Arms training weapons are exempt from this requirement.
        6.3.4.2. Combat Arms will review unit weapon preventive maintenance
        (cleaning/operator inspection) documentation during weapon inspections and annotate
        findings on the weapon inspection report.
        6.3.4.3. IAW each weapon Operator’s Manual, owning units are responsible for ensuring
        proper cleaning equipment/materials are available for each assigned weapon to include
        those in extended storage.
6.4. Procedures for Maintenance of Unserviceable Weapons: Owning agencies will take
weapons needing repair and AFTO Form 105 (SFMIS AFTO 105 will replace this need) to the
base Combat Arms section. Combat Arms personnel will inspect the weapon and determine if
they can repair it or if depot repair is needed. If Combat Arms is to retain the weapon for repair,
place a Department of Defense (DD) Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Repairable) Tag, on the
weapon, until all repairs are made, and issue a receipt to the owning agency. Notify the owning
agency when the weapon is repaired. If Combat Arms does not retain the weapon for repairs at
the time of inspection, ensure coordination with the owning unit to complete repairs is made.
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            77


Combat Arms will place a completed DD Form 1577-2 on weapons needing depot maintenance
and return them to the owning organization for turn-in to base supply. Maintain a permanent
weapons maintenance log of all maintenance performed on weapons. This log must be
maintained in the weapons maintenance shop to provide a historical record of parts used,
maintenance performed, etc. Record the maintenance action on the weapons AFTO Form 105
(SFMIS AFTO 105 will replace this need) IAW TO 11W-1-10, Recording of Historical Data for
Ground Weapons. Combat Arms will annotate the existing paper (hard-copy) AFTO Form 105
indicating that all future inspections and maintenance will be listed in SFMIS. Process
unserviceable parts/scrap material for turn-in IAW local supply or DRMO procedures. If DRMO
or local supply are unable to receive unserviceable parts/scrap, Combat Arms will coordinate
demilitarization or disposal of unserviceable weapons parts according to DOD Directive
4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual. Where conflicts occur between TOs for the
same weapon, follow the more stringent/detailed guidance.
   6.4.1. Weapons requiring depot maintenance must be shipped to depot as complete end
   items, to include all accessories (i.e., magazines, slings, spare barrel, spare barrel cases, and
   AFTO Form(s) 105). Do not ship weapons cannibalized, stripped of parts, or those
   containing unserviceable parts back to depot when they are repairable/replaceable by Combat
   Arms, unless specifically authorized by Small Arms Program Office, WR-ALC.
   6.4.2. Limited parts cannibalization may be accomplished by Combat Arms personnel for
   the sole purpose of reducing the total number of unserviceable weapons assigned to a unit.
   This procedure is limited to weapons assigned within the same unit. An example of proper
   use of this procedure is when there are four weapons with four different broken parts such as
   a missing sling, cracked hand guard, pistol grip, and stock. Placing all of these broken parts
   on one weapon would result in only one weapon being tagged for repairs versus four. When
   the weapon is repaired, all new parts will be installed and annotated appropriately.
   CAUTION: Do not exchange any parts expressly forbidden in the TO or other guidance.
6.5. Weapon Modifications: For logistic support, small arm weapon systems are categorized
and defined as support equipment items. As such, the modification of small arm weapon
systems is addressed in AFI 10-601, Capabilities-Based Requirements Development. In
accordance with AFI 10-601, a modification is defined as an alteration to a configuration item
(CI) that, as a minimum, changes the form, fit, function, or interface of the item. All
modifications to small arms weapon systems, whether permanent or temporary, must be
approved by the Small Arms Program Office, WR-ALC.
   6.5.1. Permanent modifications are managed as acquisition programs and therefore must
   satisfy approved requirements and cannot be accomplished without higher headquarters
   guidance. This guidance normally comes in the form of an approved Time Compliance
   Technical Order (TCTO) from the Small Arms Program Office. Permanent modifications
   usually result in an NSN change. The installation of the M16A2 modification kit is an
   example of a permanent modification.
   6.5.2. Temporary modifications change the configuration of a system for test purposes or to
   support the accomplishment of a specific mission. Temporary modifications use existing
   Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Non Developmental Items (NDI) or stock listed
   systems, equipment, spares, materials, etc., to accomplish the modification and are typically
78                                            AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     accomplished locally, by a unit, with the appropriate funds. There are two subsets of
     temporary modifications.
        6.5.2.1. T-1 temporary modifications temporarily change the configuration of the item to
        perform a special mission, add, or remove equipment to provide increased capability for a
        special mission. T-1 modifications are normally made by the using command for
        operational reasons, are not used as substitutes for permanent modifications, and are not
        authorized permanent logistics support (technical data, software changes, engineering
        support, spares, or support equipment, etc.). Logistics support will be constrained to the
        level of effort required for the temporary modification program. T-1 modifications will
        not be maintained on the system for more than one year without a waiver from the Small
        Arms Program Office. The configured item must be capable of being returned to its
        original configuration within 48 hours. T-1 modifications are normally funded with 3400
        monies (Operations & Maintenance). The installation of non-standard optics, sighting
        systems and lights are an example of T-1 modifications to a small arm weapon system.
        6.5.2.2. T-2 temporary modifications are required to support research, development, test,
        and evaluation (RDT&E). T-2 modifications will normally be accomplished on programs
        having an approved Program Management Directive (PMD). T-2 modification to small
        arms weapon systems are normally accomplished at the direction of the Small Arms
        Program Office and not accomplished at the unit-level. T-2 modifications are normally
        funded with 3600 monies (RDT&E) and systems will be returned to their original
        configuration upon completion of the test.
6.6. Inspection of Weapons: Use the guidance in the following paragraphs when specific
guidance is not provided in the TOs or as stringent. Weapons inspections are performed to
determine weapon serviceability, safety, discover conditions causing (or could cause) failures,
and to determine if required preventive maintenance checks are being performed. Additionally,
Combat Arms will verify the serial numbers of all inspected weapons against the unit’s
Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) during all types of inspections and
report any discrepancies to the base supply Equipment Management Section (EMS). Qualified
Combat Arms personnel will inspect military weapons assigned to all organizations. Annually,
Combat Arms personnel are to contact the base supply EMS to validate the weapon types,
quantities, and accounts assigned to the installation.         This may also include local
school/university ROTC programs with drill weapons. Occasionally, new weapons are received
and accounts are established without custodians notifying the servicing Combat Arms section.
This same validation process must be applied to units who are supported IAW an approved host
tenant support agreement and do not have their own assigned Combat Arms personnel. The
Combat Arms section is responsible for obtaining sufficient levels of tools and gauges needed to
accomplish inspections on service weapons. Additionally, they must ensure gauges are
processed for calibration through the servicing PMEL at intervals established in TO 33K-1-100-
2, Technical Manual, TMDE Calibration Interval Technical Order and Work Unit Code
Reference Guide. Where conflicts occur between TOs for the same weapon, follow the more
stringent/detailed guidance.
     6.6.1. Organizations and individuals possessing weapons are responsible for:
        6.6.1.1. Coordinating inspections with all applicable agencies (Combat Arms, Traffic
        Management Office, Packing and Crating, Supply, and Resource Protection).
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                          79


     6.6.1.2. Preparing the weapons for inspection, initiating, and maintaining AFTO Form
     105 for all weapons and DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag, for extended storage weapons.
     Do not place DD Form 1574 on in-use weapons. Entering weapon maintenance and
     inspection information in SFMIS eliminates the need for a paper AFTO Form 105.
     6.6.1.2. (ACC) T.O. 11W-1-10, Historical Data Recording of Inspection, Maintenance,
     and Firing Data for Ground Weapons, Chapter 1, Paragraphs 3.a. and 3.b., requires units
     possessing weapons to initiate and maintain Air Force Technical Order Forms 105. To
     meet T.O. 11W-1-10 requirements, once the SFMIS System Security Access Agreement
     is changed in the next system upgrade (6.1), units possessing ground weapons will be
     required to load all their weapons information (i.e. serial numbers, caliber, type,
     manufacture, storage location…) into SFMIS. Combat Arms will ensure accuracy of the
     information loaded into SFMIS during weapons inspections. Owning units will correct
     all discrepancies.
     6.6.1.3. Ensuring all weapons are cleaned and ready for inspection, to include the
     mechanical zeroing of extended storage weapons IAW applicable TOs.
     6.6.1.4. (Added-ACC) Custodians will notify Combat Arms when weapons return from
     deployments.
  6.6.2. Pre-Issue Inspection. Base supply or the organization receiving weapons from depot
  or another installation must notify the Combat Arms section within 10 days (ANG/AFRC
  within 30 days) to schedule a weapons inspection. Combat Arms personnel must inspect
  weapons within 30 days (ANG/AFRC within 60 days) of notification. All weapons must be
  inspected prior to being placed into operational service or extended storage. This inspection
  consists of disassembly, gauging, proper assembly, and function check. If required, Combat
  Arms personnel will assist owning organizations in completing the SF 368, Product Quality
  Deficiency Report, as outlined in TO 00-35D-54, USAF Material Deficiency Reporting and
  Investigating System. Combat Arms personnel will enter ―Pre-issue Inspection/Gauged‖ on
  the weapon’s AFTO Form 105 (Entering weapon in SFMIS eliminates the need for paper
  AFTO 105). Combat Arms will annotate the existing paper (hard-copy) AFTO Form 105
  indicating that all future inspections and maintenance will be listed in SFMIS.
  6.6.3. Inspection of In-Use Weapons. In-use weapons are those not in extended storage
  packaging IAW Specialized Packing Instructions (SPI). As a minimum, Combat Arms
  personnel will perform this inspection on active in-use (used for operational purposes)
  weapons semi-annually (every six months) and on inactive in-use weapons annually (every
  12 months). Combat Arms will inspect active in-use weapons not used for operational
  purposes and used exclusively for training (except for Combat Arms training weapons)
  annually (every 12 months). All in-use weapons inspected will have a complete
  serviceability inspection to include cleanliness, lubrication, authorized parts/accessories, and
  complete function check. Weapons found to have been painted or coated with a substance
  other than that authorized in the applicable TO should be removed from service immediately.
  At least 25 percent of the weapons are to receive full gauging IAW maintenance TOs. The
  MAJCOM/A7S may increase this percentage. However, under no circumstances will this
  percentage be reduced to less than 25 percent. This inspection may be accomplished at the
  time the weapons are used for firearms training or staggered throughout the year to meet
  requirements. At the time of inspection, Combat Arms will ensure all quadrant sights,
80                                           AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     magazines, spare barrels, tripods, traversing and elevating mechanisms, and other
     subassemblies of crew-served weapons are inspected for serviceability. A statement will be
     added to the inspection report describing the quantity and type of items inspected, the
     condition they were found in, and whether corrective actions are needed or were taken. All
     items with a serial number will be reflected in the report to assist in accountability and
     tracking of corrective actions. Weapons not available for the inspection (temporary duty
     [TDY], issued, etc.) must be inspected within 15 duty days upon return from TDY or issue
     status. Combat Arms personnel will enter ―Semi-Annual Inspection‖ or ―Annual Inspection‖
     (for inactive in-use weapons) on the weapon’s AFTO Form 105 (SFMIS AFTO 105 will be
     used) and ―Semi-Annual Inspection/Gauged‖ or ―Annual Inspection/Gauged‖ (for inactive
     in-use weapons) on those receiving full gauging. Pre-deployment inspections and/or post-
     deployment inspections satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.
     6.6.4. Inspection of Combat Arms Training Weapons. All rifles and pistols assigned to the
     Combat Arms section must receive full gauging IAW maintenance TOs semi-annually (ANG
     and AFRC units will inspect Combat Arms rifles and pistols annually). This inspection may
     be accomplished at the time the weapons are used for firearms training or staggered
     throughout the year to meet requirements. At the time of inspection, ensure all quadrant
     sights, magazines, spare barrels, tripods, traversing and elevating mechanisms, and other
     subassemblies of crew-served weapons are inspected for serviceability. MAJCOMS may
     change this requirement to a percentage less than 100 percent, for USAFA, Regional
     Training Centers, and AETC bases conducting BMT/Technical Training, as appropriate.
     However, under no circumstances will this percentage be reduced to less than 20 percent.
     Combat Arms personnel will enter ―Semi-annual Inspection/Gauged‖ on the weapon’s AFTO
     Form 105 (SFMIS AFTO 105 will be used). Combat Arms will annotate the existing paper
     (hard-copy) AFTO Form 105 indicating that all future inspections and maintenance will be
     listed in SFMIS.
     6.6.4. (ACC) All active in-use training weapons assigned to the Combat Arms section will
     be inspected and gauged semi-annually. All inactive in-use weapons will be inspected and
     gauged annually.
     6.6.5. Inspection of Weapons in Extended Storage/Preferred Packaging. Units must not
     remove weapons from extended storage for use during exercises unless absolutely necessary
     and authorized by the installation commander. Inspection of these weapons takes a joint
     effort from the organization or unit possessing the weapons, Traffic Management Branch
     (Preservation, Packing, and Packaging), Base Supply, and Combat Arms. Combat Arms
     personnel will perform a complete serviceability inspection immediately before units return
     the weapons to extended storage, IAW special packaging instructions (SPI). Weapons must
     be properly packaged/sealed within 30 days of this inspection or re-inspection is required.
     Combat Arms will also conduct this inspection on all weapons removed from packaging.
     Pre-deployment inspections and/or post-deployment inspections satisfy the requirements of
     this paragraph. Obtain SPI’s for weapon system at https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/sindex.cfm;
     enter NSN for weapon in ―Quick Search.‖
        6.6.5.1. Annually (every 12 months), Combat Arms must inspect 20 percent of each type
        of weapon an organization has in extended storage/preferred packaging. Combat Arms
        will coordinate these inspections with base supply to ensure serialized inventories of
        inspected weapons are completed simultaneously and to prevent unnecessary removal of
AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                         81


     weapons from packaging to conduct inventories at another time. To ease the scheduling
     process, Combat Arms may schedule this inspection within 45 days (plus or minus) of the
     annual due date. Give the weapons a complete serviceability inspection (to include
     gauging), paying particular attention to corrosion protection of each weapon inspected.
     Personnel handling weapons must wear lint-free, clean gloves to prevent perspiration
     from rusting metal surfaces. If weapons are containerized and not individually packaged,
     inspect and gauge all the weapons in the opened container.
     6.6.5.2. If any unsatisfactory condition is found (preventing proper operation of the
     weapon, failed gauging, barrel erosion, or rusting) with any weapon type, inspect an
     additional five percent of the same type. If any unsatisfactory condition is found
     (preventing the proper operation of the weapon, failed barrel erosion, or rusting) with
     these weapons, complete a 50 percent inspection of the type weapon owned by the
     organization. If any unsatisfactory condition is found (preventing the proper operation of
     the weapon, failed gauging, barrel erosion, or rusting) after the 50 percent inspection,
     complete a 100 percent inspection of the type weapon owned by the organization.
     Combat Arms personnel, or other personnel assisting in the paperwork portion of the
     inspection, will enter ―Extended Storage Inspection/Gauged‖ as necessary on the
     weapon’s AFTO Form 105 in SFMIS. Combat Arms will annotate the existing paper
     (hard-copy) AFTO Form 105 indicating that all future inspections and maintenance will
     be listed in SFMIS. Only Combat Arms or Gunsmith personnel may initial the AFTO
     Form 105 indicating an inspection has been completed. Organizations owning the
     weapons may schedule this inspection with Combat Arms in conjunction with base
     supply serialized inventories to avoid additional inspections prior to repackaging of
     weapons opened during inventory.
     6.6.5.3. Combat Arms will ensure weapons previously inspected are not inspected again
     until the entire quantity of weapons of the same type have been inspected. Inspectors will
     plainly mark on each container and bag (if applicable) the date and initials of the person
     conducting the inspection. These marks provide a visible indicator of weapons inspected.
  6.6.6. Pre-embarkation Inspections. Due to the time required to conduct these in-depth and
  detailed inspections, units alerted for deployment must contact Combat Arms as soon as
  possible to schedule/ conduct this inspection. This requirement must be included in the
  Installation Deployment Plan. The security forces commander may work with the
  installation deployment officer to establish a centralized location for this inspection. Combat
  Arms must ensure all weapons and associated equipment being deployed meet the applicable
  TO requirements. Combat Arms personnel will enter ―Pre-embarkation Inspection/Gauged‖
  on the weapon’s AFTO Forms 105. Ensure the unit sends the SFMIS AFTO Form 105 with
  the weapons.
  6.6.7. Post Deployment Inspections. Combat Arms personnel will perform a complete
  serviceability inspection on in-use weapons returning from deployments exceeding 30 days
  and any weapon removed from extended storage, regardless of deployment length. Perform
  a complete serviceability inspection including gauging on 100 percent of all weapons IAW
  maintenance TOs. Weapons found to have been painted or coated with a substance other
  than that authorized in the applicable TO should be removed from service immediately.
  Accomplish this inspection within 60 days of return date on in-use weapons and within 120
  days on weapons being returned to extended storage. Combat Arms personnel will enter
82                                             AFI36-2226_ACCSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     ―Post Deployment Inspection/Gauged‖ on the SFMIS weapon’s AFTO Form 105 and enter
     any maintenance accomplished while deployed if not previously entered.
     6.6.8. Turn-In Inspection. Combat Arms will perform a complete serviceability inspection
     to include full gauging on all weapons and accessories being turned in. Only approved stock-
     listed items for the weapon are authorized for turn in. Non-standard items such as after-
     market slings, sights, grips, camouflage paint, or other items will be removed and replaced (if
     applicable) with stock-listed items. Combat Arms will ensure repair of the weapon (within
     their authorization) if parts are unserviceable. Combat Arms personnel will enter ―Turn-in
     Inspection/Gauged‖ on the weapon’s AFTO Form 105. Combat Arms will notify the unit of
     damaged or missing accessories required for complete end item turn-in. The owning unit is
     responsible for replacing these accessories prior to turn-in, ensuring a DD Form 1574 is
     attached to the weapon, and shipping the AFTO Form 105 with the weapon.
     6.6.9. Inspection Reports. Refer to paragraph 2.2.13 for weapon inspection report
     requirements and procedures.
6.7. Packaging Weapons: Packaging weapons for shipment or storage takes a joint effort from
the organization or unit possessing the weapons, Traffic Management Branch (Preservation,
Packing, and Packaging), Base Supply, and Combat Arms. Before packaging weapons, Combat
Arms personnel must inspect the weapon and complete the DD 1574 or DD 1577-2 (if required).
A completed SFMIS generated AFTO Form 105 must accompany the weapon in shipment
through supply channels. Weapons will be prepared and packed for shipment or storage
according to applicable SPI or TO. The owning organization is responsible for packaging and/or
sealing weapons scheduled for shipment or storage. For example, M16 rifles will be packed for
storage or shipment according to SPI 00-856-6885, Special Packaging Instruction, M16 Rifle or
M9 Pistols use SPI 00-317-2468. Organizations may obtain SPI’s for weapon systems at
https://spires.wpafb.af.mil/sindex.cfm; enter NSN for weapon in ―Quick Search.‖
6.8. Support Agreements (Weapons Maintenance Support): The host Combat Arms section
will provide all weapons maintenance support, mandated in this chapter, to those tenant units
without their own AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312, or DoD civilian equivalent personnel assigned.
Tenant units without sufficient numbers of their own AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312, or civilian
equivalent personnel assigned and present during a Unit Training Assembly (UTA), request host
Combat Arms support to augment their personnel during weapons maintenance cycles through
the host-base Security Forces commander. If host Combat Arms manpower support is required,
it will be provided if manpower permits. For AFRC units, this support will include complete
access to and the use of all weapon maintenance facilities, tools, gauges, publications, and any
other items necessary for weapons maintenance. Unless specified in the support agreement, and
agreed upon by the host Security Forces commander, this support will not include spare weapons
parts. Formalize this training and/or support through an agreement according to AFI 25-201.
