AFPD36-20 5 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        3


1. Policy. It is Air Force policy to:
   1.1. Establish officer and enlisted accession goals based on guidance and the needs of the
   Air Force. Goals may be met through a combination of the accession sources to include
   other Services and the AFR and ANG components. The accession goal will be based on total
   non-prior and prior service requirements. This mixture meets the need to sustain proper rank
   structure to most effectively manage the force. Additionally, it is necessary to access
   qualified individuals with the proper skills to provide field commanders trained and
   adaptable Airmen.
   1.2. Afford all qualified persons equal opportunity to become Air Force members.
   Furthermore, subject to legal, fiscal, and numerical constraints, access eligible individuals on
   a gender-neutral basis without regard to race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion.
   1.3. Adhere to DoD minimum standards of age, citizenship, education, aptitude, physical
   fitness, dependency status, and moral character. Applicants must meet these minimum
   standards and must satisfy the requirements for Air Force specific programs for which they
   are applying. Individuals not meeting standards may be considered for exceptions on
   individual merit. The Air Force may deny admission to any individual, even if the applicant
   appears to be qualified, if it is not in the best interest of the Air Force to enlist or grant a
   commission. The fact that an applicant meets basic qualification standards for a specific
   accession program does not create a right or entitlement to be selected.
   1.4. Provide support       to   United   States   Military Entrance    Processing    Command
   (USMEPCOM).
2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) retains ultimate responsibility for all policies
   related to the Department of the Air Force.
   2.2. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR)
   serves as SECAF’s agent within manpower, military and civilian personnel policy and
   program domains. SAF/MR provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters
   pertaining to the formulation, review, and execution of plans, policies, and programs
   addressing the accession of Air Force military personnel.
   2.3. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1).
       2.3.1. AF/A1, in collaboration with the Chief of the Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) and the
       Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), develops personnel policy for Air Force
       accessions programs. This includes interservice transfer of officer and enlisted personnel
       and accession of disenrolled US Air Force Academy (USAFA) cadets.
       2.3.2. AF/A1 develops specific commissioning program entrance standards in
       collaboration with the commissioning sources. Additionally, AF/A1 provides guidance
       detailing support to include funding of Air Force JROTC, Air Force ROTC, the
       USMEPCOM programs, and the United States Air Force Academy. This guidance is to
       be consistent with the President’s Budget and any Memorandums of Understanding or
       Agreement.

    2.4. The Chief of Chaplains (AF/HC) develops professional Chaplain (HC) officer career
    field entrance standards. These are applied to prospective members contingent upon their
    meeting initial AF/A1 qualification standards. Additionally, AF/HC manages the chaplain
    accession programs and identifies an OPR to liaise with AF/A1.
    2.5. The Judge Advocate General (AF/JA) develops professional Judge Advocate (JA)
    officer career field entrance standards. AF/JA applies such professional standards (including
    designation as judge advocates and award of the 51J AFSC) to prospective judge advocate
    accessions contingent upon their meeting initial AF/A1 qualification standards applicable to
    all accessions. Additionally, AF/JA manages and executes the judge advocate recruiting and
    accession program and identifies an OPR to liaise with AF/A1.
    2.6. The Surgeon General (AF/SG) develops professional Surgeon General (SG) officer
    career field entrance standards. These are applied to prospective members contingent upon
    their meeting initial AF/A1 qualification standards. Additionally, AF/SG manages the
    medical officer accession program and identifies an OPR to liaise with AF/A1.
