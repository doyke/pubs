This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. It establishes the restrictions on
the location of safes and other heavy floor loads in buildings controlled by the Air Force in the
Kaiserslautern area. The use of the name of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity,
or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

1. Purpose: The floors in the old office buildings and dormitories, erected in the late 50s and early 60s,
were not built to withstand the heavy loads that can be imposed by safes, heavy file cabinets, and com-
puter components. Rigid restrictions must be placed on the location of these heavy loads.
 2. General. In buildings that were formerly dormitories, 4-drawer safes can be allowed only on the
 ground floor. If safes are required on the upper floors, they can only be two-drawer, weigh no more than
 260 pounds, and must be located next to, or over supporting structural members such as bearing walls or
 beams and columns. Heavy loads such as 2-drawer safes, file cabinets, and computer components must
 not be grouped together in one location on the upper floors. Buildings that were former dormitories
 which presently have offices above the ground floor are:

   2.1. Ramstein AB--the 500 series, 3-story buildings on the north side of the base and buildings 2102,
   2103, 2104, 2106, 2111, 2118, 2119, 2120, 2121, 2408 and 2409 on the south side.
   2.2. Kapaun--the 2700 3-story buildings.
   2.3. Einsiedlerhof--704, 705, 708, 709, and 710.
   2.4. Vogelwehâ€”1002, 1003, 1004, 1043, 1044, and 2078.

3. In all prefabricated buildings (typical brand names as Cadolto, Greschbach, Kleusberg, etc.) the floors
cannot be loaded with 4-drawer or larger safes. In addition, any 2-drawer safes used in a prefabricated
unit will be dispersed to avoid concentrating the load, and they must be emptied prior to moving them
within the building.
4. In the structures that were originally built as office buildings, care must be exercised when placing
4-drawer safes and other heavy floor loads. If safes are required on the upper floors, they can weigh no
more than 430 pounds. In general, such loads must be located next to or over supporting structural mem-
bers and more than three safes must not be grouped together. The movement of heavy safes can also
impose a critical load on the floors of our old structures. Moving a heavy object across the middle of an
office floor or in such areas as the connecting corridors between the wings of Bldg 201 could overstress
the floors and cause severe damage or complete failure. Any safes moved over these areas should first
have their drawers removed in order to lighten the load.
5. Responsibilities:
    5.1. Commanders and senior staff members are responsible to see that movement of safes and other
    heavy floor loads are made only according to this instruction.
    5.2. Building managers will assure, by constant surveillance, occupants do not impose floor loads that
    might overstress the structure.
    5.3. Commanders, senior staff members and building managers will immediately contact 86 CES/
    CECCD if there is the slightest doubt about the capability of the floors to support the loads in the
    offices or hallways.
