                                            Chapter 1

                         DEPOT MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT

1.1. Depot Maintenance. This instruction provides guidance for the management of AF depot
maintenance. The AF maintains three organic depots, all within Air Force Materiel Command.
This AFI requires AFMC to develop, implement, and sustain AF depot maintenance.
1.2. Aircraft and Equipment Readiness. Aircraft and equipment readiness is the maintenance
mission. The maintenance function ensures assigned aircraft and equipment are safe, serviceable,
and properly configured to meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include, but are not limited
to, inspecting, repairing, overhauling, modifying, preserving, refurbishing, troubleshooting,
testing, and analyzing condition and performance. Supervisors must emphasize safety, quality,
and timeliness in the performance of maintenance. The concept of quality maintenance must be
fostered by each supervisor and technician to ensure the integrity and skill of maintainers are not
degraded. To the greatest extent possible, maintenance is accomplished on a preplanned
scheduled basis. Planning provides the most effective and efficient use of people, facilities, and
equipment, reduces unscheduled maintenance, and allows for progressive actions toward
maintaining and returning aircraft and equipment to safe operating condition. Conducting a
bench check of components and proper control of repair cycle assets throughout the maintenance
cycle are also critical elements of the equipment maintenance program. AF units must
implement and manage the tasks specified in the scheduled program for their assigned aircraft
and associated support equipment (SE). Preventive maintenance concepts are described in
Technical Order (TO) 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Policies, and Procedures, and TO 00-25-108, Communications-Electronics Depot Support.
1.3. Maintenance Discipline. It is the responsibility of all maintenance personnel to comply
with all written guidance to ensure required repairs, inspections, and documentation are
completed in a safe, timely, and effective manner. Supervisors are responsible for enforcing and
establishing a climate that promotes maintenance discipline.
1.4. Technical Orders (TOs). AF TOs are published under the authority of the Secretary of the
Air Force (SECAF). Compliance with TOs is mandatory, except as explained in TO 00-5-1, AF
Technical Order System.
1.5. Modification Management. A modification proposal is a recommendation to alter the

addressing depot maintenance. The paragraphs below identify selected applicable code sections.
NOTE: When necessary, authoritative interpretations or explanations of Title 10 provisions
should be requested from the appropriate functional legal office.
   1.10.1. Depot maintenance and repair is defined in Title 10, United States Code (USC) §
   2460, Definition of depot-level maintenance and repair. It is defined as any action
   performed on materiel or software in the conduct of inspection, repair, overhaul, or the
   modification or rebuild of end-items, assemblies, subassemblies, and parts that requires
   extensive industrial facilities, specialized tools and equipment, or uniquely experienced and
   trained personnel that are not available in lower echelon-level maintenance activities, and is a
   function and, as such, is independent of any location or funding source and may be
   performed in the public or private sectors (including the performance of interim contract
   support or contract logistic support arrangements). Depot-level maintenance and repair also
   includes the fabrication of parts, testing, and reclamation, as necessary; the repair, adaptive
   modifications or upgrades, changes events made to operational software, integration and
   testing; and in the case of either hardware or software modifications or upgrades, the labor
   associated with the application of the modification.
   1.10.2. Title 10, USC § 2464, Core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities, defines
   the requirements for organic depot maintenance capabilities. Core depot maintenance are
   those which are necessary to maintain and repair the weapon systems and other military
   equipment (including mission-essential weapon systems or materiel), not later than four years
   after achieving initial operational capability, but excluding systems and equipment under
   special access programs, nuclear aircraft carriers, and commercial items. These capabilities
   are identified by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint
   Chiefs of Staff, as necessary to enable the armed forces to fulfill the strategic and
   contingency plans prepared by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Core depot
   maintenance capabilities are discussed in detail in Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction
   4151.20, Depot Maintenance Core Capabilities Determination Process.
   1.10.3. Title 10, USC § 2466, Limitations on the performance of depot-level maintenance of
   materiel, (the 50/50 rule) requires not more than 50 percent of the funds made available in a
8                                                                     AFI21-102 18 JULY 2012


    fiscal year (FY) to a military department or a Defense Agency for depot-level maintenance
    and repair workload may be used to contract for the performance by non-Federal
    Government personnel of such workload for the military department or the Defense Agency.
    Any such funds that are not used for such a contract shall be used for the performance of
    depot-level maintenance and repair workload by employees of the DoD.
    1.10.4. Title 10, USC §2469, Contracts to perform workloads previously performed by
    depot-level activities of the Department of Defense: requirement of competition, (the $3
    Million Rule) requires that depot-level maintenance and repair workloads that have a value
    of not less than $3,000,000 (including the cost of labor and materials), that is being
    performed by a depot-level activity of the DoD, may not be changed to performance by a
    contractor or by another depot-level activity of the DoD, unless the change is made using
    merit-based selection procedures (for competitions among all depot-level activities of the
    DoD) or competitive procedures (for competitions among private and public sector entities.)
    Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 does not apply to performance changes
    under this section.
    1.10.5. Title 10, USC §2472, Prohibition on management of depot employees by end
    strength, requires that civilian DoD employees (including AF personnel) who perform, or are
    involved in the performance of depot-level maintenance and repair workloads, may not be
    managed on the basis of any constraint or limitation in terms of man-years, end strength, full-
    time equivalent positions, or maximum number of employees. These employees shall be
    managed solely on the basis of the available workload and the funds made available for such
    depot-level maintenance and repair.
    1.10.6. Centers of industrial and technical excellence (CITEs) are addressed in Title 10, USC
    § 2474, Centers of Industrial and Technical Excellence: designation; public-private
    partnerships. Within the AF, the SECAF has designated three depot maintenance activities
    as CITEs: Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (ALC), Ogden ALC, and Warner Robins
    ALC. CITEs shall engineer industrial processes and adopt best-business practices in
    connection with their core competency requirements in order to serve as leaders in their core
    competencies throughout the DoD and in the national technology and industrial base. CITEs
    are also permitted to enter into public-private partnerships (PPPs) with private industry or
    other entities outside the DoD. PPPs are discussed in detail in DoDI 4151.21, Public-Private
    Partnerships for Depot-Level Maintenance.
    1.10.7. Title 10, USC § 2476, Minimum capital investments for certain depots, (the 6%
    Rule) discusses the minimum capital investment requirements for certain depots. It requires
    that each FY, the Secretary of a military department shall invest in the capital budgets of the
    covered depots of that military department a total amount equal to, but not less than, six
    percent of the average total combined workload funded at all the depots of that military
    department for the preceding three FYs. The capital budget of a depot is defined as including
    ―investment funds spent on depot infrastructure, equipment, and process improvement in
    direct support of depot operations.‖

                                          Chapter 4

                  DEPOT PURCHASED EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE

4.1. Equipment Maintenance. This section establishes procedures for PPBE of depot level
equipment maintenance requirements for AF weapon systems, sub-systems, and components that
are funded through the O&M and research, development, test and engineering (RDT&E)
appropriations with Air Force Element of Expense (AFEE) designators 540 through 546, 548,
and 560. It does not apply to the O&M funded depot-level maintenance requirements that are
managed through the AF WCF Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Supply Division
((CSAG-Supply), formerly Materiel Support Division (MSD)), contract logistics support (CLS)
programs, and depot-level repairs funded as miscellaneous contract services.
4.2. Purpose. The DPEM Program provides a mechanism for AFMC to collectively identify,
plan, program, negotiate, and budget for depot-level maintenance services provided by organic
AF depots, depots of other Services, and contract repair sources. Repair requirements identified
through the DPEM process represent substantial sustainment funding needs that are expressed in
the POM and change proposal process used to develop the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP).
The requirements are also used in development of submissions for the President’s Budget (PB),
Budget Execution Review (BER), Financial Plans, and Program Budget Review (PBR).
4.3. AFMC. AFMC shall serve as the DPEM Executive MAJCOM and be the DPEM process
owner. The DPEM process flows into the Centralized Asset Management (CAM) programming
and execution process. Therefore, AFMC/CC shall:
   4.3.1. Ensure appropriate AFMC organizations support the needs of using MAJCOMs by
   identifying repair requirements, building the MRWPs, and serving as a buyer of repair
   services to meet the needs. Provide for reviewing of maintenance requirements, negotiating
   work specifications, and performing a final validation of the requirement.
   4.3.2. Ensure support to PMs/PSMs/PGMs in the requirements identification and validation
   process for depot maintenance activation.
       4.3.2.1. Ensure timely preparation and delivery of essential AFWCF Consolidated
       Sustainment Activity Group-Maintenance Division ((CSAG-Maintenance), formerly
       Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG)) rate and factor information used in the
       DPEM budgeting process.
       4.3.2.2. Ensure timely obligation and reporting of DPEM funds execution.
       4.3.2.3. Provide for organic source of repair by CSAG-Maintenance operations at the
       ALCs and the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG).
4.4. DPEM Process Overview: The DPEM process involves a series of activities that identifies
repair requirements, pricing of the requirements based on forecasts of CSAG-Maintenance and
contractor sales rates, and validating of requirements. The validated requirements provide the
foundation for DPEM requirements in the PPBE process. In the PPBE resource allocation
process, funding strategies are applied to the requirements to arrive at a budgeted level of
funding. The DPEM process has four main activities: requirement determination, budget
preparation, program execution, and process control.
AFI21-102 18 JULY 2012                                                                       21


   4.4.1. Requirements determinations are derived from a variety of data sources and adjusted
   for historical performance and forecast changes. The Force and Financial Plan (F&FP)
   provides information on the planned force structure and is the primary driver for repair
   requirements.
      4.4.1.1. Requirements are categorized into nine commodity groups, and most commodity
      groups are further broken down into additional repair group categories (RGCs) that
      further define the type of work required. The commodity groups and associated RGCs
      are depicted below.

Table 4.1. Commodity Groups/Repair Group Categories.

      4.4.1.2. Requirements identifications are made at the lowest level practicable. The repair
      requirements are identified to a specific program element (PE), weapon system,
      commodity, RGC, service provider (organic, contract, interservice), and Air Force
      Element of Expense/Investment Code (AFEE/IC). The relationship among commodities,
      RGCs, and AFEE/ICs for the DPEM program is shown above.
          4.4.1.2.1. Requirements for Area/Base Support and Manufacturing are determined
          based on historical data and a forecast of known changes.
22                                                                   AFI21-102 18 JULY 2012


         4.4.1.2.2. Storage requirements are based on aircraft retirements and the maintenance
         and/or re-preservation needs of stored items, as well as requirements for
         demilitarization and disposal. For additional detail, reference AFI 16-402, Aerospace
         Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination, and
         TO 1-1-686, Desert Storage, Preservation and Process Manual for Aircraft, Aircraft
         Engines, and Aircraft Auxiliary Power Unit Engines.
  4.4.2. During each year, AFMC shall provide the DPEM community with CSAG-
  Maintenance and contract depot maintenance (CDM) pricing information essential to both
  requirements determination and formulation of the DPEM budget. The pricing information
  will consist of planning factors for POM (or change proposal) development and sales rates
  and prices for development of financial plans and PB submission.
     4.4.2.1. The Estimated POM Planning Factor Table provides rate inflation factors to be
     used in estimating the costs of DPEM requirements beyond the budget year. The table
     data will be used to escalate costs so requirements are stated in ―then year‖ dollars. For
     additional information, reference AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors.
     4.4.2.2. The sales rates and prices for the AFWCF CSAG-Maintenance are published
     annually. The rates are set to recover full cost of operation, implement program budget
     decisions (PBDs), and achieve a zero balance accumulated operating result in the budget
     year as prescribed in DoD rate stabilization policy (ref. DoD 7000.14-R, Department of
     Defense Financial Management Regulations, Volume 2B, Chapter 9). DPEM Factor
     Table data is applied to basic repair requirements to determine the budget and out-year
     requirement in ―then year‖ dollars.
  4.4.3. The budget preparation process begins with the adjustment of DPEM requirements to
  reflect anticipated cost changes and ends with the submission of the proper budget exhibits to
  SAF/FM. Budget preparation guidance is provided through a variety of sources including:
  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Under Secretary of Defense
  (Comptroller), SAF/FM, and AF/A4/7. Requirements are organized to support the PB, POM,
  BER, Financial Plan, and PBR.
     4.4.3.1. In order to properly scope the size of the DPEM requirements, costs (current or
     historic) are adjusted for anticipated fluctuations. As described earlier in this section, the
     DPEM factor table is used to apply price factors to adjust requirements for various budget
     documents. In the POM submission process, AFMC may also include additional out-year
     requirements. The adjusted requirements represent the anticipated cost of accomplishing
     100% of the maintenance actions if 100% of the forecasted requirements are generated.
     AFMC shall develop the active AF DPEM requirements and submit to AF/A4/7,
     Directorate of Resources, to develop the active AF budget submission. Courtesy copies
     of ANG and AFRC DPEM requirements data are also provided to AF/A4/7, Directorate
     of Resources, for informational use only.
     4.4.3.2. The process of ―applying funding‖ represents the budgeting process that seeks to
     obtain a funding level for a specified amount of the adjusted requirement. The funding
     level is expressed as a percentage of the total requirement or as a specific dollar amount.
     The funding levels are provided as a financial plan target for the upcoming execution or
     financial plan year, or from the Automated Budget Interactive Data Environmental
     System (ABIDES).
AFI21-102 18 JULY 2012                                                                      23


     4.4.3.3. Once the DPEM requirements are developed and provided to AF/A4/7,
     Directorate of Resources, the resulting Depot Maintenance Program Summary (OP30)
     and Operation and Maintenance Aircraft, Engine and Software Maintenance (OP80)
     budget exhibits are then submitted to SAF/FM. AF/RE submits OP30 and OP80 budget
     exhibits directly to OSD Comptroller. ANG submits OP30 and OP80 budget exhibits
     directly to SAF/FM.
     4.4.3.4. AFMC uses the financial plan to identify funded and unfunded requirements for
     the next FY. It provides financial information to SAF/FM pertaining to prior, current,
     and Financial Plan years. The Financial Plan portrays information by PE, DoD Element
     of Expense (DoDEE), and sometimes by AFEE/IC. If the requirement for a particular PE
     exceeds that PE’s funding, then an unfunded requirement is included along with a
     description of the impacts. The Financial Plan also includes a detailed explanation of
     significant program changes from one year to the next.
     4.4.3.5. A POM is submitted annually by each fundsholder (e.g., CAM, AFRC, NGB,
     etc.) to outline program requirements for inclusion in the update to the FYDP. As part of
     the DPEM POM process, AFMC submits POM data, via Resource Allocation
     Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS). AFMC then provides AF/A4/7,
     Directorate of Resources, with a database file for use in extracting POM DPEM Funding
     Summary data. AF/A4/7, Directorate of Resources, participates in each round of the
     POM cycle. They represent and defend the AF DPEM program in each mission panel
     that governs a portion of the program.
  4.4.4. In the DPEM program execution, PMs/PGMs serve as the supplier to the MAJCOM
  by purchasing the services necessary to accomplish the required maintenance actions from
  either organic AF, interservice, or contract repair sources.
     4.4.4.1. The program execution report is the primary means of documenting funding
     agreements between the PMs/PSMs/PGMs and supplier. The supplier shall generate a
     program execution report to identify quarterly obligations of funds and an FY closeout
     report. HQ AFMC shall generate execution reports to identify planning program
     authority (PA) and initial budget authority (BA).
     4.4.4.2. HQ AFMC shall develop the FY planning PA and BA based on the most
     recently validated requirements and submit the information at the program control
     number (PCN) level of detail to the supplier prior to the start of the FY.
     PMs/PSMs/PGMs may give the suppliers flexibility to realign funding among PCNs.
     Suppliers use planning PA for workload planning for the upcoming year and first quarter
     negotiations.
     4.4.4.3. If a continuing resolution authority (CRA) is in place at the start of an FY, the
     suppliers ensure that production management follows the guidance accompanying the
     CRA.
     4.4.4.4. HQ AFMC shall develop the initial BA using the latest funding information.
     The PMs/PGMs then provide the suppliers with an Operating Budget Authority (OBA)
     document or AF Form(s) 185, Project Order. This is the actual authorization for the
     suppliers to obligate funds. If a PM/PSM/PGM provides funding on an OBA document,
     the suppliers make the BA available to production management for obligation by loading
24                                                                  AFI21-102 18 JULY 2012


     it into the Base Level General Accounting Finance System (H069). If PMs/PSMs/PGMs
     provide Obligational Authority (OA) on AF Form185, the suppliers ensure the
     information is consistent with the PA in the Initial BA version of the program execution
     report.
     4.4.4.5. BA and OA can be changed at any time during the FY.
        4.4.4.5.1. BA funding change requests provided on an OBA document are made by
        PMs/PSMs/PGMs and sent to suppliers. These may be made at any time, but tend to
        follow the PM/PSM/PGM evaluation of a program execution report. After receiving
        the funding change requests, the supplier determines if it can be satisfied. If so, it is
        forwarded to program management for implementation, and the H069 is updated. If
        not, the PM/PSM/PGM is informed of the problem, and a solution is worked out. In
        order to increase funds tracking accuracy, the PM/PSM/PGM should supplement the
        OBA document with information that reconciles it to the official accounting system.
        4.4.4.5.2. OA change requests to funding provided on AF Form 185 must be
        accompanied by a request to the supplier to change any funding in the program
        execution report. When the supplier changes the program execution report, the
        amended AF Form 185 is reviewed for consistency.
  4.4.5. Process control is to ensure the DPEM process keeps up with procedures, process
  changes, and timely process execution and provides process information to the chain of
  command and users.
AFI21-102 18 JULY 2012                                                                   25

hazardous situations, machinery, equipment, and chemicals. Most hazardous situations can be
avoided by following procedures, asking for help when needed, and using PPE. Supervisors
must be knowledgeable of and implement the Voluntary Protection Program. They must also
enforce AFOSHSTDs, TOs, and AFIs applicable to their operations and ensure personnel are
educated on safety requirements applicable to the job. Examples of hazardous situations and
programs covered in the AFOSHSTDs include, but are not limited to: confined space, fall
protection, chemical safety, interior spray painting, and respirator safety.
5.2. Air Force Occupational, Safety, and Health (AFOSH) Guidance. Use AF functional
directives and technical data in conjunction with AFOSHSTDs; see Attachment 1 for
AFOSHSTDs applicable to aircraft maintenance activities (this list is not all inclusive). If
conflicting guidance exists, the weapon system specific technical data will take precedence.

                            DEPOT MAINTENANCE SUPPORT

6.1. Depot Maintenance Production Support. Depot Maintenance strives to apply the right
resources at the right time at point-of-use to execute a needs-driven production plan and
schedule. AFMC/CC shall develop standardized procedures and responsibilities for depot
maintenance production support activities to include workload control, planning, and scheduling
functions as well as documentation requirements. Additionally, responsibilities for functional
relationships with stakeholders outside of the depot maintenance realm (e.g., PM, Air Force
Global Logistics Support Center, Defense Logistics Agency, etc.) must also be defined.
6.2. Depot Maintenance Supply Support and Materiel Control. Sufficient maintenance
supply support is critical to successful depot maintenance production. The repair environment
applies agile combat support logistics concepts such as: (1) identified value in customer support
(parts when needed; on-time delivery), (2) a streamlined process model, (3) uninterrupted
continuous flow-through process, (4) synchronized delivery of material from internal and
external suppliers, (5) supportability reviews, electronic commerce, and technology enablers, and
(6) planning, engineering, contracting, and supply support well forward to support the depot
maintenance effort. Additional detail regarding materiel management is provided in AFMAN
23-110. For additional detail on cannibalization of parts, reference Chapter 13 of this
Instruction. AFMC/CC shall develop additional process implementation guidance for materiel
management and support (to include Bills of Materiel). For additional detail, reference AFMCI
21-130, Depot Maintenance Materiel Control.

              WORK CONTROL DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL DATA

7.1. Work Control Documents (WCD). Timely and complete work planning is essential to
accomplishing the depot production process. Work planning is reflected in the WCDs. To
develop accurate, efficient, and effective WCDs, it is critical to integrate all workload planning
and technical requirements that support the maintenance production functions. AFMC/CC shall
promulgate procedures for developing and processing WCDs when implementing technical data
requirements.
   7.1.1. The WCD is the official record for work including control, identification, certification,
   and routing of items. WCDs are not technical data. The WCD is an instruction document
   summarizing sequenced steps and the TO references for processing the item. WCDs are
   developed by authorized planner/industrial engineering technicians in accordance with
   approved technical data. The WCD is the record documenting that the task was performed
   by certified technicians IAW authorized technical data. It must be auditable to the
   technician’s training record. All critical tasks must be listed and certified as a separate line
   item.
   7.1.2. TO Changes and Authorized Deviations. Technical data used in depot maintenance
   must be complete, accurate, effective, and efficient. It is the responsibility of maintenance
   personnel at all levels to ensure deficiencies are reported in a timely manner and
   improvements are made when needed. When work cannot be performed using the TO as
   written, an authorized deviation must be processed and approved.
7.2. Standard Depot Maintenance Program. AFMC/CC shall develop a standard depot
maintenance program detailing the roles, responsibilities and processes for how aircraft and
commodities are planned, scheduled, inducted, handled, overhauled, repaired, tested, certified,
and delivered back to the AF and other DoD customers.

8.1. General. Maintenance quality and equipment reliability is the responsibility of all
maintenance personnel. The combined efforts of QA personnel, maintenance leaders, and
technicians are necessary to ensure high quality maintenance production and equipment
reliability. The QA staff evaluates the quality of maintenance accomplished and performs
necessary functions to manage the MSEP. The MSEP provides an objective sampling of the
proficiency of maintenance personnel and the compliance of MSEP focus areas, programs, and
processes. QA personnel are not an extension of the work force and shall not be tasked to
perform production. QA serves as the primary advisory agency in the maintenance organization,
assisting maintenance supervision at all levels to resolve quality problems. The evaluation and
analysis of deficiencies and problem areas are key functions of QA that highlight and identify
underlying causes of poor quality in the maintenance production effort. Aircraft, major end
items, and equipment condition as well as personnel proficiency are validated through the MSEP
and shall be recorded using a QA database.
8.2. Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP). The MSEP is the
maintenance component of the Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) and is
designed to provide unit maintenance managers with a method of evaluating compliance with
AF, Lead Command, and local maintenance directives and policies. LCAP (as detailed in AFI
20-111, Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP)) is the AF evaluation program that
establishes the Lead Command Logistics Compliance Assessment Team (LCAT).
   8.2.1. AFMC is responsible for developing an MSEP and conducting local inspections to
   ensure their programs, processes, maintenance technician proficiency, equipment condition,
   and other focus areas are in compliance with AF and local directives. AFMC shall ensure the
   MSEP mirrors the LCAP requirements as defined in AFI 20-111.
   8.2.2. AFMC shall document MSEP data in an approved QA database.
8.3. Quality Assurance Program. AFMC/CC shall develop a Quality Assurance Program. At
a minimum, this program shall:
   8.3.1. Ensure all QA inspector personnel are properly trained and proficient in their duties
   prior to performing unsupervised evaluations. If a functional area does not warrant a full-
   time position in QA, but specialized expertise is required, select qualified technicians to be
   augmentees.
   8.3.2. Ensure all QA inspectors complete Egress certification before evaluating egress tasks
   IAW Chapter 12 of this Instruction.
   8.3.3. Evaluate welding operations and processes IAW TO 00-25-252, Aeronautical
   Equipment Welding.
   8.3.4. Ensure all QA inspectors are trained on all associated safety requirements prior to
   performing inspections on fuel systems or fuel systems repair facilities IAW TO 1-1-3,
   Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks and Fuel Cells.

   8.3.5. Ensure all QA inspectors evaluating Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) technicians
   during Personnel Evaluations are trained and qualified on the method being evaluated.
   8.3.6. Ensure Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) standards are developed for workloads being
   assessed.
   8.3.7. Determine operations that require a quality review prior to continuing maintenance.
   8.3.8. Determine routine inspections to be completed.
   8.3.9. Evaluate unit maintenance management procedures, including locally developed
   forms, publications, Operating Instructions (OIs), checklists etc., for accuracy, intent, and
   necessity.
8.4. Activity Inspection Program. AFMC/CC shall develop an Activity Inspection Program
that:
   8.4.1. Identifies discipline, housekeeping, and technical discrepancies and attempt to identify
   the underlying cause for the deficiencies.
      8.4.2. Encompasses all flights of the unit.
      8.4.3. Produces objective reports and provides specific definitions of problem areas,
      appropriate directive references, and recommended corrective action.
8.5. Additional Quality Programs. AFMC/CC shall:
   8.5.1. Ensure development of a cross-tell program for preventive action purposes.
   8.5.2. Manage Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Federal Aviation Administration
   (FAA) Part 145, Repair Stations, program, if applicable.

               MAINTAINING COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT

11.1. Background Information and Objective. The AF procures commercial derivative
aircraft for various missions. These aircraft are intended to conform to FAA standards and
designs. The AF maintains these aircraft according to civil airworthiness standards using AF
maintenance systems and procedures. They must meet FAA requirements when modifying these
aircraft to maintain configuration control and ensure flight safety.
   11.1.1. Modifications, repairs, and overhauls accomplished by organic or commercial depot
   maintenance activities to AF commercial derivative aircraft having FAA certification shall
   not cause the aircraft to lose its FAA certification. All depot maintenance activities and
   organizations associated with commercial derivative aircraft must comply with the respective
   TOs and/or aircraft manuals. All modifications, repairs, and overhauls to commercial
   derivative aircraft by organic or contractor depot maintenance activities shall be performed in
   an FAA certified or military equivalent facility. For additional detail, reference Title 14,
   CFR, Part 145.
   11.1.2. Organic depot maintenance may use a Certificate of Conformance or Return to
   Service certification when applicable for the FAA approved maintenance processes for a
   specific workload.
11.2. Certification Requirements. Organic depot maintenance shall be performed on
commercial derivative aircraft in an organic FAA certified Part 145 Repair Station or military
equivalent facility. AF military and civilian maintenance technicians performing maintenance in
an organic FAA certified Part 145 Repair Station or military equivalent facility who work under
the authority of that specific repair station typically do not require individual FAA certification.
Only those inspectors authorized by the repair station to issue a Certificate of Conformance or
return an item to service are required to be FAA certified (Airframe, Powerplant, or Repairman
certification).
11.3. Inspection Requirements. Depot maintenance accomplished either organically or
commercially on Commercial Derivative Aircraft shall comply with inspection requirements.
11.4. Deviations from Inspection Requirements. When deviation from these requirements or
intervals is justified, proposed changes shall be sent to the PM for evaluation.
11.5. Component Overhaul and Time Change Intervals. Use the manufacturer’s component
overhaul and time-change intervals for commercial derivative aircraft and its installed
equipment. Do not exceed the FAA approved intervals.
11.6. Airframe Overhaul. Overhaul of commercial derivative aircraft during Programmed
Depot Maintenance (PDM) shall be accomplished according to FAA requirements. The PM
determines PDM cycle intervals and related work requirements IAW TO 00-25-4, Depot
Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles and Training Equipment, and the aircraft Dash-6 inspection
manual. General requirements and related time intervals include all major elements of the
aircraft.

11.7. Aircraft and Component Modifications. The FAA issues a supplemental type certificate
(STC) for a change to a type design. For AF-designed modifications to commercial derivative
aircraft and components, obtain AF approval IAW AFI 63-131. Obtain FAA certification by
sending FAA Form 8110-12, Application for Type Certificate, with engineering data attached, to
the FAA regional office. After approving the engineering prototype installation (and flight test,
if required), the FAA issues the certification or STC. The PM receives the FAA certification, or
STC, for an AF-designed modification. Have contractors obtain the FAA certification or STC
for a contractor-designed modification.
11.8. Aircraft and Component Modifications. Maintenance on AF aircraft and components
having FAA certification, when accomplished by AF depot maintenance activities, does not
cause the aircraft to lose its FAA certification. All modifications to such aircraft shall comply
with AFPD 62-6, USAF Airworthiness. Such modifications are required to keep the weapon
system or aircraft in compliance with FAA standards and to maintain FAA certification.
