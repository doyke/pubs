1. Objective: To establish an effective mishap program and provide guidelines concerning
official use of GMV. The goal is to ensure proper identification and reporting of vehicle
accidents, incidents, abuse and misuse. It outlines responsibilities, reporting procedures and
transfer of funds. Visibility and emphasis are placed at the using unit level and under the direct
control of the unit commander to foster better operator care and condition of 501 CSW vehicle
fleet. This Instruction does not alter the report of survey process to establish financial
responsibility found in AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, 1 July 1996.
2. Responsibilities: It is the using unit’s responsibility to take the proper action necessary to
prevent/resolve applicable actions related to vehicle mishaps or misuse. If the vehicle affected is
assigned to an organization other than the using organization, the using organization which has
signed out and is operating the vehicle will take responsibility for the applicable actions related
to resolution of vehicle mishaps or misuse.
3. Vehicle Accident/Incident procedures.
     3.1. The installation/group commander will:
        3.1.1. Be the final authority concerning any and all controversies on classification of
        vehicle abuse, incident, accident or misuse.
     3.2. Vehicle Management at each installation will:
        3.2.1. Provide accident, incident or abuse estimates, notification memorandums, AF
        Form(IMT) 20, Repair Cost and Repairable Value Statement, SF91, Motor Vehicle
        Accident Report and photos to the using unit/operating commander, Vehicle Control
        Officer (VCO) or Vehicle Control Non-commissioned Officer (VCNCO), Legal office,
        Safety offices and Security Forces.
        3.2.2. Commence vehicle repairs upon receipt of memorandum releasing the vehicle for
        repairs from Squadron or Operating Commander.
        3.2.3. Provide an AF IMT 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement, with final

     through the using organization's RA for reimbursement of funds listed on the AF IMT 20.
     3.2.5. Maintain an open work order in OLVIMS to capture downtime from date/time
     vehicle was turned in until all required repairs are completed.
     3.2.6. Retain possession of the vehicle from the turn-in date until all damage repairs are
     completed. In emergency situations, approval to release the vehicle back to the using
     organization must be coordinated with the 501 CSW/LG.
  3.3. The Squadron or Operating Commander will:
     3.3.1. When deemed appropriate, initiate a preliminary investigation to determine
     circumstances of the accident, incident or abuse case and evaluate procedures/safety
     considerations and determine whether a Report of Survey (ROS) should be accomplished
     IAW AFMAN 23-220.
     3.3.2. Notify Vehicle Management immediately for vehicle accident/abuse cases that a
     preliminary investigation is being initiated. Upon completion of the preliminary
     investigation, inform Vehicle Management of decision to initiate a ROS and to not begin
     any repairs until the investigation is completed. Upon completion of the investigation,
     sign and return notification memorandum to Vehicle Management releasing vehicle for
     repairs.
     3.3.3. If a decision was reached to not pursue a ROS, sign and return accident or abuse
     notification memorandum to Vehicle Management within seven working days from
     receipt of the memorandum releasing the vehicle for repairs. NOTE: If a government
     owned vehicle caused a fatality or was involved in a fatality or an accident with private
     property the Base Legal Office must release the vehicle before repairs commence.
     3.3.4. Ensure funding is available for reimbursement to Vehicle Management for all

     desk instead of local authorities.
        3.4.3. In some cases, members will be required to surrender the AF Form 2293, US Air
        Force Motor Operator Vehicle Identification Card (government drivers license), with the
        SF 91, to the VCO/VCNCO after the accident. Unit commanders may reinstate the
        license at their discretion.
     3.5. If the vehicle operator is incapacitated, the assigned or using organizations will:
        3.5.1. Turn vehicles into vehicle maintenance immediately after being released from the
        accident scene, if it can be driven safely. The initial responsibility to identify and report
        accidents rests with the vehicle operator.

        located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/, rule 24-03R 13.00 for six years after case is closed.
        These files will be inspected as part of the annual VCO/VCNCO program assessment.
4. Additional Guidance:
     4.1. Vehicles identified for accident/abuse will not be replaced unless the unit falls below
     Mission Essential level (MEL) for that vehicle type.
501CSWI24-302 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  5


   4.2. Accidents involving Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) and/Government Motor
   Vehicle/Equipment (GMV/E):
      4.2.1. If a POV/GMV accident occurred, the assigned or using unit will notify VM&A of
      the accident upon returning the vehicle.
      4.2.2. The assigned or using unit will notify the legal office of the accident and provide
      all supporting documentation regarding the accident, i.e. statements, reports, photos, etc.
      Additionally, the unit will provide a summary of the accident, to include the parties
      involved, vehicles involved, time and date, location, and a narrative of the accident. The
      legal office will process any potential claims in accordance with AFI 51-501, Tort Claims
   4.3. If a Report of Survey has been initiated on a vehicle accident and the recommendation is
   made by the investigator to financially assess the responsible individual the staff judge
   advocate will review the report for legal sufficiency. The approving authority will determine
   whether or not to actually financially assess; however, if no ROS is processed, the unit
   commander may take other action. (Ref: AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 18, Paragraph 18.4.2.3.
   The staff judge advocate will be notified at the earliest).
   4.4. Multiple-Unit Accidents (accidents between separate units):
      4.4.1. Each unit involved will conduct an investigation. The commanders of the units
      involved will have final decision authority.
   4.5. Personnel must be familiar with and adhere to the safe driving guidelines in Attachment
   2.
   4.6. Pecuniary Liability: For GMV, reimbursement to the Vehicle Management for repairs
   due to accidents, abuse or incidents will be made regardless of individual pecuniary liability
   as assessed through a ROS.
5. Official Use of GMV’s
   5.1. Unauthorized use of GMV often results in unnecessary expenditure of funds and public
   criticism. Transportation by a DOD motor vehicle shall not be provided when the
   justification is based solely on reasons of rank, position, prestige, or personal convenience.
   5.2. Restrict use of all DOD motor vehicles, including those rented or leased, for official
   purposes only; that is, uses that would further the mission of the Air Force. Providing a
   government vehicle solely or principally to enhance the comfort or convenience of
   member(s) is not permitted.
   5.3. Refer to Attachments 3 and 4 to determine official use. Questions of official use can
   also be directed to Vehicle Operations or referenced in AFI 24-301, chapter 3, and
   attachments 8 and 9. When guidance does not specifically fit a request for transportation,
   commanders must document answers to the following questions prior to approving the use of
   a government motor vehicle:
      5.3.1. Is the purpose of the trip official (in support of an authorized DOD function,
      activity, or operation)?
      5.3.2. Does the request have the potential to create a perception that will reflect
      unfavorably on the Air Force or cause public criticism (can it be justified to a taxpayer)?
6                                                          501CSWI24-302 19 OCTOBER 2012


       5.3.3. Will the request impact mission requirements?
       5.3.4. Is commercial or DOD scheduled transportation available? It is important to note
       the Air Force does not provide transportation support that competes with commercial
       services.
       5.3.5. If provided, is GMV transportation the most cost effective method of satisfying the
       requirement?
    5.4. All military and civilian employees need to take appropriate measures to prevent
    misuse, abuse, or willful acts/omissions that could cause damage to GMVs.
    5.5. Permanent Party: Official use for active duty personnel includes transportation to or
    from Air Force scheduled appointments, i.e., dental appointments, commander’s calls,
    urinalysis testing, hospital outpatient appointments, etc.
       5.5.1. Personnel conducting official off-base duties are authorized to stop at off-base
       eating establishments in the immediate vicinity or direct route of the off-base work site.
       Stopping at private quarters for any reason or stopping for shopping purposes is
       prohibited. Restrict the use of these vehicles to reputable eating establishments.
       Reputable is defined as an establishment whose primary purpose is food service and not
       providing alcohol.
    5.6. Temporary Duty Personnel: Transportation may be provided between lodgings and
    duty stations for personnel on temporary duty when public or commercial resources are
    inadequate or nonexistent. The temporary duty status of an individual does not necessarily
    justify the use of a DOD motor vehicle. Use of the vehicle will always be predicated on need,
    distance involved, and other conditions that justify their use. Note: When an adequate DOD
    or commercial bus system is available, the use of any individual motor vehicle or commercial
    rental car is prohibited. When authorized a GMV may be operated:
       5.6.1. Between places where the member’s presence is required for official business, or
       between such places and temporary lodging.
       5.6.2. Between places of business or lodging and eating establishments, barber shops,
       places of worship, laundry cleaning establishments, and similar places required for
       sustenance of the member.
       5.6.3. If used off-base, restrict the use of these vehicles to reputable eating
       establishments in reasonable proximity to the installation. Reputable is defined as an
       establishment whose primary purpose is food service and not providing alcohol.
       5.6.4. Between places of business or lodging and installation bowling centers, officer and
       enlisted clubs, gymnasiums or any on-base NAF activity (i.e., golf courses, community
       centers) facilities required for the comfort or health of the member. Use of motor vehicles
       for transportation to or from off-base entertainment or recreational facilities is prohibited.
    5.7. Emergency Response Forces. As a rule, transportation to on-base dining facilities is
    an individual responsibility. The installation commander may grant authority to personnel
    requiring emergency or rapid response capability, i.e., security police, firefighting personnel,
    etc.
501CSWI24-302 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                            7

                               SAFE DRIVING GUIDELINES

A2.1. The goal of a vehicle accident prevention program is to reduce the number and severity of
vehicle accidents. All units should ensure a viable vehicle accident prevention program is part of
the unit’s safety program. One way to accomplish this is by incorporating driver safety into your
weekly safety briefings. There are six main areas that should be stressed:
A2.2. Regular Vehicle Inspections (at least weekly, or more frequently as needed).
   A2.2.1. Tires. Check tire pressure and visually check for damage/abnormalities.
   A2.2.2. Lights. Visually check for proper operation.
   A2.2.3. Leaks. Visually check for fuel/brake/oil/coolant leaks.
   A2.2.4. Engine oil and coolant. Visually check levels.
   A2.2.5. Battery. Visually check fluid level, cleanliness, security of hold-down.
   A2.2.6. Drive belts. Visually check for fraying or cracking.
   A2.2.7. Safety devices. Functionally check operation of seat belts, headrests, and warning
   lights.
   A2.2.8. Instrument, horn, and windshield wipers. Functionally check for operation.
   A2.2.9. Brake and steering. Functionally check responsiveness and effectiveness.
   A2.2.10. Note any unusual           occurrences    such    as     noise,   odor,   and   erratic
   instruments/operation.
A2.3. Safe Driving Cushion between Vehicles.
   A2.3.1. Use the 2-second rule during normal driving conditions and more during inclement
   weather.
   A2.3.2. Never over-drive the distance lit by your headlights.
   A2.3.3. Signal your intentions at least 100 feet ahead of intersection. Not signaling your
   intentions well in advance causes other drivers to make last minute/panic decisions.
   A2.3.4. Exercise caution anytime that you are backing a vehicle; use spotters when you
   cannot see. If no spotter is available, conduct a walk around of the vehicle prior to backing.
   A2.3.5. Use mirrors to monitor your surroundings. If you cannot see, use a spotter.
   A2.3.6. Ensure you have adequate clearance around vehicles, especially when operating
   over-sized vehicles or towing equipment. Larger vehicles need a larger area to maneuver.
   Note: For additional guidance on specific adverse/hazardous road and weather condition
   requirements, please refer to your group’s Traffic Installation Code Instruction.
A2.4. Expecting the Unexpected.
   A2.4.1. Be constantly aware of surroundings and watch for other vehicles. You not only
   have to deal with decisions that you make, but the decisions of other drivers as well.
 12                                                      501CSWI24-302 19 OCTOBER 2012


   A2.4.2. Be attentive to situations that may come up while driving. You are not the only
   driver on the road.
   A2.4.3. Always drive defensively and expect other drivers to do something unexpected.
   A2.4.4. Be extra cautious when approaching major roadways, intersections, and areas where
   vehicles are entering and exiting the roadway. High traffic areas pose a greater risk to all
   drivers.
   A2.4.5. Don’t become complacent in familiar areas. Most accidents happen within 50 miles
   of your home; knowing the area is not an excuse for not paying attention to your
   surroundings.
A2.5. Weather and Road Conditions.
   A2.5.1. Changing weather conditions can degrade road conditions in a matter of seconds.
   A2.5.2. Road surfaces can have damaged areas, be prepared for them.
   A2.5.3. Use extra time to drive safely during inclement weather conditions and when
   roadways are damaged or are under construction.
   A2.5.4. Use caution on bridges, over passes and shaded areas. They will freeze before and
   stay frozen longer than other roadway surfaces
A2.6. Rules of the Road.
   A2.6.1. Pay attention to traffic signs and obey them. Traffic signs give drivers information to
   prepare for situations on the road ahead.
   A2.6.2. Do not exceed posted speed limits.
   A2.6.3. Follow directional arrows in parking lots. Arrows are used in parking lots to control
   the flow of traffic and to make things safer for everyone.
A2.7. Use of Seat Belts.
   A2.7.1. Seat belt use is MANDATORY for all drivers and passengers. Driving privileges
   may be revoked if not in compliant.
A2.8. Following these tips will greatly reduce the likelihood of being involved in an accident.
Also remember that fatigued drivers are more likely to be involved in an accident. Get the rest
that you need. Driving tired has the same effect as driving under the influence of alcohol; your
reaction times increase making it more difficult to cope with incidents on the road.

1. Reference DOD 4500.36-R, Para C2.5.10. Transportation by a DOD motor vehicle shall not be provided
when the justification is based solely on reasons of rank, position, prestige or personal convenience (i.e., generic
policies allowing support to wing or group commanders and command chiefs, or individuals of a certain
rank/pay grade such as O-6 and above). The Head of the DOD Component concerned exercises authority over
civilian personnel. Violations should be reported to the authorizing individual’s superior or the IG.

2. For all rules except 3 and 4, official travel is directed at the transportation to/from commercial or military
terminals, domicile or place of employment/primary duty. The Deployment and Distribution Flight
Chief/Superintendent is the government vehicle official use approval authority for any request which appears to
conflict with or is not sufficiently addressed in any cited governing directives or guidance.

3. Methods of transportation listed which do not meet mission requirements in a responsive manner (see
definition in this AFI) must be documented objectively on a case-by-case basis. Requests to provide other GMV
support as a result of unresponsive transportation services listed above will be annotated in the OLVIMS
Dispatch Module request remarks field and a copy of the justification will be retained for audit and inspection
purposes.

4. National Capital Region units refer to DODI 4515.7 and AFDW policy.
