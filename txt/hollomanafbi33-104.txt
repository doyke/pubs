This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-1, Command, Control, Communica-
tions, and Computer (C4) Systems. This instruction clarifies procedures and responsibilities to support
and manage the Base Cellular Telephone Program. It updates guidance on cellular telephone assets
according to directives and guidelines governing management of Land Mobile Radio (LMRs). This
instruction is in keeping with the spirit of ACC 33-106 Supplement, which states that cellular telephones
are not to be used for command and control purposes.



1. To Request Cellular Telephone Service:
   1.1. The requesting unit's LMR Net Manager will submit an AF Form 3215, C-4 Systems Require-
   ments Document, to 49th Communications Squadron Plans Flight (49 CS/SCX ) for action to process
   through appropriate agencies. Cellular telephone requirements will be processed by 49 CS/SCX in
   accordance with AFI 33-103, Requirements Development and Processing; AFI 33-106, Managing
   High Frequency Radios, Land Mobile Radios, Cellular Telephones, and the Military Affiliate Radio
   System; AFI 33-111, Telephone Systems Management; and AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis.
   1.2. The AF Form 3215 will identify the unit's requirement for a new cellular phone. If a cellular tele-
   phone request is approved, the original approval document, along with a technical solution recom-
   mending purchase of a cellular telephone, will be returned to the requesting unit. A copy of the
   original approval document and technical solution will be filed in 49 CS/SCX. All units are responsi-
   ble for retaining the original approval document and technical solution for as long as the requirement
   continues to exist, reference AFI 33-106. If the document is lost, becomes unreadable, or requirement
   changes, the requiring unit must resubmit a new document for authorization.
   1.3. Positions pre-approved to use cellular phones (see paragraph 4.) need not submit an initial AF
   Form 3215. Units with pre-approved cellular telephones will receive approval documents from 49 CS/
   SCX. A copy of the original approval document and technical solution will be filed in 49 CS/SCX.

    1.4. Each unit LMR Net Manager with cellular telephone assets will annually revalidate their unit's
    requirements by submitting an AF Form 3215 to 49 CS/SCX by 1 August. Any cellular asset not iden-
    tified in the inventory is unauthorized. Service on unauthorized cellular telephones will be terminated
    and the unit in question will pay any charges accrued.
    1.5. Unauthorized cellular telephones must be turned in to 49 CS/SCX immediately. Continued use of
    unauthorized cellular telephones will result in service termination, and the cellular telephone will be
    confiscated by the 49th Communications Squadron. Any charges accrued will be billed to the unit in
    question.
    1.6. To deactivate a cellular telephone, the requesting unit must submit an AF Form 3215 to 49 CS/
    SCX requesting phone deactivation. The request should include the cellular telephone number and
    serial number. Immediately upon deactivation, all cellular telephones must be returned to the 49th
    Communications Squadron.

2. Approval Criteria:
    2.1. The 49th Communications Squadron Commander, as the Communications Systems Officer
    (CSO), must approve/disapprove all cellular telephone requests, reference AFI 33-106 as supple-
    mented. The CSO will exercise discretion in determining cellular telephone feasibility. Factors the
    CSO will consider are:
       2.1.1. Primary use for the device (i.e., mission essential).
       2.1.2. Purchase price, anticipated monthly air time, and estimated life-cycle costs versus alterna-
       tives (LMRs, pagers).
       2.1.3. Potential security considerations.
       2.1.4. TA or AFI requisite for cellular phone.
       2.1.5. Does the requirement support emergency response functions (i.e., Fire Department, Ambu-
       lances, Disaster Control Group)?
    2.2. Cellular telephone requirements for use in environments where classified, sensitive, or critical
    information may be inadvertently overheard, monitored, or transmitted will not be approved. Cellular
    telephones are restricted to non-operational requirements only.
    2.3. Overall, if the requirement cannot be satisfied by means that are more economically advanta-
    geous to the Air Force (i.e., pagers, LMRs, etc.), then the request for a cellular telephone will be con-
    sidered for approval.

3. Cellular Telephone Use:
    3.1. Cellular telephones are authorized for official government business only. Cellular telephone
    users must comply with AFI 33-106 supplement and AFI 33-219, Telecommunications Monitoring
    and Assessment Program (TMAP). Use of government cellular telephones constitutes consent to mon-
    itoring and must have a "consent to monitoring" label affixed to them, reference AFI 33-219. Contact
    the Holloman Information Protection Office (49 CS/SCBS) to acquire labels.
    3.2. Unit Telephone Control Officers (TCO) will verify that charges and services are proper and cor-
    rect following the guidance in paragraph 6.2.2. and 6.2.3. of this instruction.
HOLLOMANAFBI33-104 28 JANUARY 1998                                                                     3


   3.3. The 49th Communications Squadron and/or the Air Force Audit Agency reserve the right to per-
   form no-notice inspections to verify official government calls. Unofficial calls are considered fraud,
   waste, and abuse, and will be reported to the 49th Fighter Wing Inspector General.

5. Cellular Telephones for Temporary Loan:
    5.1. The 49th Communications Squadron will have a limited number of Cellular Telephones on hand
    for temporary loan.
    5.2. To request temporary use of a cellular telephone, the requester must call 49 CS/SCX at ext. 7780
    at least one duty day in advance. Before receiving a phone for temporary use, the requesting unit must
    present 49 CS/SCX with a signed memorandum authorizing the 49th Communications Squadron to
    access the requesting unit's fund cite for billing purposes after cellular telephone is returned. All
    charges accrued during temporary use of a cellular telephone will be billed to the borrowing unit.
    5.3. Cellular telephones for loan are available on a first come, first serve basis. The 49th Communica-
    tions Squadron does not guarantee availability of a cellular telephone for loan.
    5.4. If a loaned cellular telephone is not returned by the due date, service will be terminated and all
    charges incurred for service deactivation/reactivation will be billed to the borrowing unit. A Report of
    Survey will be completed if the cellular telephone is not returned, is lost or stolen.
    5.5. The 49th Communications Squadron reserves the right to recall any cellular telephones if a
    higher mission priority requires it.

6. Cellular Telephone Funding:
   6.1. In order to purchase a cellular telephone, the requesting unit must receive and file an approval
   document (AF Form 3215) for the phone from the 49th Communications Squadron. All cellular tele-
   phone purchases will be conducted via IMPAC card.
   6.2. To purchase cellular telephone "air time," all units will use IMPAC card. The procedures for pay-
   ing for air time are as follows:
      6.2.1. The unit TCO will receive an invoice (detailing all calls) from the cellular telephone ser-
      vice provider monthly.
      6.2.2. The unit TCO will verify that all calls were government official and that all charges were
      correct. It is the TCO's responsibility to identify and correct any billing discrepancies with the cel-
      lular provider. If any IMPAC purchase is rejected, the TCO or IMPAC cardholder should call the
      49th Contracting Squadron to verify that the cellular telephone numbers are valid and ensure the
      purchase has been authorized. A list of all authorized active cellular telephones on Holloman AFB
      will be maintained by the 49th Communications Squadron and the 49th Contracting Squadron.
      6.2.3. After the invoice has been validated and paid, the TCO will send a copy of the invoice to 49
      CS/SCX by the 15th of each month. If all calls were official, the invoice should include a state-
      ment on it stating that all calls were "Government Official," along with the TCO signature and
      date signed. If there were unofficial calls, they must be identified on the invoice. In addition, the
      TCO should prepare a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, and attach a personal check
      from the responsible party made out to the "US Treasury." The DD Form 1131 will be processed
      through the Accounting and Finance Office, and a copy must be provided to 49 CS/SCX with the
      invoice.
      6.2.4. Once the TCO has verified charges, the TCO will present the cellular telephone bill to a
      pre-arranged unit IMPAC cardholder, who in turn will pay the bill using unit funds via IMPAC
      card.
