The Military Hospitality Alliance sponsors an Annual Inter-Service Enlisted Aide of the Year Award and
the individual with the highest overall score will represent the Air Force in this competition for the same
period.
    3.1. Enlisted Aide Single-aide Quarters Award : Recognizes personnel assigned to quarters where
    the general officer is authorized only one enlisted aide relative to their rank and/or scope of duties per-
    formed (i.e., DCS, MAJCOM Vice, Combatant Deputy, and overseas Wing Commanders), who per-
    formed their military duties in an outstanding manner, provided service to their community and
    demonstrated a commitment to self-improvement.
    3.2. Enlisted Aide Multiple-aide Quarters Award : Recognizes personnel assigned to quarters
    where the General Officer is authorized more than one enlisted aide because of the rank and/or scope
    of duties performed (i.e., CJCS, CSAF, VCSAF, AVCSAF, Combatant & MAJCOM Commanders),
    who performed their military duties in an outstanding manner, provided service to their community
    and demonstrated a commitment to self-improvement.
    3.3. Additionally, the board will select one of the two above winners as the overall winner. This indi-
    vidual will represent the Air Force at inter-service or Department of Defense competitions for the
    same period.

4. Writing the Nomination.
    4.1. General. Use AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, for all nominations. Nominations will be
    one page (front only) and in bullet format. Do not include classified information in the nomination. Do
    not sign the Air Force Form 1206. Do not weigh your nominations down with unnecessary, ineffective
    and flowery language. Direct, hard-hitting, fact-filled, results-oriented nominations get more attention
    and more accurately reflect nominee performance.
       4.1.1. Be specific when giving the timeframe of the accomplishment and do not include accom-
       plishments which occurred outside the nomination period. If another award is formally announced
       and presented during the nomination period, it may be included in the nomination (even if the
       award itself was for accomplishment outside the nomination period). Information should be veri-
       fiable.
       4.1.2. Attachments or continuation sheets are not allowed and will not be considered.
    4.2. Category. Appropriate category per paragraph 3.1. or 3.2. above.
    4.3. Rank/Name of Unit Commander. Indicate general officer making the nomination.
    4.4. Specific Accomplishments. Use the areas listed below as headers for each specific category, and
    show clearly how the nominee performed in each area. (NOTE: Following each heading is the maxi-
    mum point value for that category. DO NOT include the points as part of the headings.) To maximize
    use of space, bullets may begin immediately following the headings:
       4.4.1. Leadership and Job Performance: Describe significant leadership accomplishment and how
       well the member performed assigned primary and additional duties. Define the scope and level of
       responsibilities and the impact on the mission and unit. Include any new initiatives or techniques
       developed by the member, establishment of quality household management and/or effective ser-
       vice delivery system and significant contributions that positively impacted the unit and or
       increased mission effectiveness during the recognition period. Include awards received; e.g., NCO
       of the Quarter, other local and civilian organization recognition and so forth. (60 Points)

       vant training or activity or achievements in professional or cultural societies or associations,

       geant’s Association, Sunday school teacher and so forth. Include contributions (tangible or intan-
       gible) to the professional community/service industry’s welfare, morale, or status. Highlight
