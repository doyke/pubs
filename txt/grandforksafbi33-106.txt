GRANDFORKSAFBI33-106 1 MAY 2004                                                                             9


      3.3.3. The 319 CS/CC will determine if the equipment will be repaired, replaced, or condemned.
      Repair or replacement actions will be at the owning unit’s expense.

4. Operational Procedures.
   4.1. Operator training is the responsibility of the unit commander and is carried out by the com-
   mander's delegate (Unit LMR Manager). The Unit LMR Manager and the unit training section should
   work together to ensure that all unit personnel receive complete customer user education and that
   training is posted in each training record.
   4.2. The following general operating rules will be followed:
      4.2.1. Transmission by radio will be as short and concise as practicable. The use of standard ter-
      minology enhances brevity.
      4.2.2. Transmissions should be clear with natural emphasis on each word and should be spoken in
      natural phrases, not word by word.
      4.2.3. Send only the most essential information; this is even more important during an emergency
      situation. A lack of proper discipline can hamper effective emergency responsiveness.
      4.2.4. To avoid interfering with other traffic, listen to make certain a circuit is clear before making
      any transmission.
      4.2.5. When it is necessary for a station to transmit, to adjust a transmitter or receiver, such signals
      will continue for more than 10 seconds and will be composed of spoken numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.)
      followed by the call sign to the station transmitting the signals.
      4.2.6. Voice call signs will be IAW Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 125f para 104
      when authorized by the net control station.
   4.3. Only personnel who attend equipment operator's education training classes are authorized to
   operate LMR equipment in assigned radio talk groups. Each using organization's LMR equipment
   custodian will monitor and record training.
   4.4. Operators will adhere to procedures prescribed by the Unit LMR Manager and custodian.
   4.5. Basic rules are essential to transmission security and are strictly enforced on all LMR Talk
   Groups. Do not transmit on unauthorized channels. The following practices are specifically forbidden
   on all military radio talk groups:
      4.5.1. Violation of a directed radio silence.
      4.5.2. Unofficial conversation between operators.
      4.5.3. Excessive testing.
      4.5.4. Profane, indecent, or obscene language, which are punishable as Federal criminal offences
      under FCC regulations.
      4.5.5. Transmission of intentional false emergency calls.
      4.5.6. Transmission of classified information.
   4.6. Radio stations will accept, with absolute priority, distress calls and messages regardless of origin.
   Repeat in same manner as received, and immediately take any action(s) as required.

5. Interference.
     5.1. Using organizations will take all possible measures to identify, report, and reduce interference
     incidents. When experiencing interference, attempt to identify the source, if possible. Also identify
     the call sign, time of incident, frequency, type of modulation (e.g., voice, telegraphy) and nature of
     traffic or information, which are the fundamental sources of identity. Report incidents in accordance
     with AFI 10-707, Spectrum Interference Resolution Program and GFAFBI 33-102, Radio Frequency
     Spectrum Management.

6. Radiation Hazards and Safety.
     6.1. Radio Frequency Injury.
        6.1.1. Do not operate a vehicle radio when anyone is within two feet of the antenna. Operators
        inside the vehicle are protected by metal and glass shielding.
        6.1.2. Do not allow the antenna of a portable radio to touch your face or other parts of your body
        while transmitting.
        6.1.3. Do not work within five feet of a base station antenna. Insist operations stop if work must
        be accomplished close to a base station antenna. Base station dispatcher/controllers should warn
        personnel performing building maintenance near the antenna site (such as roof or air cooler
        repair).
     6.2. Safety.
        6.2.1. Only radios certified as intrinsically safe may be used in an explosive atmosphere. All
        non-intrinsically safe radios are capable of igniting in an explosive atmosphere. If you are using a
        non-intrinsically safe radio:
            6.2.1.1. Do not transmit within 50 feet of a possible explosive atmosphere such as a refueling
            operation, gas or fuel spills, open ungrounded containers of flammable substances, or within
            10 feet of wing tank fuel vents on aircraft.
            6.2.1.2. If you smell explosive fumes or see possible sources of explosive fumes, which are
            not being controlled by experienced personnel, report these sources as explosive hazards.
        6.2.2. Electro-explosive devices must be under the control of experienced personnel when not
        secured with electrical safety devices. Do not transmit on any radio within 50 feet of igniters or
        munitions that are electrically ignited, unless they have been secured for operation or safe storage.
        6.2.3. Radios, which are missing cover plates, are capable of causing electrical shock. Secure
        radios with loose or missing covers by removing the power source (unplug power cords from elec-
        trical sources) and report them immediately to the Base PWCS Manager or the 319 CS Mainte-
        nance Control.

7. Base and Unit Pagers.
     7.1. Pager Radio Systems. Pagers are used to improve response capabilities and save time. Pagers
     must be in use on a regular basis or should be turned in for redistribution. Refer to AFI 33-106, Man-
     aging High Frequency Radios, Personal Wireless Communications Systems, and the Military Affiliate
     Radio System, on pager policy.
GRANDFORKSAFBI33-106 1 MAY 2004                                                                        11


  7.2. The central base paging net can be accessed by any telephone. Dial 7-PAGE (7-7243). Wait for
  the voice prompt to enter the pager number then dial the four digit number assigned to the target pager.
  Wait again for the voice prompt to begin speaking for voice pagers or enter the phone number for
  alphanumeric pagers.
  7.3. Alphanumeric pagers can also be accessed via the Base PWCS Web page. The Base PWCS Man-
  ager will guide any work center on installation and operation.
  7.4. Voice pager messages can be heard by several monitoring stations including civilian scanners and
  public media. Do not pass classified/sensitive information or profane language on this net.
  7.5. Pagers are one-way, receive only radios. The pager holder must call in by telephone or report to
  base if they must comment or act on your message.
  7.6. Alert force pagers are similar to central base pagers and are held by the alert crews. The only
  point from which alert force pager messages can be sent is the 319 ARW Command Post.
  7.7. Battery Care and Usage.
     7.7.1. Rechargeable batteries must be kept charged with the battery charger issued with each
     pager set.
     7.7.2. Spare batteries and replacement batteries must be bought by funds from the user’s unit.
     Spare rechargeable batteries are charged in the socket next to the pager socket on the pager charger
     unit.
     7.7.3. Refer to your user booklet to remove and insert batteries in your pager when necessary. If
     no booklet is available, visit the Base PWCS Manager’s office in Building 314 for help. The bat-
     tery door is delicate on most pagers; do not force it open or closed. Be sure batteries are inserted
     with the “+” or “-“ sign up as indicated near or in the battery holder pocket.
  7.8. Pager Maintenance.
     7.8.1. Pagers that have been carelessly broken may require user or unit funding to repair.
     7.8.2. The range of Grand Forks AFB paging system has been increased to a distance of a 20 mile
     radius from the base and an overlapping area which has a radius of 20 miles from a center point on
     US Highway 81 three miles south of 32nd Ave in Grand Forks. There are no known dead spots in
     Grand Forks, and pager reception has been successful as far away as Warren, MN to the east and
     as far west as Larimore, ND. Please report dead spots to the Base PWCS Manager so a record and
     attempt to cure them can be made.
     7.8.3. If your pager functions differently then when it was first received, bring it to the LMR shop
     Bldg 314 for a checkup. Unusual sounds or missed calls, as well as reduced range, are some of the
     reasons to bring your pager in for repair.
     7.8.4. Pagers now cost between $155.00 and $405.00 each. If you no longer need your pager,
     bring it to the Base LMR Manager for redistribution.
  7.9. Base pager operating instructions are located on the Base PWCS Web page.

8. Cellular Telephones.
     8.1. Cellular telephones, with the exception of cellular STU-III or other encrypted cellular telephones,
     will not be used to discuss classified, sensitive, or critical information. Information concerning opera-
     tional missions or any information covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 will not be discussed.
     8.2. Cellular telephones will be used for non-operational requirements only. Standard cellular tele-
     phones are even more susceptible to monitoring than conventional administrative desk-top tele-
     phones; for that reason, all requests for cellular telephones will include a security risk assessment.
     8.3. QAE’s will be required to contact 10% of the customers by using the random sampling. The
     information will be used to complete the customer surveys.
     8.4. Requesting Cellular Telephones.
        8.4.1. The requester will get a quote from the vendor on a selected plan and/or phone, and route
        the paperwork through the following offices: the Unit LMR Manager, Unit Telephone Control
        Officer (TCO), squadron commander, 319 CS/SCX, 319 CS/SCML, 319 CS/CC.
        8.4.2. Requests for cellular telephones will be submitted as prescribed in AFI 33-103, Require-
        ments Development and Processing, using an AF Form 3215 found on the Base PWCS Web page.
        8.4.3. All cellular telephones are required to have a cellular telephone acquisition decision matrix
        on file and will be submitted with the initial request IAW AFI 33-106, Managing High Frequency
        Radios, Personal Wireless Communications Systems, and the Military Affiliate Radio System.
        8.4.4. Users are required to read and sign the Cellular Telephone Users Briefing and Risk Assess-
        ment Form (Attachment 3) when the following actions occur: A new cellular telephone is acti-
        vated, during annual revalidations, and when a cellular telephone is transferred.
        8.4.5. The 319 CS/CC, SCM Flight Commander (319 CS/SCM), 319 CS/SCX, and the PWCS
        Managers from the Communications Squadron would be authorized to provide approval, which
        the vendor would keep on file. This would also give the approving official an opportunity to dou-
        ble-check that the phone being activated is properly accounted for. The 319 CS/CC has final
        approval/disapproval authority.
        8.4.6. The LMR office will notify the requester and 319 CS/SCX of final disposition of the
        request. If the request is approved, the PWCS Manager will finalize the process by placing a call
        to the vendor giving final approval. The requester may obtain the cellular telephone and service
        from the current cellular contractor. All cellular telephone information will be sent to the PWCS
        office.
     8.5. Cellular telephones are for official use only. Personal calls placed on or received by cellular tele-
     phones for the sake of personal convenience cost the government money, in addition to the airtime
     charges. Cellular telephones are prohibited for TDY use unless prior authorization is received from
     your Squadron CC. The user will reimburse all long distance charges incurred. An occasional personal
     call on a cell phone is justified under some circumstances. However, you must reimburse the govern-
     ment for personal calls that cause the cellular phone bill to exceed its monthly-allotted usage charge.
     See AFI 33-111, Telephone Systems Management, for further guidance.
     8.6. The Unit TCO will validate cellular phone bills. The TCO will ensure compliance with directives
     for the legal operation of cellular telephones by verifying all incoming and outgoing calls are offical.
GRANDFORKSAFBI33-106 1 MAY 2004                                                                           13


  The TCO will sign the certifying statement, and have the squadron commander initial the review
  block. After confirmation, the TCO will submit the bill to the squadron resource advisor for payment.
  8.7. The Cell Phone Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE), Contracting, or other designated represen-
  tatives should conduct random periodic audits to ensure the records are being maintained. Failure to
  do so may result in the squadron receiving a warning to suspension of cellular phone service
  8.8. Cellular telephones should not be solely relied upon for performing critical tasks due to the frag-
  ile nature of the cellular system. We recommend users have a back-up communications plans to ensure
  communications are not totally lost during a crisis. Commercial cellular telephone sites are not under
  Air Force control. The Air Force is like any other customer of the service provider in that it is subject
  to the policies of the said provider. Cellular services are easily disrupted from service by acts of van-
  dalism, terrorism or natural disasters such as tornadoes and thunderstorms. In addition, cellular ser-
  vice often becomes unreliable during peak periods of use.
  8.9. Revalidation of cellular telephones.
     8.9.1. Annual revalidation of cellular telephones will be conducted as required by AFI 33-106,
     Managing High Frequency Radios, Personal Wireless Communications Systems, and the Military
     Affiliate Radio System. The intent of the revalidation is to ensure the user still has a verifiable need
     for continued use of the cellular telephone.
     8.9.2. The Base PWCS Manger will send a list of cellular telephone assets maintained by each
     unit to that unit’s LMR manager.
     8.9.3. The Unit LMR Manager will revalidate the requirement for each cellular telephone by
     using the Cellular Telephone Revalidation Form located on the PWCS Web page. The revalidation
     will be sent to 319 CS/SCML no later than 30 days after receipt of the cellular telephone asset list.
     8.9.4. The Base PWCS manager will summarize the data. If the Base PWCS Manager determines
     that the customer no longer has a justifiable need for continued use of the cellular telephone, the
     Base PWCS Manager will recommend turn-in or transfer of the equipment to another customer
     with a validated requirement. The report will be routed IAW para. 8.3.4. of this instruction.
  8.10. Temporary Issue of Cellular Telephones.
     8.10.1. The LMR office maintains a limited number of cellular telephones for temporary issue.
     8.10.2. Requests for temporary issue of cellular telephones, up to 10 days, will be in writing and
     signed by the requesting unit’s commander. Request for temporary issue of cellular telephones, 11
     to 30 days, will be in writing and signed by the requesting unit’s group commander. The letter may
     be sent to 319 CS/SCML or taken directly to the LMR office at Building 314. The letter will
     include, at a minimum:
         8.10.2.1. Dates the cellular telephone will be required.
         8.10.2.2. Location the cellular telephone will be used.
         8.10.2.3. A summary of how the cellular telephone will be used, type of information that will
         be transmitted, and name of the person or work center that will be using the cellular telephone.
         8.10.2.4. A statement that the cellular telephone will not be used to transmit classified, sensi-
         tive, or critical information, or any information covered by the Privacy Act of 1974; and use
         will be restricted to nonoperational requirements only.

        8.10.3. A one-time letter may be submitted, by the unit commander, for offices with recurring
        requirements. This letter will include the information in paragraphs 8.8.2.1 thru 8.8.2.4, and list
        personnel authorized to request and pickup the cellular telephones. The personnel authorized to
        request the cellular telephones must still complete a letter listing the items in paragraphs 8.3.2. and
        8.3.3.
     8.11. Personnel are required to log all incoming and outgoing calls on an AF Form 1072, Authorized
     Long Distance Telephone Calls

                                         AND
                                   RISK ASSESSMENT


The weak signal used in cellular telephone systems is very susceptible to jamming, intrusion, and
interference. Although FCC regulations specifically prohibit monitoring cellular telephone frequencies in
the CONUS, many inexpensive devices are available on the open market for this activity.
Cellular telephone system infrastructures are owned by civilian companies who can monitor, turn off, or
modify their systems or parts of their systems without user knowledge or coordination.
Standard cellular telephones are even more susceptible to monitoring than conventional administrative desk
top telephones. For that reason, cellular telephones, with the exception of cellular STU-III or other
encrypted cellular telephones will not be used to discuss classified information. Care should be taken when
discussing sensitive unclassified, critical information, or information concerning operational missions. The
privacy of individuals should be considered before discussing Privacy Act information over cellular
telephones.
This briefing is directed by an AIA, (Air Intelligence Agency) message dated 17 Mar 94.
I HAVE READ THE ABOVE AND AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:
The cellular telephone assigned to me is for authorized use only. I will not discuss, transfer, process, or
transmit classified information. Use of this telecommunications system/device constitutes consent to
monitoring.

                 CELLULAR TELEPHONE ACQUISITION DECISION MATRIX


1. Does the requirement document specify that the primary use is for Command & Control
Communications? (If “YES,” look for a technical solution other than a cellular telephone. If “NO,”
proceed to the next paragraph.)
2. Does the requirement document identify a need for transmission/reception of Classified, or Sensitive
Unclassified Information in a mobile environment? (If “YES,” look at a portable/mobile STU-III
technical solution rather than a conventional cellular instrument. If “NO,” proceed to the next
paragraph.)
3. Does satisfaction of this requirement with a cellular telephone result in the net reduction in the number
of LMRs or pagers in use on the base? (If “YES,” examine paragraphs 4., and 5. If “NO,” proceed to
paragraph 6.)
4. Does the requirement document identify a mission that was previously satisfied by an LMR or pager?
(If “YES,”, proceed to paragraph 5. If “NO,” proceed to paragraph 6.)
5. What aspect of the original mission has changed, which makes the continued use of LMR or pagers
unworkable? (If the requirement is essentially the same as before and convenience is the primary reason
for the request, acquisition of a cellular telephone is not warranted. If there is a substantial change to the
mission, proceed to paragraph 6.)
6. Is there a serious mission degradation, failure, or life and death impact not previously present that you
cannot meet through the use of LMRs or pagers? (If “YES,” consider the applicability of cellular
