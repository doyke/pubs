2.1. 80th Operations Support Squadron Office of Student Training (80 OSS/OST) will:

    2.1.1. Ensure display of the US, NATO, and all foreign national flags are accomplished at
    0730 Monday through Friday.

    2.1.2. Ensure a schedule is developed for flag raising/lowering detail each duty day.

2.2. Wing Command Section or 80 FTW Protocol will:

    2.2.1. Notify 80 OSS/OST if a flag should fly at half-staff.

2.4. Military Training Officer will:

    2.4.1. Ensure assigned personnel are attending flag lowering detail.

3. PROCEDURES.

3.1. Flags are stored in 80th Flying Training Wing Command Section when not in use.

3. 2. When raising the flags, the following procedures will be followed:

    3.2.1 When all flags are being flown, the US flag will always be raised first. The foreign
    national flags will be raised briskly in alphabetical order using the English alphabet (per AFI
    34-1201) and the NATO flag will be raised last IAW Attachment 2.

    3.2.2 When raising the US flag, the detail will march to the flagstaff, halt, and attach flag to
    the halyards. When the wind is blowing, individuals should position themselves with their
    backs against the wind to raise the flag. One individual will face the flagstaff to hoist the
    flag, while the other holds the flag until it is hoisted clear of the grasp. At this time the
    individual comes to attention and executes present arms.

    3.2.3 After the US flag has been hoisted, the individual raising the flag will execute present
    arms and the senior member will command order arms. The individuals will then continue to
    hoist the other foreign national flags in the proper alphabetical order by country.

3.3. When a flag is flown at half-staff, other flags will not be flown.

    3.3.1. When flown at half-staff, the flag is first hoisted briskly to the peak and then lowered
    slowly to the half-staff position. At the end of the day, raise the flag briskly to the peak
    before lowering slowly.

    3.3.2. The flag will be flown on its country’s designated pole.

3.4. Flag lowering procedures:

    3.4.1. The US flag will always be lowered last.
80FTWI34-1201 23 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                      3


   3.4.2. The US flag will be lowered simultaneously with 82 TRW retreat and a minimum of
   two individuals is required.

   3.4.3. The playing of the National Anthem will signal retreat and the following procedures
   will be followed:

        3.4.3.1. The designated officer will march with the assigned member(s) to the flagstaff;
        face the flight line, and order, “Parade Rest.” Upon the sounding of retreat, both
        individuals will come to attention, proceed to their positions at the base of the flagstaff
        and arrange the halyards for proper lowering of the flag.

        3.4.3.2. Upon the first note of the National Anthem, the senior member will execute
        present arms and the junior member will lower the flag slowly and with dignity. The
        senior member will hold his salute until the flag has reached the area of the grasps and,
        at this time, he/she will ensure the flag does not dip below the grasps. The flag will be
        completely lowered simultaneously with the ending of the last note during the National
        Anthem.

        3.4.3.3. At this time, the flag detail will secure the halyards and the individuals will
        remain outside, weather permitting, to fold the flag IAW Attachment 2. Once flag is
        folded, the senior member will hold the flag and the flag detail will march back to the
        wing headquarters building.

   3.4.4. All personnel, military and civilian, will pay proper respect to the flag during retreat
   and the folding ceremony. Personnel observing from their automobiles will not drive, but
   will remain seated in their automobiles until the ceremony’s completion.

        3.4.4.1. During the sounding of retreat, members walking will halt and assume the
        position of parade rest. On the first note of the US national anthem, members will
        assume the position of attention and present arms.

        3.4.4.2. Members not in formation and within 25 paces of the flag folding detail will
        halt and assume the position of attention until the US flag is completely folded and
        secured.

4. MISCELLANEOUS:

4.1. Inclement weather procedures:

   4.1.1. Flags will be lowered when forecast projects brief or heavy periods of precipitation
   and/or high winds to exceed 25 knots. If weather improves, 80 OSS/OST maintains
   responsibility of raising the flags, but may enlist the help of others.

4.3. The responsible military commander shall ensure the procedures for flying the ENJJPT

    Training Wing Commander.
