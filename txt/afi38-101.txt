SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization

By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum immediately
changes AFI 38-101. Compliance with the Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its
directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in
accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

The Chief of Staff of the Air Force approved specialized organizational size guidance for the Air
Reserve Components (ARC). In advance of a rewrite of AFI 38-101, the attachment to this
Memorandum provides guidance changes that are effectively immediately. An asterisk (*)
indicates newly revised material.

This Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from its date, or upon incorporation
by interim change to, or rewrite to AFI 38-101, whichever occurs sooner.

*(Add New) 2.2.13.2.4. This additional specialized guidance applies to ANG and AFRC units.
The use of standard wing/group organization structures in the Air Reserve Components (ARC)
enhances their ability to transition smoothly to the expeditionary environment and interface with
active duty forces, although ARC wings and groups are often smaller due to factors such as a
more experienced work force with a smaller trainee population, fewer aircraft at a location, and
smaller installation support infrastructure. ARC units follow standard unit size and
organizational guidance in all other respects, except:

    *(Add New) 2.2.13.2.4.1. Specialized adjusted population minimums for ANG and AFRC
    units are 750 for wings and 200 for groups.

    *(Add New) 2.2.13.2.4.2. An ANG or AFRC wing with other dependent groups may have an
    operations group if it has at least one operations squadron reflected in the Force tabs or is an
    associate squadron, plus at least one other unit (e.g., operations support squadron). This is
    similar to the guidance for active duty operations groups but reflects that many ARC wings
    have only one flying unit.

    *(Add New) 2.2.13.2.4.3. Adjusted populations for ANG units may include a percentage of
    the state employees. This recognizes the contribution of state employees while reflecting the
    differing roles and supervisory aspects.

       *(Add New) 2.2.13.2.4.3.1. Specifically, one-third of the state employees for a unit may
       be counted when the state employee portion counts for no more than 30% of the adjusted
       population used to meet unit size minimums. In other words, before state employees may
       be considered, adjusted populations (excluding CMEs) must be at least 525 for wings,
       140 for groups and 25 for squadrons.

       *(Add New) 2.2.13.2.4.3.2. CMEs are excluded from the adjusted population when
       assessing if the state employee portion counts for no more than 30% to ensure units are
       made up predominantly of assets directly associated with USAF. The specified
       percentages of state employees and CMEs may be included in the final total adjusted
       population if the minimums have been met.

                                             Chapter 1

             AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPLES AND
                             RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Organization Objectives. Air Force organizations are designed to achieve the
characteristics outlined in AFPD 38-1.
1.2. Organization Principles. Air Force organizational structure follows these management
principles:
     1.2.1. Emphasis on Wartime Tasks. Organizations must be structured to accomplish wartime
     tasks without reorganizing.
     1.2.2. Functional Grouping. Organizations have these characteristics: a clear-cut purpose,
     goal and scope, with one individual in charge; parts that form a logical, separable activity; a
     close relationship among the parts, constituting a complete entity; and natural divisions of
     work that clearly define where responsibility begins and ends.
     1.2.3. Lean Organizational Structures. Organizations must encourage rapid decision making,
     so they should be flat structures without intermediate levels, unless mission requirements
     cannot otherwise be met. When used, intermediate organizations will consist of tactical
     functions only, without a full range of staff functions. Organizational levels that exist only to
     review and transmit information or tasking should be eliminated. Both the number of
     supervisors and the number of internal subdivisions within organizations should be designed
     to minimize layers and maximize worker-to-supervisor ratios.
     1.2.4. Skip-Echelon Structure. Major commands (MAJCOM) sit on top of a skip-echelon
     staffing structure. MAJCOMs, wings and squadrons possess the full range of staff functions
     needed to perform required tasks. Numbered/named air forces (NAF), groups and flights
     have no or minimal staff. These tactical echelons are designed to increase operational
     effectiveness rather than to review and transmit paperwork. The chain of command and
     responsibility for mission accomplishment runs through commanders at all levels. Problems,
     however, often are solved by staff communication through the functional chain, bypassing
     echelons where the function is not found. (NOTE: Component NAFs (C-NAFs) possess a
     broader staff to support the Air Force component commander; see paragraph 2.2.5.2 and
     Figure 3.2).
     1.2.5. Standard Levels. The Air Force uses the standard levels described in Chapter 2 to
     design organizations. Establish organizations at the lowest level required to successfully
     accomplish the primary mission. Factors such as scope of responsibility, span of control and
     functional grouping of related missions/activities are the predominant factors that determine
     organizational type.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                          7



1.3. Responsibilities Assigned:
   1.3.1. Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF) and the MAJCOMs, field operating agencies
   (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU) work toward meeting Air Force organizational
   goals. The Director of Manpower, Organization and Resources (AF/A1M) is responsible for
   leading and monitoring progress. HQ USAF functional chiefs give assistance in their
   functional areas.
   1.3.2. AF/A1M is responsible for the administrative control of all units in the Air Force. It
   publishes Department of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) letters, which are the legal authority for a
   unit and authorize such actions as unit activations, redesignations and inactivations.
   1.3.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must follow the organizational procedures and standard
   structures described herein. A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU must have AF/A1M approval to
   deviate from a standard structure and to activate, redesignate, or inactivate units (see
   Chapter 6 for procedures).
   1.3.4. Individual unit commanders must use the standard organizational structures found in
   this Instruction. If a unit's unique mission or location requires a different structure, a waiver
   to the standard structure can be obtained using the organizational change procedures found in
   Chapter 6. Units work with their servicing Manpower and Organization activity on such
   requests (for most field units, this activity is in the Manpower and Personnel Flight of the
   base Force Support Squadron).
 8                                                                    AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


                                              Chapter 2

  STANDARD LEVELS OF AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION & ASSOCIATED TERMS

 NOTE: ( See Chapter 4 for related terminology and procedures.)
2.1. Organizational Entities. The Air Force is comprised of establishments, units, and
nonunits.
     2.1.1. Establishment. An organizational entity consisting of a headquarters unit and its
     subordinate units. The name of the establishment is in the name of the headquarters unit. For
     example, Air Mobility Command (AMC) is an establishment; HQ AMC is its headquarters.
     Subordinate units are assigned to the establishment and not to the headquarters unit.
        2.1.1.1. A group with subordinate squadrons is generally the lowest-level establishment.
        Lower-level establishments are assigned to higher-level ones; for example: groups to
        wings, wings to NAFs, NAFs to MAJCOMs, MAJCOMs to HQ USAF. This
        arrangement (units reporting to establishments, subordinate establishments to superior
        ones) sets up the chain of command, through which all control and accountability flow.
        2.1.1.2. Establishments facilitate organizational actions. For example, the reassignment
        of a wing (establishment) from one NAF to another automatically reassigns the wing's
        subordinate units.
     2.1.2. Unit. A military organization constituted by HQ USAF or designated by a MAJCOM,
     FOA or DRU (for provisional units only). A unit is either named or numbered.
        2.1.2.1. A unit helps provide for an unbroken chain of command since military personnel
        must be assigned to a unit at all times. Normally, a unit having military members will
        have an officer designated as its commander. A civilian may lead a unit in approved
        circumstances, and provide supervision to military and civilian personnel in the unit.
        Appointment of a civilian to lead a unit designates that unit as civilian-led. When a
        civilian is appointed to lead a unit, that individual will be the director of that unit. (In the
        case of a civilian-led unit, the chain of command is maintained by having it reside with
        the first military unit commander above the civilian-led unit.)
            2.1.2.1.1. Civilians cannot assume military command or exercise command over
            military members within the unit. Units designated to be led by directors will not
            have commanders and alternative arrangements for functions which must be
            performed by a commander will be required (see AFI 51-604, Appointment to and
            Assumption of Command). A civilian director of a unit is authorized to perform all
            functions normally performed by a unit commander except as restricted by law (e.g.,
            Uniform Code of Military Justice) or DoD Issuance (DoD Directive, DoD Instruction,
            etc.). For guidance concerning whether an authority or action is explicitly reserved
            for military commanders, contact the local staff judge advocate.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                      9


     2.1.2.2. The following terms apply to a unit:
        2.1.2.2.1. Active Unit. A major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency
        (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) constituted and activated by Headquarters US
        Air Force (HQ USAF); or a subordinate unit constituted by HQ USAF, assigned to a
        MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU and activated by special order.
        2.1.2.2.2. Inactive Unit. A unit constituted by Headquarters US Air Force but not yet
        activated or a unit constituted, activated and subsequently, inactivated.
        2.1.2.2.3. Disbanded Unit. A unit whose legal authority for existence is withdrawn
        by Headquarters US Air Force. Its designation is retired and preserved in historical
        records.
        2.1.2.2.4. Parent Unit. An organization that directly administers units, detachments,
        or operating locations assigned to it.
        2.1.2.2.5. Provisional Unit. A temporary unit organized to perform a specific task.
        (See Chapter 8 for guidance on provisional units.)
        2.1.2.2.6. Attached Unit. A unit, or part of a unit, placed under the control of another
        organization for a specific purpose such as operational control, administrative control,
        or logistic support. It is still assigned to the parent unit.
        2.1.2.2.7. Detached Unit. A unit serving away from its organization of assignment. It
        may function independently, or may be attached to another organization.
        2.1.2.2.8. Primary Subordinate Unit (PSU). A unit that performs part or all of the
        primary mission of the organization to which it is assigned. The unit reports to the
        commander of the parent organization and has full authority to execute its assigned
        mission. A PSU’s purpose is to perform part of its parent organization’s main
        mission and not to provide support functions for its parent headquarters. Under a
        MAJCOM, examples include NAFs, Air University (AETC) and the Air Force Global
        Logistics Support Center (AFMC). Similarly, under a wing, squadrons are PSUs of
        their group and the groups are PSUs of the wing.
  2.1.3. Nonunit. An organizational entity that is not constituted by Headquarters US Air
  Force as a unit.
     2.1.3.1. The following terms apply to a nonunit:
        2.1.3.1.1. Named Activity. A part of a unit whose mission can be identified better by
        assigning it a definitive name (for example, the Civil Engineer School is part of a
        unit, the Air Force Institute of Technology). Headquarters US Air Force is
        responsible for administrative control of named activities and authorizes them by
        issuing DAF/A1M letters.
        2.1.3.1.2. Detachment. Part of a unit that is separated geographically from its parent
        unit. Although not a unit for organizational purposes, if a commissioned officer is
        assigned and appointed on orders as a commander, the commander has nonjudicial
        punishment authority under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) unless
        withheld by superior competent authority.
 10                                                              AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


          2.1.3.1.3. Operating Location. Part of a unit that is separated geographically from its
          parent unit. It is used to account for personnel by location. Personnel remain assigned
          to the parent unit. An operating location has none of the administrative attributes of a
          unit and does not have nonjudicial punishment authority under the UCMJ.
          2.1.3.1.4. Squadron Section. A function responsible for the administrative control of
          all members assigned to a unit. A squadron section is created by appointing a section
          commander on special orders in accordance with guidance in AFI 51-604. A
          squadron section commander has nonjudicial punishment authority under the UCMJ
          unless withheld by superior competent authority. Section commanders at other
          organizational levels may use a term reflecting their unit level, e.g., Group Section
          Commander, etc.
          2.1.3.1.5. Air Force Element. The nomenclature used to account for manpower
          authorizations and to identify Air Force personnel on duty with organizations outside
          the Air Force, such as defense agencies, defense field activities and Air National
          Guard units not in federal service. Although not a unit for organizational purposes, an
          element may function as a unit if so designated by competent authority, an eligible
          commissioned officer either assumes command or is appointed to command and Air
          Force members are assigned or attached to the element (see paragraph 4.3.3.5).
2.2. Standard Levels of Air Force Organization. The following standard levels of
organization are used in structuring and designating Air Force units:
   2.2.1. Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF). The senior headquarters of the Air Force,
   consisting of two major entities: the Secretariat (including the Secretary of the Air Force and
   the Secretary's principal staff) and the Air Staff, headed by the Chief of Staff.
   2.2.2. Major Command (MAJCOM). A major subdivision of the Air Force that is assigned a
   major part of the Air Force mission. A MAJCOM is directly subordinate to Headquarters US
   Air Force. Most MAJCOMs have the word Command as part of their designation;
   Command should not be used in the designation of any unit that is not a MAJCOM.
   MAJCOM headquarters are management headquarters and thus have the full range of
   functional staff. MAJCOMs, in turn, may be subdivided according to either of the
   organizational schemes shown in Figure 2.1. The levels are in descending order and
   represent levels of assignment. For example, a group may be assigned to any organization
   listed above it, but a group may not be assigned to another group or to a squadron. The terms
   below ―Center‖ represent internal staff structure and are not units as defined in paragraph
   2.1.2.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                     11

*Limited Use
         2.2.2.1. Lead MAJCOM. A type of MAJCOM that consolidates responsibilities for a
         particular function in a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire Air Force as applicable.
         For example, Air Education and Training Command is the Lead MAJCOM for education
         and training.
         2.2.2.2. Component MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM). A type of MAJCOM that is the USAF
         component to a Unified Combatant Command. For example, Pacific Air Forces
         (PACAF) is a C-MAJCOM that is the USAF component to United States Pacific
         Command (USPACOM). A C-MAJCOM is commanded by the Commander of Air
         Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and includes supporting staff, one or more CNAFs (through
         which it presents its forces to the Combatant Commander (CCDR)), and all assigned and
         attached forces. The C-MAJCOM integrates, at the strategic level, component activities
         across all phases of conflict. The C-MAJCOM staff should not duplicate the functions of
         the C-NAF AFFOR staff or AOC (see Figure 3.2). The C-MAJCOM commander is the
         CCDR’s theater COMAFFOR and may function as a theater Joint Force Air and Space
         Component Commander (JFACC) when required. Refer to AFDD2, Operations and
         Organization, for additional information on component relationships and roles. NOTE:
         A MAJCOM can be both a C-MAJCOM and a Lead MAJCOM.
   2.2.3. Direct Reporting Unit (DRU). A subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to
   the Chief of Staff, US Air Force. A DRU performs a mission that does not fit into any of the
   MAJCOMs. A DRU has many of the same administrative and organizational responsibilities
   as a MAJCOM.
         2.2.3.1. Major Command Direct Reporting Unit (MAJCOM DRU). DRU also applies to
         a subdivision of a MAJCOM. A MAJCOM DRU reports directly to the MAJCOM
         commander and performs a mission that does not fit into any of the MAJCOM's primary
         subordinate units.
 12                                                              AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


(NOTE: See paragraph 6.2.4. for additional guidance on establishment of DRUs or MAJCOM
DRUs.)
   2.2.4. Field Operating Agency (FOA). A subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate
   to a Headquarters US Air Force functional manager. A FOA performs field activities beyond
   the scope of any of the major commands. The activities are specialized or associated with an
   Air Force-wide mission and do not include functions performed in management
   headquarters, unless specifically directed by a DoD authority. Air Force FOAs usually have
   the word Agency as part of their designation; Agency should not be used in the designation
   of any unit that is not a FOA directly under HQ USAF. NOTE: Organization guidance for
   MAJCOMs also applies to the large Air Force FOAs that are structured along MAJCOM
   lines, e.g., Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA).
      2.2.4.1. Major Command Field Operating Agency (MAJCOM FOA). FOA also applies
      to a subdivision of a MAJCOM. A MAJCOM FOA reports directly to a MAJCOM
      functional manager and performs specialized field activities beyond the scope of any of
      the MAJCOM's primary subordinate units. The activities are specialized and are
      associated with MAJCOM or theater-wide missions that transcend the scope of routine
      wing functions. FOA activities do not include functions performed in management
      headquarters unless specifically directed by DoD authority. (NOTE: See paragraph
      6.2.4 for additional guidance on establishment of FOAs or MAJCOM FOAs.)
   2.2.5. Numbered/Named Air Force (NAF). A level of command directly under a MAJCOM.
   NAFs provide operational leadership and supervision. A NAF is assigned subordinate units,
   such as wings, groups and squadrons. They do not have complete functional staffs. They are
   not management headquarters (unless specifically directed by a DoD authority).
      2.2.5.1. NAFs designated as component NAFs (C-NAF) support the Air Force
      component commander (COMAFFOR) at the operational and tactical level. When
      designated as the Air Force component to a Unified Combatant Command (UCC), the
      component NAF will function at the strategic, operational and tactical level. A C-NAF is
      authorized a broader staff as depicted in Figure 3.2.
      2.2.5.2. The number of persons assigned to a NAF headquarters varies from case to case,
      but, with the exception of C-NAFs, should not exceed 99 manpower authorizations
      without an approved waiver from AF/A1M. The size of the C-NAF headquarters staff is
      not limited to 99 manpower authorizations.
   2.2.6. Wing. A level of command below the NAF or higher headquarters. A wing has a
   distinct mission with significant scope. A wing is usually composed of a primary mission
   group (e.g., operations, training) and the necessary supporting groups. By pulling together
   the mission and support elements, a wing provides a significant capability under a single
   commander. It is often responsible for maintaining the installation. A wing has several
   squadrons in more than one dependent group. Wings will have a minimum adjusted
   population of at least 1000 per paragraph 2.2.13. A wing may be either an operational
   wing, an air base wing, or a specialized mission wing.
      2.2.6.1. Operational Wing. A wing that has an operations group and related operational
      mission activity assigned to it. When an operational wing performs the primary mission
      of the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                      13


     capable of self-support in functional areas like maintenance, supply and conventional
     munitions, as needed. When an operational wing is a tenant organization, the host
     organization provides it with varying degrees of base and logistics support.
     2.2.6.2. Air Base Wing. A wing that performs a support rather than an operational
     mission. It maintains and operates a base. An air base wing sometimes provides
     functional support to a MAJCOM headquarters.
     2.2.6.3. Specialized Mission Wing. A wing that performs a specialized mission and
     usually does not have aircraft or missiles assigned to it. For example, intelligence,
     surveillance and reconnaissance wing; training wing and so on. This wing may be either a
     host wing or a tenant wing, depending on whether it maintains and operates the base.
  2.2.7. Group. A level of command between wings and squadrons. Groups bring together
  multiple squadrons or other lower echelon units to provide a broader capability. For instance,
  a mission support group pulls together several squadrons in a variety of areas to provide a
  full spectrum mission support capability. A group is generally a tactical echelon without
  significant staff support. A group has two or more subordinate units. Groups will have a
  minimum adjusted population of at least 400 per paragraph 2.2.13.
     2.2.7.1. Dependent Group. A dependent group is a mission, maintenance, mission
     support, medical, or large functional unit (e.g., communications) that encompasses a
     number of related squadrons to provide the specified capability to a parent wing. Such
     groups may possess small supporting staff elements, such as standardization and
     evaluation or quality control, that are organized as sections.
     2.2.7.2. Independent Group. An independent group has the same functions and
     responsibilities as a like-type wing but its scope and size do not warrant wing-level
     designation and associated overhead costs.
  2.2.8. Squadron. The basic unit in the Air Force. Squadrons are the basic ―building block‖
  organizations in the Air Force, providing a specific operational or support capability. A
  squadron may be either a mission unit, such as an operational flying squadron, or a functional
  unit, such as a civil engineer, security forces, or maintenance squadron. A squadron has a
  substantive mission of its own that warrants organization as a separate unit based on factors
  like unity of command, functional grouping and administrative control, balanced with
  efficient use of resources. Squadrons vary in size according to responsibility, but will have a
  minimum adjusted population of at least 35 per paragraph 2.2.13. Do not fragment a
  capability into multiple squadrons when a single squadron provides a parent wing or group
  commander the best approach in terms of a coordinated, focused capability under single
  direction. In extreme cases, when squadron population exceeds 700 manpower
  authorizations, MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs may request establishment of two squadrons.
  Functional squadrons will employ the 7-series numbering convention in these instances; i.e.,
  ―XX‖ and ―7XX‖ Squadrons.
  2.2.9. Flight. If internal subdivision is required, a flight may consist of sections, then
  elements. A flight may be either a numbered flight, named flight, alpha flight, or a functional
  flight.
14                                                               AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


     2.2.9.1. Numbered/Named Flight. The lowest level unit in the Air Force. A numbered or
     named flight primarily incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit that is
     established by a DAF/A1M letter. Its administrative characteristics, such as strength
     reporting, are like those of a squadron. Functions requiring unit status that are not large
     enough to be squadrons may be considered for numbered/named flight level. Because a
     numbered/named flight is a unit, it must be assigned to an establishment at group level or
     higher rather than to a squadron. EXAMPLES: 497th Combat Training Flight, Air
     Mobility Command Contracting Flight.
     2.2.9.2. Alpha Flight. Part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and composed of
     several elements performing identical missions. Because an alpha flight is not a unit, it is
     not subject to unit reporting. EXAMPLE: A Flight in an operations squadron.
     2.2.9.3. Functional Flight. Usually part of a squadron and composed of elements
     performing specific missions. Because a functional flight is not a unit, it is not subject to
     unit reporting. EXAMPLE: Manpower and Personnel Flight in a force support
     squadron.
  2.2.10. Center. A named unit that performs a specialized mission. A primary characteristic is
  that it performs most of its mission within a large complex at one location; for example, air
  logistics centers and test centers. Usually, it has only a few subordinate units.
  2.2.11. Laboratory. An organization that performs a research or advanced development
  mission.
  2.2.12. Region. A term sometimes used when organization is geographic.
  2.2.13. Organization Size Guidance for Wings, Groups and Squadrons.
     2.2.13.1. Adjusted population minimums are 1000 for wings, 400 for groups and 35 for
     squadrons. Adjusted populations include:
         2.2.13.1.1. Manpower authorizations as reflected in the Manpower Programming and
         Execution System (MPES).
         2.2.13.1.2. Average daily student load (ADSL) or, for the USAF Academy, cadets.
         For the purpose of figuring adjusted populations for this AFI:
         ADSL = (Course Days x Total Students) divided by Training Days per Year
         2.2.13.1.3. A percentage of the contractor workforce. Specifically, one-third of the
         Contract Manyear Equivalents (CME) reflected in MPES for a unit may be counted
         when:
             2.2.13.1.3.1. The CME portion counts for no more than 30% of the adjusted
             population used to meet unit size minimums. In other words, before CMEs may
             be considered, adjusted populations must be at least 700 for wings, 280 for groups
             and 25 for squadrons.
             2.2.13.1.3.2. The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative resides in the
             unit. (Also referred to as Contracting Officer’s Representative. For more
             information see AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program; the Federal
             Acquisition Regulation; and the Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement.)
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                         15


             2.2.13.1.3.3. This guidance recognizes the role of contractors in mission
             accomplishment while reflecting the reduced supervisory responsibilities. It also
             ensures USAF units are made up of predominantly USAF assets.
      2.2.13.2. Additional specialized guidance:
         2.2.13.2.1. A unit reflected as a squadron in the Force Tabs may maintain its
         squadron status regardless of size. (The Force Tabs are maintained by AF/A8P as
         part of the Program Data System per AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming,
         Assignment, Distribution, Accounting and Termination.)
         2.2.13.2.2. A wing with other dependent groups may have an operations group if it
         has multiple squadrons reflected in the Force Tabs, regardless of the operations
         group’s size.
         2.2.13.2.3. An Associate unit may be a squadron if the unit whose weapons system(s)
         it shares is a squadron. Refer to AFPD 90-10, Total Force Integration Policy, for
         descriptions of Associate units.
      2.2.13.3. MAJCOM/A1Ms will monitor unit sizes on an ongoing basis to ensure units
      are named and organized per the guidance in this Instruction.
      2.2.13.4. AF/A1M will review wing, group and squadron sizes every two years to ensure
      compliance with organization size guidance.
      2.2.13.5. Expeditionary Units. MAJCOMs should strive to organize expeditionary units
      per the organization size guidance but may authorize variances when necessary due to
      factors such as operational needs, relationships with other Service or coalition forces, or
      to avoid turbulence due to population fluctuations. (See Chapter 8 for general guidance
      on provisional units.)
2.3. Standard Elements of Air Force Organization. The following terms describe the
organizational elements within command and staff functions.
   2.3.1. Command:
      2.3.1.1. Commander. An officer who occupies a position of command pursuant to orders
      of appointment or by assumption of command according to AFI 51-604. This
      designation is used in all Air Force units except:
         2.3.1.1.1. US Air Force Academy, which is commanded by a superintendent
         2.3.1.1.2. School organizations, which are commanded by commandants.
         2.3.1.1.2. A unit with a civilian leader. When a civilian is appointed to lead a unit,
         that individual will be the director of the unit. A unit designated to be led by a civilian
         director will not have a commander, section commander or detachment commander.
         (NOTE: Internal functional flight heads using the duty title of ―flight commander‖
         may continue to use this title since they are not unit commanders with commensurate
         legal command authority.)
16                                                       AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


     2.3.1.1.2.1. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU headquarters may approve designation of a
     unit to be led by a civilian director instead of a military commander subject to the
     restrictions within this AFI or other applicable guidance. HQ USAF approval
     under the waiver process in this AFI is required for approval under any other
     circumstances.
     2.3.1.1.2.2. Civilian unit directors must be full-time Department of the Air Force
     appropriated fund employees who have completed any applicable probationary
     periods. Civilian unit directors must be United States citizens.
     2.3.1.1.2.3. A unit will not have a civilian unit director and must have a military
     commander if:
        2.3.1.1.2.3.1. The unit is committed as a unit to a combat mission or to fill a
        mobility requirement.
        2.3.1.1.2.3.2. The unit or an organization subordinate to the unit has a flying
        mission.
        2.3.1.1.2.3.3. The unit has a medical mission.
        2.3.1.1.2.3.4. The unit is above wing level. (This restriction does not apply to
        Air Force FOA and MAJCOM FOA headquarters units.)
        2.3.1.1.2.3.5. The unit is one whose leader would normally function as an
        installation commander.
        2.3.1.1.2.3.6. The unit is an expeditionary or provisional unit.
        2.3.1.1.2.3.7. The unit is in the Air Force Reserve Command or Air National
        Guard. (This restriction does not limit traditional Reserve and ANG
        Technician arrangements.)
     2.3.1.1.2.4. Since civilians cannot assume military command or exercise
     command over military members, and no member of the unit or subordinate unit
     can assume command of the unit, prior designation of a successor to leadership of
     the unit, in the event the civilian leader is incapacitated, should be made. Refer to
     AFI 51-604 for guidance on military justice and command authority matters for
     units led by civilian directors.
     2.3.1.1.2.5. Civilian unit leaders will use an Office Symbol Code (OSC) of CL,
     Civilian Unit Leader. Civilian unit leaders will not use the title Commander nor
     an OSC of CC (Commander).
        2.3.1.1.2.5.1. Since units with civilian leaders do not have commanders, the
        titles and OSCs for Vice Commander (CV) and Deputy Commander (CD)
        cannot be used for either military or civilian members in such units. When
        authorized, a primary subordinate who shares the civilian director’s duties and
        acts for the director in the director’s absence will use the title Deputy Director
        and the OSC of DD. The title Vice Director and OSC of DV may be used for
        such a primary subordinate at center or wing level.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                      17


                  2.3.1.1.2.5.2. Civilians who are subordinates in units commanded by officers
                  cannot use the titles Vice Commander, Deputy Commander, Deputy to the
                  Commander or any similar title which denotes or implies the ability to
                  exercise command authority in a Commander’s absence. Such civilians may
                  use a title of Deputy and OSC of DD.
     2.3.1.2. Vice Commander. An officer who shares a commander's duties and acts for the
     commander during the commander's absence. If command is properly assumed or
     appointed under the provisions of AFI 51-604, a vice commander may exercise all
     command authority. This designation is used at major command through wing level only.
         2.3.1.2.1. Where the Air Force is the lead service at a joint base, the officer
         (irrespective of branch of military Service) designated the "Deputy Joint Base
         Commander" performs the functions of vice commander at wing level.
     2.3.1.3. Installation Commander. The host unit commander. This individual discharges
     the duties directed by US statutes or Air Force directives to be performed by the
     installation commander.
     2.3.1.4. Deputy Commander. An officer who shares the commander’s duties and acts for
     the commander during the commander’s absence. If command is properly assumed or
     appointed under AFI 51-604, a deputy commander may exercise all command authority.
     This designation is used at group level.
  2.3.2. Staff:
     2.3.2.1. Chief of Staff (CSAF). Title held by the Chief of Staff, US Air Force, with the
     only variance for Component NAFs. (See Figure 3.2 for variance for Component
     NAFs.)
     2.3.2.2. Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS). An officer who oversees a major portion of the Air
     Staff and who reports directly to the CSAF. A DCS supervises the activities of
     directorates and field operating agencies.
     2.3.2.3. Director of Staff (DS) A staff element reporting directly to the MAJCOM Vice
     Commander. The function oversees executive services, orderly room and command
     section activities. Wings may use this title when authorized under Air Force Manpower
     Standards (AFMS).
     2.3.2.4. Directorate. A staff element at Headquarters US Air Force or major command
     level. This is a decision making level which performs a range of related staff functions.
     Normally, a directorate supervises the activities of divisions and field operating agencies.
         2.3.2.4.1. Directorates are also authorized in large HQ USAF field operating
         agencies and in large centers and laboratories (approximately 500 authorizations)
         which oversee major mission areas and key Air Force programs or support functions.
     2.3.2.5. Division. Normally aligned as a staff element in Headquarters US Air Force,
     major command, NAF, center, field operating agency, or equivalent. Divisions supervise
     the activities of branches if the organization is large enough to require branches.
     Organizations that hold squadron status in the wing structure can be aligned as divisions
     when the head of the organization is a civilian (e.g., Services Divisions).
18                                                             AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


     2.3.2.6. Branch. A staff element that performs a specific portion of a division's mission.
     Branches may be further subdivided into sections and elements. Branches supervise the
     activities of sections and elements. However, sections and elements are only authorized if
     the organization performs technical, highly specialized workload or if the supervisor-to-
     worker ratio exceeds 1:10. If further subdivision of a branch is required, a team-leader
     approach is the preferred arrangement.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                       19


                                           Chapter 3

                              STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS

3.1. Organization Structure. This chapter prescribes standard organizational structures for use
to the lowest level shown. Illustrative figures include approved organizational titles (Figure 3.1
through Figure 3.36). Organization structures are illustrated to the lowest mandatory levels. HQ
USAF and MAJCOM functional managers and Manpower, Organization and Resources focal
points are authorized to develop standard organization structures below the mandatory level.
This chapter also reflects standard office symbol codes.
   3.1.1. Organizational Variations. Each figure depicts a standard organizational structure for a
   particular unit or function. AF/A1M must approve any variations from standard structure.
   Variations from standard structures should have a clear, overriding purpose that has easily
   recognizable and defensible organizational and cost benefits. MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs
   submit variation requests as described in Chapter 6 of this Instruction when a standard
   function does not exist at a location, when functions are combined due to small size, or when
   units are responsible for activities not accounted for in standard structures.
   3.1.2. Functions and Responsibilities. Each figure depicts the standard organizational
   structure and lists typical functions and responsibilities performed by an organization. These
   functions and responsibilities are not comprehensive, but are intended to give an
   understanding of activity that fits in each organizational block.
3.2. Numbered/Named Air Force (NAF). The NAF is a command echelon directly under a
MAJCOM that is focused on ensuring the readiness of assigned forces. It prepares forces for
deployment and employment. The basic NAF structure is in Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1. Basic NAF Structure (Applies to NAFs that are not C-NAFs).




   3.2.1. A component NAF (C-NAF) is a specialized category of NAF that is structured to
   perform an operational and warfighting mission in support of a Unified Combatant
   Command (UCC). The C-NAF is a command echelon directly under the control of an
   operational MAJCOM. The C-NAF structure is in Figure 3.2. The C-NAF will plan,
   command, control, execute and assess air, space and information operation capabilities across
   the full range of military operations. The C-NAF consists of an AFFOR staff and an Air and
   Space Operations Center (AOC) as depicted in Figure 3.2. Air Force forces and units will be
   assigned or attached as required to support the UCC.
 20                                                                AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


Figure 3.2. Component NAF Structure.




Organization Variations. Elements of Personal Staff should be reduced or eliminated as much as
practical through support agreements and reachback. The Personal Staff may include Protocol
(CCP), Political/Military Advisor (CCT), Staff Judge Advocate (JA), Public Affairs (PA),
Historian (HO), Chaplain (HC), Safety (SE), Surgeon (SG), Financial Management (FM),
Reserve Affairs (RE), Information Protection (IP) and Inspector General (IG). The rest of the C-
NAF staff should consist of the standard Air Force A1-A9 staff functions (see Figure 4.1 and
paragraph 4.4.3 for information on A-staff OSCs). A-staff 2-digit functions may be linked (e.g.,
A3 and A5 as A3/5), but separate functional staffs must be maintained. C-NAFs are authorized
to use the Chief of Staff (CS) title as a variance to paragraph 2.3.2.1 of this Instruction. C-NAF
responsibilities may vary depending on the capabilities provided by the MAJCOM.
3.3. Standard Wing. The standard wing (Figure 3.3) generates and employs combat
capability. One commander has the authority and responsibility to command the wing. The
standard operational wing structure is a wing with four dependent groups (operations,
maintenance, mission support and medical) with related functions and disciplines aligned under
the appropriate group. Generally, only the wing staff, comptroller unit and the four group
commanders report directly to the wing commander. Thus, the wing commander concentrates on
the wing's primary mission and delegates authority to subordinates so they can accomplish their
responsibilities. Major wing functions are divided among a few principal subordinates, each
accountable for carrying out a specific part of the wing mission. Responsibilities are clearly
defined and duplication is avoided. While the standard wing is organized for combat operations,
its basic structure is applied to all types of wings (for instance, air base and specialized mission
wings).
   3.3.1. Staffing of a Standard Wing. A wing is organized as an operational unit with
   manpower requirements set at those levels required for mission success. A standard or core
   manpower level exists for each organization defined in this Instruction (see AFI 38-201,
   Determining Manpower Requirements).
   3.3.2. Wing Staff Organization. Wing staff functions report to the wing commander (Figure
   3.4). A wing staff function may be referred to as an office, for example: a public affairs
   office. The senior staff member is referred to as the chief. (NOTE: the below reflects
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                     21


  separate wing staff functional offices; it does not reflect individual positions/activities
  immediately under the CC or CV as reflected by CC_ or CV_ office symbol codes, such as
  the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (CVK) and Antiterrorism Officer (CCW).)
     3.3.2.1. Public Affairs (PA). Delivers candid counsel and guidance to commanders to
     communicate timely, truthful, accurate, and useful information about Air Force activities
     to DoD, Air Force, domestic and international audiences. Provides visual information
     (VI) services and VI documentation of significant events. Gives commanders awareness
     of the public information environment and the means to use it as part of Air Force air,
     space, cyberspace, and information operations. Provides expert advice to assist leaders in
     making and communicating decisions affecting mission accomplishment. Employs
     communication tools to link Airmen and their leaders. Plans, develops, executes, and
     evaluates strategies and activities to obtain informed public understanding and support on
     issues impacting Air Force operations. Directs media and community relations activities.
     Provides security and policy review of publicly releasable information. Only wings with
     host installation responsibilities are authorized a PA office without SAF/PA waiver.
     3.3.2.2. Safety (SE). Advises commanders and supervisors on safety requirements and
     issues. Manages wing USAF mishap prevention program to help preserve vital resources
     and enhance mission capability.
     3.3.2.3. History (HO). Provides commanders and staffs with research services; prepares
     official histories and other publications.
     3.3.2.4. Staff Judge Advocate (JA). Advises wing and subordinate commanders on
     military justice and disciplinary matters. Prosecutes courts-martial and represents the
     government in administrative separation hearings. Provides personal legal assistance.
     Provides legal advice to military investigative agencies. Represents Air Force interests in
     environmental, civilian labor and utility rate matters and advises on contract law and
     related civil law issues. Acts as Air Force liaison with Federal, state and local legal
     authorities. Advises commanders and staffs on international law matters. Drafts and
     reviews operation and exercise contingency plans for compliance with the law of armed
     conflict.
     3.3.2.5. Command Post (CP). Implements emergency action and quick reaction checklist
     procedures and controls assigned forces; operates communications systems; maintains
     and provides communications security and area security; monitors alert force status;
     monitors airfield, weather and navigational aid status. Coordinates and reports
     maintenance actions. There is only one command post on each installation unless
     otherwise approved under AFI 10-207, Command Posts.
     3.3.2.6. Chaplain (HC). Provides spiritual care and the opportunity for authorized
     personnel to exercise their constitutional right to the free exercise of religion by
     conducting religious observances and providing pastoral care. Advises leadership on
     spiritual, ethical, moral, morale, core values and religious accommodation issues.
     3.3.2.7. Information Protection (IP). Wing focal point for information protection (IP)
     guidance and programs supporting a converged IP environment that includes all aspects
     associated with the protection of sensitive, controlled and classified information.
22                                                            AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


     3.3.2.8. Plans (XP). Focal point for wing deployment exercise evaluations. Coordinates
     base support planning. Provides and directs war reserve materiel management.
     3.3.2.9. Equal Opportunity (EO). Assists commanders at all levels to proactively engage
     all Airmen in the pursuit of equal opportunity by fostering and supporting equal
     opportunity, the Air Force Core Values and the Airman’s Creed through day-to-day
     actions and implementation of various EO programs (e.g., complaint program, human
     relations program, climate assessment program, Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR)
     program – including conflict consulting, Affirmative Employment Program and Special
     Emphasis Programs). Educates and trains all Airmen to make workplace professionalism
     a top priority and to take proactive steps to prevent, correct and eliminate unlawful
     discriminatory behavior.
     3.3.2.10. Inspector General (IG). Plans, directs, conducts and monitors inspector general
     programs. Implements the Air Force’s Inspection System; Complaints Program; and
     Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA) Programs.
     3.3.2.11. Wing staff personnel are attached to the Comptroller Squadron for
     administrative and UCMJ purposes.
         3.3.2.11.1. For wings that do not have a Comptroller Squadron or that have a
         civilian-led Comptroller Squadron, wing staff personnel are attached to the Force
         Support Squadron. In this case, if the Force Support Squadron is civilian-led, the
         wing staff personnel are attached to the Mission Support Group headquarters unit.
         3.3.2.11.2. MAJCOM/A1s, in coordination with their MAJCOM/JAs, may approve
         variances to the above wing staff attachments if necessary to avoid inappropriate
         reporting relationships such as between spouses. The variances should last the
         minimum time needed to avoid the inappropriate relationship.
         3.3.2.11.3. If a wing does not have any of the units specified in paragraph 3.3.2.11
         or 3.3.2.11.1, the wing commander may attach wing staff personnel to another unit
         for administrative and UCMJ purposes
  3.3.3. Comptroller (FM). Provides financial analysis and services, including budget
  development and execution, cost and economic analysis, pay and travel services and liaison
  with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) (Figure 3.5).
  3.3.4. Operations Group (Figure 3.6):
     3.3.4.1. The operations group operates primary mission equipment.
     3.3.4.2. Standardization/evaluation (OGV) and intelligence (OGI) will be separate staff
     elements.
  3.3.5. Maintenance Group (Figure 3.13):
     3.3.5.1. The maintenance group supports the primary mission with weapon system
     maintenance. This includes maintenance training, on-equipment and off-equipment
     maintenance.
     3.3.5.2. Normally, the maintenance group will consist of a maintenance squadron, an
     aircraft maintenance squadron and a maintenance operations squadron. If a maintenance
     squadron has over 700 manpower authorizations, MAJCOMs may approve splitting the

                                           Chapter 4

       TERMINOLOGY AND PROCEDURES FOR ORGANIZATION ACTIONS

4.1. Organization Actions. Use the terminology and related procedures outlined in this chapter
to make an organization change. Implementation of actions must be in accordance with
applicable provisions of AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing. Procedures and responsibilities shown
below apply to MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs. The HQ USAF Manpower and Human Capital
Management Directorate (HAF/HR) may perform these functions for their supported
organizations.
4.2. Organization Terminology:
   4.2.1. Constitute. Provide the legal authority for a new unit by designating it in a Department
   of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) letter.
   4.2.2. Disband. Withdraw the legal authority for a unit. The designation of the unit is retired
   and pre-served in historical records.
   4.2.3. Reconstitute. Renew legal authorization of a disbanded unit.
   4.2.4. Activate. Bring into existence a constituted unit, a detachment of a unit, or a
   provisional unit. An active unit can legally function as specified by directives.
   4.2.5. Inactivate. End the existence of a unit, detachment of a unit, or provisional unit. An
   inactive unit retains its lineage, history and honors and is available for activation when
   needed again. Units should be inactivated when their mission ceases to exist and all resources
   are withdrawn.
   4.2.6. Designate. Give an official name (or a number and name).
   4.2.7. Redesignate. Change the name or number.
   4.2.8. Consolidate. To permanently combine two or more organizations by merging their
   lineage into a single line to form a single organization. Consolidation usually applies to
   organizations that were active at different times but have the same numerical designations or
   similar functions. Units that have been active concurrently cannot be consolidated. A
   consolidated unit cannot subsequently be separated.
   4.2.9. Assign. Place a unit with an existing military organization.
   4.2.10. Attach. Place a unit, or part of a unit, with a military organization other than its
   parent organization, without making it a part of that organization. A unit, or part of a unit,
   may be attached for operational control, administrative control and logistic support.
       4.2.10.1. Operational Control. The control exercised by a commander or constituted
       authority over persons or units to compose forces, to assign tasks, to designate objectives
       and to give directions through subordinate commanders for the conduct of operations.
 66                                                               AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


       4.2.10.2. Administrative Control. Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or
       other organizations regarding administrative and other matters not included in the
       operational mission of the subordinate or other organizations. Examples of administrative
       control are UCMJ authority, personnel classification, effectiveness reports, granting
       leaves and so on.
       4.2.10.3. Logistic Support. The support provided by one organization to another,
       enabling that organization to carry out operations. Examples include supply,
       maintenance, logistics planning, transportation and contracting. An order that states a unit
       is attached for logistic support only clearly means operational control and administrative
       control are not responsibilities of the commander to which the unit is attached. The order
       itself does not detail the extent and kind of logistic support, as this support is clarified
       through separate documents, such as host tenant support agreements.
       4.2.10.4. For the purposes of this AFI, the above are defined for use with internal Air
       Force organizational actions and relationships. In terms of joint doctrine and
       employment of forces in the joint environment, operational control is command authority
       that may be exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant
       command; it is inherent in combatant command and may be delegated within the
       command.
   4.2.11. Allot. Authorize a unit to be part of the Air National Guard. DAF/A1M memos allot
   units to the National Guard Bureau which in turn allots them to the appropriate state, territory
   or the District of Columbia.
4.3. Organization Procedures. The following procedures apply to organization entities within
the Air Force.
   4.3.1. Establishments:
       4.3.1.1. An establishment is automatically created when its headquarters unit is
       activated.
       4.3.1.2. An establishment is controlled through its headquarters. However, subordinate
       units are assigned to the establishment, not to the headquarters unit. This enables each
       unit within an establishment to have a separate identity. The fact that the headquarters
       unit controls the establishment places the other units subordinate to it. Personnel are
       assigned to a unit, not to an establishment.
       4.3.1.3. The assignment of any establishment assigns all its components at the same
       time, unless otherwise specified. For example, when a wing is assigned to an NAF, the
       assignment of the wing's groups and squadrons also is to the NAF. The separation of
       units by location does not affect their assignment to the establishment.
       4.3.1.4. Inactivation of a headquarters unit automatically inactivates the establishment.
       Units assigned to the establishment automatically revert, unless otherwise directed, to the
       next higher level.
   4.3.2. Units:
       4.3.2.1. HQ USAF issues a DAF/A1M letter to constitute and activate MAJCOMs,
       FOAs and DRUs. For a unit subordinate to a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU, HQ USAF
       constitutes the unit and assigns it to the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU for activation. The
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                       67


     MAJCOM, FOA or DRU will activate and assign the unit by issuing a G-Series Order
     citing the DAF/A1M letter as authority. A DAF/A1M letter also can authorize a
     MAJCOM, FOA or DRU to redesignate or inactivate a unit. An inactivated unit reverts to
     the control of HQ USAF. DAF/A1M letters and G-Series Orders follow the formats
     prescribed in Chapter 7.
     4.3.2.2. A MAJCOM, FOA or DRU may reassign a unit internally unless the unit's
     assignment is specified in a DAF/A1M letter or by a standard structure prescribed in this
     Instruction.
     4.3.2.3. A unit may be reassigned from one MAJCOM, FOA or DRU to another. In this
     case, the losing MAJCOM, FOA or DRU (after coordinating with the gaining MAJCOM,
     FOA or DRU) requests AF/A1M approve the reassignment on a date agreed to by both
     commands. If only unit reassignments are involved, the DAF/A1M letter directs the
     reassignment of such units and copies are sent to both commands. If reassignment and
     movement occur at the same time, the movement directive issued per AFI 16-403,
     Updating the USAF Program Installations, Units, and Priorities and Movement of Air
     Force Units, can also serve as the reassignment directive.
     4.3.2.4. The effective date of an organization action (for example, activation,
     inactivation, or redesignation) is either published in the DAF/A1M letter or in orders
     issued by the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU. An action effective on or about a certain date
     must occur no more than 30 calendar days before or after that date.
     4.3.2.5. Numbered flights are units and require the same organization procedures as
     other units. Alpha and functional flights, however, are not units and are not subject to this
     chapter's procedures.
  4.3.3. Nonunits: MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs have the approval authority to activate
  detachments and operating locations (OL). MAJCOM Manpower and Organization focal
  points should conduct an annual detachment/OL review to validate the continuing
  requirement for the activity.
     4.3.3.1. Detachments:
        4.3.3.1.1. A MAJCOM, FOA or DRU may activate a detachment for a function that
        is geographically separated from its parent unit. A detachment is activated to fill a
        need for command or supervision, or for other reasons, such as to facilitate unit
        movement. If there is a need for command authority, the senior officer on duty with a
        detachment is appointed on orders as detachment commander. NOTE: Normally, a
        geographically separated organization is designated an operating location unless on-
        site command authority is required. Then, it is designated a detachment.
        4.3.3.1.2. Detachments are numbered in sequence, beginning with 1.
        4.3.3.1.3. A detachment can be redesignated to another number within the same unit.
        The new number cannot duplicate a currently active detachment number within that
        unit.
        4.3.3.1.4. The following redesignations cannot be made:
            4.3.3.1.4.1. A detachment of one parent unit to a detachment of another parent
            unit.
68                                                             AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


            4.3.3.1.4.2. A detachment to a unit.
            4.3.3.1.4.3. A unit to a detachment.
            4.3.3.1.4.4. A detachment to an operating location.
            4.3.3.1.4.5. An operating location to a detachment.
        4.3.3.1.5. The inactivation of a parent unit automatically inactivates its detachments.
        4.3.3.1.6. Detachments are designated as part of a unit, not an establishment, e.g.,
        Detachment 1, 1st Fighter Squadron or Detachment 4, HQ 1st Operations Group.
     4.3.3.2. Operating Location (OL):
        4.3.3.2.1. An OL may be activated by a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU.
        4.3.3.2.2. An OL is a geographically separated location where persons are required to
        perform permanent duty and the command supervision or other features provided by a
        detachment are not needed.
        4.3.3.2.3. An OL is not a location separated from an installation to which persons are
        transported to work.
        4.3.3.2.4. Guidelines for actions in paragraph 4.3.3.1.4 and 4.3.3.1.6 above
        regarding detachments also apply to operating location actions.
        4.3.3.2.5. Manpower authorizations for an OL are reported with the location where
        duty is being performed.
        4.3.3.2.6. OLs are designated in alphabetical sequence, beginning with A.
     4.3.3.3. Coding Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Data
        4.3.3.3.1. The PAS code contains data fields for designating detachments, OLs and
        staff elements. The following coding rules apply:
        4.3.3.3.2. OLs are designated with a maximum of three alphabetic characters in a
        four-character field. The first character of the OL field must be zero. The first two
        characters of the OL field will always be zero for OLs designated with two letters.
        The first three characters of the OL field will always be zero for OL designations with
        a single letter (e.g., OL code ―000A‖ for OL-A, OL code ―00ZZ‖ for OL-ZZ, OL
        code ―0ABC‖ for OL-ABC).
        4.3.3.3.3. If the OL is not subordinate to the detachment, the detachment code is
        designated with zeroes (e.g., detachment code ―0000‖ and OL code ―000A‖ means
        OL A and parent is not a detachment).
        4.3.3.3.4. If the OL is subordinate to the detachment, both fields are designated
        independently (e.g., detachment code ―0001‖ and OL code ―000A‖ equals OL A of
        detachment 1).
        4.3.3.3.5. Detachment and OL data fields (four characters each) are combined in the
        personnel system. Therefore, total non-zero characters cannot exceed four characters.
            4.3.3.3.5.1. An OL can be up to three characters if the detachment number
            designation is one digit (1-9).
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                   69


            4.3.3.3.5.2. An OL can be one or two characters if the detachment number
            designation is two digits (10 through 99).
            4.3.3.3.5.3. An OL can be only one character if the detachment number
            designation is three digits (100 through 999).
            4.3.3.3.5.4. An OL cannot be assigned to a detachment numbered greater than
            999. If it should become necessary to establish an OL, the detachment must be
            redesignated using not more than three digits for identification.
            4.3.3.3.5.5. The first character of an OL or staff element data field must be
            alphabetic if used for anything other than an OL (e.g., when establishing a
            separate PAS for a senior rater).
            4.3.3.3.5.6. General guidance on the PAS system is in AFCSM 36-699, Volume
            4, Personnel Accounting Symbol System Users Manual.
     4.3.3.4. Squadron Sections. A commander of a large unit (e.g., approximately 250 or
     more military authorized), squadron or above, may delegate administrative control of all
     assigned members by appointing a section commander on special orders IAW guidance
     in AFI 51-604.
        4.3.3.4.1. If a full-time section commander is not authorized under a manpower
        standard, unit commanders may appoint a section commander who performs these
        functions as an additional duty. Commanders should exercise discretion to ensure
        this is done only when warranted by span of control factors.
        4.3.3.4.2. See AFI 51-604 for legal guidance on appointment of section commanders.
        See AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), for guidance
        on AFSC/duty title matters.
     4.3.3.5. Air Force Elements:
        4.3.3.5.1. An element may be designated to function as a unit by a designating officer
        (described below). The designating officer attaches the Air Force members on duty
        with an organization outside the Air Force to the element. (Refer to AFI 51-604 for
        the determination of an element commander and/or the appointment of element
        section commanders.) The following officers have authority to designate an element
        to function as a unit:
            4.3.3.5.1.1. The Senior Air Force Officer (SAFO) in a defense agency, defense
            field activity, unified or specified combatant command, joint task force, combined
            task force, coalition force, or activity outside the Air Force that exercises
            operational control over the element.
            4.3.3.5.1.2. The commander of the Air Force MAJCOM for active duty members
            within that command detailed to a unit of the Air National Guard not in federal
            service, to an organization outside the Air Force for which the Secretary of the
            Air Force serves as the Executive Agent pursuant to Department of Defense
            Directives and in similar circumstances.
            4.3.3.5.1.3. The Commander, Air Force District of Washington for elements not
            within such commands, agencies or activities.
 70                                                               AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


          4.3.3.5.2. In appropriate circumstances (such as a geographically dispersed element),
          an element may be divided into sections and an element section commander
          appointed to each section. In these cases, the element commander will designate
          which members are attached to each section.
4.4. Office Symbol Codes. Office Symbol Codes (OSCs) identify the organization structure
and functional responsibilities within a unit. For instance, ―HO‖ is the OSC for the History
Office in the wing headquarters. See AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications, for
overall guidance on OSCs. The following is in addition to AFMAN 33-326 guidance and
specifically addresses OSCs as used in MPES. (NOTE: Office Symbol Codes were formerly
called Organization Structure Codes.)
   4.4.1. Types of OSCs. There are two types of OSCs.
       4.4.1.1. Air Force Standard OSCs are available for use by more than one command.
       These types of OSCs are established for standard organization structures such as those in
       Chapter 3 of this AFI or a functional AFI and to promote standardization and ease of
       communication. These OSCs are identified by a command code of ―HQ‖ in the MPES
       OSC Reference Table.
       4.4.1.2. Command-unique OSCs are used by a single command, as identified in the
       MPES OSC Reference Table. Command-unique OSCs will not duplicate or conflict with
       standard OSCs. Do not create a command-unique OSC if an Air Force standard OSC
       exists for an organization; e.g., if a Civil Engineer Squadron has an Operations Flight, it
       uses an OSC of CEO as reflected in Chapter 3.
   4.4.2. Procedures for MPES OSCs:
       4.4.2.1. MPES OSCs are limited to 7 alphanumeric characters. Though special
       characters such as dashes or slashes may be acceptable when OSCs are used for
       communication or identification purposes, they cannot be included in OSCs as reflected
       in MPES because they create problems in some data systems that interface with MPES.
       4.4.2.2. MPES OSC titles are limited to 40 characters for Air Force systems and an 80
       character title for interface with DoD systems. To facilitate interface with the DoD
       systems, the 80 character title should be spelled out as much as possible, avoiding
       acronyms and other abbreviations. Special characters cannot be used in MPES OSC titles
       because they create problems in some data systems that interface with MPES.
       4.4.2.3. Organizational level should not normally be included in the OSC title; i.e., do
       not include words like Division, Directorate, Squadron, Flight, Section, etc., in the title.
       This allows the same OSC to be used at different organizational levels.
       4.4.2.5. Using organizations should request deletion of OSCs that are no longer required.
       4.4.2.6. Existing OSCs should be used when possible.
       4.4.2.7. HQ USAF functional managers should maintain standard OSCs/structures down
       to the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with three-digit OSCs) for MAJCOM and
       NAF headquarters to facilitate communications and minimize personnel transition time.
       Deviations to these established three-letter office symbols must be approved by the HQ
       USAF functional manager (see paragraph 6.1.3).
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                      71


   4.4.3. A-Staff OSCs. A-staff OSCs are used to identify certain major staff elements in HQ
   USAF, MAJCOM headquarters and C-NAF headquarters. These OSCs are patterned on the
   J-staff structure used in joint organizations and are designed to improve communication
   within the Air Force and with other DoD organizations. Base-level organizations do not use
   A-Staff OSCs. Standard 2-letter A-staff OSCs are shown in Figure 4.1. MAJCOMs may
   request to link A-staff 2-digit functions (e.g., A3 and A5 as A3/5) using the organization
   change request procedures in Chapter 6.

Figure 4.1. Standard 2-Letter A-Staff OSCs.
A1 – Manpower, Personnel and Services
A2 – Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
A3 – Operations
A4 – Logistics
A5 – Plans and Requirements
A6 – Communications
A7 – Installations and Mission Support
A8 – Strategic Plans and Programs
A9 – Studies, Analyses, Assessments and Lessons Learned
A10 – Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (Limited to HQ USAF and approved
MAJCOM headquarters)
   4.4.4. Requests for MPES OSC Actions:
       4.4.4.1. If an OSC change is needed because of an Organization Change Request (OCR),
       requesters include the associated OSC actions in question 5 of the OCR per the
       procedures in Chapter 6 of this AFI.
       4.4.4.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and HAF/HR send other OSC requests for MPES
       actions via e-mail to the AF/A1MO Workflow mailbox. The e-mail should have a
       distinct subject reflecting the request and requester; e.g., subject: OSC Request - ACC
       OS Add; OSC Request - AFMC PK Actions. The e-mail should include: the specific
       OSC, OSC titles, action (add, delete, change), a short rationale for the request, and
       whether requesting a standard or command-unique OSC (identify command code, as
       appropriate). AF/A1MO obtains functional coordination within HQ USAF, as required,
       and forwards approved requests to AF/A1MZ to be loaded into MPES. NOTE: OSC
       requests for organizations outside the Air Force (e.g., Air Force Elements) should be sent
       to AF/A1MS instead of AF/A1MO.
 72                                                            AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


                                         Chapter 5

               PROCEDURES FOR NAMING AND NUMBERING UNITS

 NOTE: (Most of the information in this chapter was previously in AFPD 38-5, Unit
Designations. In addition, relevant policy guidance from AFPD 38-5 is in the process of being
incorporated into AFPD 38-1.)
5.1. Nomenclature. Standardize organization titles, when possible. When activating a unit,
designate it using the procedures in this Instruction and guidance in AFPD 38-1 and AFPD 38-5.
5.2. General Guidelines. Apply the following guidelines when naming a unit:
   5.2.1. Generally, units require a specific organization title or designation made up of a
   number or name, a "kind" (nomenclature) and a "type" (organizational level) indicator.
   Examples of a numbered and named unit designations are in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1. Unit Designation Examples.
Numbered Unit Designation Example:
Title: 2nd Bomb Wing
Number: 2
Unit Kind: Bomb
Unit Type: Wing


Named Unit Designation Example:
Title: Ogden Air Logistics Center
Unit Kind: Ogden Air Logistics
Unit Type: Center
5.3. Unit Number:
   5.3.1. A numbered unit is assigned a number of no more than three numerals (for example,
   305th Air Mobility Wing).
   5.3.2. USAF designates Numbered Air Forces in a single series beginning with "First." Do
   not use Arabic or Roman numerals in designating Numbered Air Forces. C-NAFs will have
   a parenthetical designation indicating their component role consisting of "(Air Forces
   XXXXX)" where "XXXXX" is the functional or geographic designation of the associated
   Unified Combatant Command; e.g., Eighteenth Air Force (Air Forces Transportation) or
   Seventh Air Force (Air Forces Korea). NAFs that are not C-NAFs will not have a
   parenthetical designation; e.g., Second Air Force.
   5.3.3. Use unit numbers as low in sequence as possible.
   5.3.4. Reserve numbers 101 through 299 for Air National Guard units.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                     73


   5.3.5. Do not duplicate wing and independent group numerical designations. In other words,
   there is only one 388th wing (presently a fighter wing) or one 720th group (presently a
   special tactics group). Since these numbers are taken, no other 388th or 720th wing or group
   is authorized. AF/A1M manages active wing designations.
   5.3.6. Give groups and support squadrons the same number as their parent organizations,
   when possible. If you cannot give groups their parent organization's number (e.g., due to
   duplication) do not use a number already assigned to another wing. Assign to these groups or
   squadrons a number that bears a logical relationship to the parent. When feasible, number
   duplicate units 7XX or 8XX (where XX is the wing number). For example, duplicate
   squadrons under the 96th Civil Engineer Group would be the 96th Civil Engineer Squadron
   and 796th Civil Engineer Squadron.
   5.3.7. Do not normally give mission squadrons assigned to groups or wings the same number
   as their parent organizations. When otherwise convenient, use sequential numbers for
   mission squadrons within the same wing. Examples of mission squadrons include
   operational squadrons in a flying wing, training squadrons in a training wing, and software
   maintenance squadrons in a maintenance wing.
   5.3.8. You will not normally redesignate a unit numerically. For example, if the host wing at
   a base changes, the support units are not redesignated from the old host wing number to the
   new host wing number. Instead, the support units under the old host wing are inactivated and
   support units with the new host wing number are activated. This ensures that the previous
   host wing has like-numbered support units available for activation if needed.
   5.3.9. Normally number units subordinate to a NAF 6XX (where XX is the NAF number).
   Do not use 6XX numbers for units not assigned to XX NAF (where XX is the NAF number).
   5.3.10. Use the heritage priorities in AFPD 38-1 or AFPD 38-5 to assign unit numerical
   designations for wings, independent groups and operational squadrons.
5.4. Unit Kind:
   5.4.1. Assign a unit nomenclature that describes its assigned mission. Do not construct unit
   titles that restrict another unit with a like mission from using that nomenclature.
   5.4.2. Do not designate composite wings or composite independent groups by "kind"
   designation (for example, 3rd Wing).
   5.4.3. Keep unit "kinds" (nomenclature) and type attributes short and simple. Use more
   specific nomenclature at lower organizational levels, but keep the number of different titles
   to a minimum.
   5.4.4. Use current, approved nomenclature for units.       For available unit "kinds"
   (nomenclatures) see the Organization Kind Code Reference Table in MPES. You must get
   approval from AF/A1M for any deviations to approved nomenclature.
5.5. Unit Type: Use Chapter 2 of this Instruction to determine appropriate unit types.
 74                                                               AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011



5.6. New Nomenclature. If an unusual factor such as a special mission suggests a deviation
from the standard organization nomenclature, a MAJCOM may request new nomenclature from
AF/A1M. Include in these requests the proposed nomenclature (unit kind), type (level),
command to which restricted (if any) and a short definition of the mission implied by the
nomenclature. Also include the justification or rationale for the proposed nomenclature. Include
this information in question 6a of an Organization Change Request IAW the procedures in
Chapter 6 of this Instruction. For EXAMPLE:
Proposed Unit Kind: Fighter Training
Proposed Unit Type: Squadron
Command Restriction: None.
Definition: Provides flying training in fighter type aircraft.
Justification: Provide rationale for new nomenclature.
5.7. Procedures for Unit Designation: Units are regularly activated, inactivated, or
redesignated as a result of force structure and organizational changes. Designation actions will
conform to policy criteria in AFPD 38-1 and AFPD 38-5 and procedural criteria documented in
this Instruction.
   5.7.1. Do not designate or redesignate a unit with the exact number, name and type of
   another active or inactive unit.
   5.7.2. You may use an inactive unit to form a new unit of the same number, name, or similar
   function. A new unit formed from an inactive unit inherits the lineage and honors of the
   former unit.
   5.7.3. A unit retains its lineage, honors and history through all activations, inactivations and
   redesignations. AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services, and Requirements, describes the
   effect an organizational action will have on inheriting the lineage, honors and history of a
   unit. Upon request, the Air Force Historical Research Agency will provide MAJCOMs with
   a list of qualified inactive units for possible activation.
   5.7.4. MAJCOMs will use approved nomenclature and heritage lists to propose unit
   designations. Submit these proposals to AF/A1M for evaluation and certification of
   compliance with guidance in AFPD 38-1 and AFPD 38-5 and this Instruction according to
   procedures in Chapter 6. If MAJCOMs wish to deviate from the guidance, they must
   provide explicit justification in a request for approval of an organizational variance.
   AF/A1M sends proposals to the Chief of Staff for approval.
   5.7.5. Requests to memorialize a named unit or named activity must also follow the
   guidelines in AFI 36-3108, Memorialization Program and Ceremonies. MAJCOMs submit
   these requests according to the procedures in Chapter 6 of AFI 38-101 and include a
   biography of the individual, explanation of why the MAJCOM wishes to memorialize the
   organization for this individual, and certification that appropriate quality force reviews or
   background checks have been conducted.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                         75


                                           Chapter 6

                                ORGANIZATION CHANGES

6.1. Actions Requiring AF/A1M Approval. MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs and their
subordinate units (through their Manpower, Organization and Resources office) must have
AF/A1M approval to:
   6.1.1. Activate, inactivate, or redesignate a unit or to vary from any policy, guidance,
   procedure, or standard organization depicted in this Instruction, AFPD 38-1 or AFPD 38-5.
   A variation includes any addition, deletion, or merger of functions shown in a standard
   organization.
   6.1.2. Change major staff elements (directorate or equivalent level; i.e., offices with two-
   digit office symbols) in a MAJCOM headquarters.
   6.1.3. Also, HQ USAF functional managers must approve changes to MAJCOM
   headquarters at the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with three-digit office symbols).
   MAJCOMs submit these requests to the appropriate HQ USAF functional manager with an
   information copy to AF/A1MO or to AF/A1M via the procedures in this chapter.
6.2. Organization Change Request (OCR). A request for organization action such as unit
activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard structure must include answers
to the following questions, as they apply. Answer ―Not Applicable‖ when appropriate. AF/A1M
will review organization change requests and, upon approval, direct MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs or
HAF/HR to reflect the action in the RCS: HAF-A8P(M)9227 Report, Programming Actions
Involving Units, Installations, and Unit Equipment per AFI 16-403. Also, MAJCOMs, FOAs
and DRUs are required by AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry, to submit
to the Air Force Historical Research Agency a monthly report of any changes in organizations
using RCS: HAF-HO(M)7401, Air Force Organization Status Change Report. Implementation
of actions must be in accordance with applicable provisions of AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing.
   6.2.1. Organization Change Request Questions. (MAJCOMs should edit submissions from
   their base-level organizations before forwarding requests to HQ USAF to ensure questions
   are answered completely and that information extraneous to HQ USAF review is deleted.)
       6.2.1.1. Question 1: What is the proposed action (list specific actions, such as activation,
       inactivation, nomenclature change, reorganization, or variation request)?
       6.2.1.2. Question 2: Why is the action needed? What are the expected benefits? (Identify
       factors driving the need for the action, e.g., changes to Instructions, missions or concepts
       of operations; attach any substantiating Air Force directives. In describing expected
       benefits, identify improvements, examples of increased mission capability and so on.
       Generalized statements such as increases mission capability or reduces span of control
       are not adequate as justifications.)
       6.2.1.3. Question 3: What is the structure of the new organization (include current and
       proposed organization and function charts showing authorized and proposed manpower
       by officer, enlisted and civilian. Also include Average Daily Student Load, where
       applicable. Explain manpower changes.)?
76                                                              AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


     6.2.1.4. Question 4: Explain how the proposed structure compares with standard
     structure, nomenclature and size guidance and provide rationale for any requested
     deviations. Using the guidance in Chapter 2, include computation of adjusted
     populations for wings, groups or squadrons with manpower authorizations under the unit
     size thresholds.
     6.2.1.5. Question 5: As a result of this request, are any changes needed to add or delete
     Organization Nomenclature Codes or Office Symbol Codes (OSCs) or to change the title
     for an OSC; if so, provide the following information. Strive to use existing codes rather
     than creating new ones. Avoid special characters due to data system interface problems.
     (See AFMAN 33-326 and Chapter 4 of this AFI for additional information on OSCs.)
        6.2.1.5.1. Question 5.a. Organization Nomenclature Code Change:
        Action: [Add or Delete; titles cannot be changed]
        Title:
        Requested 3-character code:
        Requested 18-character code:
        Requested 38-character code:
        Requested 100-character code: [to facilitate interface with systems outside of the Air
        Force, spell out full nomenclature to the maximum extent possible, avoiding
        acronyms and other abbreviations]
        Description: [Provide a short one to two sentence description of the mission for this
        type of unit. Description should be mission-focused and generic enough to allow
        other similar units to use this nomenclature.]
        6.2.1.5.2. Question 5.b. Office Symbol Code (OSC) Change:
        Action: [Add, Delete, Change Title]
        Requested code: [Can be no more than 7 alphanumeric characters]
        Requested 40-character title:
        Requested 80-character title: [to facilitate interface with systems outside of the Air
        Force, spell out full nomenclature to the maximum extent possible, avoiding
        acronyms and other abbreviations]
     6.2.1.6. Question 6: For unit activations or redesignations, explain why the proposed
     unit designation was chosen. Identify any inactive historical units you’re proposing to
     use and explain why you want to use these units.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                        77


     6.2.1.7. Question 7: What is the cost of the request in terms of dollars and resources?
     (Document cost in terms of dollars and manpower. Include administrative costs such as
     flags and signs, as well as manpower increases or monetary costs directly driven by the
     requested reorganization action. Do not include costs that may be a result of related force
     structure, for example, runway construction costs for bedding down programmed aircraft
     would not be included in the OCR to activate an associated flying squadron. If the action
     cannot be implemented from within currently programmed MAJCOM, FOA or DRU
     resources, see paragraph immediately below.)
         6.2.1.7.1. MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs will normally implement actions approved
         under the OCR process using currently programmed manpower and budgetary
         resources. In the rare cases when this is not possible, they will submit an initiative for
         the resources needed to the Air Force Corporate Structure during a budget exercise,
         following guidance in AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air Force
         Programs, and any related instructions. This must be done prior to or concurrent with
         the OCR submission. AF/A1M will hold the OCR without action until the resources
         are approved. AF/A1M will return the OCR with-out action if the resource approval
         does not occur within 30 calendar days of receipt of the OCR. For reconsideration,
         the MAJCOM, FOA or DRU must resubmit the OCR following approval of the
         resources.
     6.2.1.8. Question 8: Provide a mission directive, statement or description for
     organizations being activated or reorganized.
  6.2.2. A request for organization action is not required for units inactivating as a result of an
  approved force structure action. A request is also not required when organizational impacts
  have been addressed as part of actions approved under AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities
  Program (see that publication for specific guidance on required information).
  6.2.3. A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU, after notifying AF/A1M, may return a changed
  organization to a prescribed configuration.
  6.2.4. Additional requirements may need to be met for establishment of a new FOA, DRU,
  MAJCOM FOA, or MAJCOM DRU. The annual Defense Appropriations Act usually
  contains a provision prohibiting expenditure of funds for establishment of such organizations.
  The provision permits the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to grant a waiver if SECAF
  certifies to Congress that the establishment will result in personnel or financial savings to the
  Department of the Air Force. Existing FOAs, DRUs, MAJCOM FOAs and MAJCOM DRUs
  will not be redesignated or re-missioned to an unrelated mission area to circumvent this legal
  direction. Contact AF/A1MO for the current guidance when considering establishment of
  one of these organizations.
  6.2.5. Units will not take actions such as scheduling ceremonies, inviting dignitaries, or
  making public announcements prior to appropriate HQ USAF approval of organization
  changes.
 78                                                                 AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011



6.3. Testing New Organizations. MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs may develop and test new
organizations. The purpose of an organization test is to evaluate the new organization's
effectiveness under actual working conditions and resolve most common problems before
committing affected functions to change. A test involving an organization structure found in this
Instruction requires AF/A1M approval. Submit test plans for approval at least 120 calendar days
before the proposed start of the test. The test plan should include:
   6.3.1. Answers to the questions in paragraph 6.2.1, as they apply.
   6.3.2. Dates of the test period (not to exceed 1 year).
   6.3.3. Objective measures to assist in evaluation of the test.
   6.3.4. After completing the test period, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU sends results and
   recommendations to AF/A1M. A waiver request is included if a permanent organization
   change is desired.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                        79

                          ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Implementation Authority. HQ USAF, MAJCOM, FOA and DRU manpower and
organization functions are responsible for publishing the legal and authoritative documents
needed to implement organization actions.
   7.1.1. Department of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) Letters. DAF/A1M letters constitute,
   reconstitute, disband, consolidate, activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign and reassign
   (between MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs) Air Force units. In addition, DAF/A1M letters
   designate, redesignate, inactivate, assign and reassign (between MAJCOMs, FOAs and
   DRUs) named activities. DAF/A1M letters serve as authority for MAJCOM, FOA and DRU
   unit and named activity organization actions. DAF/A1M letters follow the formats outlined
   in Figure 7.1 through Figure 7.5.
      7.1.1.1. Effective Date. The effective date of an organization action is either published in
      the DAF/A1M letter or in the order issued by a MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. When a
      DAF/A1M letter allows the effective date to be on or about a certain date, the
      organization action must occur no more than 30 calendar days before or after that date.
   7.1.2. G-Series Orders. These orders are published to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign
   and reassign units, detachments and named activities subordinate to a HQ USAF, MAJCOM,
   FOA, or DRU; and to attach one organization to another. A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU
   manpower and organization function may authenticate and publish G-Series Orders using the
   formats in Figure 7.6 through Figure 7.12. HAF/HR may perform these functions for their
   supported organizations. In addition, AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, provides general
   guidelines about orders preparation. (NOTE: Unit moves and movement orders are covered
   by AFI 16-403.)
      7.1.2.1. Guidelines for G-Series Orders:
          7.1.2.1.1. Numbering G-Series Orders. Orders are numbered in sequence starting
          with number one (for example, GS-1, GS-2 and so on). Begin a new sequence each
          fiscal year.
          7.1.2.1.2. Effective Date. The effective date of the action described in the order is the
          date of the order, unless a different effective date is specified.
          7.1.2.1.3. Distribution. Send all organizations impacted by the order a copy. Use of
          standard distribution lists is encouraged. Orders involving medical units must include
          the Air Force Medical Support Agency on distribution.
      7.1.2.2. G-Series Order Organization Actions:
          7.1.2.2.1. Activation and Assignment. Include the title of organization, station, unit
          or establishment of assignment, effective date and authority (Figures 7.6 and 7.9).
          7.1.2.2.2. Redesignation. Include the old and new unit or detachment designation; the
          station, unit and establishment of assignment, as applicable; the effective date; and
          the authority (Figures 7.7 and 7.9). (See paragraph 4.3.3.1.4 for additional guidance
          regarding redesignation of detachments.)
 80                                                              AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


          7.1.2.2.3. Inactivation. Include the designation of organization being inactivated, the
          station, the effective date, the disposition of personnel and equipment, statement that
          funds will be disposed of according to Air Force directives and the authority (Figures
          7.8 and 7.9).
          7.1.2.2.4. Reassignment. Include the designation of the establishment from which the
          unit is relieved, the establishment to which the unit is assigned, the effective date of
          transfer and the authority (Figures 7.9 through 7.11).
          7.1.2.2.5. Attachment of One Unit to Another. Include the unit and MAJCOM to
          which attached, the effective date of attachment, the purpose of attachment and the
          authority (See sample orders in Chapter 8).
          7.1.2.2.6. Detachments and Operating Locations. (See Figure 7.12) Detachments
          and operating locations are designated as part of a unit, not an establishment, e.g.,
          Detachment 1, 1st Fighter Squadron or Operating Location A, HQ 1st Operations
          Group. This is because detachments and operating locations are parts of a unit, not
          separate units. Special orders are not required for Operating Location actions because
          there is no associated UCMJ authority; however, MAJCOMs may publish orders for
          announcement or accountability purposes.
7.2. Distribution Requirements. Each MAJCOM manpower and organization function will
ensure HQ USAF/A1MO is on distribution to receive special orders, MAJCOM organization
charts, mission directives and Instructions relating to organizations within their command.
7.3. Headquarters Department of the Air Force Organization Chart. This publication
prescribes AFVA 38-104, HQ USAF Organization Chart. AFVA 38-104 shows HQ USAF
offices under the Secretariat and the Air Staff down to the 3-letter level, along with their
respective Field Operating Agencies (FOAs). HAF/HR prepares this AFVA semiannually or as
needed.

                                           Chapter 8

                          ORGANIZING PROVISIONAL UNITS

8.1. Provisional Unit. A provisional unit is temporary in nature and created when a specific
organization is required for a temporary mission and no organization exists to attach forces
(including personnel).
   8.1.1. References to assigned and attached units in this chapter refer to the organizational
   structure of the provisional organization which establishes the Air Force chain of command.
   Assigned and attached units should not be confused with assigned and attached forces.
   8.1.2. Provisional units are organized in the same manner as permanent units. Establish
   provisional organizations at the organization level required to meet mission requirements
   (i.e., NAF, wing, group, squadron, flight, detachment, operating location). Organize
   provisional operations, maintenance, mission support, medical groups, and subordinate
   squadrons under a provisional wing, as needed. Related functions may be consolidated into a
   single unit if more efficient due to size, oversight, or other factors; e.g., all maintenance
   functions can be combined into a maintenance squadron when the size of the functions do not
   warrant separate maintenance, aircraft maintenance and maintenance operations squadrons.
   If only a portion of a squadron is required, those functions may be added to an existing
   provisional squadron or to the next higher provisional unit. For example, if an entire
   expeditionary force support squadron is not required, manpower, personnel, and services
   functions could be assigned into an expeditionary mission support group.
   8.1.3. A provisional unit is attached rather than assigned to a permanent unit. Conversely, a
   permanent unit cannot be assigned to a provisional unit, but it may be attached to a
   provisional unit. A subordinate provisional unit is assigned to a higher provisional unit.
8.2. Types of provisional units. There are two types of provisional units (traditional and
expeditionary).
   8.2.1. Traditional. When there is a need for a temporary organization not associated with a
   contingency type situation. An organization change request (OCR) to HQ USAF or
   Department of the Air Force (DAF) letter is not required for this type of provisional unit. For
   example,
       8.2.1.1. When two or more organizations merge and the need exists to create a temporary
       organization pending final disposition of resources from the merging organizations.
       8.2.1.2. When an organization is needed for short-term requirement such as a temporary
       headquarters until a location is selected for the permanent headquarters. (NOTE: A
       provisional unit should not be established to pre-suppose approval of a permanent basing
       decision.)
   8.2.2. Expeditionary. Provisional organizations established in support of a contingency or
   exercise operation. There are two types of expeditionary units (major force provider and
   rainbow).
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                        95


       8.2.2.1. Major Force Provider. An expeditionary unit that draws the preponderance of its
       forces or command element from a single active unit. This wartime or contingency
       organization uses the unit designation of the unit providing the preponderance of forces
       (major force provider) or the command element. (Discussed further in 8.7.3.1)
       8.2.2.2. Rainbow. An expeditionary unit formed from multiple force providers. This
       wartime or contingency organization does not have an identifiable major force provider.
       These organizations are inactive historical units converted to provisional status and
       assigned to, and activated by MAJCOMs as expeditionary organizations. (Discussed
       further in 8.7.3.2)
       8.2.2.3. MAJCOM A1Ms will establish procedures for requesting the establishment of
       expeditionary units assigned or attached to subordinate AETFs.
   8.2.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will forward copies of G-series orders to AF/A1MO,
   the Air Force Historical Research Agency (HQ AFHRA/RSO), all units mentioned in the
   order, and other offices and units as needed. (Discussed further in 8.11)
8.3. PAS Codes. Provisional units have the same command relationship characteristics and
PAS code requirements as permanent units. MAJCOMs request provisional PAS codes per
current instructions. PAS codes will be assigned and registered in the PAS system. The PAS
code for provisional units will be represented by an "H" in the fifth digit of the eight digit PAS
instead of an "F" (i.e., "EP2CHR9C" vs. "EP2CFR9C"). The use of "H" serves two primary
purposes: provides distinction between provisional units and regular units; and keeps the
provisional PAS code compatible with the joint reporting systems.
8.4. History.
   8.4.1. Traditional provisional organizations as described in 8.2.1 are temporary and once
   inactivated, their lineage ceases and may not be revived. Any provisional unit of this type
   using the same nomenclature as a previous provisional or permanent unit may not claim the
   lineage, history, or honors of that unit.
   8.4.2. Major force provider expeditionary organizations as described in paragraph 8.2.2.1
   are temporary and once inactivated, their lineage ceases and may not be revived; however,
   any honors earned by this type of expeditionary provisional organization are conferred upon
   its single major force provider of the same organizational level (squadron to squadron; group
   to group, etc.) in accordance with AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and
   Heraldry. For this purpose, wings are considered on the same organizational level as groups
   and squadrons on the same organizational level as numbered flights.
   8.4.3. Rainbow expeditionary organizations temporarily converted from permanent to
   provisional organizations as described in 8.2.2.2 retain all lineage, history, and honors of the
   permanent unit and, when returned to permanent status, retain all lineage, history, and honors
   earned while in provisional status. Honors earned by a rainbow unit are retained by the
   rainbow unit and are not shared with units that provided personnel for the expeditionary
   organization.
   8.4.4. For specifics on lineage, honors, and heraldry refer to AFI 84-105, Organizational
   Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry.
 96                                                             AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


8.5. Designations. MAJCOMs will title provisional units to reflect their functional mission. To
the maximum extent possible, use existing nomenclature. Traditional provisional units will
include the term provisional in the unit designation to indicate the unit is provisional, for
example, Headquarters 849th Mission Support Group (Provisional) or HQ 849 MSG (P).
MAJCOMs must submit an organization change request to AF/A1M IAW Chapter 5 of this AFI
for approval to create new unit nomenclatures (organization kind).
   8.5.1. For traditional provisional units, MAJCOMs should select a unit designation that
   cannot be confused with another unit and does not have the same designation as an active
   unit.
   8.5.2. Designate expeditionary units as directed in paragraph 8.7 and Figure 8.1.
8.6. Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). The Air Force component in a joint
force will organize as an AETF. An AETF has a commander of Air Force forces
(COMAFFOR), a staff, appropriate command and control mechanisms, and tailored and fully
supported forces to meet specific mission requirements. The AETF will be organized into a
numbered expeditionary air force (NEAF), air expeditionary wings (AEW), air expeditionary
groups (AEG), and air expeditionary squadrons (AES), or other organizations, as necessary to
provide reasonable spans of control. When directly supporting a unified combatant command,
the AETF is attached to the Air Force component. When an AETF is established to support a
joint task force subordinate to a unified combatant command, the AETF may be attached for
administrative control directly to the Air Force component to the unified combatant command, or
it may be assigned to an AETF established at the unified combatant command level.
   8.6.1. An AETF is named based on the unit providing the senior command headquarters, its
   size (NEAF, AEW, AEG), and the operation name.
       8.6.1.1. For a NEAF level AETF, use the numerical designation of the engaged NAF,
       followed by Expeditionary Air Force (EAF), then the name of the operation. For
       example, a NEAF-sized AETF established under 12AF (AFSOUTH) would be
       designated as 12 EAF-OPERATION NAME.
       8.6.1.2. For wing- or group-sized AETFs, use the numerical designation of the engaged
       wing or group, followed by Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) or Air Expeditionary Group
       (AEG), then the name of the operation. For example, a wing or group-sized AETF
       established under 12AF (AFSOUTH) would be designated the 345 AEW-OPERATION
       NAME or the 345 AEG-OPERATION NAME.
       8.6.1.3. While not normally established, a squadron sized AETF would use the
       designation of the engaged expeditionary squadron followed by the operation name.
   8.6.2. Refer to appropriate Air Force and Joint doctrine for additional guidance on
   organization and command relationships.
8.7. Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Organization:
   8.7.1. Expeditionary units are established to operate with an AETF. In the following
   paragraphs, the term ―supported command‖ refers to the Air Force MAJCOM the AF
   component command is administratively assigned to and which is receiving support (i.e.,
   forces) from other MAJCOMs. ―Supporting command‖ refers to the Air Force MAJCOM,
   FOA or DRU providing forces to the supported command.
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                       97


  8.7.2. Permanent units supporting or participating in an AETF from their permanent
  locations are not redesignated as expeditionary units nor are major force provider
  expeditionary units established at the same location as the corresponding permanent unit. In-
  place permanent units supporting or participating in an AETF can be attached to the
  expeditionary unit they are supporting.
  8.7.3. Expeditionary units are numbered as follows.        See also Figure 8.1 for detailed
  guidelines on AEF unit naming and numbering.
     8.7.3.1. With the exception of support units, the numerical designation for expeditionary
     units that have a major force provider will reflect the designation of the unit that provides
     the preponderance of forces or the command element to the expeditionary organization.
     For example, if the 4th Fighter Wing is the major force provider of an Air Expeditionary
     Wing, then the nomenclature would be 4th Expeditionary Fighter Wing (EFW). If there
     is a mix of forces (e.g., fighter, mobility) then the nomenclature would be the 4 AEW.
     The organizational level of the expeditionary unit must be the same as the unit providing
     the preponderance of forces, except for the situations in paragraphs 8.7.3.1.1 and
     8.7.3.1.2.
         8.7.3.1.1. If size and scope of an operation do not warrant establishment of a wing, a
         group nomenclature may be used. For example, if the 4th Fighter Wing is the major
         force provider of an Air Expeditionary activity that does not have the appropriate
         scope or size to be designated a wing, a major force provider unit designated the 4th
         Expeditionary Fighter Group or 4th Air Expeditionary Group could be established.
         8.7.3.1.2. If the size and scope of an operation do not warrant establishment of a
         squadron, a numbered flight nomenclature may be used. For example, if the 4th Civil
         Engineer Squadron is the major force provider for an expeditionary mission, but size
         does not warrant a squadron designation, a major force provider unit designated 4th
         Expeditionary Civil Engineer Flight could be established.
     8.7.3.2. The numerical designation for expeditionary units that do not have a major force
     provider will reflect the designation of an historic unit activated to form a rainbow unit.
     In cases where multiple MAJCOMs deploy forces to the same location, but a single
     major force provider cannot be identified, the supported MAJCOM will create
     expeditionary units using historical ―rainbow‖ units allocated for their use by AF/A1MO.
     The numerical designation for expeditionary rainbow units will retain the numerical
     designation of the historic unit converted from permanent to provisional status.
     MAJCOMs must work with their historians and the Air Force Historical Research
     Agency to identify inactivated units to fill rainbow expeditionary unit requirements to
     meet highest projected demand and provide those units to AF/A1MO. AF/A1MO will
     issue a Department of the Air Force (DAF) numbered letter converting the inactive
     historic units to provisional units and assigning them to the MAJCOM to activate or
     inactivate in provisional unit status as needed. (Figure 8.2)
98                                                             AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011


     8.7.3.3. All subordinate dependent groups and support units will carry the same
     numerical designation as the parent expeditionary organization. For example, support
     units under the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Wing would be designated the 4th
     Expeditionary Operations Group, 4th Expeditionary Maintenance Group, 4th
     Expeditionary Maintenance Squadron, 4th Expeditionary Mission Support Group, 4th
     Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron, 4th Expeditionary Medical Group.
     8.7.3.4. If portions of an organization are deployed to different locations, MAJCOMs are
     authorized to include the name of the operation and location in the unit designation (e.g.,
     71st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron – Noble Anvil, Location Name).
AFI 38-101 16 MARCH 2011                                                                 99

8.8. Attaching/Assigning Provisional Units. Provisional units are assigned to a higher echelon
provisional unit or attached to a higher or same echelon permanent unit. All expeditionary units
are assigned to an AETF or attached under a component NAF and under the administrative
control (ADCON) of the Air Force Service component for the geographic region in which forces
are based. If a deployed expeditionary unit is not assigned or attached to the regional
COMAFFOR (i.e., the forces are not formally transferred by Secretary of Defense order and the
owning unified combatant command retains control) then a host-tenant support agreement is
required to define support requirements.
8.9. Administrative Control (ADCON). The ADCON responsibilities of the gaining
commander can vary by scenario and should be specified in G-Series orders. The supporting and
supported MAJCOMs must work together to ensure the degree of ADCON responsibilities is
clearly understood. Specified ADCON responsibilities are included in AFDD 1.
8.10. UCMJ authority resides concurrently with the commanders in the assigned and
attached units, and does not need to be explicitly stated in G-series orders. See 51-series
AFIs for specific information on disciplinary and UCMJ matters.
8.11. G-Series Orders. AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, provides guidance on the
preparation of administrative orders. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must publish G-series
orders to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign or attach provisional (including expeditionary)
units. The G-Series order provides the legal authority for provisional units. Examples of G-
Series orders for provisional and expeditionary units are shown at Figures 8.3 – 8.7.
MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must forward copies of unclassified and classified orders to HQ
USAF/A1MO, the Air Force Historical Research Agency (HQ AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault
Circle, Maxwell, AFB AL 36112-6424), and all units mentioned in the order. MAJCOMs,
FOAs, and DRUs will use the Air Force Organization Status Change Report (RCS: HAF-HO
(M) 7401) to document the organizational changes to provisional units IAW AFI 84-105,
Organization, Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry.
   8.11.1. G-series orders for expeditionary units will be prepared by the supported MAJCOM
   (reference paragraph 8.7.1) or in cases where forces will not be attached, by the MAJCOM
   retaining operational control. The supporting and supported MAJCOMs must work closely
   together on drafting the G-series orders to ensure ADCON responsibilities are spelled out
   and the AETF commander’s concept for organization and unity of command are understood.
   8.11.2. Command Relationships. The ground rules for command relationships are outlined
   in Joint Publication 1 and AFDD 1. The supported and supporting command must work
   closely together to develop the best organization structure to support mission requirements
   and build a clear chain of command.
   8.11.3. Activation and inactivation dates may be specified in the same G-series order.
   8.11.4. MAJCOMs may add the name of the operation and location to any unit in the G-
   series orders.
   8.11.5. G-Series orders should be classified and declassified according to the security
   classification guidance published for the exercise or operation. Classified orders must have
   appropriate paragraph marking, classified by, and declassification guidance. Every effort
   should be made to declassify the orders as soon as permissible or use a specific event (i.e.
   activation date) as the declassification date.

  8.11.6. G-series orders for recurring and major exercise (when required) units will follow the
  same basic conventions as those used for expeditionary units.
  8.11.7. A G-series order is not required to establish a provisional or permanent MAJCOM
  headquarters. A DAF A1M letter is the authority and establishes the specific MAJCOM
  headquarters activation date.
