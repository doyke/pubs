SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction must be completely reviewed. The major change occurred when AFI 31-204,
Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision was replaced with AFI 31-218(I), Motor Vehicle
Traffic Supervision and AFMAN 31-116, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision was
created. The Traffic Safety Working Group name was changed to Traffic Safety Coordination
Group. Rental vehicles are now required to be registered at the 39 SFS Pass and ID during duty
hours and at BDOC after hours and non-duty days within 24 hours. Failure to comply will result
in improper registration and the renter will be assessed the points and/or could result in
suspension of driving privileges. Installation speed limit changes from 40 KPH to 30 KPH base
wide unless otherwise posted

     Forces Member will witness the signing of the form. The recipient is then responsible for
     briefing the offender and providing him or her with a copy of the letter at the earliest
     opportunity. A copy of the letter is provided to the offender and the original is attached to
     the security forces report. The “Notice of Preliminary Revocation of Driving Privileges”
     letter issued by Security Forces specifies the violator’s recourse of action and is considered a
     “suspension of driving privileges” until a final disposition is determined. Driving privileges
     will remain suspended pending determination of final action by the base driving suspension
     or revocation authority (39 MSG/CC). Patrolmen will not confiscate any type of driving
     license; it is the First Sergeant or Commander‘s responsibility upon suspension. 39

     designated representative.
     2.3.2. Penalty for Driving While Under Suspension or Revocation. The revocation period
     for drunk driving is 1 year. If the member is caught driving while on suspension or
     revocation, he or she may have an additional 2-year revocation period added.

     resolution of intoxicated driving incidents under the following circumstances: Conviction by
     Turkish authorities for drunk driving or refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested
     chemical test to determine BAC for alcohol or other drugs. Military personnel arrested or
     apprehended by host nation police for traffic related offenses must report this information to
     the Security Forces BDOC within 24 hours of the incident. Failure to report this contact is a
     violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
2.4. Administrative Due Process For Suspension and Revocations.
     2.4.1. Air Force will use administrative due process for suspensions and revocations
     procedures outlined in AFI 31- 218(I), chapter 2-6.
2.5. Restricted driving privileges or probation.
     2.5.1. An individual desiring partial or restricted on-base POV driving privileges will submit
     a letter to his or her commander. If the unit commander agrees with the individual, the letter
     is endorsed and forwarded through the 39 SFS/S5R to the 39 ABW/CC or designee for final
     disposition.
     2.5.2. When an individual is authorized restricted driving privileges (POV or GOV), the
     individual will provide a copy of the limitation letter to 39 SFS/S5R. The individual will
     keep a copy of the limitation letter with him or her or in the vehicle while operating it. This
     letter must be produced upon demand by proper authorities. Limited privileges must be
     specific, indicating type of limitation, and the date and time the privileges are reinstated. If
     the suspension or revocation was the result of host nation court action, close coordination is
     required with the Staff Judge Advocate‘s office regarding any restricted driving privileges.
2.6. Reinstatement of driving privileges.
     2.6.1. See AFI 31-218(I), chapter 2-13 for reinstatement of driving privileges procedures.

  ACCIDENT REPORTING AND IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. Responsibilities. Drivers are responsible for immediately reporting accidents involving
POVs and GOVs, unattended vehicles, personal injury, or death and/or damaged property to
BDOC regardless of the degree of damage. A person involved in a traffic accident must remain
at the scene if injuries or damage to property of others is inflicted. The person involved in a
minor vehicle accident may only leave the scene if they have waited a reasonable period of time,
considering the circumstances (i.e. minor property damage), but must report the accident
immediately or within 24 hours to the proper law enforcement authorities. Additionally, if
contact is made with the victim, the person involved must make his identity known.
6.2. Duty to Give Information. All drivers or owners of vehicles involved in accidents will
provide the pertinent information (i.e. operator names, vehicle owner names, vehicle license
plate number, VIN number, make and model of vehicles involved, names of any
witnesses/passengers, insurance company name and policy number, and operators should take
pictures if at all possible) to any person injured in an accident or the driver, owner, occupant or
any other person attending any vehicle or property damaged in an accident. In all cases, the
above persons will produce and surrender their ID card, appropriate license, vehicle registration
and current insurance card to the Security Forces.
6.3. Vehicle Accident Investigations. In addition to Security Forces personnel, Turkish
Jandarma, 39 ABW/SE, 39 ABW/SJA and Flight Safety (when aircraft are involved) are
authorized to conduct investigations of on-base motor vehicle accidents and receive accident
data.
6.4. On-Base Minor Vehicle Accidents. A minor accident is any accident in which there are
no fatalities/injuries and when it would be reasonable to assume that the cost to repair any
vehicle/property damage is less than $9,999. Operators are responsible for exchanging all
pertinent information. Security Forces may respond to minor traffic accidents if not on higher
priority responses. In cases where they are not able to respond, personnel will be directed to the
BDOC, Bldg 548 to complete an accident report. Personnel must bring all vehicle information
as well as have the date, time and location of the accident available to file in the report.
Reference 6.6 for Major Vehicle accidents.
   6.4.1. Fleeing the scene of an accident (i.e. failing to attempt to make contact with the
   vehicle owner or contacting Security Forces prior to leaving the scene of an accident) will
   result in a traffic ticket, which carries a minimum of a 6-month suspension of driving
   privileges.
6.5. Off-Base Vehicle Accidents.
   6.5.1. The driver of any motor vehicle involved in an off-base traffic accident will
   immediately report the accident to local authorities. Local authorities should investigate off-
   base accidents. The on-call 39 ABW/SJA will be contacted for all off-base accidents where
   the individual is being held by Jandarma or needs legal representation. Individuals should
   immediately notify BDOC at the first available opportunity. NOTE: Do not move the
   vehicle until local authorities, Turkish National Police (TNP) or Jandarma respond. If the
 32                                                       INCIRLIKABI31-116 13 JUNE 2013


   vehicle(s) are moved, the responding authorities will not conduct an investigation of the
   accident and the operator(s) could be held liable for repair cost to the vehicles involved.
   6.5.2. Detachment 522, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) with the
   assistance of a certified 39 SFS traffic accident investigator, if allowed will conduct
   investigations of off-base traffic accidents involving fatalities of military members or
   military member involvement, where homicide or suicide is suspected. AFOSI will monitor
   the Turkish National Police (TNP) investigation and/or facilitate liaison between the base and
   TNP. AFOSI or the 39 SFS will normally not conduct investigations of other off-base traffic
   accidents but will obtain official police reports from the responding off-base law enforcement
   agency. If 39 SFS is called out to an off-base traffic accident involving a fatality or serious
   injury of a US DoD employee or affiliated US citizen, in order to preserve potential evidence
   and document the accident scene, 39 SFS personnel will respond with a video camera, still
   camera, on-duty interpreter and an AFOSI agent (to facilitate liaison with TNP).
6.6. Major Traffic Accidents. The 39 SFS will conduct detailed investigations of all on-base
major motor vehicle accidents with an estimated vehicle or property damage over $10,000 or any
injury. When available, a certified traffic accident investigator will be used to investigate major
accidents in which substantial injury or damage was sustained. The AF Form 1315, Accident
Report, will be used to document all major vehicle accidents.
6.7. Traffic Accident Notifications. In addition to security forces, the following agencies will
be notified of on-base motor vehicle accidents:
   6.7.1. 39 ABW/SE for all vehicle accidents and vehicle mishaps.
   6.7.2. 39 ABW/CP (Command Post) for all major vehicle accidents.
   6.7.3. 39 ABW/CC for all major vehicle accidents involving injuries or fatalities.
   6.7.4. Alert photography for all minor and major vehicle accidents requiring pictures.
   6.7.5. Squadron Commander of a military member or affiliate involved in a vehicle accident.
   6.7.6. Squadron First Sergeant of a military member driving a GOV involved in a vehicle
   accident.
   6.7.7. Appropriate site manager for civilian employees involved in a vehicle accident
6.8. Impounding Privately Owned Vehicles. Refer to AFI 31-218(I), Chapter 6 and AFMAN
31-116, Chapter 6. Additionally, below are local procedures.
   6.8.1. Unreasonable periods: Any motor vehicle stopped or parked in violation of
   installation parking rules for a period in excess of 72 hours. Includes parking lots (Army/Air
   Force Exchange Services, Bowling Center, Commissary, Passenger Terminal etc.), unless
   otherwise approved by the appropriate authority. The 72-hour warning period begins when
   the DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, is placed on the vehicle. NOTE:
   Individuals on TDY or leave must make arrangements through their unit to monitor vehicles.
   Units will contact security forces immediately if a DD Form 2504 is discovered on a TDY or
   leave individuals vehicle.
   6.8.2. Potential Threat: Any motor vehicle deemed to present a potential threat, risk, public
   nuisance or menace. Vehicles left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or
INCIRLIKABI31-116 13 JUNE 2013                                                                33


  off-limits area will be considered a potential threat and will be a reason for vehicle
  impoundment.
  6.8.3. 39 SFS Investigations (39 SFS/S2I) is ultimately responsible for impounding vehicles
  IAW AFI 31-218(I), Chapter 6 and AFMAN 31-116, Chapter 6. Impounded vehicles will be
  towed by 39 LRS/LGRV and stored at the 39 SFS Impound Lot. Requests for towing should
  be made through the Vehicle Operations dispatcher by 39 SFS/S2I or BDOC. Only mission-
  essential operations will delay the towing of vehicles designated for impoundment.
     6.8.3.1. 39 SFS/S2I is responsible for conducting an inventory of the vehicle’s contents
     IAW AFI 31-218(I), Chapter 6 and AFMAN 31-116, Chapter 6. All documention will be
     kept on file with 39 SFS/S2I. 39 SFS/S2I will provide copies of DD Form 2505,
     Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization, if a contracted wrecker service is used and
     DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report to 39 LRS/LGRV. If contraband is found,
     the search and/or inventory will stop, the vehicle will be secured by 39 SFS/S2I and
     AFOSI will be contacted for instruction. NOTE: The 39 SFS and 39 LRS/LGRV are
     neither responsible nor liable for any damages incurred to an impounded vehicle while
     being towed or stored. This includes all POVs and GOVs. Damage expenses are the
     responsibility of the owner or assigned unit.
     6.8.3.2. The owner of an impounded or towed vehicle is responsible for any fees
     associated with storage of the vehicle. Impoundment fees are based on a $25 initial
     impoundment fee plus $1 for each day of impoundment. The 39 SFS/S2I will not release
     the vehicle until the owner has completed a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher
     that has been processed through the 39th Comptroller Squadron.
  6.8.4. If no owner of the abandoned vehicle comes forward, 39 SFS/S2I begins tracer actions
  to identify the owner. 39 SFS/S2I will use all means available to identify the owner of the
  vehicle. There shall be three attempts made to locate the owner of the vehicle IAW
  regulation. Each attempt shall not be less than 30 days. After three attempts, the matter shall
  be turned over to the 39 ABW/SJA for coordination on declaring the vehicle abandoned.
  Once declared abandoned, the vehicle will become property of the United States government
  in order to be properly disposed.

Terms
Abandoned Vehicle— Vehicles that have been stationary for an extended period and vehicles
missing license plates or other evidence of ownership are vehicles that will become officially
“abandoned vehicles”.
Crosswalk— Any portion of a roadway, at an intersection or elsewhere, distinctly marked for
pedestrian crossing by lines, or other markings on the roadway surface.
Divided Road— A road that is divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for vehicular
traffic.
Driver— Any person who drives or is in physical control of a motor vehicle, including
motorcycles, motor scooters, and mopeds, or exercising control over or steering a towed vehicle.
A driver is in physical control when in position to control the motor vehicle, whether to regulate
or restrain its operation or movement. For example, sitting in a parked car behind the steering
wheel, keeping it in restraint or in a position to control its movement. The word “driver” is
interchangeable with the word “operator.”
Driving on Suspension or Revocation— Operating a motor vehicle while driving privileges are
suspended or revoked.
Indecent and Obscene Material— Written or graphic material that is considered indecent
because it describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in terms or in a way that is
patently offensive as measured by contemporary standards. Such material is obscene if, taken as
a whole; the material appeals to prurient interest in sex; is offensive because it affronts
contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual
matters, and is utterly without redeeming social value.
INCIRLIKABI31-116 13 JUNE 2013                                                                 37


Intersection— A place where two or more streets meet. The junction of an alley or driveway
with a street or highway is not an intersection.
Motorcycle— Any motor vehicle having a seat or saddle for the use of its operator and designed
to travel on not more than three wheels (includes mopeds, motor scooters, and pocket bikes; does
not include ATVs).
Motor Vehicle— Any transportation device with a motor powered by fossil fuels, electricity, or
other external sources of energy, except devices moved by human power or used exclusively on
stationary rails or tracks. For the purpose of this Instruction, bicycles are considered motor
vehicles when operated on roadways.
Moving Violation— A violation of any traffic law, ordinance, or directive while operating a
vehicle.
Non—Moving Violation- A violation of the Incirlik Air Base Traffic Code when the vehicle is
not in motion, such as parking violations, excessive noise violations, major vehicle repairs, and
abandoned vehicles.
Non—Moving Violation Suspension- A suspension of driving privileges not to exceed 6
months for an individual who accumulates three non-moving violations within a 12-month
period.
Open container— any bottle, can, or container from which the seal has been broken, or the
contents partially removed.
Parking— To bring a vehicle to a stop and keep it at the edge of a public way; to leave
temporarily the vehicle on a public way or in a parking lot or garage.
Pedestrian— Any person not in or on a motor vehicle or other road vehicle.
Ready possession— means located in the passenger compartment of the vehicle accessible to
the driver or any passengers.
Recreational Motor Vehicles (RMVs)— These vehicles typically are not registered as road use
motor vehicles. This group includes vehicles manufactured solely as off-road motorized vehicles
or transportation devices. The design may be for paved, unpaved, or unimproved surfaces but
they do not typically comply with vehicle safety standards required for vehicle registration or
roadway use in the state, territory, or host nation. These vehicles do not fall in the general
categories of agricultural, construction, or industrial use vehicles. They include, but are not
limited to, all the following privately owned battery or fossil fuel powered motorized vehicle and
devices; non-street legal race cars, racing carts, off-road motorcycles, go-carts, motorized
skateboards, snowmobiles, personal golf carts, Gators, GO-PEDS, utility carts, mini-
motorcycles, dune buggies, pocket bikes, and self balancing or similar standing human
transportation devices. This includes all off-road vehicles categorized by DoDI 6055.04 as Other
Specialty Vehicles (OSV). Not included in this category are motorized devices that allow people
with disabilities to move as pedestrians, such as wheelchairs. Also not included are motorcycles,
mopeds, seated motor scooters and motor assisted bicycles authorized by applicable traffic codes
to be used in traffic.
Right-of-Way—precedence in passing afforded to one vehicle over another by custom, decision,
or statute; the legal right of traffic to take precedence; the legal right to take precedence over
others.

Stop— A stop is when there is no forward momentum from the motor vehicle. The longer the
stop, the more discernible it is to the naked eye, giving a motorist a better chance of avoiding a
traffic ticket.
Traffic Control Devices— Signs, signals, and markings used by the authorities to regulate, warn
or guide traffic.
Unlicensed Person— Any person who failed to accomplish the prescribed requirements to
obtain a valid vehicle operator’s license for the vehicle they are operating.
Unreasonable period of time— Any motor vehicle stopped or parked in violation of installation
parking rules for a period in excess of 72 hours. Includes parking lots (Army/Air Force
Exchange Services, Bowling Center, Commissary, Passenger Terminal etc.), unless otherwise
approved by the appropriate authority.

                     EXAMPLE OF TRAFFIC TICKET REBUTTAL

MEMORANDUM FOR 39 SFS/S5R

FROM: 39 XX/XXX

SUBJECT: Rebuttal for Traffic Violation for SSgt John P. Doe: Ticket Number H123456

1. On 29 August 2012 at approximately 2136L, I, John P. Doe, was cited with a traffic violation
(Ticket#: H123456). The patrol, SrA Jan Goode, asked for my documents and did not state why
I was being pulled over. She returned with my citation then stated that I exceeded the speed
limit by driving 48 kilometers per hour (kph) in a 40 kph zone. I did not exceed 43 kph. I have
included two witness memorandums to support this. My vehicle has a rather large LED screen
which displays my speed in kilometers. This is easily seen by passengers in my vehicle. Also,
my speedometer is accurate as I have had it checked by the base auto hobby shop to ensure it is
calibrated correctly.

2. Please contact me at DSN 676-XXXX for any questions or concerns.
