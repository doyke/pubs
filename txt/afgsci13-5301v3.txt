SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidance that clarifies requirements for REACT crew
training programs. Interim change guidance adds Air Force Instruction 13-530 to introductory
paragraph, removes HQ AFGSC/A3 as the approval authority for supplements, provides policy
for combat crew mission planning along with eliminating references to pre-departure briefing
requirements, removes requirement for 20 AF to develop manual hardening, OLYMPIC PLAY
and Giant Ball checklists, removes references to conducting Launch Control Equipment Building
inspections, allows computer-generated versions of the classified material inventory form,
adjusts verbiage on who is placed on Assignment Availability Code 55 and incorporates
administrative changes. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

                               PRE-DEPARTURE / DEPARTURE

2.1. Mission Planning.
     2.1.1. Missile Combat Crew Mission Planning Responsibility. Effective mission planning
     gives crews the opportunity to apply critical thinking skills necessary to execute alert, Missile
     Procedures Trainer (MPT) training, operational training events or evaluation events. The
     goals of mission planning are to identify the tasks to be accomplished, integrate and de-
     conflict the plan, assess and mitigate risk, share lessons learned and utilize the insight of
     experienced personnel.
        2.1.1.1. Mission planning will be conducted prior to any alert, MPT training event or
        evaluation event. The duration and scope of mission planning may be tailored based on
        local directives from the OG/CC.
        2.1.1.2. Mission planning should be accomplished as a crew, squadron and group, as
        applicable. Crew commanders are ultimately responsible and accountable for ensuring
        all mission planning materials are current and command guidance is followed.
        2.1.1.3. All crewmembers must be present during mission planning unless specifically
        excused by squadron operations officer or higher authority.
        2.1.1.4. All personnel dispatching for a field evaluation, training alert or other related
        actions must be briefed on the information in paragraph 2.1.2.2.2. at a minimum prior to
        departure, and will develop a plan for completing potential scenarios based on status
        briefed.
        2.1.1.5. Unit commanders will provide crews with sufficient time to accomplish crew
        mission planning and mission briefing based on the complexity of the mission,
        proficiency of the crews and resources available.
        2.1.1.6. Units will ensure mission planning facilities and materials are maintained and
        available. A copy of operations technical orders, nuclear surety and security directives or
        any other reference material helpful to mission planning in accordance with local
        procedures or weapons officer direction must be readily available.
        2.1.1.7. DELETED.
        2.1.1.8. DELETED.
     2.1.2. Mission Planning Phases. Missile combat crew mission planning consists of five
     phases: Data Gathering, Crew Preparation, Crew Plan Development, GO/NO-GO Brief, and
     Re-Planning. While these phases are distinct and have unique activities associated, some
     cross-flow between phases may occur in limited circumstances. This cross-flow will not be
     used to shorten or eliminate phases. The common themes for each phase are timely and
     relevant data for mission planning, critical thinking by crews, and crew commanders
     responsibility and accountability. The OG/CC has full discretion to delegate or personally
     conduct any phase of mission planning (e.g., OG/CC could choose to lead Commander’s
     Intent or GO/NO-GO Brief, both or neither).
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                7


     2.1.2.1. Data Gathering Phase. The goal of this phase is to provide crews with the most
     comprehensive and accurate data for use in successfully planning and executing alert,
     MPT training or evaluation events.
        2.1.2.1.1. Data gathering is primarily accomplished by the Mission Planning Cell
        (MPC) prior to crew arrival and formatted in a crew mission card by the combat crew.
        Missile combat crews are ultimately responsible for obtaining comprehensive and
        accurate data for their mission.
     2.1.2.2. Crew Preparation Phase.       This phase consists of the Quick Look and
     Commander’s Intent brief.
        2.1.2.2.1. Quick Look is intended to be quickly accomplished in the squadron prior
        to Commander’s Intent brief. Quick Look is the opportunity for the crew commander
        to certify the crew is alert ready to the squadron commander, operations officer or
        flight commander. Unit commanders have full discretion to determine the depth and
        detail of Quick Look.
        2.1.2.2.2. The Commander’s Intent brief gives the OG/CC or designated
        representative the opportunity to communicate intent prior to Crew Plan
        Development. Any supplemental training, special interest items or classified material
        issue that could affect crew mission planning should be addressed (actual issue of
        classified documents and materials can be conducted at a time determined by the
        unit). At a minimum, Commander’s Intent brief will include the following
        information (units may supplement as needed):
            2.1.2.2.2.1. Weather and current road conditions.
            2.1.2.2.2.2. Location of security teams, to include any camper alert teams, and
            any scheduled security forces changeover.
            2.1.2.2.2.3. Forecasted maintenance, to include scheduled convoys.
            2.1.2.2.2.4. MAF, LCC, Launch Control Equipment Building (LCEB) (if
            applicable) and LF status.
            2.1.2.2.2.5. Status of wing communication systems.
            2.1.2.2.2.6. Squadron timeslot assignment and any pending EWO or targeting
            actions.
            2.1.2.2.2.7. Scheduled calibrations, tests or exercises.
            2.1.2.2.2.8. Dispatching and returning crews, facility managers or chefs.
            2.1.2.2.2.9. Any scheduled visits.
            2.1.2.2.2.10. Nuclear surety (e.g. no-lone zone, etc.).
            2.1.2.2.2.11. Any required classified issue, return or supplemental training.
            2.1.2.2.2.12. Periodic intelligence briefings.      Frequency will be determined
            locally.
            2.1.2.2.2.13. Duress words.
            2.1.2.2.2.14. Electronic device restrictions.

       2.1.2.3. Crew Plan Development Phase. Crew plan development is conducted in the
       squadron (or appropriate OG mission planning facility) and is led by each individual
       crew commander. At least one flight commander or weapons officer is expected to be
       available. Crew Plan Development will utilize information from the crew mission card
       and all briefs in concert with the Mission Planning Guide (MPG). Upon completion,
       crews will discuss their plan with other squadron crews. The SCP will integrate and
       adjust individual crew plans as necessary and guide discussion of contingency plans.
       Contingency planning must involve critical assessment of the developed plan prior to
       GO/NO GO brief. It is not possible to plan for all contingencies, but crews should
       develop backup plans for those that are most likely.
       2.1.2.4. GO/NO-GO Brief.          Crew commanders communicate responsibility and
       accountability to the appropriate OG/CC, OG/CD, SQ/CC or SQ/DO by stepping through
       their plan and requesting approval to execute. GO/NO-GO Briefs are not required prior
       to MPT training or evaluation.
           2.1.2.4.1. OG/CCs have the authority to conduct this brief or delegate to OG/CD,
           SQ/CC or SQ/DO at their discretion.
              2.1.2.4.1.1. Units may develop GO/NO-GO brief format according to
              commander’s discretion that covers the following topics at a minimum: crew plan
              to accomplish all tasks, identified risks and/or contingencies, and detailed actions
              to mitigate risks.
           2.1.2.4.2. The appropriate commander will give GO or NO-GO to execute the plan as
           briefed. A NO-GO decision leads to immediate crew re-planning.
       2.1.2.5. Re-Planning. Re-planning takes the changing environment of alert duty,
       weaknesses identified in original plans and contingencies into account. Possible entering
       arguments for re-planning include re-planning based on receiving NO-GO to execute, re-
       planning based on information received from off-going crew during crew changeover, re-
       planning for morning activities on the day crews return from alert (as required), and as
       necessary when plans change.
           2.1.2.5.1. A NO-GO during the initial GO/NO-GO brief leads to immediate crew re-
           planning followed by another GO/NO-GO Brief.
           2.1.2.5.2. Crew commanders should consider information received from the off-
           going crew during crew changeover and how the new information affects their
           mission and contingency plans.
           2.1.2.5.3. On-duty crews in the field will conduct re-planning when necessary using
           data gathered from the MPC. It is not necessary to have both on-duty crew members
           awake for this type of re-planning.
    2.1.3. The Mission Planning Cell. The goal of the MPC is to ensure missile combat crew
    members (MCCM) have accurate and timely baseline data to plan for a successful alert. The
    MPC consists of squadron staff, weapons officers, SCP crews, on-duty officer, operations
    desk, or other personnel, as determined locally. The OG/CC will ensure the MPC has
    adequate personnel and resources to meet the mission planning needs of squadrons. The
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                  9


  missile combat crew retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring complete and accurate data
  for successful mission planning.
     2.1.3.1. Units will locally develop crew mission cards. The format and medium (paper
     or digital) will be determined locally. Units may designate appropriate agencies to
     provide and update the information used to populate crew mission cards. The MPC is
     responsible for ensuring information is updated and available to crews.
  2.1.4. The Mission Planning Guide. Crews will develop and use an MPG to guide planning.
  Units should supplement the MPG with reviews of recent errors, lessons learned or
  Operational Risk Management (ORM) tools, as determined locally. The following list is not
  all-inclusive but should serve as a starting point for developing an MPG.
     2.1.4.1. Overview. Discuss Commander’s Intent. Review data received during data
     gathering phase and ensure the information is reasonable and accurate. The crew
     commander should establish and communicate priorities at this time.
     2.1.4.2. Departure. Discuss vehicle type and condition, driver, passengers, weather and
     road conditions. Discuss who has the authority to approve departure.
     2.1.4.3. Weather. Discuss how weather and hours of darkness could affect any
     maintenance or security activities. Discuss dangers people in your flight area might face
     due to weather and what you need to be prepared to do about it.
     2.1.4.4. Maintenance. Discuss scheduled maintenance in your flight area. Ensure you
     can explain the ―when‖, ―where‖, ―what‖ and ―why‖ for each activity and mission
     impact. Discuss the checklists associated with maintenance activities. Discuss the
     potential implications if scheduled maintenance does not occur or does not fix the
     problem.
     2.1.4.5. Targeting. Discuss any targeting forecasted for your alert, to include what
     sorties and when. Discuss how current operational status of your flight might affect
     targeting. Step-study checklists as necessary.
     2.1.4.6. Security. Discuss the security status of your MAF, LFs and flight area.
     Determine if any sites are currently guarded and why. Discuss how scheduled
     maintenance could affect the security posture of your flight. Determine if security forces
     changeover will occur during your alert.
     2.1.4.7. Nuclear Surety. Discuss any possible impact on nuclear surety due to current
     operational status, security status or planned maintenance.
     2.1.4.8. Visitors, tests or exercises. Discuss planned visitors, tests or exercises. Ensure
     you are adequately trained and equipped for any tests or exercises.
     2.1.4.9. Training and experience. Discuss how your experience level affects your ability
     to accomplish the mission. Discuss your ability as a crew, to include whether or not you
     are an integral crew, how many activities you have performed together and how many
     times and how recently you have performed the required tasks. Discuss training goals for
     this alert. Determine any study packages or other references you need to take on this
     alert.

      2.1.4.10. Crew Rest. Discuss sleep shifts and acceptable levels of risk. The crew
      commander should clearly communicate actions or situations that both crew members
      will be awake for.
      2.1.4.11. Step through. Review the plan to check for inadequacies prior to GO/NO-GO
      brief and discuss contingency plans.
2.2. Vehicle Operations. Government Motor Vehicles (GMVs) are the primary mode of
transportation within the missile complex for combat crews.
   2.2.1. The senior ranking individual is ultimately responsible for safe vehicle operation and
   occupant safety; however, everyone shares responsibility for safety and mission
   accomplishment.
   2.2.2. Personnel will inspect the vehicle and complete/sign the AF Form 1800, Operator's
   Inspection Guide and Trouble Report.
      2.2.2.1. Conduct a vehicle inspection any time the vehicle is left unattended outside a
      secure area [e.g., Missile Alert Facility (MAF)]. Personnel will report suspicious items to
      security forces or local law enforcement.
   2.2.3. Personal items, technical order (T.O.) bags, MAF supplies and other duty equipment
   will be properly secured at all times (e.g., locked inside vehicle when unattended or secured
   with available safety harnesses during transport).
   2.2.4. Drivers must be trained and licensed on the vehicle being operated in accordance with
   AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, 20AFI 24-301, Transportation Control Center (TCC)
   Operations and Vehicle Operations Within and Outside the Missile Field Complex, and 20
   AFI 91-1, Vehicle Safety for Twentieth Air Force Missile Field Operations. Personnel will
   use approved travel routes (primary or alternates) unless the appropriate authority authorizes
   deviations.
   2.2.5. Periodic rest stops are authorized.
      2.2.5.1. When transporting critical/code components or positive control material (PCM),
      MCCMs will comply with EAP-STRAT Volume 3, Positive Control Policy, Procedures
      and Coded Control Devices (U), and EAP-STRAT Volume 16, ICBM Code Component
      Control Policy and Procedures (U), as applicable.
   2.2.6. Communication with TCC or designated agency is mandatory anytime personnel
   depart Mission Support Base (MSB) in a government vehicle.
      2.2.6.1. Very High Frequency (VHF) radios are the primary means of communication
      within the missile complex. If the VHF radio becomes inoperable due to a malfunction
      or loss of signal, a landline or cell phone is authorized to use for communication with
      TCC.
      2.2.6.2. A radio function check will be accomplished prior to departing MSB. If the
      VHF radio is inoperable, the vehicle or radio must be exchanged if operational equipment
      is available.
      2.2.6.3. Only transmissions dealing directly with mission support will be permitted.
      Transmission of classified or other sensitive information is strictly prohibited.
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                  11


   2.2.7. If an emergency or vehicle breakdown occurs in the missile complex, the operator and
   passengers will call the nearest Launch Control Center (LCC). 20 AF/A3NV will develop
   and maintain a 20 AF MCC Contingencies Checklist for MCCMs to accomplish as
   applicable.
2.3. Helicopter Travel. Personnel being flown to a MAF will be processed through helicopter
operations and briefed by the aircraft commander or designated representative in accordance
with AFI 11-202v3, General Flight Rules.
2.4. Uniform and Gear Requirements. Personnel are required to report for alert duty wearing
the appropriate uniform and with all required gear readily available.
   2.4.1. The uniform for alert duty is the Flight Dress Uniform (FDU) or the maternity Airman
   Battle Uniform (ABU) as applicable. Reference AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
   Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and AFI 36-2903_AFGSCSUP, Dress and Personal
   Appearance of Air Force Personnel, for proper wear and other uniform questions.
   2.4.2. Prior to dispatch from MSB, personnel will have in their possession a complete set of
   technical orders that are properly posted and in good operational condition, military
   identification (ID) card, driver’s licenses (state and any government-issued) and a 4-digit
   combination lock issued by the supply section.
       2.4.2.1. When directed by the operations group commander (OG/CC), personnel
       dispatching to the missile field will have in their possession all required winter weather
       gear items.
2.5. Technical Orders. Operational systems and weapon systems will not be operated without
validated and verified technical data or operations procedures. Once technical data or
operational checklists are in place, crews will use and adhere to the directions of the technical
data and checklists at all times when operating the systems.
   2.5.1. Users will ensure their personal T.O.s are correctly posted, serviceable and properly
   marked or annotated as specified in this instruction and the provisions of T.O. 00-5-1, Air
   Force Technical Order System.
   2.5.2. Every page of sections III, IV and V of each weapon system operations T.O. and
   communications T.O. must be covered with acetate. This will prevent technical data from
   being obscured by a wet-erase marker or other marking devices as well as minimize wear and
   other damage to the pages.
   2.5.3. Annotations in T.O.s will not be directive in nature and will not obscure printed
   material or change the technical content or classification of the material being annotated.
   Changing the technical content includes, but is not limited to, adding, deleting, or
   supplementing checklist steps or technical information. The intent of authorized annotations
   is to remind MCCMs of other actions or procedures.
   2.5.4. Users are responsible for prompt and accurate posting of revisions and changes to
   T.O.s in accordance with T.O. 00-5-1 prior to any event. An event is defined as weapon
   system classroom training, any MPT session, evaluation, scheduled or standby alert and
   exercise or real-world recall.
       2.5.4.1. Users will ensure T.O. changes are posted as soon as possible during exercise or
       real-world recalls.

   2.5.5. T.O.s that are not issued to any crew member or squadron and T.O.s that are not used
   for reference or training, are not required to be kept current.
   2.5.6. Superseded and removed T.O. pages are to be destroyed by shredding to prevent
   disclosure of the contents or reconstruction of the document. Reference T.O. 00-5-1 for
   further T.O. destruction limitations and authorizations.
2.6. Technical Order Distribution Office (TODO). Primary responsibility for the issue,
transfer and return of missile operations technical manuals rests with the Operations Group
Standardization and Evaluation Office (OGV).
   2.6.1. The TODO must be fully knowledgeable of technical order account management and
   distribution procedures (see AFPD 21-3, Technical Orders, TO 00-5-1, and TO 00-5-2,
   Technical Order (TO) Distribution System).
      2.6.1.1. One copy of the unclassified operations technical manual will be issued to each
      assigned crew member. The TODO may also issue sufficient copies to each missile
      squadron as a sub-account for distribution of one copy to each assigned crew member.
      2.6.1.2. The TODO will distribute and maintain two copies of the communications
      technical order at all LCCs and MPTs, as well as one copy at the Minuteman Enhanced
      Procedures (MEP) Trainer.
   2.6.2. The AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply, is
   a recommendation for a specific T.O. improvement, correction of an error, or correction of an
   omission that prevents the adequate performance of the functions required for the mission.
      2.6.2.1. Proposed emergency, urgent and routine changes will be submitted to the TODO
      through the Technical Order Distribution Alternate (TODA). These submissions will be
      reviewed by OGV for technical accuracy and, after approval from the TODO, will be
      forwarded to 20 AF/A3NV.
      2.6.2.2. Units are encouraged to submit an AFTO Form 22 to OGV if there is
      information MCCMs are consistently annotating and does not meet the above criteria, but
      is worthy of T.O. inclusion. OGV is the final local approving or disapproving authority
      for all AFTO Forms 22 initiated against the missile operations technical manuals.
      2.6.2.3. Ensure all submitted AFTO Forms 22 meet the criteria established in T.O. 00-5-
      1.
   2.6.3. OGV must review all technical data to ensure technical accuracy before distribution.
   If the change is technically inaccurate, submit an emergency AFTO Form 22.
      2.6.3.1. OGV must identify all significant discrepancies to 20 AF/A3NV by telephone
      within 5 working days of initial receipt and in writing within 7 working days of receipt of
      initial distribution.

                       ALERT PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS

3.1. Status Briefings. The on-coming MCCMs will receive status briefings from topside
personnel in preparation for their alert shift.
   3.1.1. Crews will receive a briefing from facility managers (FMs) with information on the
   overall condition of the MAF, system degrades, pending maintenance activities, system tests,
   current and expected visitors and any other discrepancies or problems at the MAF.
   3.1.2. Crews will receive a briefing from the Flight Security Controller (FSC) with
   information regarding any personnel and maintenance at a launch facility (LF) or in the flight
   area, security situations in the flight area, condition of the security response vehicles and
   radios, road and response conditions, and any suspicious activity. MCCMs will re-
   accomplish this briefing after the current FSCs changeover with a new security forces crew.
3.2. Crew Changeover. Crew changeover is a systematic process of transferring alert
responsibilities from one crew to another. Both crews share responsibility for ensuring a
comprehensive and accurate changeover is accomplished.
   3.2.1. DELETED.
   3.2.2. The LCC blast door will be closed as soon as possible after the entry or exit of the on-
   coming or off-going MCC. During periods of extended maintenance, the LCC blast door
   may remain open to allow movement of the maintenance team and their equipment. Combat
   crew commanders will use sound judgment and ensure the LCC blast door remains closed as
   much as possible.
      3.2.2.1. If maintenance must be performed during changeover, the crews will take all
      appropriate measures to ensure maintenance personnel do not observe the classified
      inventory.
   3.2.3. The on-coming crew will accomplish a changeover inventory to account for each
   Communications Security (COMSEC) item listed on the AFCOMSEC Form 16, COMSEC
   Account Daily Shift Inventory. Non-COMSEC items will be inventoried using AFGSC Form
   61, Classified Material Daily Shift Inventory. Local computer-generated versions of the
   forms are authorized.
      3.2.3.1. MCCMs will accomplish an inventory of all TOP SECRET, SECRET,
      COMSEC, USNAL 45B combinations and other cryptographic material or equipment in
      accordance with AFKAG 1N, Air Force Communications Security (COMSEC)
      Operations, EAP-STRAT Volume 3, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
      Management and AFI 33-201v2, Communications Security (COMSEC)User
      Requirements.
3.3. Checklists. MCCMs will strictly adhere to all checklists in a T.O. and US Strategic
Command (USSTRATCOM) or other higher headquarters (HHQ) directives.
   3.3.1. 20 AF/A3NV will be responsible for generating standardized checklists to cover
   actions not addressed in a T.O. or other directives (e.g., 20 AF MCC Contingencies Checklist,
   20 AF Severe Weather Checklist, etc).
 14                                                          AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011


   3.3.2. Units may develop local procedures specific to their wing when operations fall outside
   existing technical orders and HHQ regulations or checklists. Units will not supplement
   existing technical data with local procedures. Local procedures will not be used to re-create
   or consolidate existing technical data or HHQ regulations.
3.4. Field Direction. While on alert, the MCC is in command of the flight area and is
ultimately responsible for all activities, operations, maintenance, security, and personnel in the
flight area.
   3.4.1. The MCC must exercise direct command and control during any actual or potential
   situation involving the safety and security of personnel or equipment.
       3.4.1.1. Once any LF is taken into local control or status out, the maintenance team chief
       will be responsible for the safe operation of the missile system in the LF. The MCC will
       resume responsibility when status monitoring capability is restored.
3.5. Alternate Command Post/Squadron Command Post (ACP/SCP) Duties and
Responsibilities. The ACP/SCP crews are responsible to lead their squadron and wing in
executing the mission by ensuring the squadron carries out all nuclear surety and positive control
measures as well as directing various daily actions.
   3.5.1. The ACP/SCP crews will consist of individuals that have been trained and certified in
   accordance with AFGSC Instruction (AFGSCI) 13-5301v1, Rapid Execution and Combat
   Targeting (REACT) Crew Training.
   3.5.2. The ACP/SCP crews will direct and coordinate all Emergency War Orders (EWO)
   actions, targeting, exercise and other daily requirements.
       3.5.2.1. Although the ACP/SCP is responsible for accomplishing all additional duties,
       Primary Launch Control Center (PLCC) crews will support the ACP/SCP and ensure all
       duties are properly executed.
   3.5.3. Reference EAP-STRAT Volume 8, ICBM and ALCS Procedures, for additional
   ACP/SCP/Controlling Launch Control Center (CLCC) duties.
3.6. Assumption of ACP/SCP Duties. In the event an ACP or SCP can no longer perform its
function by becoming communications isolated or unable to monitor squadron weapons system
status, another SCP or LCC must assume responsibility. 20 AF/A3NV will develop and
maintain a 20 AF ACP/SCP/CLCC Assumption Checklist for MCCMs to accomplish when
assuming responsibility.
   3.6.1. Reference Figure 3.1. for devolution of command when it is necessary for an SCP to
   assume ACP responsibilities.
       3.6.1.1. If no SCP is capable of assuming ACP responsibilities, ACP roles and
       responsibilities should go to the LCC with an ACP/SCP certified crew starting with the
       senior experienced combat crew commander. If no ACP/SCP certified crew is posted on
       alert, responsibilities will go to the LCC with the senior experienced combat crew
       commander.
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                    15

   3.6.2. If an SCP can no longer perform its function, CLCC responsibility should go to the
   LCC with an ACP/SCP certified crew starting with the senior experienced combat crew
   commander. If no ACP/SCP certified crew is posted on alert, responsibilities will go to the
   LCC with the senior experienced combat crew commander.
        3.6.2.1. The CLCC will be responsible for completing all ACP/SCP duties as stated in
        paragraph 3.6.
   3.6.3. During times when SCP responsibilities will be transferred to a CLCC for an extended
   period of time, the squadron commander (SQ/CC) or operations officer (SQ/DO) is
   authorized to direct a specific LCC to assume the CLCC role and will inform crews of the
   CLCC during the squadron pre-departure briefing.
        3.6.3.1. When an SCP site is shutdown for an extended period, the combat crew
        assuming the alert at the CLCC must be ACP/SCP qualified.
3.7. Relief of Command. Operations officers and above may direct relief of a crew or crew
member on alert for personal or medical reasons and for unqualified performance in the field.
   3.7.1. An evaluator crew in an LCC may relieve a posted crew or crew member if such
   action is required to preclude loss of life or serious injury, violation of weapon system safety
   rules (WSSR) in accordance with AFI 91-114, Safety Rules for the Intercontinental Ballistic
   Missile Systems, or major damage to equipment.
        3.7.1.1. If, during the error determination process following an evaluation or observation,
        a crew member is rated unqualified in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v2, Rapid
        Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) Crew Standardization and Evaluation, the
        evaluators must relieve the appropriate crew member(s).
   3.7.2. The relieving individual must be combat mission ready (CMR) in the position being
   relieved. The relieving crew member(s) must inform the SCP and the squadron commander
   or operations officer of the change of command.
   3.7.3. If an evaluator crew relieves the on-duty crew of command to facilitate a
   standardization evaluation, the evaluator crew will be listed on the Missile Alert Duty Order
   (MADO) and complete changeover per weapon system operating instructions.
   3.7.4. HHQ evaluators or inspectors are not authorized to relieve a crew on duty in the LCC.
   If a crew member commits an error that is determined to be a restrictable field deviation or
   receives an unqualified rating during an HHQ evaluation or observation in the LCC, the
 16                                                         AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011


   evaluation or inspection team chief will immediately inform the wing, operations group, and
   squadron commanders. The unqualified crew member(s) will be replaced as soon as possible.
   HHQ evaluators or inspectors are required to supervise the crew member(s) until they have
   been replaced.
3.8. Communication. Maintaining effective communication is critical for the operations of the
weapon system as well as the safety, security, command and control of the personnel and
equipment in the missile complex.
   3.8.1. Crews will develop coordination between themselves to ensure commands and
   responses, actions and other communications are clear, unambiguous and professional to
   ensure procedures being accomplished in the LCC are warranted and that the correct
   procedures are accomplished in accordance with applicable technical orders and directives.
   3.8.2. For a scheduled communications outage, the MCC will ensure some form of backup
   communication is available with topside personnel.
   3.8.3. DELETED.
3.9. Crew Log Requirements. MCCs will use the electronic log to record events occurring
during the alert. Should the console not automatically enter required log entry details, the crew
must manually input the necessary details into the console. Logs will be written with sufficient
detail so alert activities can be reconstructed.
   3.9.1. MCCs must use the electronic log unless the console is shutdown or electronic crew
   log capabilities are unavailable, at which point MCCs will use the AFGSC Form 524, Missile
   Combat Crew Log, to record events that occur during the alert. No alterations are authorized
   in the preprinted area. Units may subdivide the large lined sections and locally overprint the
   form. Classify the AFGSC Form 524 appropriately.
   3.9.2. Crews will archive crew logs every 24 hours in accordance with technical data.
   Archived disks or prints will be kept in the LCC for one week, unless audited by unit OGV.
   After one week, archives may be overwritten or destroyed unless directed otherwise.
       3.9.2.1. LCCs should have a minimum of 14 crew log archive diskettes to ensure
       primary and backup diskettes are available for seven days.
3.10. Status Tracking. Detailed status tracking is critical for the situational awareness
necessary for the safety, security and reliability of the weapon system and personnel.
   3.10.1. MCCs will track the status of all degraded sorties and LCCs in their flight or
   squadron as applicable. This includes Partially Mission Capable (PMC), off-alert, modified-
   alert, degrades affecting LF security and hardness degrades affecting launch capability.
   3.10.2. A detailed Operator Entered Status (OES) will be used and updated to document the
   status of an LF or LCC degrade within the flight. The OES will not be deleted until the issue
   has been completely resolved.
   3.10.3. When crews are notified by Missile Maintenance Operations Center (MMOC) that a
   fault is cycling status, they may suppress the fault after notifying MMOC.
3.11. Combat Crew Aids. MCCMs may develop charts, question banks, guides or other visual

                               OPERATIONS SCHEDULING

4.1. Operations Scheduling. Adherence to safe operating procedures and WSSRs is mandatory
and has prime consideration in the planning, scheduling, briefing, and conduct of all activities.
Development of a comprehensive scheduling plan to manage personnel resources, training and
certification requirements is critical for efficient operations.
4.2. Operations Scheduling Office. Operations schedulers are responsible to publish, post and
monitor schedules for the crew force and initiate changes to the schedules based on proper
tracking of qualifications, certifications and restrictions.
   4.2.1. The MADO will be published prior to the pre-departure briefing. The MADO will be
   authenticated and distributed before the alert duty period. MCCs listed on the MADO are
   authorized to pull alert at any LCC in the wing for which they are qualified.
   4.2.2. Availability of resources will determine a unit’s ability to meet operational
   requirements. Schedulers will fill positions by applying the following priorities:
       4.2.2.1. Priority 1: Primary mission objectives.
       4.2.2.2. Priority 2: Training and evaluations.
       4.2.2.3. Priority 3: HHQ evaluations or inspections.
       4.2.2.4. Priority 4: HHQ directed missions, exercises, or system training.
   4.2.3. An operations scheduler will ensure affected squadrons are notified if a change was
   made to their schedule that is effective within 72 hours from the time the change was made.
       4.2.3.1. An operations scheduler will ensure a crew member on leave or temporary duty
       (TDY) is notified if a schedule change places or changes an event on their schedule
       during the first 72 hours of their scheduled return.
           4.2.3.1.1. Notifications will be made as soon as practical after the change is official,
           but not later than 12 hours prior to the scheduled event time.
       4.2.3.2. If a schedule change places an alert event on a crew member’s schedule within
       24 hours, an operations scheduler will notify the affected SQ/CC or SQ/DO for a
       schedule change approval. If approved, the crew member will be notified.
4.3. Crew Member Responsibility. The operations scheduling office publishes the schedule
for each crew member; however, ultimate responsibility for obtaining monthly training and other
requirements rests with each crew member.
   4.3.1. MCCMs will ensure they are scheduled or have completed monthly codes, weapon
   system and EWO training as well as the monthly trainer ride. MCCMs will ensure they are
   scheduled to meet minimum alert requirements in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v1.
   4.3.2. MCCMs will ensure they have a current Preventative Health Assessment (PHA) on
   file.
   4.3.3. MCCMs are prohibited from consuming alcoholic beverages 12 hours prior to the
   squadron pre-departure briefing for their alert duty. These restrictions also apply to MCCMs
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                  21


   scheduled for backup alert duty, or dispatching to the field for any reason (e.g., field
   observation, courier duty, training alerts, etc.).
       4.3.3.1. Possessing or consuming alcoholic beverages or controlled substances is
       prohibited within the confines of any MAF or LF, and while en-route to or from duty in
       the missile complex.
4.4. Crew Force Management. The goal is to maximize crew force experience while
sustaining staff manning at an adequate level for unit programs.
   4.4.1. Missile units will fill their company grade staff positions using internal resources to
   the maximum extent. When necessary, Permanent Change of Station (PCS) manning will be
   provided based on priorities determined by HQ AFGSC/A1 (in coordination with HQ
   AFGSC/A3TO), but careful planning and coordination should minimize these occurrences.
   Flexible application of Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 55 and AAC 39 will support
   this process.
   4.4.2. Individuals whose primary duties do not require CMR certification (e.g., plans,
   executive officers, protocol, codes) should not remain CMR certified. Officers selected for
   these positions will be near or at the end of their crew tour commitment. MCCMs should not
   fill these staff positions prior to completion of their AAC 55. Waiver requests will be in
   accordance with paragraph 4.13.5.
   4.4.3. Trained Personnel Requirements (TPR) are based on AAC 55 expiration dates;
   therefore units should not expect replacements for officers with AAC 55 waivers until the
   original AAC 55 expires. HQ AFGSC/A1 will coordinate with HQ AFGSC/A3TO on
   assignment actions of crew personnel with an AAC 55, as required.
       4.4.3.1. Waivers are not required when removal from CMR duty is the result of medical
       disqualification, permanent Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) decertification or if Air
       Force Personnel Center (AFPC) has broken the AAC 55 to meet an Air Force-level PCS
       requirement.
4.5. Crew Positions. CMR crew positions are normally filled with 13SX personnel. With the
exception of foreign nationals, personnel with another Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) may fill
CMR positions to gain operational experience.
   4.5.1. A CMR crew consists of a crew commander and a deputy. A CMR crew commander
   may be assigned two crew deputies if manning overages occur in the deputy commander
   position.
       4.5.1.1. The MCCC commands a two-person combat-ready crew during an alert. While
       on alert, the commander is normally responsible for 10 ICBMs; however, the commander
       may be responsible for as many as 50. The commander is accountable to the President,
       Secretary of Defense and the Commander USSTRATCOM for launch actions of those
       ICBMs.
       4.5.1.2. The Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander (DMCCC) is second in
       command of an ICBM flight while on alert in that flight.
   4.5.2. The MCCC is dual qualified upon upgrade to MCCC from DMCCC in the same
   weapon system.
 22                                                        AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011


   4.5.3. Refer to AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), and the
   Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) for the AFSC awarded to each crew
   position.
4.6. Crew Pairing. MCCCs and DMCCCs are paired together to form a crew; however, two
certified MCCCs may be paired together to form a dual qualified CMR crew. It is the
responsibility of the crew to build coordination, proficiency and cohesiveness.
4.7. Alert Construct and Requirements. LCCs are manned and conduct continuous operations
24 hours a day to execute the nuclear mission.
   4.7.1. The MCCC is responsible for the crew and all alert related duties at the
   commencement of the pre-departure briefing until all materials are transferred to the
   appropriate agencies upon return to MSB.
   4.7.2. An alert period starts when the MCC assumes command of the flight area and ends
   when they are relieved by another crew. Although an alert period is 24 hours, the actual time
   will vary pending early or late departure of crews due to extenuating circumstances on base
   or inclement weather.
      4.7.2.1. Under normal conditions, the MCC assumes command of the flight area and
      responsibility for operations when they sign for the Sealed Authentication System (SAS)
      documents. If SAS is not on site, the MCC assumes command upon notifying the
      command post (squadron, alternate, or wing) that changeover is complete.
   4.7.3. Only CMR certified crews consisting of at least one MCCC, will perform alert duty at
   an operational LCC.
   4.7.4. Only crews trained and certified specifically in ACP/SCP duties and procedures will
   perform alert tours at the ACP or SCP.
      4.7.4.1. A crew posted to a shutdown ACP/SCP configured LCC is not performing any
      ACP/SCP alert duties; therefore, the crew does not have to be ACP/SCP certified.
4.8. Alert Credit. Alert credit will be awarded to CMR certified MCCMs who assume
command of the flight area with the intention of completing an alert period.
   4.8.1. DELETED.
   4.8.2. Duty shifts at Vandenberg AFB in support of any 576th Flight Test Squadron testing
   or evaluation will not count towards alert currency requirements.
   4.8.3. ACP/SCP certified crews will be awarded ACP/SCP alert duty credit upon completion
   of an alert at an operational ACP/SCP or at a CLCC. Although a CLCC is not ACP/SCP
   configured, ACP/SCP duties and responsibilities are still required and are performed.
      4.8.3.1. Schedulers will ensure ACP/SCP certified MCCMs perform at least one
      ACP/SCP alert duty every 3 calendar months at an operational ACP/SCP or CLCC.
   4.8.4. MCCMs posted on alert at a shutdown LCC will be awarded alert credit even if the
   alert is performed topside.
      4.8.4.1. ACP/SCP alert duty credit will not be awarded for any crew posted to a
      shutdown ACP/SCP.
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                    23


4.9. Alert Rotation. MCCMs can expect to see a routine schedule rotation during portions of
each month to accommodate alert load and crew rest requirements.
   4.9.1. A typical rotation is defined as an alert with corresponding day off (O-day), followed
   by one day of scheduled or unscheduled activity before an alert on day four.
   4.9.2. A back-to-back alert is defined as an alert and O-day, immediately followed by
   another alert and O-day, taking place over four consecutive calendar days.
       4.9.2.1. Back-to-back alerts will not be scheduled unless approved by the OG/CC.
       4.9.2.2. Alerts extended due to inclement weather (48-hour alert or longer) or multiple
       days in the field as part of an A1/A2 or other modified crew pulling 12-hour shifts do not
       constitute back-to-back.
4.10. Alert Load. The alert load for MCCMs will vary due to manning issues and states of
readiness.
   4.10.1. Alerts extended due to inclement weather (48-hour alert or longer) or multiple days
   in the field as part of an A1/A2 or other modified crew will count as additional alerts. For
   example, an alert lasting 48 hours will count as 2 alerts and alerts lasting 72 hours will count
   as 3 alerts. Schedules should be adjusted accordingly.
   4.10.2. MCCMs in tactical squadrons are limited to a maximum of eight alert events (alerts
   and back up alerts) per month. Any request to schedule a crew member for more than eight
   alert events requires OG commander or deputy commander approval.
   4.10.3. The OG commander or deputy commander will determine the maximum monthly
   alert load requirements for MCCMs in OGV and Operations Support Squadron (OSS) as well
   as CMR flight commanders. These officers hold key CMR positions and the primary
   emphasis should be on performing their duties with an alert rate that ensures an adequate
   level of proficiency.
4.11. Backup Alert. In addition to scheduled alerts, a crew member may be scheduled for
backup alert duty in the event a scheduled crew member is not able to perform the alert.
   4.11.1. Backup alert duty starts at 0600L on the assigned day and ends at 0600L the
   following day.
4.12. Crew Rest. The purpose of crew rest is to ensure the crew member is adequately rested
before performing alert duties. Crew rest is free time, which includes time for meals,
transportation, and rest. Rest is defined as a condition that allows an individual the opportunity
to sleep.
   4.12.1. Crew rest is mandatory prior to performing alert duties, receiving classroom and
   MPT training or being administered an evaluation. MCCs must be given the opportunity for
   12 hours of crew rest immediately prior to the pre-departure briefing time or scheduled event.
       4.12.1.1. During crew rest, MCCMs should have time for meals, transportation, and the
       opportunity for 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. Unusual circumstances may occur which
       may require the OG commander or deputy commander to place a crew on duty or
       accomplish training to meet mission requirements. Every effort shall be made to ensure
       those MCCMs have a minimum of 8 hours of uninterrupted rest.
 24                                                         AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011


   4.12.2. Evaluations, crew training, MPT rides, or other mission-related duties will not be
   scheduled during a crew member’s off-day or ―O-day‖.
4.13. Crew Tour Commitment. MCCMs accomplishing their first missile crew tour
assignment are placed on an AAC 55. The AAC 55 is intended to provide a stabilized crew
force, a TPR validation tool and to ensure payback for Air Education and Training Command
(AETC) training.
      4.13.1. The code is controlled by AFPC and may be terminated for a higher-level Air
      Force priority. Personnel with an AAC 55 must perform duty in a CMR position until an
      appropriate authority waives the AAC 55, the AAC 55 expires, or their active duty
      service commitment expires and they separate from active duty.
      4.13.2. An AAC 55 will start and end in accordance with AFI 36-2110, Assignments,
      and the AFPC Stabilized Tour Guide.         The individual becomes available for
      reassignment during the assignment cycle when the AAC expires. The local Military
      Personnel Element (MPE) administers the AAC 55.
          4.13.2.1. AAC 55 dates will not be adjusted by local MPEs. For instances such as
          security clearance issues and extended DNIA status, units are encouraged to request
          extensions for members via the AFPC reclama process as appropriate.
      4.13.3. Follow-on assignments for officers at inactivating units will be determined
      through the AFPC assignment process.
      4.13.4. Officers applying for schools or special programs do not require an AAC 55
      waiver prior to the selection board. This includes boards for flying training, AF Institute
      of Technology (AFIT) programs, Top Hand, and the AF Weapons School Program.
      Officers should contact HQ AFGSC/A3T for boards not listed above. If the officer is
      selected, the unit must process a waiver to accurately account for AAC 55 commitments.
      4.13.5. A waiver is required prior to removal of officers from duty in a CMR position if
      the AAC 55 has not expired. HQ AFGSC/A3 is the AAC 55 waiver authority; however,
      this authority is delegated to the 20 AF/CC for waivers of 7-12 months and wing
      commanders for waivers of 6 months or less. Documentation of 20 AF and unit waivers
      will be in accordance with local unit procedures and will include a roster of all MCCMs
      granted AAC 55 waivers, the purpose for the waiver, the original and new AAC 55
      expiration dates.
          4.13.5.1. Recognizing the time-sensitive nature of Code Controller manning, HQ
          AFGSC/A3 will consider AAC 55 waiver requests of greater than 12 months in
          extenuating circumstances to meet mission requirements.
      4.13.6. The 20 AF/A3 is responsible for managing the AAC 55 process for 20 AF. The
      20 AF/CC may delegate AAC 55 waiver authority to the 20 AF/A3.

               OPERATIONAL TESTS, EXERCISES AND INSPECTIONS

5.1. General Information. Exercising and testing the crew force is necessary to maintain
proficiency; however, exercises, tests and inspections also provide collection agencies with
important data needed to validate the operation of the weapon system.
   5.1.1. During an exercise or test, MCCMs on alert will participate and follow directives to
   the maximum extent possible.
   5.1.2. The crew member will not jeopardize operational mission requirements to accomplish
   test or exercise actions. Real-world emergencies or priorities may dictate that a crew needs
   to withdraw from a test or exercise. The MCCMs will coordinate with the ACP/SCP and all
   appropriate agencies to cancel, postpone or withdraw from a test or exercise. When priority
   actions are complete, the MCC will resume participation as applicable.
5.2. Tests and Exercises Requiring Crew Member Participation. MCCMs will become
familiar with the procedures for all tests and exercises in which they can expect to participate.
   5.2.1. Continuing Evaluation Program (CEP).  Crews will receive periodic CEP
   communications tests from USSTRATCOM. CEP testing is used by higher headquarters to
   gather reliability data.
   5.2.2. OLYMPIC PLAY. OLYMPIC PLAY tests are initiated locally to assess missile alert
   force readiness. Checklists and procedures developed for OLYMPIC PLAY tests will be in
   accordance with AFGSCI 99-102, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Operational Test
   and Evaluation (OT&E).
   5.2.3. Communications Exercises.        Communications Exercises examine assets and
   procedures to provide end-to-end connectivity from warning sensors to national decision-
   makers to executing forces through the National Military Command System.
   5.2.4. Giant Ball. Giant Ball tests are periodically conducted to test UHF communications
   with the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS). Crew members will use the checklist
   developed by the 625 Strategic Operations Squadron (STOS) when performing a Giant Ball
   test.
   5.2.5. Security Reaction Exercises (SRE). Security forces may conduct exercises to evaluate
   security forces. Crews are required to react to all weapon system indications as well as any
   additional inputs provided by the initiating individuals, to include upgrading security
   situations or directing further security force response and termination as outlined in 20AFI
   31-133.
   5.2.6. HHQ and Joint Exercises.
       5.2.6.1. The MIGHTY GUARDIAN exercises are a joint service force-on-force
       evaluation to determine if existing DoD, service and MAJCOM policies, standards, and
       equipment are realistic and sufficient to secure a Minuteman III launch facility in the
       current threat environment. The evaluation also exercises MAJCOM proposed changes
       or mitigations to determine their operational impact on weapons security.
 26                                                          AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011


       5.2.6.2. The Global Thunder exercises are conducted by USSTRATCOM to demonstrate
       the ability of nuclear forces to execute operation plan (OPLAN) procedures and nuclear
       command, control and communication (NC3) processes.
5.3. Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). Units may request assistance from HQ AFGSC, 20 AF or
other wings to review programs for compliance with standards.
   5.3.1. Units will coordinate with HHQ SAV team or other units to determine the programs
   and depth of the review.
   5.3.2. HQ AFGSC-administered SAVs will be non-attributional. SAVs will not be treated as
   an inspection and no score/rating will be assessed.
   5.3.3. Nuclear Surety SAVs (NSSAVs) will be conducted in accordance with AFGSCI 91-
   120, Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visit (NSSAV) Program and Responsibilities.
5.4. Inspections Affecting Crew Members. Units are regularly inspected by higher
headquarters to assess their operational warfighting capabilities and readiness. Refer to AFI 90-
201, Inspector General Activities, for inspection details.
   5.4.1. Combat Capability Evaluation (CCE). The CCE provides the USSTRATCOM Task
   Force-214 (TF-214)/CC, an assessment of a unit’s combat capability by evaluating technical
   proficiency, standardization, evaluation, training processes, programs and support.
       5.4.1.1. MCCMs may reference 20 AFI 90-1, Combat Capability Evaluation (CCE), for
       details on the assessment.
   5.4.2. Compliance Inspection (CI). CIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as
   well as mission areas that are critical or important to the health and performance of
   organizations.
   5.4.3. Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspection (NORI). The NORI is designed to evaluate
   and measure the ability of units to perform their wartime, contingency, or force sustainment
   missions in support of USSTRATCOM and Joint Chief of Staff-directed OPLANs. NORIs
   focus on force generation, employment, and reconstitution and require units to demonstrate
   their operational capability of nuclear and nuclear-support in a time-constrained
   environment.
   5.4.4. Nuclear Surety Inspections (NSI). The NSI is designed to certify a unit's continued
   capability to perform its assigned nuclear mission and a unit's capability to manage nuclear
   resources while complying with applicable nuclear surety rules governing their nuclear
   mission. MCCMs must demonstrate their knowledge of weapon acceptance procedures,
   nuclear weapon system safety rules, and nuclear weapon control order handling and
   authentication procedures. The frequency in which the AFGSC/IG will conduct the NSI is in
   accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3263.05, Nuclear
   Weapons Technical Inspection.
5.5. Maintenance Training LF Considerations. One launch facility at each wing contains an
off-alert sortie without a re-entry system that is used for training maintenance teams. The sortie
may be included in exercises and may be generated to simulated alert status during HHQ
exercises, evaluations or inspections.
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                 27


  5.5.1. When the training LF is postured to simulated alert during exercises by either local or
  HHQ direction, a training reentry system (RS) may be installed and the LF may be manually
  unsafed. The MCCMs will perform all post-maintenance tests directed by MMOC.

      ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL LIMITS, RESTRICTIONS AND PROCEDURES

6.1. Duties Not Including Alert (DNIA). This process ensures individuals with medical
conditions that could affect mission accomplishment, cause mission degradation, or endanger
personnel safety do not perform operational duties.
   6.1.1. Personnel assigned to Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or CMR positions who fail to
   meet the applicable medical standards established in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
   Standards, will be placed in DNIA status and will not perform CMR/BMC duties on real-
   world systems.
   6.1.2. In accordance with AFI 48-123, pregnant crew members should be removed from alert
   duty after 24 weeks gestation. This standard may be modified as necessary for problem
   pregnancies.
        6.1.2.1. Pregnant crew members should continue to receive their required monthly
        training up to their date of delivery (as medical circumstances will allow). These crew
        members should become CMR as soon as possible after maternity leave is completed.
   6.1.3. Personnel in DNIA status who are not on convalescent leave, hospitalized, or assigned
   to quarters may perform additional duties as determined by the unit and competent medical
   authority to include receiving classroom and simulator instruction.
6.2. NetLink Usage. The LCC NetLink system is government-provided hardware and software
for conducting official and authorized government business. Usage will be in accordance with
AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use.
   6.2.1. MCCMs will practice proper information security (INFOSEC), COMSEC, computer
   security (COMPUSEC) and Operations Security (OPSEC) at all times. Do not discuss or
   reveal information about the planning and conduct of sensitive or combat-related operations
   in email or other electronic LCC NetLink transmissions. NetLink is not authorized for
   classified information.
   6.2.2. MCCMs will use sound, professional judgment in determining whether or not the use
   of LCC NetLink will impact their alert responsibilities.
6.3. Modification Proposal. The AF Form 1067 is used to propose a modification. OGV will
be responsible for collecting all AF Form 1067s and is the final local approving or disapproving
authority for all AF Form 1067s initiated for REACT discrepancies and modifications. OGV
will forward approved AF Form 1067s to 20 AF/A3NV.
   6.3.1. Anyone may propose changes to the REACT system or report software anomalies
   using an AF Form 1067. The process used to make a change is dependent on the urgency of
   the change. There are three types of changes: Emergency, Urgent, and Routine.
        6.3.1.1. Emergency changes are changes that must be made immediately in order for the
        REACT system to function. Examples of emergency changes are software anomalies
        that prevent proper EWO commit or anything that causes the REACT console to be non-
        functional.
AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011                                                                   29


          6.3.1.1.1. Notify the 20 AF/A3 of emergency changes within 6 hours. Initial
          notification may be made by phone, with the AF Form 1067 FAX or e-mail to follow.
          After duty hours and on weekends or holidays, contact the 20 AF/A3 through the 90th
          Missile Wing Command Post (WCP).
          6.3.1.1.2. The 20 AF/A3 will immediately notify HQ AFGSC/A3I that an emergency
          change is in work. Within 6 hours, HQ AFGSC/A3I will notify the Air Force Nuclear
          Weapons Center (AFNWC) ICBM Systems Division and Higher Authority
          Communication/Rapid Message Processor Element (HAC/RMPE) Software Support
          Facility (HSSF) of the required change and then FAX or e-mail the approved AF
          Form 1067.
          6.3.1.1.3. Special procedures may be necessary while some emergency changes are
          in work. 20 AF/A3 will determine when special procedures are necessary and after
          coordination with AFGSC/A3I, will forward instructions to units.
       6.3.1.2. Urgent changes are changes that do not fit the emergency criteria, but are serious
       enough to warrant change without unnecessary delay.
       6.3.1.3. Routine changes are changes that will improve system performance, but are not
       necessary to mission accomplishment.
          6.3.1.3.1. All urgent and routine changes are forwarded to 20 AF/A3NV for
          incorporation by the unit approval authority. The 20 AF/A3 will approve all AF
          Forms 1067 and forward valid changes to HQ AFGSC/A3I, who will forward
          approved changes to the AFNWC ICBM Systems Division.
   6.3.2. The REACT Concept for Software Support (CSS) details the change process for the
   HAC/RMPE software. The CSS for HAC/RMPE software is an agreement between HQ
   AFGSC/A3T/A3I/A5/A6, 532 TRS/CC, and the AFNWC ICBM Systems Division.
   6.3.3. For LCC configuration modification, 20 AF/A3NV will route modification requests
   through the appropriate 20 AF/A4 office. From there, the forms are forwarded to HQ
   AFGSC/A4 and Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) at Hill AFB. The OO-ALC
   maintains configuration control over the MAJCOM’s equipment and is the final determining
   authority for modification approval.      AFGSCI 21-104, Systems Requirements and
   Implementation Approval Process, describes the LCC configuration approval process.
6.4. Operations Review Boards (ORB). 20 AF will establish an ORB process to conduct an
investigation to determine the cause of any abnormal system response. Examples of
circumstances requiring an ORB include: major system degradation, indications of erroneous
system response/procedures with significant mission impact, and significant events where the
cause cannot be determined by initial assessment or when corrective action is beyond minimal
retraining or minor procedural changes.
   6.4.1. The ORB convening authority is the 20 AF/A3 or the wing/group/squadron
   commander at the respective organizational levels. ORB composition is at the discretion of
   the convening authority. Inform 20 AF, HQ AFGSC/A3T, and HQ AFGSC/A3I via
   memorandum when an ORB is convened (electronic versions are acceptable).
 30                                                         AFGSCI 13-5301V3 16 May 2011


       6.4.1.1. Units will establish an ORB process to determine the cause of any abnormal
       system response. An abnormal system response may include the following: hardware or
       software anomalies, WSSR violations, or security deficiencies.
       6.4.1.2. When to convene, composition, and report format will be left to unit discretion;
       however, the ORB should recommend corrective action(s) and suggest improvements to
       prevent a reoccurrence.
       6.4.1.3. Unless directed by other DoD, Air Force, MAJCOM, or other agency direction,
       units will forward their ORB report to 20 AF/A3NV.
          6.4.1.3.1. ORB minutes will be approved at the next organizational level above the
          convening authority. Send a copy of ORB minutes to 20 AF, with information copies
          to HQ AFGSC/A3T and HQ AFGSC/A3I. Unclassified electronic versions are
          acceptable and should be sent to AFGSCA3TWorkflow@barksdale.af.mil and
          AFGSCA3IWorkflow@ barksdale.af.mil. Related classified information (up to
          SECRET)          should        be       sent         via        SIPRnet         to
          AFGSCA3TWorkflow@barksdale.af.smil.mil                                        and
          AFGSCA3IWorkflow@barksdale.af.smil.mil.
          6.4.1.3.2. Forward an unclassified copy of ORB minutes documenting safety-related
          problems to HQ AFGSC/SEW at afgscsewworkflow@barksdale.af.mil. Related
          classified information (up to SECRET) should be sent via SIPRnet to
          afgscsewworkflow@barksdale.af.smil.mil.
6.5. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for New or Upgraded Systems. Prior to IOC, the
wing/group ensures operations, training, standardization, evaluation, and crew force management
programs are developed and managed to provide adequate support to the new or upgraded
system operations. The unit commander will report this status using Status of Resources and
Training System (SORTS) criteria (see AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System).
