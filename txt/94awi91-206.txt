SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised to include additional assigned responsibilities,
augmented safety procedures, and a description of exercise location. Review it entirely.
1. GENERAL: All commanders and their designated representatives must ensure that live and
blank ammunition are not introduced into training or exercise environments where they could be
commingled or mistaken for each other. The hazard of commingling live and blank ammunition
is that personnel may fire a live round under the false assumption that it is a blank round and
