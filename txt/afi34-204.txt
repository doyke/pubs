This instruction implements AFPD 34-2, Managing Nonappropriated Funds, by providing
property management guidance for activities supported in whole or part with NAFs. It covers

Office (DRMO), and nonappropriated fund (NAF) property.

This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG), unless the particular unit has
custody of Air Force NAF property. In this case, these procedures must be followed.

To fully understand procedures and terminology regarding property management, see the
referenced Department of Defense (DoD) guidance, AF Manual (AFMAN) 23-series
publications, and AF Instructions (AFI) 34-201 and 34-209.

managed IAW the guiding Air Force directive on ADPE management, AFI 33-112, Computer

Section 1A—Property Management Overview

1.1. Purpose. This publication tells Services personnel how to manage appropriated fund
(APF), nonappropriated fund (NAF), and Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO)
property and provides guidance that will ensure the procedures used to manage property are
consistent throughout the Services organization. Although this instruction describes the
responsibilities of each of the key players in the management of Services property, the activity
manager is its primary focus.
1.2. Property Management Defined.
   1.2.1. What is ―property‖? For the purpose of this instruction, property is furniture, fixtures,
   equipment, and vehicles. As used here, property does not include buildings, structures, or real
   estate.
   1.2.2. What does ―property management‖ mean? Property management covers all actions
   and responsibilities pertaining to the property’s lifecycle.
   1.2.3. What is the lifecycle for property? The property lifecycle includes all of the major
   stages in the life of a single property item, from the time that the need for having the item is
   identified; through its purchase, its use, and its repair; to its eventual disposal and/or
   replacement. Then, the lifecycle begins anew for the replacement item. Use the lifecycle
   model, below, to ensure all Services property is purchased, used, and safeguarded.

Figure 1.1. Property Lifecycle.




Section 1B—Roles and Responsibilities.

1.3. Individual Responsibility.
   1.3.1. Why is property management my responsibility? As the activity manager, the
   Squadron Commander/Division Chief has appointed you as the account custodian and
   delegates to you responsibility for the property within your facility or program.
   1.3.2. Who else has responsibilities for property during its lifecycle? All Department of
   Defense personnel and Air Force contractors are responsible for proper use and control of
   property. In other words, no one should abuse or neglect to safeguard property.
1.4. Organizational Roles and Responsibilities.
 8                                                                 AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


     1.4.1. How do I know if I have an additional role or responsibility in property management?
     Certainly, each Services organization member must protect all property under his or her
     control against misappropriation, misuse, damage, or loss. In addition, as a Services
     organization member, you may have an additional role based on AFI 38-101, Air Force
     Organizational Structures Figure 3.29 and on Air Force Instruction (AFI), AFI 34-262
     Services Programs and Use Eligibility. Figure 1.2, shown below, identifies where some of
     these property management roles reside in the Services organization. NOTE: The figure
     shown represents a large base, which has a five-flight structu re. A medium base would have
     four flights and a small base would have three flights. If you occupy a position of leadership
     within any of the functions or activities diagrammed, then you definitely have an additional
     role in Services property management and need to read further.

Figure 1.2. Services Organizations and Activities.




     1.4.2. Who in the Services organization has specific property management responsibilities?
     The Activity Managers; Property Account Custodians; Flight Chiefs; Chief, Logistics
     Support Section; RMFC and Services Commander/Division Chief all play a part in property
     management. In addition, various higher headquarters also have property management
     responsibilities. An overview of property management responsibilities is provided below. For
     a detailed list of duties, refer to Attachment 2-Attachment 9.
1.5. Activity Manager’s Responsibilities. The activity manager is the first line of defense in
the successful management of Services property. They are ultimately responsible for all aspects
of the property lifecycle for their activity. They manage the individual activities within the
Combat Support, Community Support, Family Member Support, Resource Management and
Business Operations Flights (at large bases only). In addition, Activity Managers are usually the
appointed primary Property Account Custodians for their respective activities. He or she may
designate, in writing, a subordinate to perform this duty; however, the Activity Manager
maintains the responsibility for the designated custodian’s performance. The Activity Manager’s
specific responsibilities are outlined in Attachment 2.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                        9


1.6. Property Account Custodian. The custodian is responsible for budgeting, ordering,
receiving, controlling, and disposing (i.e., custodial responsibilities) of all equipment and
supplies within his/her respective activity. Specific responsibilities are outlined in Attachment
3.
1.7. Flight Chief. The Combat Support, Community Support, Family Member Support,
Resource Management and Business Operations Flight Chiefs should ensure that Activity
Managers within their flights fulfill their responsibilities. Attachment 4 outlines specific
responsibilities.
1.8. Chief, Logistics Support Section (LSS). The chief of this section serves as the focal point
for all Services property management matters to ensure property control and disposal processes
are consistent throughout the Services organization and to maintain single point accountability
for excess and surplus property. He or she also provides logistics guidance, training and
assistance for Services activities receiving APF, NAF, and DRMO support. This individual acts
as the liaison between Services and Base Supply, Contracting, DRMO, NAFs Council and
RMFC. See Attachment 5 for a list of specific responsibilities.




   1.8.1. How can the LSS help Flight Chiefs, Property Account Custodians, and Activity
   Managers? Personnel assigned to the Logistics Support Section are trained in the Supply
   (General Schedule 2000 series) career field. They understand the supply policies and
   instructions. They can assist Services personnel in filling out the right forms; in organizing,
   accomplishing, and resolving inventories; and in properly managing the lifecycle of each
   property item. You can rely on LSS as a reference and an educator.
1.9. Resource Management Flight Chief (RMFC). The RMFC has financial and functional
responsibility for ensuring that the policies and procedures regarding property management are
followed and performed. Specific responsibilities are outlined in Attachment 6. The RMFC
provides oversight (direction and assistance) for all assets utilized in Services.
1.10. Services Commander/Division Chief. The Commander/Division Chief should ensure
that all members of their organization comply with this instruction. The Commander/Division
 10                                                               AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


Chief appoints the primary and alternate Property Account Custodians for APF, NAF & DRMO
accounts. Specific responsibilities are outlined in Attachment 7.
1.11. Higher Headquarters. At least three levels of higher headquarters have overarching,
contributory, or collateral responsibility in the performance of the procedures outlined in this
instruction. The individual major commands (MAJCOMs) primarily provide guidance and
assistance to their respective bases. The Air Force Services Agency (HQ AFSVA) provides
guidance, assistance, and training to the MAJCOMs. Headquarters Air Force Services (HQ
AF/ILV) sets policy and oversees its fulfillment. Specific higher headquarters responsibilities are
outlined in Attachment 9.

Section 1C—Training.

1.12. How do I learn to fulfill my property management responsibilities? If you are a Flight
Chief, Activity Manager (or a Property Account Custodian), or the Chief, LSS, you should
receive both formal and informal training on property management. This training should help
you establish and maintain effective, efficient communications with others involved in property
management.




1.13. Formal Property Management Training. Several classes and/or modules are available
for the formal education of property management policies and procedures. These include classes
for:
   1.13.1. Chief, LSS. HQ AFSVA conducts specific formal training classes for the Chief, LSS.
   This training covers all areas of Services property management, including management
   policies, processes, and procedures, and review of the most common deficiencies that impact
   control and disposal of NAF, DRMO and APF property.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                       11


   1.13.2. Flight Chief and Activity Manager. HQ AFSVA conducts training classes for flight
   chiefs and activity managers. These courses include a block of instruction on property
   management tailored to each different activity. Major command training monitors schedule
   base personnel to attend HQ AFSVA classes.
   1.13.3. AFIT Courses. The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) includes property
   management training modules in its courses for Services Commanders/Division Chiefs and
   Flight Chiefs.




   1.13.4. MAJCOM Training. The major commands, through regular base level staff
   assistance visits, ensure local training is scheduled for property managers on their respective
   accountability requirements.
1.14. Informal Training. The Chief, LSS, provides training to Activity Managers and Property
Account Custodians in the day-to-day performance of the procedures outlined in this instruction.
This includes account management training and on-the-job training for newly assigned
personnel. The Chief, LSS should also provide ongoing guidance and technical assistance to
Services organizations on property management regulations, policies and procedures.
1.15. Skill Exercises. HQ AFSVA has developed property accountability training exercises that
are directed at improving the property management skills of the Resource Management Flight
Chief, Activity Managers, the Chief, LSS, and Property Account Custodians. These exercises
should be reviewed in preparation for annual evaluation. The exercises are available on the Air
Force Services Agency web site at https://www-r.afsv.af.mil.

                                           Chapter 2

                PLAN, BUDGET AND ACQUIRE (1 LIFECYCLE STAGE)

2.1. Overview. This stage of the lifecycle is where property management starts. It includes all
of the preparatory steps for acquiring the property item and is intended to include procedures up
until the point of physical receipt of the property item.
2.2. Planning . Planning is the time in the property management lifecycle when you identify the
need for a property item. Planning is generally considered an annual process since requirements
must be established prior to the beginning of the budgeting process each fiscal year.
   2.2.1. Prioritization. As you build your annual property purchase plan or review your on-
   going requirements listing, you should consider and establish the priority of acquiring each
   item. The priority may be based on the expense, time sensitivity, and/or justification of each
   item.
2.3. Budgeting. Budgeting takes the priorities you identified during the planning stage and
determines how to fund the item. There are several possibilities for funding, including future
fiscal year funding, end-of-year funding, and nonappropriated funds. The process of budgeting
also includes consolidation and refinement of the various activities’ priorities made within the
planning process. Therefore, the more thoroughly you document your requirements and
justifications, the more likely your requirements will be funded in a consolidated budget.
Coordinate with the Chief, LSS on APF and NAF Requirement Budgets (NRB), all out-of-cycle
NAF purchase requests, and all five-year capital requirements and equipment plans to ensure
proper fund sources are identified and used. You will be using two basic types of funding,
appropriated and nonappropriated funds in your budget process. Do not budget for both APF and
NAF at the same time.
   2.3.1. Appropriated Fund (APF) Budget Procedures.
       2.3.1.1. Who Prepares the APF Budget? The RMFC works with Services management to
       prepare the APF budget. Activity Managers prepare a separate budget (apart from the
       NRB) for property items to be received from APFs. Activity Managers, Flight Chiefs,
       Chief, LSS and the Resource Advisor review all operational needs and property
       requirements to identify which can be purchased with APFs. AFI 65-106, Appropriated
       Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund
       Instrumentalities, provides guidance on APF funding. If APFs are not authorized, the
       Activity Manager should include the requirement in the appropriate NAF budget.
       2.3.1.2. When APFs Are Not Available. Services submit any capital or operational needs
       for which APFs are authorized, but not available, as unfunded requirements in the APF
       budget. Services may also obtain approval to use NAFs from the Installation Commander
       when APFs are authorized but not available. See AFI 34-201 for guidance.
   2.3.2. Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Budget Procedures.
       2.3.2.1. Who Prepares the NAF Budget? As Activity Managers, you must prepare your
       NRB annually before the beginning of the fiscal year (FY). Prepare your budget for a
       minimum of five years. Use the NAF Budget program to complete the NRB for your cost
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                          13


       center. Forward completed budgets to your respective flight chief for review,
       consolidation, and approval.
       2.3.2.2. Quarterly NAF Budget Updates. Although budget preparation is an annual
       requirement, it is revised each quarter, based on current performance and expected
       changes. See AFMAN 34-214 for NAF Budget procedures.
       2.3.2.3. Who Reviews and Approves the NAF Budgets? All levels of management take
       part in the review and approval process once the Activity Manager completes his or her
       activity’s budget. The installation commander approves the completed budgets for all
       NAF instrumentalities (NAFIs). See AFMAN 34-214 for NAF Budget procedures.
2.4. Acquisition. When you identify the requirement, determine the source of funding, and
have approved funding, then you are ready to order and pay for the property item. NOTE:
Another term for this is procurement. The Chief, LSS can play a significant role in the
acquisition process. Use them as a resource to conduct research for new product sources, so you
get the best quality product at the best price. In addition, the Chief, LSS will ensure the requested
item is not excess to another activity prior to purchase.
   2.4.1. APF Equipment and Supply Support. Services can use APFs for Category A and B
   activities and approved Category C activities at remote or isolated locations. AFI 65-106,
   Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation Programs and
   Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, spells out the specific uses and limitations
       2.4.1.1. Management of Allowance Standard Equipment. The Chief, LSS manages all
       Services-related Allowance Standards and ensures that all APF equipment items are
       authorized for Services use in the appropriate Allowance Standard. Attachment 10
       identifies the allowance standards that apply to Services activities.
       2.4.1.2. The Allowance Standard Retrieval System (ASRS). This system prescribes
       support equipment for Air Force organizations. Logistics managers may use this product
       to ascertain APF equipment requirements for Services activities. The ASRS is designed
       to operate on a personal computer. The application files and all associated equipment
       allowance and cataloging data for all allowance standards are written on a single
       Compact Disc – Read Only Memory (CD-ROM). This CD-ROM provides allowance
       standard and cataloging information for equipment items. The ASRS program may be
       obtained through normal publication channels.
       2.4.1.3. Changes to Allowance Standards. To request changes in Allowance Standards
       (AS), the equipment custodian must submit to the Chief, LSS an AF Form 601,
       Equipment Action Request IAW AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume II,
       Part Two, Chapter 22.
   2.4.2. Purchasing APF Items.
       2.4.2.1. For APF Purchases up to $2,500. The Activity Manager (or designated account
       custodian) uses the Government Purchase Card. Refer to AFI 64-117, Air Force
       Government-Wide Purchase Card Program for guidance on the use of this card for APF
       purchases. Record the purchase on the Government Purchase Card log.
       2.4.2.2. For APF purchases greater than $2,500. The Activity Manager or designated
       account custodian, uses AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, or AF Form 601,
14                                                             AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


     Equipment Action Request, for those items controlled through the standard base supply
     system.
  2.4.3. Purchasing NAF Items. The Activity Manager sends all purchase requests for NRB
  items to the RMFC. The RMFC reviews each request to purchase NRB items before buying
  to ensure it is an approved NRB purchase, and there are funds available to make the
  purchase.
     2.4.3.1. For NAF purchases up to $2,500. The Activity Manager or designated account
     custodian uses the NAF Government Purchase Card. Ensure the purchase is included on
     the NAF log.
     2.4.3.2. For NAF purchases greater than $2,500. The Activity manager or designated
     account custodian prepares AF Form 9, Request For Purchase and submits it to the
     NAF Contracting Office for procurement.
  2.4.4. Acquiring Excess and Surplus (DRMO) APF Supply Support.
     2.4.4.1. Support Entitlement. All Services activities can acquire DoD and Air Force
     excess and surplus property. The Chief, LSS serves as the focal point for ordering,
     control and basic accountability of DRMO property. The property custodians for each
     activity are assigned as sub-account custodians. The Chief, LSS, submits requisitions
     through base supply or directly to DRMO if Squadron/Division has a Department of
     Defense Address Accounting Code (DODAAC) on file with the Defense Automatic
     Addressing System Office (DAASO).
     2.4.4.2. Authorization Letter. Each year, the Services Commander/Division Chief must
     provide DRMO an authorization letter, delegating the authority to screen local and
     nearby DRMO assets to the Chief, LSS or alternate personnel. This annual letter of
     delegation must bear the signatures of the designated persons and be approved by the
     chief of supply.
     2.4.4.3. Request for DRMO Items Through Base Supply (Category A & B items). Use
     procedures established for property acquired from the chief of supply to account for these
     items. See AFMAN 23-110, Standard Base Supply Customer Procedures, Vol. II, Part
     13, Chapter 1, for clarification of priorities and categories.
     2.4.4.4. Requests for Items Directly from DRMO (Category C items). When submitting a
     Services request directly to the DRMO, the Services ―FF‖ DoDAAC must be cited. Use
     this support category only for administrative and other purposes that will not directly
     benefit an individual. Requisitions must include the following information:
        2.4.4.4.1. The Services account number and the signature of the Services accountable
        officer (Chief, LSS).
        2.4.4.4.2. When withdrawing property from DRMO, use the following statement,
        ―This property is obtained without reimbursement. When property is no longer
        needed or becomes unserviceable, it shall be turned in to the nearest DRMO and no
        part of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition shall be returned to the MWR
        activities/Services.‖ See Attachment 21 for a sample DD 1348-1A.
        2.4.4.4.3. When returning property to DRMO use the following statement ―This
        property was obtained without reimbursement. Property is no longer needed or
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                       15


         unserviceable. No part of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition shall be
         returned to the MWR activities/Services.‖ See Attachment 22 for a sample DD Form
         1348-1A.
         2.4.4.4.4. Who is responsible for maintaining the files for excess or surplus items?
         As the focal point for DRMO property, the Chief, LSS will set up and maintain a
         single jacket file folder relating to DRMO-acquired property. Each file should
         contain, but not be limited to, all issue, receipt, and turn-in documents relating to the
         excess and surplus property assigned. A jacket file is not required for expendable or
         consumable DRMO property. Such items may be issued to using Services activities
         on AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt .
  2.4.5. Supporting Additional Fitness Center and Exercise Rooms. Physical fitness equipment
  for unit level mini-fitness centers is authorized under certain conditions. See the preface to
  AS 410, Morale Welfare Recreation and Physical Training. AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, Part 2,
  Chapter 22, and AFI 34-266, Air Force Fitness and Sports Program, for procedures and
  responsibilities in establishing a unit mini-fitness center.
  2.4.6. Acquisition of Mortuary Supplies and Equipment. APFs are used to purchase
  mortuary supplies and equipment. For information on specific funding sources for items such
  as hardwood cases, memorial register books, honor guard equipment and supplies expended

                                           Chapter 3

                     RECEIVE & ACCOUNT (2 LIFECYCLE STAGE)

3.1. Overview. This lifecycle stage is one of the most critical in the property’s life since it
validates the use of funds (i.e., what was paid for was received) and establishes the baseline for
tracking and safeguarding the item until it is permanently removed from an activity’s inventory.
These procedures should always be accomplished prior to any use of the property.
3.2. Receive and Account Process. This process is broken into three segments or phases, 1)
initial receipt and inspection of the property, 2) proper accounting, and 3) marking or labeling
the property received. The purpose of each of these is to ensure the Services organization and
your activity are getting exactly what has been ordered and paid for.
3.3. PHASE 1 – Initial Receipt and Inspection.




   3.3.1. Inspection. When property is received, the Property Custodian should inspect the
   property and compare it to the receiving document to ensure it matches what has been
   ordered before accepting the delivery. The property should be inspected to ensure it is in
   good condition and is the make and model ordered (or a suitable replacement product of
   equal or greater value). The quantity delivered should also be the same as the quantity on the
   receipt document. If there is a problem with the order, the custodian should annotate the
   discrepancies on the receiving document. If the Government Purchase Card was used, the
   custodian should immediately notify the vendor of the problem. If a Form 9 was used to
   purchase the property, the custodian should contact base contracting and ask them to contact
   the vendor. All receiving documents indicating a discrepancy should be separately
   maintained and follow-up taken until resolution.
   3.3.2. Acceptance. After the Property Custodian has verified that the property and quantity
   received are accurate and after noting any exception or variance, they should sign and date
   the appropriate form to signify acceptance. Acceptable forms for NAF or APF items include:
   a sales slip; a delivery ticket; an AF Form 2209; DD Form 250, DD Form 1155 or a
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                        17


   certificate of acceptance for receipt. For DRMO items, use a DD Form 1348-1A or AF Form
   2005. For Government Purchase Card purchases, the cardholder records or completes the log
   to document the receipt.
   3.3.3. Disposition of Receiving Documents for NAF and APF items. The Property Custodian
   should:
       3.3.3.1. For NAF and APF property, forward the original copy of the receiving
       documents to the NAF accounting office and provide a copy of the receiving document to
       the Chief, LSS by the next duty day.
       3.3.3.2. Retain one copy and file it in their property file.
       3.3.3.3. The Chief, LSS, should file the NAF and APF receiving document in the folder
       for that particular activity and retain it until they have completed their monthly Master
       Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL) reconciliation to ensure all new property has been recorded.
       See paragraph 3.4.1 for a description of the MFAL.
           3.3.3.3.1. DELETED.
   3.3.4. Disposition of Receiving Documents for DRMO Property. The Chief, LSS should:
       3.3.4.1. Forward original copies to the NAF Accounting Office.
       3.3.4.2. Retain one copy for their files.
       3.3.4.3. Give one copy to the property custodian along with the property. The property
       custodian should file the copy in the standard property file.
   3.3.5. For Partial Receipts. Occasionally, the vendor will not be able to fill an order
   completely. Upon delivery, the Property Custodian should identify what is missing from the
   original order on any certificate of acceptance made and on any file copies the custodian is
   maintaining. If the reason for partial shipment is not provided upon delivery, the custodian
   should contact the vendor (for Government Purchase Card purchases) or ask base contracting
   (for AF Form 9 purchases) or NAF Contracting (for AF Form 2209 purchases) to contact the
   vendor for a status report. The Property Custodian should validate that the order is eventually
   completed, rescinded, or amended and file the final documents in the property file.
       3.3.5.1. Posting a Partial Receipt. If there is a partial shipment of property, the Property
       Account Custodian; Chief, LSS; and NAF Accounting Office record only the property
       actually received, regardless of the quantities shown on the invoice or shipping/transfer
       documents.
3.4. PHASE 2 - Accounting for Property Received. All NAF, DRMO, and APF furniture,
fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) classified as accountable as well as items designated as
pilferable must be accounted for from the time a Services activity takes possession or a NAFI
takes title, until ultimate consumption or disposal of the property. There are two forms used to
record Services property, the Master Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL) or the Custodian
Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL).
   3.4.1. Master Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL). The MFAL is the report used to record FF&E
   and pilferable items from all sources - NAF, DRMO, and APF (except APF property with an
   acquisition cost over $100,000). The NAF Accounting Office (AO) maintains the MFAL.
   The MFAL will be used to record property for all Air Force Central NAFIs and NAFIs under
 18                                                                AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


   the purview of the Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Advisory Board
   (AFMWRAB), the Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund Board, and the Air Force Fisher House
   Fund Board, and will also be used to record property in readiness, mortuary affairs, and
   appropriated fund dining facilities. The NAF AO will provide the Chief, LSS and applicable
   Property Account Custodian a complete MFAL on a monthly basis. See Attachment 20 for a
   sample MFAL.
   3.4.2. Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) (R14). The Chief, LSS
   or designated APF equipment custodian, accounts for APF capital accountable property with
   an acquisition cost exceeding $100,000 on the CA/CRL.
   3.4.3. DELETED.
3.5. What Constitutes Non-Accountable FF&E? Non-accountable FF&E include:
   3.5.1. NAF Bulk Purchased FF&E. Equipment type items (televisions, microwaves, tables,
   chairs, bar stools, mattresses, box springs, curtains, drapes, and other similar equipment
   items) if they meet the criteria IAW AFMAN 34-214. These items will be capitalized and
   amortized as a single line item on the MFAL unless locally identified as pilferable.
   3.5.2. NAF Quantity Supply-Type Items. Supply items (stainless steel ware, glassware,
   linens, bowling pins, irons, ironing boards, glass coffee pots/servers, clock radios, and other
   similar type items) do not qualify as expendable equipment. These items are to be set up as
   prepaid supplies or expensed directly to supply GLAC. High value supply items may be pro-
   rated for a maximum of 3 years, at a minimum pro-rated amount of $75 per month.
   3.5.3. NAF Non-Capital items. This is FF&E purchased using NAFs with an acquisition cost
   of $999.99 or less (excluding expendables and consumable items). Non-capital FF&E is
   expensed on the financial records of the using activity’s cost center at the time of acquisition.
   The same is true if the item was obtained via transfer from another NAFI.
   3.5.4. NAF Pilferable FF&E. Pilferable property is NAF FF&E with an acquisition cost
   below $ 999.99, which the Services Commander/Division Chief (on advice from the Chief,
   LSS, Activity Manager, and RMFC) locally determines has a high risk of being pilfered or
   stolen. As such, it merits additional care by the Property Account Custodian, the Chief, LSS,
   the RMFC, and the NAF AO. Pilferable items are expensed on the financial records of the
   using activity’s cost center at the time of acquisition. The same is true if the item was
   obtained by transfer from a NAFI. These items are accounted for in the MFAL.
      3.5.4.1. Examples of Pilferable Items. Typical examples of pilferable items include but
      not limited to: refrigerators, microwave ovens, wood furniture, cameras, videocassette
      recorders (VCRs), TVs, typewriters, calculators, answering machines, and computer-
      related items (i.e., printers, ZIP Drives, CD-ROMs, scanners, Palm Pilot personal digital
      assistants, cell phones, pagers). The Property Account Custodian, RMFC, or Services
      Commander/Division Chief, should carefully consider this list and determine what makes
      economical sense to track at their installation.
   3.5.5. DRMO Capital/Accountable FF&E – These are items obtained from DRMO sources
   that require NAFs for repair costs, freight, installation, and/or training of $1,000 or more with
   a useful life exceeding two years. These items are accounted for in the MFAL.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                      19


   3.5.6. DRMO Non-Capital FF&E – These items were obtained from DRMO and do not meet
   the criteria in paragraph 3.5.5 above however, they will be accounted for in the MFAL.
   (Note: Consumable type items withdrawn from DRMO are not accountable as they are
   consumed in use.)
   3.5.7. APF Capital Accountable FF&E. This is property purchased with APFs, with an
   acquisition cost of $100,000 or above. These items are accounted in the R14.
   3.5.8. APF Budget Code 9 FF&E. This is property (including Fitness Center Equipment)
   purchased with APF, with an acquisition cost between $2,500 and $99,999 (excluding
   furniture in Federal Supply Group 71). These items are accounted for in the R15.
   3.5.9. APF Pilferable FF&E. This is APF property (including Fitness Center Equipment)
   with an acquisition cost of less than $2,500 and locally considered to have a high risk of
   being pilfered. These items are accounted for in the R15.
3.6. What Constitutes Accountable FF&E? There are several categories of FF&E considered
accountable. All categories except APF Capital FF&E assets are accounted for on the MFAL.
They include:
   3.6.1. NAF Capital FF&E. This property is purchased with NAFs, has an acquisition cost of
   $1,000 and above, and has a useful life of 2 years or more. These are depreciated on the
   financial records of the using activity’s cost center code over its useful life (AFMAN 34-214,
   Procedures For Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management And Accounting, Table 7.1,
   Criteria for Capitalizing Purchases, and Table 7.2. Depreciation/Amortization Rate
   Schedules). The same is true if the item was obtained by transfer from a NAFI. These items
   are accounted for in the MFAL.

   3.6.2. NAF Non-Capital/Pilferable Items. This is FF&E with an acquisition cost of at least
   $100 but less than $1,000 (excluding expendables and consumable items). Non-capital FF&E
   is expensed on the financial records of the using activity’s cost center at the time of
   acquisition. The same is true if the item was obtained via transfer from another NAFI. Only
   those items identified as pilferable will be accounted for on the MFAL.
       3.6.2.1. Mandatory Services pilferable items include vehicles, non-disposable cameras,
       and computer-related items not already on the property list. The Services
       Commander/Division Chief, on the advice of the Property Account Custodian, Activity
       Manager and the RMFC, may consider other items that make economical sense to track
       at their installation.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                         21


   3.6.3. DRMO Capital/Accountable FF&E – These are items obtained from DRMO sources
   that require NAFs for repair costs, freight, installation, and/or training of $1,000 or more with
   a useful life exceeding 2 years. These items are accounted for in the MFAL.
   3.6.4. DRMO Non-Capital FF&E – These items were obtained from DRMO and do not meet
   the criteria in paragraph 3.6.3 above; however, they will be accounted for in the MFAL.
   (Note: Consumable type items withdrawn from DRMO are not accountable as they are
   consumed in use.)
   3.6.5. APF Capital Accountable FF&E. This is property purchased with APFs with an
   acquisition cost of $100,000 or above. These items are accounted in the R14.
   3.6.6. APF Budget Code 9 FF&E. This is property (including fitness center equipment)
   purchased with APF with an acquisition cost between $2,500 and $99,999. These items are
   accounted for on the MFAL.
   3.6.7. APF Pilferable FF&E. This is APF property with an acquisition cost of at least $100
   but less than $2,500 and locally considered to have a high risk of being pilfered. Mandatory
   Services pilferable items include fitness center equipment, non-disposable cameras, and
   computer-related items not already on the property list. The Services Commander/Division
   Chief, on the advice of the Property Account Custodian, Activity Manager and the RMFC,
   may consider other items that make economical sense to track at their installation. These
   items are accounted for on the MFAL. (Note: APF vehicles are managed by Base
   Transportation and will not be accounted for on the MFAL.)
3.7. How Accountability is Maintained. Upon receipt of the receiving documents, the NAF
AO records all newly purchased accountable property in the general ledger. The NAF AO
assigns a locally established asset designator to identify the new property. See paragraph 3.7.1
and Figure 3.1 below for more information on asset designators. Once the property has been
entered into the accounting system, the system calculates depreciation, where applicable, for the
NAF purchased FF&E assets and expenses the cost to the using activity cost center.
   3.7.1. Assigning Asset Designators. The first two digits use a prefix that identifies the type
   of property (NAF, APF, DRMO). See Figure 3.1 below.
   3.7.2. LABELS FOR R15. The Chief, LSS must coordinate with Base Supply’s Equipment
   Management Element to obtain labels for all items maintained on the R15, Organizational
   Visibility List.
3.8. PHASE 3 – Identification (Marking or Labeling Property). To ensure that Services-
owned property can be tracked and accounted for throughout its useful life, it must be labeled
and/or marked with identification based upon the type of funds used. Identification will be
affixed for the life of the property in a way that does not detract or deface the property.
   3.8.1. Property Identification Labels. The NAF AO should provide the property account
   custodian a property identification label within 7 duty days of receipt of the property. Labels
   can be printed for the entire property system or labels can be printed for a specific activity.
   The label program sorts on the asset designator field. It prints by number (asset designator)
   and shows the property’s acquisition date, description, model number or serial number, cost
   center asset account number, and NAFI.

  3.8.2. LABELS FOR R14. The Chief, LSS must coordinate with Base Supply’s Equipment
  Management Element to obtain labels for all items maintained on the R14, Custodian
  Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL).
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                        23


                                            Chapter 4

                       USE AND CONTROL (3 LIFECYCLE STAGE)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines the procedures you should use to properly control Services
property during its useful life. As Activity Managers, you should exercise supply discipline to
conserve, protect and maintain government property under your control.
4.2. Property Control - How do I as the Activity Manager control property under my
jurisdiction? There are several ways to control your property. 1) Protect your property with
physical safeguards. 2) Ensure all items are accurately accounted for on property listings. 3)
Implement a preventive maintenance and repair program. 4) Understand and fulfill your duties as
property custodian as outlined in this instruction, or ensure the individual you have designated as
custodian is properly equipped to carry out their duties as custodian. 5) Conduct periodic spot
checks of your inventory. 6) Perform self-inspections of your property management program.




   4.2.1. Physical Safeguards. You can physically control your property with locks, secure
   buildings, proper lighting and alarm systems. If you are not sure of how to best safeguard
   your property, you can seek operational and staff assistance from your RMFC, your property
   custodian (if you are not the custodian) or base Security Forces. Once in place, periodically
   check your physical controls to be certain they continue to be effective. Spot check your
   inventory and pay special attention to items that might be stolen, e.g., those determined to be
   pilferable.
   4.2.2. Accounting Procedures.
       4.2.2.1. Accounting For Property Listed on the MFAL. Ensure all your property is
       accurately listed on the MFAL. When you receive new items, you or your custodian
       should expect to receive an updated copy of the MFAL from the NAF AO within 30 days
       of receipt. Review the document to ensure all new items have been properly recorded.
       Notify the NAF AO if they have not.
       4.2.2.2. Accounting For Property Listed on the CA/CRL (R14). When an item is issued
       or turned-in, the Supply system automatically posts the transaction and generates a Daily
       Document Register. Supply sends the property custodian a copy of the Daily Document
       Register to notify them that their account has been updated. However, the system does
       not automatically produce a new CA/CRL. A new CA/CRL is only generated if the
24                                                               AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


     property custodian requests an updated copy, if there is a change in custodian, or when
     the annual inventory takes place.
     4.2.2.3. DELETED.
  4.2.3. Maintenance and Repair. A preventive maintenance and repair program is another
  way to control your property. By keeping your property in serviceable condition, you extend
  your property’s useful life.
     4.2.3.1. Preventive Maintenance. You should establish a preventive maintenance
     program for items such as vehicles, or any equipment items used in activities that need to
     be kept in good working order.
     4.2.3.2. Repair. For items that need repair: 1) you or your custodian must know whether
     or not items are under warranty or contract maintenance, including Government Purchase
     Card purchases, 2) you must know if items are being accounted for on the R14 or on the
     MFAL, and 3) you must determine whether it is economically feasible/practical to fix the
     item. Do not repair an item if the repair cost exceeds 75 percent of the acquisition cost.
     The custodian is responsible for keeping the record of all repair cost. Purchasing a new
     item may be more cost effective.
         4.2.3.2.1. For items with a contractual repair arrangement retain the item and contact
         the contractor for on-site repair or transport the item to the contractor’s facility.
         Ensure that accountable APF equipment items (items on R14), that cannot be repaired
         locally, are processed through Base Supply’s Equipment Management Section for
         repair and return. NOTE: Under no circumstances will APF equipment be directly
         shipped or transferred to an off-base activity for repair. Refer to AFMAN 23-110,
         Volume II, Part Thirteen, Chapter 8 or contact Base Supply’s Equipment
         Management Section for guidance. For repair of warranty or guarantee items, contact
         your base contracting office or see AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part Thirteen,
         Chapter 8.
  4.2.4. Property Custodian Responsibilities. If you are the custodian, it is your responsibility
  to maintain custody, care, and safekeeping of the property issued to you for use in your
  organization. You must have a basic knowledge of and interest in equipment management.
  You should also know the controls you need to develop for managing in-use equipment and
  customer requests. If you need assistance in establishing your program or require training,
  contact your Chief, LSS for assistance. You must continually monitor the status of property
  on-hand to effectively control and prevent loss due to theft or misuse.
     4.2.4.1. Standard Property Folders. Maintain a standard property folder for your account.
     This folder will include at a minimum, custodian appointment letters, a copy of the most
     recent R14 and MFAL, results of the last annual physical inventory, a pilferable list, a list
     of disposal actions, and the status of actions for missing items.
  4.2.5. Periodic Inventory Spot Checks. The Chief, LSS will conduct a spot check of your
  activity’s inventory at least semi-annually and provide you, your flight chief and the RMFC a
  report of their findings. This is a proactive measure intended to help you control your
  inventory. By having your inventory checked more frequently, problems will be detected
  early and discrepancies can be rectified prior to the annual inventory. During these spot
  checks, the Chief, LSS should ensure: 1) that property in your possession or under your
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                        25


   jurisdiction is properly charged to your account (i.e., that quantities, nomenclature and asset
   designators on the property listing are correct); 2) that the property listed is on hand and in
   serviceable condition; 3) that proper physical safeguards are in place; 4) that property is
   properly marked or labeled; and, 5) that inventory discrepancies have been corrected and
   follow-up actions have been requested or completed for missing items. In addition to
   providing a list of findings, the Chief, LSS should include corrective actions and provide a
   status report until all findings have been taken care of.
   4.2.6. Internal Control Program. You as the Activity Manager should perform a self-
   inspection of your activity’s property management program to determine if required control
   procedures have been implemented and functioning effectively. Refer to training aid NA-37
   for guidance. For your convenience, the items that pertain to property management have been
   outlined in he checklist included asAttachment 14 of this instruction. You should then
   provide a statement of assurance to your flight chief certifying you have completed the
   internal control checklist and internal controls are present and sufficiently effective.




       4.2.6.1. Discrepancies are annotated and the flight chief is responsible for working with
       activity managers to correct the discrepancies. Specific questions are included on the
       internal control checklist concerning NAF, DRMO, and APF fixed asset inventory
       discrepancies. These certifications and checklists are used for the flight chief’s statement
       of assurance to the Deputy Services Commander. The certification ultimately becomes
       the support documentation for the Services Commander/Division Chief Statement of
       Assurance to the installation commander as part of the Federal Manager’s Financial
       Integrity Act (FMFIA).
4.3. Program Assessment - How do I know if my controls are working effectively? You
know your property controls are effective when your physical inventory is accurate and your
property is in good working condition. A completed Statement of Assurance, certifying internal
controls are present is also a strong indicator your program is operating efficiently. Additional
guidance may be found in AFI 65-201, Management Control.
4.4. Physical Inventories - When Are They Conducted? Physical inventories are conducted
annually, upon transfer of custody to contractors, when the activity manager or custodian
changes or during semi-annual spot checks.
   4.4.1. Annual Inventory Procedures. The procedures are not the same for all FF&E assets.
   Table 4.1, provides a snapshot of the inventory procedures for each of the different

  categories of FF&E. However, all assets should be inventoried at least once within a 12-
  month period.
     4.4.1.1. NAF Capital FF&E Inventory Procedures. The NAFFA maintains a schedule for
     annual physical inventories for NAF Capital FF&E and submits this schedule to the
     Services commander/division chief requesting the appointment of team members. The
     individuals selected should be experienced in inventory procedures, and they should be
     independent of the activity being inventoried by that team. In addition, the team chief
     should be senior in rank to the manager of the activity being inventoried. The NAFFA
     will provide property listings to the team and brief them of their responsibilities. The
     team’s basic duty is to observe the physical inventory being taken by activity staff
     members. See Attachment 15 for the Annual Property Certification format and Financial
     Management Training Aid (FMTA) #8, Impartial Inventories, for additional guidelines.
     4.4.1.2. NAF Non-Capital and Bulk FF&E Inventory Procedures. The RMFC schedules
     this inventory. Personnel from activities, other than the activity being inventoried,
     observe activity personnel as they take the physical inventory. Refer to paragraph 4.5
     for guidelines on how to conduct a thorough physical inventory. The NAF AO will
     provide property listings to the activity personnel to perform the inventory. As in
     paragraph 4.4.1.1 above, the team should observe the physical inventory being taken by
     activity staff members. They must ensure the inventory is complete and accurate and may
     validate accuracy by physically counting or recounting certain items. The team should
     also note the general security and protection of the inventory.
     4.4.1.3. DRMO Assets Inventory Procedures. The RMFC schedules this inventory that is
     conducted by the Chief, LSS. (NOTE: DRMO consumable assets do not require an
     annual inventory). Take action to reconcile and correct property records.
     4.4.1.4. APF Capital FF&E. The property custodian conducts this inventory, which is
     scheduled by Base Supply and uses the CA/CRL to verify the accuracy of the inventory
     IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, Part 13, Chap. 8.
     4.4.1.5. APF FF&E (Budget Code 9 and Pilferable). The RMFC schedules this inventory
     that is conducted by the property custodian, using the MFAL to check the inventory.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                       27

   4.4.2. Physical Inventory Upon Transfer of Property to Contractors. For FF&E provided to
   contractors, physical inventories will be conducted at the start and at the termination of the
   contract, annually, and as required by accountable officers.
   4.4.3. Physical Inventory When the Activity Manager or Property Custodian Changes. To
   verify the property records, the incoming Activity Manager physically inventories the
   property and accepts the account from the outgoing custodian. Any discrepancies should be
   corrected prior to new manager/custodian acceptance.
4.5. Actions Needed for a Thorough Physical Inventory.
   4.5.1. Check on-hand quantities and compare them to the property listing. Review the
   property listing to ensure that it’s properly annotated, i.e. correct asset designators, accurate
   nomenclature etc.
   4.5.2. Visually inspect property to ensure it’s in serviceable condition. If not, there should be
   documentation that shows the item is scheduled for repair or disposal.
   4.5.3. Check property to ensure it’s properly marked or labeled.
   4.5.4. Determine whether the activity still needs the property.
4.6. Accounting for Physical Inventories. The NAF AO maintains all property records in the
accounting system property module. The NAF AO will enter assets into the accounting system
for everything maintained on the MFAL.
4.7. Actions Taken After the Physical Inventory Has Been Done.
   4.7.1. For NAF Capital FF&E. The team chief forwards the inventory certification to the
   NAFFA along with any discrepancies noted during observation of the inventory. The
   NAFFA discusses the certification with the Activity Manager and the RMFC, including any
   unresolved discrepancies, and forwards written results to the Services Commander/Division
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                   29


   Chief and Installation Comptroller. The RMFC reviews and determines whether further
   action is required according to AFI 34-202, Protecting Nonappropriated Fund Assets and
   ensures all variances are resolved according to AFMAN 34-212, Control Procedures for
   Protecting NAF Assets, Chapter 9 (to be AFMAN 34-412). Unresolved discrepancies must be
   tracked to resolution. Documentation should be retained in the standard property folder,
   maintained by the property custodian. The Chief, LSS can assist with resolving inventory
   discrepancies. The RMFC completes property account write-offs within 30 days of physical
   inventory or within 30 days of inquiry/investigation completion, where applicable, and
   completes the annual property certification. (See Attachment 15) For additional guidance,
   see FMTA #8, Impartial Inventories.
   4.7.2. NAF Non-Capital/Bulk FF&E. The RMFC reviews and determines whether further
   action is required according to AFI 34-202 and ensures all variances are resolved according
   to AFMAN 34-212, Chapter 9 (to be AFMAN 34-412). Unresolved discrepancies must be
   tracked to resolution. Documentation should be retained in the standard property folder,
   maintained by the property custodian. The Chief, LSS can assist with resolving inventory
   discrepancies. The RMFC completes property account write-offs within 30 days of physical
   inventory or within 30 days of inquiry/investigation completion, where applicable, and
   completes the annual property certification. (See Attachment 15.)
   4.7.3. DRMO Assets. The Chief, LSS and the RMFC will discuss property that is missing or
   cannot be accounted for and determine the action to be taken.
   4.7.4. APF FF&E (includes R14 property). Property that is reported missing or that cannot
   be accounted for during the inventory will be reported immediately to the Chief, LSS. The
   Chief, LSS will advise the Services Commander/Division Chief, who will determine whether
   to initiate a Report of Survey. The Commander/Division Chief appoints a report of survey
   investigating officer. The report of survey will be conducted IAW AFM 23-220 Reports of
   Survey for Air Force Property.
4.8. Transfer of Custodial Responsibilities.
   4.8.1. Property Transfer to Contractors. Custody/possession of NAF, DRMO, and APF
   FF&E may be physically transferred to a commercial contractor when that contractor is
   competitively selected to operate a Services activity under the AF Outsourcing Program. All
   property continues to be maintained on the R14 or MFAL.
       4.8.1.1. The contractor may be assigned responsibility for the FF&E assets to operate,
       maintain, replace and return them to the government at the end of the contract period.
       4.8.1.2. The government may retain responsibility for FF&E, maintain and replace it
       when the contractor operates them.
       4.8.1.3. Other arrangements may be negotiated in the contract for disposition of NAF
       property. APF equipment is returned to the government at the end of the contract period
       or when no longer required. DRMO property is returned to the Chief, LSS at the end of
       the contract period or when no longer required.
   4.8.2. Change of Activity Manager. Incoming Activity Managers must verify the accuracy of
   the property records. Refer to AFMAN 34-214 for further guidance. The NAF AO furnishes
   fixed asset property listings to the Activity Managers when management changes. To verify

                                           Chapter 5

                             DISPOSAL (4 LIFECYCLE STAGE)

5.1. Overview. The 4th stage in the property life cycle is the final stage. Even at the end of its
useful life, you must appropriately account for property. This chapter identifies the alternatives
for property disposal and its proper accounting. This chapter addresses the different options a
Services organization may use to dispose of APF, NAF and DRMO acquired property. It also
includes provisions for the temporary loan of property to another organization.
NOTE:
It’s important to keep in mind that Services government property must only be disposed of in
accordance with this instruction. No person may give, donate, or otherwise transfer government
property to employees, customers, other persons, or organizations except as specifically
authorized by law or federal policy. Property disposal actions must not create the appearance of a
conflict of interest.
   5.1.1. Why is disposal of property encouraged? Disposal of excess or unserviceable property
   permits more efficient use of limited storage space for higher priority efforts. Prompt
   disposal also decreases potential loss (from theft, neglect, or decay), removes fire hazards,
   and improves facility housekeeping and sanitation. In addition, the sale of excess NAF
   property may improve the financial position of the owning NAFI.
   5.1.2. When should we dispose of property? Property should be disposed of when an
   organization no longer needs it either because it is excess to their needs or when the property
   has out-lived its useful life and has become unserviceable. Disposal actions may be necessary
   when management of an organization has been outsourced to a contractor or a base is
   closing.
   5.1.3. What is the best disposal method to use? The best disposal method is the one
   providing the highest economic return to the owning NAFI.
   5.1.4. What is the first step in the disposal process? The Activity Manager or property
   account custodian should first ensure that no other Services Activities can make use of the
   item before they take any disposal actions.
 32                                                               AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


   5.1.5. What is the difference between serviceable and unserviceable? Serviceable FF&E is
   defined as property fulfilling its intended purpose or function. Unserviceable FF&E is unfit
   for continued use, is no longer capable of fulfilling its intended purpose, or is not economical
   to repair.
5.2. Procedures for Disposal of APF Property. Property purchased with appropriated funds
(APF) and which is now excess to the activity’s needs or unserviceable must be turned-in to Base
Supply for disposal. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, Part 13, Chapter 4 ―Turn-In Procedures‖
for additional guidance. APF FF&E should not be transferred outside the Services organization
without the assistance of Base Supply. For accountable APF FF&E transferred between Services
activities, ensure the activity is authorized the property in the appropriate Allowance Standard
(AS). If approved, ensure this transaction is reflected on the MFAL.
   5.2.1. Property Account Custodians/Activity Managers must turn in excess APF property as
   soon as possible after declaring it excess to the Chief, LSS. This includes all budget code 9
   items.
5.3. Procedures for Disposal of DRMO Property. DRMO and Resource, Recovery, and
Recycling (RRRP) property items may be disposed of when excess, no longer serviceable or
upon base closure through return to DRMO. All DRMO property must be returned to the Chief,
LSS. The Chief, LSS, will need to complete DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt
Document. NOTE: Property acquired through the DRMO is not NAF property and may not be
disposed of through the NAF Sales Outlet.
5.4. Procedures for Disposal of NAF Property. Disposal of excess or unserviceable NAF
property is a wise business decision. Proper disposal improves efficiency of the operation and
may enhance the financial position of the owning NAFI. The decision to dispose of or retain
NAF property assets is based upon the serviceability of the property. Such disposal is not based
on the financial condition of an activity or NAFI. Once it has been determined that NAF property
should be disposed of, it should be done promptly. Do not store unneeded property.
   5.4.1. Before taking any disposal action check with other Services activities first. The
   Activity Manager or property account custodian, with the assistance of the Chief, LSS,
   should check with other Services activities to determine whether they can use the item.
   5.4.2. If no other Services activity can use the item. The RMFC, in conjunction with the
   owning Activity Manager or property custodian, should then select the best method for
   disposal. He or she then processes the action through the base’s NAF Council.
NOTE:
The best disposal method is the one providing the highest economic return to the owning NAFI.
   5.4.3. Disposing of Property that is not fully depreciated. For serviceable or unserviceable
   property with a book value of $1,000 or more, and a useful life of two years or more, refer
   the selected disposal method through the NAF council for installation commander approval.
   5.4.4. What are disposal procedures for Property less than $1,000? For items with a book
   value of less than $1,000, the RMFC has the authority to determine the disposal method and
   make it a matter of record in the next NAF council meeting minutes.
   5.4.5. What is fair market value and how is it determined? Fair market value is the price the
   buyer could expect to pay on the open market. The RMFC and Activity Manager, with help
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                          33


   from the servicing contracting officer (for near new property) or the DRMO (for used
   property), will determine the fair market value for purposes of FF&E transfers between
   NAFIs. The NAFI that receives the transferred property must pay the mutually agreed upon
   value of the property.
   5.4.6. What’s the difference between fair market value and book value? The fair market
   value of a property item is the price that a buyer could expect to pay and a seller could expect
   to receive. Book value equals acquisition value less accumulated depreciation.
   5.4.7. What if the book value is higher than the fair market value? Dispose of the property at
   book value if possible.
5.5. Disposal of Serviceable NAF Property. There are several ways to dispose of serviceable
property that is recorded as a capital asset (acquisition cost of $1000 or above) or property below
$1000 accountable on the MFAL. Table 5.1 below provides a brief snapshot of disposal options
for serviceable NAF property.

Table 5.1. Disposal Options for Serviceable NAF Property (Not in priority order. Use the
option which provides the greatest return to the owning NAFI.)

 Trade-in     For credit toward the purchase of a new similar item when in the best interest of
              the owning NAFI (excludes vehicles)
 Sale         Through sealed bid, announced auction, or competitive sales negotiations
              Through periodic NAF property sales when there is no formally established NAF
              property sales outlet
              Through NAF property sales store outlet
              Turn-in to DRMO
 Transfer     To another DOD NAFI on the installation or elsewhere on a reimbursable basis at
              fair market value at the expense of the gaining NAFI.
              To other DOD agencies on a reimbursable basis at fair market at the expense of
              the gaining agencies with the assistance of the servicing DRMO.


   5.5.1. TRADE-IN. Trade-in serviceable property for credit towards the purchase of a new,
   similar item when this is in the best interests of the owning NAFI. NOTE: This excludes
   vehicles.
   5.5.2. SALE. There are four methods of selling serviceable property – 1) auction by either
   sealed, open bid or competitive sales negotiations, 2) periodic NAF property sales, 3) NAF
   Sales Outlet, and 4) turn-in to DRMO for sale. Be certain to establish procedures to prevent
   pre-selection of sale merchandise or segregation of merchandise, which would allot
   individuals an opportunity to buy before all other participants have equal opportunity. For
   competitive sales negotiations, the servicing Staff Judge Advocate and installation
   contracting offices provide necessary advice and assistance to protect the NAFI’s interests
   and ensure no one misuses the procedure. NOTE: Activities must not purchase more NAF
   property than needed or authorized for the express purpose of reselling it for profit.
 34                                                              AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004




       5.5.2.1. Auction. Dispose of property by selling it without DRMO involvement through
       SEALED BID or OPEN BID auction. The Services Commander/Division Chief appoints
       an auctioneer or authorizes the hiring of a professional auctioneer. Refer to Attachment
       11, Procedures for Auctions. If needed, the servicing Staff Judge Advocate and/or
       servicing Contracting Office can provide advice and assistance to protect the NAFI
       interest.
       5.5.2.2. Periodic NAF Property Sales. When there is no permanent NAF sale outlet,
       advertise the sale date and location. Property sales will be at fair market value.
       5.5.2.3. NAF Sales Outlet. Sales are at fair market value through the local Services NAF
       Sales Outlet. The Outdoor Recreation Checkout facility is the sole authorized sale outlet.
       If the Outdoor Recreation Checkout is not adequate, forward a request for waiver to
       allow use of an alternate facility through the MAJCOM/SV to HQ AFSVA/SVPCO.
       Refer to Attachment 12, Procedures for a NAF Sales Outlet.
NOTE:
 Although a waiver may be granted to allow installations a location change, the responsibility of
the sales outlets will remain with Outdoor Recreation. Under no circumstances will management
responsibility for a NAF Sales Outlet be transferred to another activity.
       5.5.2.4. Turn-in for sale by DRMO. As a last resort, serviceable property may be turned
       in to the servicing DRMO for disposal. When DRMO sells the property, the owning
       NAFI receives all proceeds minus any applicable DRMO fees. NOTE: DRMO ―sales and
       handling‖ fees apply to property physically moved to the DRMO for sale. DRMO "sales‖
       fees apply to property retained in the Services activity but marketed ―in place‖ by
       DRMO. Use this method only if all other more financially beneficial options have been
       considered and found to be unacceptable.

1. Payment Methods. Purchasers may make payments with cash, check, money orders, or
major credit cards (if the installation accepts major credit cards).
a. Payment by Check - Valid ID Holders. Checks may be accepted from valid military or
civilian identification cards holders. Do not accept checks that do not contain the information
necessary to locate the check writer in case the check is returned for insufficient funds (see
AFMAN 34-212 for details).
b. Payment by Check – Public. Checks may be accepted from the public (i.e., those without
valid AF identification cards). However, checks $100 or over may be accepted if the purchaser
has their bank either mail or fax bank letters of credit/guarantee directly to the RMFC. The
letter will not be valid if received directly from the purchaser. Do not accept bank guarantee
cards or their equivalent. If the purchaser already has a bank’s letter of credit/guarantee on file
with the RMFC, a check may be accepted.
2. Sales Records. Use a cash register tape or AF Form 2555, NAF Cash CollectionRecord, to
record all sales. If a cash register is used, record the item number along with description. After
each business day, complete an AF Form 1876, NAF Consolidated Cost Center Report and
give it to the NAF AO. Deposit the funds with the Central Cashier no later than the next
business day. See Attachment 19 for sample form.
3. Ownership Transfer. Proper documentation for boats, vehicles, trailers, etc., should be
provided to the purchaser at the time of payment (See Chapter 6 for vehicle transfer
requirements).


   5.5.3. TRANSFER. The transfer of NAF property is a form of disposal where the property
   remains an asset of the government but not of the organization or activity that originated the
   transfer (referred to here as the “losing” organization or activity). When transferred, it
   becomes the asset of the receiving or ―gaining” organization or activity. NOTE: It is
   prohibited to transfer NAF property to, from, or between NAFIs (or activities) to improve the
   apparent financial condition of either organization (although this is not intended to prohibit
   "common cause" transfers). There are several types of transfers for NAF property - 1)
   transfer from one NAF activity to another NAF activity, 2) transfer from a NAF-to-APF
   activity, 3) transfer from NAF-to-a Contractor, and 4) transfer to a NAFI or organization at
   another base.
       5.5.3.1. NAF Transfer Within and To Other DoD NAFIs. Transfers within a NAFI take
       place at book value. Transfers to another DoD NAFI on the installation or elsewhere (off-
       base) take place on a reimbursable basis at fair market value and at the expense of the
       gaining NAFI unless HQ USAF/ILV grants exceptions. Refer to Table 5.2. below and
       AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs) for additional guidance. All motor
       vehicles will be disposed of by sealed bid or announced auction, except for transfer to
       another NAFI on a reimbursable basis. This is done when economically advantageous to

        both the losing and gaining NAFI (see Chapter 6 for additional information on disposing
        of vehicles).

       5.5.3.2. NAF-to-APF Property Transfer. Property purchased with NAF funds may only
       be transferred to Services APF activities and at no cost. These transfers must be approved
       by the Services Commander/Division Chief, and the following conditions must be met: 1)
       the property is identified as an authorized item (or permissible substitute) in the
       appropriate Allowance Standard (AS), 2) it is in serviceable condition, and 3) it is of the
       same basis of issue (i.e., unit of measurement) as the authorized item. The transferred
       property becomes an APF asset and future maintenance becomes an APF responsibility.
       NOTE : The use of NAFs for maintenance of that property is discontinued. See Table
       5.3. below for specific accounting and documentation requirements for NAF to APF
       transfers.

 Chief         a. The Chief, LSS, assists the activity property custodian in preparing a DD
               Form 1348-1A, for the NAF property indicating that title is being transferred
               from the losing NAFI FF&E account (number) to the gaining activity APF
               account (number). In lieu of using this form, an approval letter from the NAFs
               Council may be used to record property title transfers.
               b. The RMFC reviews the DD Form 1348-1A (or NAFs Council’s letter of
               approval) in accordance with AFI 34-201.
                c. The Property Account Custodian notes the date the transfer was approved in
               the base NAFs Council minutes.
                d. Once the decision is made to transfer the item, the NAF AO removes the
               property from the NAF section of the MFAL and moves it to the APF section of
               the MFAL.
               e. The RMFC ensures property is properly transferred
               f. The NAF AO retains a copy of the transfer document(s) in the life-of-the-fund
               file.
               g. The Chief, LSS, retains a copy of the transfer document(s) in the logistics
               office file
               h. The Property Account Custodian removes the NAF property label and
               replaces it with the APF asset designator label.
               Gaining Activity:
               a. The NAF AO moves the item from the losing activity’s MFAL and assigns an
               APF asset designator, adding it to the APF section of the gaining activity’s
               MFAL with a zero book value.
               b. The Property Account Custodian receives the property (refer to Chapter 3,
               Receive) and affixes a new APF property label (with the new asset identifier).

       5.5.3.3. NAF-to-Commercial Contractor Transfer. Custody of NAF property may be
       transferred to a commercial contractor if the contractor has been competitively selected to
       operate a Services activity and the terms of the transfer are contained in the contract.
       NAF property will not be purchased for the purpose of making it available for
       contractors. All government property should be returned at the end of the contract unless
       some other acceptable compensation is contained in the contract. Refer to Table 5.4
       below and AFI 34-201, paragraph 5.6.4 and paragraph6.3, for more information.
          5.5.3.3.1. NAF-owned FF&E may be transferred to the contractor with the contractor
          maintaining and operating the equipment during the life of the contract. The
          equipment remains on the NAF property list (MFAL) and is returned to the
          contracting NAFI at the end of the contract period. The contractor is responsible for
          operating the activity using the NAFI owned equipment. No other use by contractor is
          permitted.
          5.5.3.3.2. The contracting NAFI may sell the equipment to the contractor for fair
          market value if so specified in the contract.
5.6. Disposal of Unserviceable NAF Property. Unserviceable property may be disposed using
any of the methods described above except for the reimbursable transfer to another NAFI. The
RMFC may also make the property available for use in instructional programs that are part of AF
Services Skills Development activities or dispose of the property through a NAF or Installation
qualified recycling program. Refer to AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program for guidance,
a program managed by the civil engineers.

                                                         to complete all property disposal
                                                         actions in a timely manner.

                                                               The RMFC records all NAF FF&E
                                                               transfers on AF Form 2534, NAF
                                                               Property Disposal/Transfer
                                                               Receipt.

NOTE:
 Public Law 102-190, section 344, and Public Law 102-484, section 2821 govern the way net
proceeds from the sale of a building or structure acquired, constructed, or improved with NAFs
and sold in a BRAC are processed.
5.8. Property Requiring Special Processing for Disposal.
   5.8.1. NAF Owned Computers. NAF assets are disposed of by the method most financially
   advantageous to the owning NAFI. Before that method can be selected for computers, the
   base communications squadron must be consulted to determine the steps required to ―purge‖
   information from the computers. Once these requirements have been satisfied, the
   appropriate disposition method for NAF assets should be selected and used. the procedures
   below must be followed. If you need help complying with these policies, follow any
   additional instructions provided in AFI 33-112, along with applicable MAJCOM
   supplements, and local Communications and Information (SC) guidance.
        5.8.1.1. Transfer Within DoD. NAF-owned computers contain ―For Official Use Only‖
        information. If the computer will be transferred for use by any part of the DoD, clear and
        sanitize the functioning hard drive using overwriting software that meets DoD approved
        overwriting software specifications. Individuals performing the overwriting must be
        properly trained and must certify that the overwriting process has been completed. To
        certify the sanitation of hard drives, affix a signed label to the computer indicating the
        date and method of overwriting. Use a locally produced written certification form with
        the signature of the individual who disposed of the items and a witness’ signature.
        5.8.1.2. Sale Outside DoD. If the computer is to be sold outside DoD or is not saleable,
        select one of the following options.
           5.8.1.2.1. Clear the hard drive and sanitize it (using the procedures described above).
           To certify the sanitation of hard drives, affix a signed label to the computer indicating
           the date and method of overwriting. Use a locally produced written certification form
           with the signature of the individual who disposed of the items and a witness’
           signature.
           5.8.1.2.2. Sell the computer in the next NAF property auction; sealed bid sale; or, if
           you have a NAF property resale store, sell it there for fair market value. If the
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                      43


           computer is unserviceable convert it to ―scrap‖ and dispose of it. Do not dispose of
           any NAF computers or residual components through DRMO. Document this action
           with a locally produced written certification; use the sales slip or the certification
           documentation as the NAF Financial Management Office source document for
           removing the computer from the NAF property records.
   5.8.2. Slot machines. Before disposing of any slot machines, contact HQ AFSVA/SVCA.
   They must approve all disposal actions. Refer to AFMAN 34-129, Air Force Slot Machine
   Controls and Procedures.
   5.8.3. Aero Club Aircraft. HQ AFSVA/SVPAR must approve all proposed disposal actions
   for Aero Club aircraft. HQ AFSVA/SVPAR will provide the fair market value for all
   transfers unless it grants an exception.
5.9. Loan of Property . Property may be loaned by a Services activity to another activity or
NAF instrumentality for up to 30 days. If the property is to be loaned for a longer period, its
ownership/accountability should be transferred to the other entity.
   5.9.1. Loans of Less than 30 Days. The Property Account Custodian should use AF Form
   1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, to account for the temporary loan of his/her activity’s
   property.
   5.9.2. Loans of Greater than 30 Days or of Indefinite Duration. The Property Account
   Custodian should transfer the property, through the RMFC, to the new activity or
   instrumentality using AF Form 2534, NAF Property Disposal/ Transfer Receipt. Upon
   receipt of the form, the NAF AO should change the ownership and depreciation of the
   property to the activity now using the property. See Attachment 18 for a sample of a
   completed AF Form 2534.
5.10. Lost, Abandoned, or Unclaimed Private Property. Bases must comply with the
requirements of DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Material Disposition Manual, Chapter 4, paragraph
40, regarding identification and notification of owners and the time frames required for holding
such property before disposition. (For disposition of lost, abandoned, or unclaimed privately
owned vehicles, see paragraph 6.25).

                                           Chapter 6

                                 VEHICLE MANAGEMENT

6.1. Introduction . This chapter covers the procedures for controlling, using, and disposing of
NAF, DRMO, confiscated, and APF vehicle management. Vehicles are a type of ―property‖ you
must manage within the purview of this instruction. This chapter also illustrates the use of the
lifecycle process as it applies to vehicles.
6.2. Who is responsible for managing Services Vehicles? There are certain roles required for
vehicle management. These are the Vehicle Authorization Utilization Official (VAUO), Vehicle
Control Officer (VCO), and the Vehicle Operations Officer (VOO).
   6.2.1. Vehicle   Authorization   Utilization     Official (VAUO):   The    Services
   Commander/Division Chief is the VAUO for NAF, confiscated and DRMO-acquired
   vehicles and privately owned vehicles when used for official Services business. See
   Attachment 7 for specific VAUO responsibilities.
   6.2.2. Vehicle Control Officer (VCO). Units with permanently assigned motor vehicles
   require certain day-to-day program oversight. The Chief, LSS serves as the VCO with the
   responsibility to ensure the most effective overall use of vehicles assigned to the unit. In this
   role, they are the focal point for all NAF, confiscated, and DRMO-acquired vehicle matters
   and are the contact between Services and Transportation organizations for all permanently
   assigned APF vehicles. The Services Commander/Division Chief appoints the VCO by a
   letter to the Chief of base Transportation. NOTE: If there is no Chief, LSS assigned to the
   organization (or another logistics person), designate an individual from the RMFC flight to
   be the VCO. Otherwise, the Chief LSS should always serve as the Services VCO. See
   Attachment 8 for specific VCO responsibilities.
   6.2.3. Vehicle Operations Officer. The VOO is the VCO’s point of contact in base
   Transportation concerning the status use, and disposition of all APF vehicles in the Services
   inventory.




6.3. Plan, Budget and Acquire . A cost effective vehicle replacement program will provide
higher quality vehicle support, and ensure that funds are used wisely. A vehicle replacement
program that includes yearly review of accumulated maintenance costs and current resale values
will help determine the most cost effective time to dispose/replace both NAF and DRMO
vehicles.
6.4. Planning for NAF and DRMO Vehicle Use and Replacement. The Activity manager
and VCO plans and budgets annually for replacement of NAF and DRMO supported vehicles.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                      45


Performing the Annual Vehicle Utilization Review is the yearly baseline for managing the life
cycle of Services vehicles. To help perform this task, go to the Services website at https://www-
r.afsv.af.mil/. Select Logistics and the Vehicle Management for the tools and necessary forms.
As part of the local NAF annual budget process, the vehicle information will be provided to the
Services leadership to validate the continued use, and planned new or replacement vehicles as of
30 June, each year. The reporting period for Services vehicles is July through June. Use AF
Form 4256, Annual Vehicle Utilization Report (RCS: HAF-SV (A) 0121). This report is
designated emergency status code C-3. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, may be
delayed to allow the transmission of higher precedence reports. This review examines vehicle
utilization rates, accumulated maintenance costs of NAF and DRMO vehicles, current resale
values of NAF vehicles, current and projected vehicle requirements and the most cost-effective
method of vehicle disposal and replacement. Once the Commander/Division Chief has approved
the information, and the annual budget has been approved, send a copy of the annual vehicle
utilization report to your MAJCOM Services Office. MAJCOM’s will consolidate and review
the reports and forward them to HQ AFSVA/SVPCO in September. AFSVA will validate and
forward MAJCOM vehicle totals to HQ USAF/ILV for review and comment.
   6.4.1. Annual Services Vehicle Utilization Preparation. Refer to the Services website for the
   following tools and forms that you must use to prepare your Annual Vehicle Utilization
   Review.
       6.4.1.1. AF Form 4252 - Vehicle Requirements. This information (for all NAF and
       DRMO vehicles) is required for authorization and part of the local NAF budget process.
       6.4.1.2. AF Form 4253 Economic Analysis for New/Replacement NAF/DRMO
       Vehicles Spreadsheet. This is a good tool to help you determine the cost effectiveness of
       purchasing initial or replacement vehicles.
       6.4.1.3. AF Form 4254, 5-year Vehicle Replacement Plan. Assembling this information
       provides a clear picture in one place where vehicles are assigned by activity, the type of
       vehicle on-hand, the planned year of replacement, and the replacement cost.
 46                                                              AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


6.5. Budgeting for NAF Vehicle Requirements . Based upon the Services
Commander/Division Chief’s review of Services Vehicle Utilization, prepare an AF Form 4255,
Financial Summary of NAF Vehicle Requirements for the upcoming year’s budget. This is
done in conjunction with each activity manager and the Resource Management Flight Budget
Analyst.
   6.5.1. The Activity manager identifies any new requirements and attaches it to the related
   Economic Analysis. Be sure the appropriate flight chief approves the requirement before it is
   forwarded to the VCO for combining with other requirements in the budget.
   6.5.2. The budget analyst works with the VCO to prepare a consolidated vehicle budget, by
   NAFI, for those vehicles to be purchased with NAF during the coming year. Ensure quarterly
   updates are done according to paragraph 2.3.2.2. The budget analyst uses a local code in
   the cost center column to identify the Services activity requesting the vehicle purchase. For
   example, this can be added at the end of the cost center code (example: W1-V to purchase a
   vehicle for the Club Administration).
   6.5.3. The VCO assembles all NAF vehicle requirements into a package, separately tabbed
   for each vehicle request, and forwards it to the RMFC for inclusion in the NAF budget. The
   first tab includes the Financial Summary of all NAF Vehicle Requirements in that year’s
   budget request. Subsequent tabs contain each vehicle requirement as approved by the Flight
   Chief, along with the VCO’s recommendation. When all budget actions are
   approved/disapproved, through the NAF Council, the RMFC provides a copy of the response
   to the Logistics office. If the request was approved, it becomes the vehicle authorizing source
   document for permanent retention in the VCO’s vehicle jacket folder file. Disapproved forms
   will also be filed in the Logistics office. NOTE: If the vehicle request has been disapproved,
   the VCO notifies the requesting activity of the disapproval and maintains the returned
   correspondence in the current year’s office file. It is retained in the inactive file for 2
   additional years. For out of cycle/emergency vehicle purchases, the activity manager must
   complete a Vehicle Requirements Form and attach the related Economic Analysis to the
   purchase request.
NOTE:
 NAF are also used to maintain both NAF vehicles and those obtained from DRMO. Ensure
sufficient NAF are budgeted to pay for vehicle maintenance and services.
6.6. Acquiring NAF, Confiscated and DRMO Vehicles. The VCO uses the following
processes:
   6.6.1. For NAF Vehicle Purchases. The activity manager completes the NAF purchase
   request, or other purchase documentation as needed by contracting and sends it to the VCO.
   The VCO coordinates and forwards the purchase request to the RMFC to ensure funds are
   available to purchase the vehicle. The NAF purchase request is forwarded to the NAF
   purchasing clerk. The Air Force NAF Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO) Commanders Smart
   Buy Program should be used whenever possible. Bases are not authorized to use NAF to
   lease vehicles on a permanent dispatch. This is due to the 2,000-mile vehicle policy.
   6.6.2. To Acquire Confiscated Vehicles. The VCO coordinates with the owning agency (e.g.
   Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), etc.) to
   determine the availability of confiscated vehicles.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                       47


   6.6.3. To Acquire DRMO Vehicles. The VCO withdraws vehicles from the servicing
   DRMO by using the Services accountable officer’s ―FF‖ Department of Defense Activity
   Address Code (DoDAAC). Prepares a DD Form 1348-1, Issue Release/Receipt Document,
   containing the following information:
      6.6.3.1. Base Services ―FF‖ DoDAAC number. (―FF‖ designates the Services
      organization in the DOD supply system. ―DoDAAC‖ is the Department of Defense
      Activity Address Code
      6.6.3.2. Signature of the ―FF‖ (Services) Accountable Officer. (Servicing DRMO must
      have a memorandum from SV Commander/Division Chief designating individual as
      accountable officer for the ―FF‖ DoDAAC account.)
      6.6.3.3. Use the statements found in Attachment 21 and Attachment 22 when
      withdrawing or turning-in of vehicles from DRMO.
6.7. APF Vehicle Support.
   6.7.1. When are we authorized to use APF vehicles? Services Core APF vehicle
   requirements are authorized for permanent dispatch to Services activities according to
   Allowance Standard (AS) 019 as listed in Attachment 17. Category A (mission sustaining)
   and Category B (community support) activities are authorized APF vehicle support. Category
   C (revenue generating) activities are not authorized APF vehicle support for internal program
   operations, but must use nonappropriated fund owned vehicles. APF vehicles are authorized
   for Category C activities at those locations congressionally approved as remote or isolated. If
   APF support is authorized, but not specified in AS 019, use base vehicle operations repetitive
   use (dispatch) vehicles.
NOTE:
 The Services Commander/Division Chief must ensure NAFs are not used to purchase vehicles
for Category A activities or for any requirements for which APF vehicles are authorized.




   6.7.2. APF Vehicles for Honor Guard Details. Honor Guard vehicle requirements may be
   found in AS 019, Mission Application, ―ZF‖. In lieu of AS019ZF, bases may elect to
 48                                                               AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


   establish their requirements under the MAJCOM allowance standards, 020 through 032.
   These allowance standards identify vehicle allowances unique to specific major commands
   or equivalent. These allowance standards are source documents only and do not constitute
   authorization or approval authority for vehicles. To obtain specific vehicle authorizations,
   bases must submit requirements through Transportation channels to MAJCOMs IAW AFI
   24-301, Vehicle Operations. When establishing these requirements, Services
   Commander/Division Chief are encouraged to seek the specific support of your wing
   commander. When basis of issue does not meet honor guard requirements (demand for
   funeral honors is at a level that exceeds vehicles assigned) and temporary dispatch vehicle
   will not suffice, Services Commander/Division Chief may require an increase in their
   authorization using the above method.
6.8. RECEIPT. When a vehicle is received, the VCO:




   6.8.1. Records all NAF, confiscated or DRMO vehicles in Fleetman, the automated Vehicle
   Control Program (VCP). NOTE: NAF Vehicles will be recorded in Fleetman even if they
   have zero book value.
   6.8.2. Will not purchase public liability insurance for NAF, confiscated, or DRMO-acquired
   vehicles unless required by foreign law or approved by the Headquarters, Air Force Services
   Agency, Insurance and Compensation.
   6.8.3. Complies with local installation registration and inspection procedures.
   6.8.4. Prepares and maintains a vehicle jacket folder for all NAF, confiscated and DRMO-
   acquired vehicles. See Figure 6.3 for specific information contained in the jacket file.
   6.8.5. Ensures the vehicle is properly licensed and plates are displayed. See paragraph 6.9.3
   for specific guidance.
   6.8.6. Ensures the proper documentation is placed in the vehicle. See paragraph 6.10.2 for
   specific documents.
   6.8.7. May elect to place vehicle identification on the door. (Optional). If elected, follow
   guidance in paragraph 6.9.1.
6.9. Identification.
   6.9.1. Vehicle Door Identification. Identifying NAF, Confiscated, and DRMO-acquired
   vehicles is optional; however, apply it to the front doors on all vehicles, centering each line.
   For vans and panel trucks, you may apply the lettering on the side panels. See Figure 6.1 for
   guidance.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                     49


Figure 6.1. Sample Door Identification.




   6.9.2. All vehicles, both NAF and DRMO, must have the same door marking. Individual
   activities are not authorized to use permanent marking of any nature to identify the specific
   activity. However, nonpermanent markings (e.g., magnetic signs), which identify or provide
   information on the Services activity using the vehicle may be added. Commercial advertising
   and commercial sponsor recognition of NAF, confiscated, and DRMO-acquired vehicles is
   prohibited. The purpose of using Services or SVS is to provide the option of transferring or
   joint use of vehicles between activities in order to obtain the 2,000-mile criteria.
   6.9.3. Vehicle Licensing and License Plate Identification. This AFI covers the licensing of
   all NAF, confiscated, or DRMO-acquired vehicles in the US and overseas, unless superseded
   by treaties or agreements between the US and foreign governments.
      6.9.3.1. State license plates may be obtained when these plates are issued at no cost to
      SV. In regions or countries that don’t require area licenses, use a durable 6- by 12-inch
      license plate, with a three-letter, three-number combination. See Figure 6.2.
 50                                                             AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004

       Plates may be locally manufactured or procured.
       6.9.3.3. Display plates in accordance with local requirements.
       6.9.3.4. For overseas commands, MAJCOM/SVs may authorize marking exemptions for
       vehicles located within their areas of responsibility when conspicuous identification
       could endanger the security of individuals or U.S. Government interests.
6.10. Accountability. Vehicles are high value property and as such, firm accountability is
required at all times.
   6.10.1. File Maintenance – Jacket Folders. The VCO maintains jacket file folders for all
   assigned NAF, confiscated and DRMO-acquired vehicles. The jacket folder includes the
   following information listed in Figure 6.3.
   6.10.2. Documentation Maintained in the Vehicle. The following information must be kept
   in the vehicle at all times:
       6.10.2.1. DD Form 518, Accident-Identification
       6.10.2.2. AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report
(General Purpose Vehicles). Changed monthly and retained for one year.

6.11. Using the Fleetman Automated Vehicle Control Program (VCP). The VCO enters all
NAF, DRMO, confiscated, and specialty vehicle entries in Fleetman.
   6.11.1. Record all vehicles’ monthly odometer readings, and completed maintenance.
   6.11.2. Use Fleetman to document and schedule maintenance and inspections.
NOTE:
 For step-by-step instructions on common tasks, frequently asked questions, general support
topics, and other helpful resources use Fleetman’s website at http://www.fleetman.com. For
additional information, refer to the instructions on the Logistics section of the AFSVA website.
Contact HQ AFSVA/SVPCO if you have questions or problems.




6.12. Use and Control of Vehicles - Overview. The VCO is responsible for vehicle use, safety,
security, control, inspection, and scheduling preventive maintenance. This can be achieved by
establishing and implementing a proper training program for activity managers and operators, by
developing detailed operating instructions and by ensuring that vehicles are inspected on a timely
basis by maintaining a viable VCP.
6.13. Use of Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs). Activities using privately owned vehicles
(POVs) must have prior Services Commander/Division Chief approval to qualify for
reimbursement.
The VCO maintains records on all Commander/Division Chief approvals of Services employees
who are authorized mileage reimbursement for the use of their privately owned vehicles to
support the mission.
6.14. Use of Specialty Vehicles. Specialty vehicles are defined as tractors, forklifts, tow trucks,
flat bed trucks, reefers, lift trucks, box trucks, etc. These vehicles must be used for a "special
purpose", e.g., refrigerated to move food or some other unique purpose where that certain vehicle
 52                                                              AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


type is required. The major function of specialty vehicles cannot be to transport personnel. Golf
carts used by golf course patrons are not considered specialty vehicles; however, golf carts used
by activities in performance of duties are considered specialty and should be listed on the
specialty report.
   6.14.1. Classification as a Specialty Vehicle. The base Services Squadron
   Commander/Division Chief decides when a vehicle is classified as a specialty vehicle. In
   making this decision, they must have an alternate (local) measure of utilization for these
   vehicles, to ensure their continued use warrants the cost needed to maintain them.
   MAJCOMs are responsible for providing oversight of specialty vehicles within their
   command.
6.15. Use of NAF, Confiscated, and DMRO Acquired Vehicles
   6.15.1. Vehicle Use Standards – Services activities should fully use all assigned vehicles.
   Maintaining underused vehicles adds unnecessary maintenance and repair costs. Services
   Commanders/Division Chiefs are responsible for ensuring vehicles are driven at least 2,000
   miles per year. If this mileage standard cannot be met, joint use may be an option to increase
   mileage. You cannot retain a general-purpose vehicle unless it is driven at least 2000 miles
   annually.
   6.15.2. Proper Use of NAFI Vehicles. Use NAFI vehicles for official Services and NAFI
   purposes only. You should not use them for private business, unofficial purposes, or personal
   convenience.
   6.15.3. Use by Protocol or Installation Requirement. Do not use NAF vehicles for base
   protocol or any non-Services transportation requirements unless the installation Commander
   authorizes each use in writing. Each authorization states that the vehicle is being temporarily
   assigned to the protocol function or installation activity requiring the use of the vehicle and
   that the duration of the assignment will not be a detriment to the Services mission and its
   usage will be covered by APF benefits. In addition, each authorization should state why Base
   Transportation could not support the protocol or installation requirement. NOTE: When used
   for protocol or an installation requirement, the vehicle is serving an APF function and the
   NAF self-insurance liability program does not apply. Drivers must be in an official duty
   status.
   6.15.4. For NAF vehicles being used for APF protocol or installation functions:
       6.15.4.1. Always use a properly licensed APF driver.
       6.15.4.2. Make sure the proposed use does not conflict with the vehicle’s primary NAF
       mission.
       6.15.4.3. Use vehicle for approved APF purposes only. See Figure 6.4.
       6.15.4.4. Do not require APF reimbursement if NAF vehicles are used only on
       occasional basis. If they are required on a repetitive basis, an MOA under AFMAN 64-

scheduling preventive maintenance but, he or she needs the help of other members of the
Services organization to make the program work correctly. The activity managers and vehicle
operators play a key role in ensuring vehicles are properly controlled and safeguarded.
6.18. How the VCO Safeguards and Controls Vehicles. A good training program and an
effective maintenance and repair program are two of the best ways to safeguard and control
vehicles. As VCO, you must oversee these matters to ensure they are accomplished:
      6.18.1. Proper operator care, inspections, and maintenance.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                      55

6.21. Driver Licensing:
   6.21.1. AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, governs the issuing of licenses, maintenance
   records, and training. Organizations using NAF vehicles must use this directive as a training
   guide.
   6.21.2. To operate NAF, confiscated, and DRMO-acquired general-purpose vehicles of
   14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight (GVW) or less, military and civilian personnel must
   possess a valid motor vehicle license issued in any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,
   Puerto Rico, or a similar licensing jurisdiction. You must have an additional United States
   (US) Government license in those over-seas areas where a Status of Forces Agreement
   requires such a license.
   6.21.3. To operate NAF general-purpose vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVW and NAF
   special-purpose vehicles, you must possess a valid AF Form 2293, US Air Force Motor
   Vehicle Operator Identification Card, or an Optional Form (OF) 346, US Government
   Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card. In addition, you must attend Traffic Safety
   Courses I and II (AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program) and undergo
   advanced operator training. Civilian operators may require a Commercial Drivers License
   (CDL) in some areas to operate vehicles over 14,000 pounds.
6.22. Buying Fuel, Oil, and Lubricants. You may use GSA commercial credit cards to buy
fuel, oil, and lubricants for NAF, confiscated, and DRMO-acquired vehicles.
   6.22.1. RMFC establishes procedures in the form of an OI for buying fuel, oil, and
   lubricants. These procedures include setting up the proper accounts for APF and NAF fuel
   purchases and ensuring base fuel and GSA credit cards are available to authorized SV work
   centers.
   6.22.2. Do not purchase fuel, oil, and lubricants for NAF and DRMO-acquired vehicles used
   for SV activities except on a tax-exempt, NAF-reimbursable basis. This includes watercraft
   and recreational vehicles.
6.23. Controlling Recreational Vehicles. The Services equipment checkout and rental center
controls all recreational vehicles, trailers, watercraft, snowmobiles, and comparable self-
propelled vehicles. This work center also ensures these vehicles are mechanically safe and
properly maintained. The minimum safety standards are the same as for other Government
vehicles.
 58                                                              AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004

6.24. Disposal Methods. Dispose of vehicles using the guidelines outlined below.
   6.24.1. Disposal of DRMO or Confiscated Vehicles. When DRMO or confiscated vehicles
   are no longer serviceable or when Services no longer needs them, you must turn them in to
   the nearest DRMO facility.
   6.24.2. Disposal of NAF Vehicles. There are only two ways to dispose of NAF vehicles.
   They may be transferred to another base or sold using sealed bid or an announced auction.
       6.24.2.1. Transfer. When transferring vehicles from one base to another, the losing base
       must ensure that all vehicle documentation (vehicle jacket file folder) is forwarded to the
       gaining base Services VCO. In addition, both the losing and gaining bases must update
       their VCP (Fleetman) with appropriate annotation of loss/gain.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                        59


       6.24.2.2. Sale or Auction. You must use sealed bid or announced auctions for the
       disposal of NAF owned vehicles. This includes boats, trailers and campers. Upon the sale
       or auction of the vehicle, provide the purchaser with a title or Standard Form 97 (SF97)
       for title purposes. If you have the title to the vehicle, you do not need the SF97. Overseas
       bases must follow local policy, treaties or agreements between the United States and
       foreign governments.
          6.24.2.2.1. SF 97 Procedures. The RMFC and VCO will work together to accomplish
          the following:
              6.24.2.2.1.1. Request the SF97 from the Air Force Services Agency with an
              information copy to the MAJCOM. The request will contain a return mailing
              address, commercial phone number, the vehicle property number(s) to be sold,
              and be mailed to: HQ AFSVA/SVPCO, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 402, San
              Antonio, TX 78216-4138.
              6.24.2.2.1.2. Upon receipt store the form(s) in a safe or locked cabinet/drawer,
              until needed to document the sale of the NAF vehicle.
              6.24.2.2.1.3. Establish a logbook, computer generated file to record the SF97
              serial number used with the sale of the NAF vehicle. The SF97 control log will
              contain the following headings: SF97 serial number, SVS Vehicle Property
              Number, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), vehicle make, vehicle model,
              vehicle year, date the vehicle was sold, the buyer, and dollar amount of the
              purchase.
              6.24.2.2.1.4. The RMFC signs the SF97 when a vehicle is sold. For AFRC bases,
              the Services Commander/Division Chief is authorized to sign the SF97.
              6.24.2.2.1.5. Keep a copy of the completed SF97 in the vehicle jacket file folder.
              In addition, send a copy to HQ AFSVA/SVPCO. AFRC bases should forward a
              copy of the completed SF97 to HQ AFRC/SVF for inclusion in the Life of Fund
              file.
              6.24.2.2.1.6. After the vehicle is sold, the VCO annotates the AF Form 2534,
              NAF Property Disposal/Transfer Receipt, with the sales price received for the
              vehicle sold, and retains this information for use in the vehicle economic analysis
              when preparing the AF Form 4255, Financial Summary of NAF Vehicle
              Requirements.
6.25. Lost, Abandoned, or Unclaimed Privately-Owned Vehicles . See paragraph 5.10 for
guidance on identification and notification of owners, and the time frames required for holding
property before disposition.
   6.25.1. The Base Property Disposal Board (subject to Installation Commander approval)
   may decide to transfer an abandoned vehicle to a NAFI for use as part of its program (i.e., the
   auto hobby shop). When this occurs, ensure you obtain documentation from the Base
   Property Disposal Board indicating all of the requirements in DOD 4160.21-M have been
   met prior to accepting the vehicle. If the vehicle is used for parts, document this action on a
   locally produced written certification. All documentation received or generated will be filed
   in the Life of the Fund file.
 60                                                               AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


   6.25.2. If the vehicle will not be used for parts, the NAFI will establish NAF accountability
   by assigning it a vehicle property number and entering it into the Fleetman program. When
   the vehicle is no longer needed, it will be sold by the NAFI (as outlined in paragraph
   6.24.2.2). Use of the Standard Form 97 is still required.
6.26. Use of NAF Vehicles for Rental Service. See AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use
Eligibility ). Services can operate a vehicle rental or taxi service using NAFs if AAFES declines.
   6.26.1. In the US, vehicle rental or taxi services can only be authorized through
   concessionaires. Concessionaires must provide the vehicles and commercial liability
   insurance.
   6.26.2. In overseas areas, vehicle rental or taxi services can be operated with NAF-purchased
   vehicles or through concessionaires.
   6.26.3. APF vehicles, including vehicles obtained through DRMO cannot be used in these
   types of programs.
   6.26.4. Such programs must be self-sustaining.
6.27. Deleted

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Accounting Year—The accounting year is from 1 October of a given year through 30
September of the following year.
Activity—This term describes operational organizations within the SV structure, such as

                              PROCEDURES FOR AUCTIONS

A11.1. Overview . Use auctions as a way to dispose of NAF-owned property. The RMFC is
responsible, as appointed by the Services Commander/Division Chief, for the conduct of the
auctions. Procedures for both SEALED BID and OPEN auctions are provided below. Where
there are differences, the relevant auction type is clearly identified.
A11.2. Actions to Take Before the Auction . The Account Custodian, in coordination with the
Activity Manager, will:
   A11.2.1. Identify a suitable, secure location for the potential auction.
   A11.2.2. Identify the property and move the property to the auction location, if feasible.
   A11.2.3. Inventory all property and assign each item a unique number (for use only during
   the auction).
   A11.2.4. Complete an AF Form 2534, NAF Property Disposal/Transfer Receipt for the
   property to be auctioned (i.e., disposed).
   A11.2.5. Determine the current property (or undepreciated) value by reviewing the current
   property list. Contact the DRMO for assistance in determining the fair market value of the
   item. This will allow the RMFC to set appropriate ―minimum bid‖ values on items that still
   maintain a book value.
   A11.2.6. Maintain control of the property. This property must be secured until new owner
   pays and takes control.
   A11.2.7. Establish time frames for Sealed Bid and Open auctions. A SEALED BID auction
   has a bid acceptance period of one or more days and an OPEN auction is a supervised period
   of time (determined locally).
   A11.2.8. Advertise the auction. If SEALED BID, use the base paper, daily bulletin, or flyers
   to market and advertise the property viewing period, as well as the beginning and ending
   dates, and time of the bid acceptance period. If OPEN, advertise the length of the auction
   using the base paper, daily bulletin, or flyers. Do not allow pre-selection of purchases.
   A11.2.9. Enforce fairness. If SEALED BID, prior to the bidding period, provide the same
   opportunity to all potential bidders to view the property. If OPEN, provide inventory listings
   (i.e., advertise what is to be auctioned) prior to the auction.
   A11.2.10. Obtain an auctioneer. For an OPEN auction, locate an auctioneer, who must
   operate and call the auction. To locate an auctioneer, request the Services Contracting Officer
   establish a contract with an authorized auctioneer, (in accordance with AFI 64-301, NAF
   Contracting and AFMAN 64-302, NAF Contracting). Use of Services or other local
   personnel who are skilled as auctioneers is permissible.
A11.3. Actions To Take During the SEALED BID Auction Period .
   A11.3.1. Prior to the cut-off deadline, collect all bids at the identified central control point
   and place them unopened in a locked box.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                       85


   A11.3.2. On the day of the cut-off deadline, collect the bids from the central control point
   and open them in the presence of at least one witness from outside the Services organization.
   This is needed to maintain the integrity of the bidding process.
   A11.3.3. Record the amount of all bids on a locally devised form (hereafter ―bid sheet‖).
A11.4. Actions to Take During an OPEN auction.
   A11.4.1. Conduct registration according to guidance provided by the auctioneer and allow
   only approved authorized participation according to local policies (e.g., military personnel
   only; military, and DoD civilians only; or open to the public).
   A11.4.2. Work with the auctioneer to complete the necessary paperwork for the high bidder.
   A11.4.3. Perform and control the clerking function of the auction.
      A11.4.3.1. What is involved in clerking at an auction? The clerk identifies and records
      winning bids on a locally devised form or form provided by the auctioneer (hereafter ―bid
      sheet‖) and forwards the proper paperwork to the cashiers.
   A11.4.4. Perform and control the cashier function of the auction.
      A11.4.4.1. The cashier uses the bid sheet provided by the clerk to determine the amount
      the purchaser (i.e., high bidder) has agreed to pay.
      A11.4.4.2. Provide proper documentation for vehicles, trailers, etc., to the purchaser at
      the time of payment. Bills of sale or receipts should accompany all purchases. Purchasers
      may make payments with cash, money orders, or VISA® and MASTERCARD® without
      making prior arrangements to have the bank send a bank letter of credit/guarantee.
      Checks may be accepted from holders of valid Air Force Military or Civilian
      Identification Cards without making prior arrangements for bank letters of
      credit/guarantee. Ensure checks contain sufficient information to locate the check writer
      in case the check is returned for insufficient funds. To accept checks from the public,
      request bidders have their bank either mail, or facsimile, bank letters of credit/guarantee
      directly to the Resource Management Flight (RMF) project officer. It is important that the
      letter is received directly from the bank, and not the individual. Do not accept bank
      guarantee cards, or the equivalent. If there is a bank letter of credit/guarantee on file in
      the RMF, a check may be accepted.
A11.5. After the Auction Period Closes .
   A11.5.1. The Property Accounts Custodian will forward the bid sheet for sealed auctions to
   the RMFC.
   A11.5.2. The RMFC (or designee) will:
      A11.5.2.1. Notify the highest bidder with a time and deadline for property pick-up and
      payment. (For SEALED BID, only)
      A11.5.2.2. Maintain a list, using the bid sheet, of non-winning bids for each property
      item auctioned for a minimum of 60 calendar days. (For SEALED BID, only)
      A11.5.2.3. Receive the payment for purchases made at the time of pick-up by the highest
      bidder. (For SEALED BID, only)
86                                                             AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


     A11.5.2.4. Use the bid sheet to verify that funds received from the purchaser agree with
     the actual bid made.
     A11.5.2.5. Annotate the amount of the sale and the date each property item was received
     by its bidder on its respective AF Form 2534, NAF Disposal/Transfer Receipt.
     A11.5.2.6. Review the inventory listing to ensure all items sold are accounted for and
     that all unsold items are still on hand.
     A11.5.2.7. Provide a listing of items sold and dollar amounts collected to the RMFC for
     retention.
     A11.5.2.8. Attach a copy of the winning sealed bid to the AF Form 2534, NAF
     Disposal/Transfer Receipt, when completed. (For SEALED BID, only)
     A11.5.2.9. Complete a separate AF Form 1876, NAF Consolidated Cost Center
     Report, for the funds collected. Attach the bills of sale. (See Attachment 19 for a sample
     of the AF Form 1876.)
     A11.5.2.10. Ensure all AF Forms 2534 are completed, so that the items can be removed
     from the property list
     A11.5.2.11. Forward this documentation (including AF Form 1876, bills of sale, and AF
     Forms 2534) to the NAF AO following conclusion of the auction.
     A11.5.2.12. Deposit the payment with the Central Cashier no later than the next business
     day.
  A11.5.3. The NAF Accounting Office (NAF AO) will account for funds received for:
     A11.5.3.1. Items on NAF property records by crediting GLAC 913, Gain/Loss on
     Disposal of Assets, in the benefiting activity, and debiting GLAC 101, Cash in Bank.

installations a location change, the responsibility of the sales outlets will remain with Outdoor
Recreation. Under no circumstances, will management responsibility for a NAF Sales Outlet be
transferred to another activity.
A12.3. Who plays a role in the sales outlet operation? The RMFC, all SV activity managers,
and the Recreation or Community Support Flight Chief are responsible for the operation of this

Sales Outlet are provided in the paragraphs that follow.
   A12.5.1. Items Authorized for Sale . Sales may include NAF procured capital assets on
   NAF property records, NAF procured supplies, and other NAF procured items not on the
   NAF property records.
       A12.5.1.1. Cost Center Used. The sales activity operates in the cost center code (CCC)
       F6, NAF Resale Outlet. All direct Outdoor Recreation Activity expenses incurred to
       operate the outlet will also be recorded in CCC F6 (e.g., labor transfers for time spent
       running the outlet, supplies purchased, maintenance and repair costs, etc.). CCC F6 will
       be reimbursed for the handling costs associated with selling an activity’s excess
       equipment. This cost center should be operated on a break-even basis. In any one fiscal
       year, CCC F6 should neither profit nor lose from this venture (or the profit or loss should
       be nominal).
   A12.5.2. Determining Sales Price . The Activity Manager and the Chief, LSS determine the
   "fair market value" for all items to be sold. The RMFC resolves any pricing concerns. Enter
   the sales price of each item in the Remarks section of AF Form 2534. The Activity Manager
 88                                                                  AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


   signs as Property Custodian, the Sales Outlet Manager signs as Recipient. The Chief, LSS
   signs as Witness. Retain copies 1 and 2 of the form in the Outdoor Recreation files (CCC
   F6). Give copy 3 to the Activity Manager. The losing activity maintains the form until the
   item is sold and removed from the property records or is returned to the activity.
   A12.5.3. Determining Handling Fee. The handling fee covers any direct expense the NAF
   Resale Outlet may incur. For the first quarter in operation, the NAF Resale Outlet will set the
   reimbursement rate at 20% of sales. At the end of the first full quarter, the RMFC, working
   with the outdoor recreation manager, reviews the income and expense statement for the NAF
   Resale Outlet. If there is a profit, reduce the reimbursement rate for the remainder of the
   fiscal year to ensure profits are nominal. If there is a loss, validate expenses before increasing
   the reimbursement rate. Repeat this process at the end of each quarter. Your objective is to
   achieve a break-even operation.
   A12.5.4. Documenting Property Transfer to the Sales Outlet. The using Activity
   Manager (e.g., club, youth, etc.) prepares an AF Form 2534, NAF Property
   Disposal/Transfer Receipt, when selling NAF property. This includes NAF procured
   (excess) supplies or materials that are not on the activity’s property records. To complete the
   form:
      A12.5.4.1. Enter the name of the NAFI, Activity Cost Center, and the date of transfer to
      the Sales Outlet.
      A12.5.4.2. Enter the property number from your inventory listing under "Asset
      Designation Number."
      A12.5.4.3. Leave the assets designation number column for supplies and expendable
      equipment blank.
      A12.5.4.4. Include a brief description of the item(s) to be sold. The Acquisition value is
      the original purchase price of the item.
      A12.5.4.5. Change the column labeled "approval date" to "book value." In this column,
      enter the remaining (undepreciated) value of the item as listed on the property list. The
      gaining NAFI will be 51 and gaining cost center will be F6.
      A12.5.4.6. List the items as they are to be sold (i.e., set, pair, etc.).
NOTE:
Book value = acquisition value less accumulated depreciation.
   A12.5.5. Tagging Items for Sale. The Sales Outlet Manager tags all items using the
   information on the AF Form 2534. On the tag, include the asset designator, description, and
   sales price. Establish a list of consecutive numbers for items with no property list number
   (i.e., excess supplies or expendable equipment). Use each number only once and be certain
   you enter this number on the tag and on the AF Form 2534.
   A12.5.6. Record of Sales. Use a cash register tape or AF Form 2555, NAF Cash
   Collection Record, to record all sales. If a cash register is used, record the item number
   along with description.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                       89


   A12.5.7. Instructions for Preparing AF Form 1876, NAF Consolidated Cost Center
   Report (CCR). The Activity Manager or designee prepares AF Form 1876 each day for the
   prior day’s sales, inserting the GLAC lines needed in account number order.
       A12.5.7.1. Determine activity cost center from AF Form 2534 of item sold.
       A12.5.7.2. On the AF Form 1876, add the General Ledger Account Code (GLAC) of
       913, Gain/Loss on Disposal of Assets. The columns will be for each activity cost center
       codes of items sold. Consolidate items by cost center code. Enter the dollar amount on
       GLAC 913 for all equipment items and GLAC 812 for supplies and non-capital sales.
       The total should match the total accountability from the AF Form 1875, NAF Individual
       Cashier’s Report, if a cash register is used or the total sales figure if the AF Form 2555
       is used. (For the sale of lodging and other NAFI items, see paragraph A12.5.7.7 below.)
       A12.5.7.3. Add GLAC 801, Reimbursement from Another Activity/NAFI, to the line
       above GLAC 812. The cost center will be F6. Multiply each total of GLAC 913 and 812
       by the agreed upon Sales Outlet percent of sales. This handling fee covers only those
       direct costs related to the sales of NAF property. Examples of these direct costs are labor
       transfers for time spent running the outlet, supplies purchased for the resale activity,
       maintenance and repair costs associated with the sales outlet, etc. Enter the handling fee
       in GLAC 801. The sales outlet is intended to be a break-even operation. The handling fee
       will be set to achieve that objective. When posting to the general ledger, post only the
       total handling fee amount to cost center F6.
       A12.5.7.4. Add GLAC 789, Miscellaneous Operating Expenses, to the line that reads
       "Other". The cost centers will be the same as used for GLAC 913 and 812. Multiply the
       sales for each cost center by the same percentage used for GLAC 801. After you have
       completed the calculations, the total for all cost centers will equal the amount in GLAC
       801. If there is a variance due to rounding, make an adjustment so the amounts equal
       GLAC 801.
       A12.5.7.5. Enter the cash you deposit by cost center in the deposit line. The total will be
       your actual cash deposit.
       A12.5.7.6. Complete AF Form 1876 by finishing the Total Accountability and Cash
       Accountability lines.
       A12.5.7.7. Selling lodging and other NAFI items.
NOTE:
 Do not "mix" the sale of different NAFI sales on the same AF Form 1876. Use a separate AF
Form 1876 for each NAFI. The cost centers listed on the AF Form 1876 will only be for
activities in the same NAFI. Add the GLAC 249, Other Payables, for other NAFIs. The amount
on this line will be the amount of the items sold less the calculated sales handling percentage
amount. For example, using lodging sales of $75.00 and a sales handling fee of 20% ($75 x 20%
= $15; $75 - $15 = $60) enter the calculated percentage amount to GLAC 801. Prepare an AF
Form 1804, NAF Inter-fund Dollar Transfer, to reimburse the $60 for lodging for items sold.
The $15 sales percentage entry for the Disbursing NAFI (51) will be a debit to GLAC 249. The
entries for the receiving (lodging) NAFI (70) will be a credit to GLAC 913XX and/or
812XX(appropriate cost center) for 100% of the selling price, and debit 789XX (appropriate cost
center) for the calculated percentage.
90                                                             AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


     A12.5.7.8. Preparing AF Form 2534. The Sales Outlet Manager completes this form for
     all items sold and attaches it to the daily CCR. For items on the property listing, forward
     two copies of the AF Form 2534 to the NAF Accounting Office (AO). Using this form as
     the source document, the NAF AO removes any capital assets from the property list.
     THIS IS IMPORTANT AS AUDITS CONTINUE TO NOTE THE NAF AO’s
     FAILURE TO REMOVE PROPERTY FROM THE NAFI MASTER PROPERTY
     RECORDS. One copy is forwarded to the originating activity for them to adjust their
     records.
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                       91

                 that have to transport perishable foods at overseas locations and bases
                 without Prime Vendor. Additionally, the vehicle may be required at some
                 stateside locations to transport food from central prep locations, as well as
                 transferring finished and unfinished perishable products, and WRM rations
                 between dining facilities. The need to support field exercises and other local
                 contingencies constantly requires the use of a 2 1/2-ton refrigerated vehicle.
                 The height of the 2 1/2-ton vehicle is the minimum requirement because
                 smaller vehicles do not marry up to the receiving docks and require custom
                 ramps be built and used while loading and unloading products. This
                 constantly presents safety concerns to food managers.
                 Troop Support. 653 ABG/LGSE message 011541Z Apr 94, Subject: Basis
                 of Issue for Material Handling Equipment (MHE) to Support Troop Issue
                 Effective October 1994, states allowance for troop support will be entered
                 into the ―AZ‖ part and section of Allowance Standard 019 (formally Table of
                 Allowance 012), effective 1 May 94. All equipment identified on Food
                 Services’ original input for Troop Support is needed at both Prime Vendor
                 and non-Prime Vendor bases. Although the amount of Troop Support
                 warehousing will be greatly reduced when Prime Vendor is implemented,
                 we’ve asked bases to maintain their warehouses to accommodate storage of
                 some local purchase items, not provided by the Prime Vendor and to
                 accommodate storage of items for exercising units.

                  vans from the base motor pool.) The carpet cleaning vans are needed to

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2004-1 TO AFI 34-204, PROPERTY
MANAGEMENT. This interim change (IC) 2004-1 provides guidance for Air Force Services
Property Management. It incorporates revised definitions for pilferable items, bulk purchases,
and quantity supply type items. It includes new procedures to account for APF Budget Code 9
items. It includes updated inventory procedures for bulk and pilferable equipment items. A bar ( |
) indicates revision since previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.

3.3.3.1. For NAF and APF property, forward the original copy of the receiving documents to the
NAF accounting office and provide a copy of the receiving document to the Chief, LSS by the
next duty day.

3.3.3.3. The Chief, LSS, should file the NAF and APF receiving document in the folder for that
particular activity and retain it until they have completed their monthly Master Fixed Asset
Listing (MFAL) reconciliation to ensure all new property has been recorded. See paragraph
3.4.1 for a description of the MFAL.

3.3.3.3.1. DELETED.

3.4. PHASE 2 – Accounting for Property Received. All NAF, DRMO, and APF furniture,
fixtures, and equipment (FF&E) classified as accountable as well as items designated as
pilferable must be accounted for from the time a Services activity takes possession or a NAFI
takes title, until ultimate consumption or disposal of the property. There are two forms used to
record Services property, the Master Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL) or the Custodian
Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL).

3.4.1. Master Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL). The MFAL is the report used to record FF&E and
pilferable items from all sources - NAF, DRMO, and APF (except APF property with an
acquisition cost over $100,000). The NAF Accounting Office (AO) maintains the MFAL. The
MFAL will be used to record property for all Air Force Central NAFIs and NAFIs under the
purview of the Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Advisory Board (AFMWRAB), the
Air Force Civilian Welfare Fund Board, and the Air Force Fisher House Fund Board, and will
also be used to record property in readiness, mortuary affairs, and appropriated fund dining
facilities. The NAF AO will provide the Chief, LSS and applicable Property Account Custodian
a complete MFAL on a monthly basis. See Attachment 20 for a sample MFAL.

3.4.3. DELETED.

3.5. What Constitutes Non-Accountable FF&E? Non-accountable FF&E include:
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                        111


3.5.1. NAF Bulk Purchased FF&E. Equipment type items (televisions, microwaves, tables,
chairs, bar stools, mattresses, box springs, curtains, drapes, and other similar equipment items) if
they meet the criteria IAW AFMAN 34-214. These items will be capitalized and amortized as a
single line item on the MFAL unless locally identified as pilferable.

3.5.2. NAF Quantity Supply-Type Items. Supply items (stainless steel ware, glassware, linens,
bowling pins, irons, ironing boards, glass coffee pots/servers, clock radios, and other similar type
items) do not qualify as expendable equipment. These items are to be set up as prepaid supplies
or expensed directly to supply GLAC. High value supply items may be pro-rated for a maximum
of 3 years, at a minimum pro-rated amount of $75 per month.

3.6. What Constitutes Accountable FF&E? There are several categories of FF&E considered
accountable. All categories except APF Capital FF&E assets are accounted for on the MFAL.
They include:

3.6.1. NAF Capital FF&E. This property is purchased with NAFs, has an acquisition cost of
$1,000 and above, and has a useful life of 2 years or more. These are depreciated on the financial
records of the using activity’s cost center code over its useful life (AFMAN 34-214, Procedures
For Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management And Accounting, Table 7.1, Criteria for
Capitalizing Purchases, and Table 7.2. Depreciation/Amortization Rate Schedules). The same is
true if the item was obtained by transfer from a NAFI. These items are accounted for in the
MFAL.

3.6.2. NAF Non-Capital/Pilferable Items. This is FF&E with an acquisition cost of at least $100
but less than $1,000 (excluding expendables and consumable items). Non-capital FF&E is
expensed on the financial records of the using activity’s cost center at the time of acquisition.
The same is true if the item was obtained via transfer from another NAFI. Only those items
identified as pilferable will be accounted for on the MFAL.

3.6.2.1. Mandatory Services pilferable items include vehicles, non-disposable cameras, and
computer-related items not already on the property list. The Services Commander/Division
Chief, on the advice of the Property Account Custodian, Activity Manager and the RMFC, may
consider other items that make economical sense to track at their installation.

3.6.3. DRMO Capital/Accountable FF&E – These are items obtained from DRMO sources that
require NAFs for repair costs, freight, installation, and/or training of $1,000 or more with a
useful life exceeding 2 years. These items are accounted for in the MFAL.

3.6.4. DRMO Non-Capital FF&E – These items were obtained from DRMO and do not meet the
criteria in paragraph 3.6.3 above; however, they will be accounted for in the MFAL. (Note:
Consumable type items withdrawn from DRMO are not accountable as they are consumed in
use.)

3.6.5. APF Capital Accountable FF&E. This is property purchased with APFs with an
acquisition cost of $100,000 or above. These items are accounted in the R14.
 112                                                                 AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004


3.6.6. APF Budget Code 9 FF&E. This is property (including fitness center equipment)
purchased with APF with an acquisition cost between $2,500 and $99,999. These items are
accounted for on the MFAL.

3.6.7. APF Pilferable FF&E. This is APF property with an acquisition cost of at least $100 but
less than $2,500 and locally considered to have a high risk of being pilfered. Mandatory Services
pilferable items include fitness center equipment, non-disposable cameras, and computer-related
items not already on the property list. The Services Commander/Division Chief, on the advice of
the Property Account Custodian, Activity Manager and the RMFC, may consider other items that
make economical sense to track at their installation. These items are accounted for on the MFAL.
(Note: APF vehicles are managed by Base Transportation and will not be accounted for on the
MFAL.)

3.7. How Accountability is Maintained. Upon receipt of the receiving documents, the NAF AO
records all newly purchased accountable property in the general ledger. The NAF AO assigns a
locally established asset designator to identify the new property. See paragraph 3.7.1and Figure
3.1below for more information on asset designators. Once the property has been entered into the
accounting system, the system calculates depreciation, where applicable, for the NAF purchased
FF&E assets and expenses the cost to the using activity cost center.

3.7.1. Assigning Asset Designators. The first two digits use a prefix that identifies the type of
property (NAF, APF, DRMO). See Figure 3.1below.

3.8. PHASE 3 – Identification (Marking or Labeling Property). To ensure that Services-
owned property can be tracked and accounted for throughout its useful life, it must be labeled
and/or marked with identification based upon the type of funds used. Identification will be
affixed for the life of the property in a way that does not detract or deface the property.

3.8.1. Property Identification Labels. The NAF AO should provide the property account
custodian a property identification label within 7 duty days of receipt of the property. Labels can
be printed for the entire property system or labels can be printed for a specific activity. The label
program sorts on the asset designator field. It prints by number (asset designator) and shows the
property’s acquisition date, description, model number or serial number, cost center asset
account number, and NAFI.

3.8.2. LABELS FOR R14. The Chief, LSS must coordinate with Base Supply’s Equipment
Management Element to obtain labels for all items maintained on the R14, Custodian
Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL).

4.2.2.3. DELETED.

4.2.3.2. Repair. For items that need repair: 1) you or your custodian must know whether or not
items are under warranty or contract maintenance, including Government Purchase Card
purchases, 2) you must know if items are being accounted for on the R14 or on the MFAL, and
3) you must determine whether it is economically feasible/practical to fix the item. Do not repair
an item if the repair cost exceeds 75 percent of the acquisition cost. The custodian is responsible
for keeping the record of all repair cost. Purchasing a new item may be more cost effective.

4.2.4.1. Standard Property Folders. Maintain a standard property folder for your account. This
folder will include at a minimum, custodian appointment letters, a copy of the most recent R14
and MFAL, results of the last annual physical inventory, a pilferable list, a list of disposal
actions, and the status of actions for missing items.

4.4.1.5. APF FF&E (Budget Code 9 and Pilferable). The RMFC schedules this inventory that is
conducted by the property custodian, using the MFAL to check the inventory.

5.2. Procedures for Disposal of APF Property. Property purchased with appropriated funds
(APF) and which is now excess to the activity’s needs or unserviceable must be turned-in to Base
Supply for disposal. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, Part 13, Chapter 4 ―Turn-In Procedures‖
for additional guidance. APF FF&E should not be transferred outside the Services organization
without the assistance of Base Supply. For accountable APF FF&E transferred between Services
activities, ensure the activity is authorized the property in the appropriate Allowance Standard
(AS). If approved, ensure this transaction is reflected on the MFAL.

Who           Documentation
Approves
Services/CC     Losing Activity:
or Division
Chief           a. The Chief, LSS, assists the activity property custodian in preparing a DD
                Form 1348-1A, for the NAF property indicating that title is being transferred
                from the losing NAFI FF&E account (number) to the gaining activity APF
                account (number). In lieu of using this form, an approval letter from the NAFs
                Council may be used to record property title transfers.
                b. The RMFC reviews the DD Form 1348-1A (or NAFs Council’s letter of
                approval) in accordance with AFI 34-201.
                c. The Property Account Custodian notes the date the transfer was approved in
                the base NAFs Council minutes.
                d. Once the decision is made to transfer the item, the NAF AO removes the
                property from the NAF section of the MFAL and moves it to the APF section
                of the MFAL.
                e. The RMFC ensures property is properly transferred
                 f. The NAF AO retains a copy of the transfer document(s) in the life-of-the-
                fund file.
                g. The Chief, LSS, retains a copy of the transfer document(s) in the logistics
                office file
                h. The Property Account Custodian removes the NAF property label and
                replaces it with the APF asset designator label.

                Gaining Activity:

                a. The NAF AO moves the item from the losing activity’s MFAL and assigns an
                APF asset designator, adding it to the APF section of the gaining activity’s
                MFAL with a zero book value.
                b. The Property Account Custodian receives the property (refer to Chapter 3,
                Receive) and affixes a new APF property label (with the new asset identifier).

requirements of DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Material Disposition Manual, Chapter 4, paragraph
40, regarding identification and notification of owners and the time frames required for holding
such property before disposition. (For disposition of lost, abandoned, or unclaimed privately
owned vehicles, see paragraph 6.25)
AFI34-204 27 AUGUST 2004                                                                        117


6.6.1. For NAF Vehicle Purchases. The activity manager completes the NAF purchase request,
or other purchase documentation as needed by contracting and sends it to the VCO. The VCO
coordinates and forwards the purchase request to the RMFC to ensure funds are available to
purchase the vehicle. The NAF purchase request is forwarded to the NAF purchasing clerk. The
Air Force NAF Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO) Commanders Smart Buy Program should be
used whenever possible. Bases are not authorized to use NAF to lease vehicles on a permanent
dispatch. This is due to the 2,000-mile vehicle policy.

6.9.3.4. For overseas commands, MAJCOM/SVs may authorize marking exemptions for vehicles
located within their areas of responsibility when conspicuous identification could endanger the
security of individuals or U.S. Government interests.

6.14. Use of Specialty Vehicles. Specialty vehicles are defined as tractors, forklifts, tow trucks,
flat bed trucks, reefers, lift trucks, box trucks, etc. These vehicles must be used for a "special
purpose", e.g., refrigerated to move food or some other unique purpose where that certain vehicle
type is required. The major function of specialty vehicles cannot be to transport personnel. Golf
carts used by golf course patrons are not considered specialty vehicles; however, golf carts used
by activities in performance of duties are considered specialty and should be listed on the
specialty report.

6.15.3. Use by Protocol or Installation Requirement. Do not use NAF vehicles for base protocol
or any non-Services transportation requirements unless the installation Commander authorizes
each use in writing. Each authorization states that the vehicle is being temporarily assigned to the
protocol function or installation activity requiring the use of the vehicle and that the duration of
the assignment will not be a detriment to the Services mission and its usage will be covered by
APF benefits. In addition, each authorization should state why Base Transportation could not
support the protocol or installation requirement. NOTE: When used for protocol or an
installation requirement, the vehicle is serving an APF function and the NAF self-insurance
liability program does not apply. Drivers must be in an official duty status.

6.15.4. For NAF vehicles being used for APF protocol or installation functions:
