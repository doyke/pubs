This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 91-2, Safety Programs, and provides
guidance for the participation and execution of the Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program as
mandated by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. This
operating instruction applies to the 52 Fighter Wing Safety office (52 FW/SE), 52 Operations Group (52
OG), 52 OG Standardization Evaluation office (52 OG/OGV), 52 Operational Support Squadron (52
