A2.5. Resource Protection and Crime Prevention Briefing: The Air Force Resource
Protection Program is designed to be a cooperative effort between the security police and the
military community to eliminate or minimize the opportunity and desire to engage in criminal
activities. One mechanism designed to accomplish these objectives is the appointment of crime
prevention personnel. Our organization crime prevention personnel are the primary and alternate
Security Managers for the squadron. Their duties include, (1) conducting quarterly recurring
training, (2) distributing crime prevention materials, (3) coordinating participation in project
identification, and (4) identifying and correcting crime hazards throughout work areas. The most
widely publicized element of the base crime prevention program is operation CRIME STOP 734-
2000. Extension 734-2000 is a dedicated phone line terminating at the police dispatcher’s office.
Please use 734-2000 to report any crime that you witness being committed at this ALC.
A2.6. Bomb Threat Briefing: All supervisors are required to advise new employees of proper
bomb threat procedures as part of their orientation briefing. AF Form 440, Bomb Threat Card is
to be posted by every telephone on base. The first rule is to ―REMAIN CALM‖. If you are the
recipient of a bomb threat call, only you can exploit the situation and provide security police
with information needed to safeguard life and property and apprehend the offender. If you
receive a bomb threat call, alert a co-worker to call security police at extension, 734-2000, 734-
3737, or 734-3738. Keep the caller talking as long as possible. Ask questions: When is the
bomb going to explode? Where is it right now? What does it look like? What kind of bomb is
it? What will cause it to explode? Did you place the bomb? Why? Where are you? What is
your name? Even flippant responses from the caller can provide security police with information
of value. The longer you keep the caller talking, the more your mind will retain in relation to
voice characteristics and background noises. When the caller hangs up. Lay the receiver down –
do not break the connection. The next step for the recipient of the call is to finish completing AF
Form 440 and write down everything you can remember of the conversation. Then brief you
supervisor. Your supervisor directs personnel to secure any classified materials and search the
immediate area for something out of place. Do not touch strange objects. If you are directed to
evacuate, unplug typewriters and other office machines that make noise. To evacuate, use an
established route to a predetermined location to ensure accountability (your supervisor provides
this information to you). Please take your personal possessions (coat, purse, car keys, etc.) with
you. You may be out of the area some time. NOTE: Your supervisor reverses AFMC Form

3024 posted at the exit. This will indicate to the security police that the area has already been
searched.
A2.7. Operation Security (OPSEC) – Phase I Training: OPSEC is the process of denying
adversaries information about friendly capabilities and intentions by identifying, controlling, and
protecting indicators associated with the planning and conduct of military operations and other
activities. Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI) were developed by our squadron.
EEFIs are critical facts about friendly operations and activities, which, individually or in the
aggregate, reveal sensitive details about capabilities and intentions, and require protection from
hostile intelligence collection and exploitation. During Phase II Training EEFIs for this
squadron are discussed and instructions provided to you on how this information is protected.
