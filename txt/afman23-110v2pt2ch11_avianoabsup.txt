11B9.3.1. (Added) The use of Transaction Exception Code/s (TEX) “D” is authorized for
unserviceable issues to Air Force Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP) with the exception of
ERRC XD* items. Resource Management (RM) will be notified when these issues are processed
to ensure all free issue cost data are captured and reported.
Table 11B9.1. TEX and Explanations. TEX %: The LRS/CC option is taken. Items with
Mission Impact Code (MIC) 3, 4, or blank and ERRC XB3 or NF1 (with Issue Exception Code/s
(IEX) E/6 or 3/K) may be offered for sale at a reduced price (in lieu of transfer to disposal) after
365 days in retention. ERRC XB3 or ERRC NF1 (with IEX E/6 or 3/K) items with MIC 1 or 2
assigned may be sold at a reduced price after 700 days in retention (i.e., 30 days before the full
retention period is met). Budget codes 1 and 9 are the only budget codes allowed. The LRS/CC
AFMAN23-110V2PT2CH11_AVIANOABSUP 9 JANUARY 2012                                                 9


option to determine the percentage of discount (from 01 up to a maximum of 99 percent off) is
also taken. Only items on hand will be discounted and backordering at a reduced price is not
allowed. To ensure only items approved by the LRS/CC are issued, RM shall review the Base
Supply Surveillance Report (D20), part 11, Reduced Price Issues. Issue inputs not meeting the
above conditions will produce a non-cumulative 001 reject. See AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2,
Part 2, Chapter 7 for corrective action.
11B15.5.1. Using a AMS hand held terminal (HHT), the Documented Cargo (DC) driver will
scan the AMS label on the property to be delivered, prior to effecting the delivery. At
destination, a receipt confirmation signature will be obtained by the driver inserting the
customer’s Smart Card into the HHT, and the customer entering their Personal Identification
Number (PIN). If accepted, the asset will be released to the customer and the driver will be
relieved of property responsibility. If PIN is not accepted, the driver will obtain customer
information and signature on DD Form 1348-1A, AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, or a
locally developed hand receipt. Upon return to DC, the driver will generate an AMS label and
affix it to the locally developed form, which will be forwarded to the CSLE.
11B15.5.1.1.1. (Added) To indicate asset movement from the applicable storage area to DC, the
AMS label affixed to the bin location will be scanned, and DC will in turn acknowledge receipt
and responsibility by scanning the property label.
11B15.6. DC will scan property label information into the Cargo Movement Operation System
to clear the shipment suspense details.
11B16.4.3.2. I023 management notices will be forwarded to the requestor.
Table 11B17.2. (Aviano) Note 2. For proper assignment of these codes, see AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 10, Paragraph 10C4.9, Hazardous Commodities. The Hazardous
Materiel Element will monitor IEX 7, 8, and 9.
