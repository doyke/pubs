This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, Environmental Quality, by identi-
fying US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) requirements for an Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) in a
real property transaction. This instruction complements AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property, and
AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property. It applies to all USAFE operations. It does not apply to US Air
Force Reserve or Air National Guard units.



1. How To Use This Instruction
   1.1. Background. Use the procedures in this instruction when considering real property acquisition,
   out-grant, or disposal.
   1.2. Concept:
       1.2.1. Air Force Instruction 32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys in Real Estate Transac-
       tions, does not apply overseas; therefore, this instruction is intended to fill the void.
       1.2.2. The EBS replaces the USAFE Environmental Status Report (ESR) currently required for
       base closure actions.
   1.3. Responsibilities:
       1.3.1. Installation Civil Engineer. Prepares the EBS reports. Ensures the EBS is addressed
       prior to forwarding any real estate transaction for approval according to AFI 32-9001 and AFI
       32-9004.
       1.3.2. Major Command (MAJCOM) Civil Engineer . Provides execution guidance and over-
       sees implementation of this instruction.

2. Requirements
2                                                                USAFEI32-7066 9 FEBRUARY 1996

    2.1. Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS). Each installation must conduct an EBS when consider-
    ing acquisition, out-grant, or disposal of real property.
       2.1.1. Purpose. The purpose is to identify potential environmental contamination liabilities and
       other environmental constraints associated with a transaction. In the case of out-grant or disposal,
       the EBS becomes a tool to disclose any suspected contamination to property recipients.
       2.1.2. EBS Documentation. Each installation must document the nature, magnitude, and extent
       of any environmental contamination of real property considered for acquisition, out-grant, or dis-
       posal.
           2.1.2.1. AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis. For real property
           acquisition, the EBS may be documented on an AF Form 813 in conjunction with the Environ-
           mental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). The AF Form 813 may be used if the initial records
           review, interviews, and site inspections indicate no potential or existing sources of contamina-
           tion; thereby, eliminating the need to prepare an EBS Report. The AF Form 813 must specifi-
           cally mention the EBS, the property category (see paragraph 2.3.2), and recommendation (see
           paragraph 2.3.3).
           2.1.2.2. EBS Report. An EBS report must be prepared when initial records review, inter-
           views, or site inspections indicate potential or existing sources of contamination. Addition-
           ally, an EBS report must be prepared for each disposal or out-grant of real property.
    2.2. Investigations . The installation must make a reasonable effort to gather known information on
    the subject property including review of available studies and records, reasonable inquiry into the
    existence and availability of relevant information, and interviews of current and former employees
    involved with operations. Collection of additional samples or initiating new surveys is not required,
    unless a site is suspected to pose an imminent and substantial threat to human health or environment.
    2.3. The EBS Report. The format for the EBS report is at attachment 1.
       2.3.1. Approval. The installation’s Environmental Protection Committee (EPC) must approve
       the EBS report.
       2.3.2. Conclusions. Based on the findings, the EBS report shall categorize the potential, or exist-
       ence, of contamination for each property or area using the categories below.
           2.3.2.1. Category 1 - No storage, release or disposal has occurred. Property where no haz-
           ardous substances were stored, released into the environment or structures, or disposed on the
           subject property and where no migration from adjacent areas has occurred.
           2.3.2.2. Category 2 - Only storage has occurred. Property where hazardous substances were
           stored, but no release, disposal or migration from adjacent areas occurred.
           2.3.2.3. Category 3 - Contamination below levels that require any action. Property where
           contamination is suspected but falls below established action levels, as determined by DoD
           policy and international agreements.
           2.3.2.4. Category 4 - Remedial action required and taken. Property where contamination
           existed but all remedial actions necessary to protect human health and the environment have
           been taken.
USAFEI32-7066 9 FEBRUARY 1996                                                                          3

         2.3.2.5. Category 5 - Remedial or other action underway. Property undergoing remedial
         action for known contamination. Remedial systems are partially or entirely in place, but have
         not been fully demonstrated.
         2.3.2.6. Category 6 - Required response action not implemented. Property containing known
         contamination and required remedial action has not been selected or implemented.
         2.3.2.7. Category 7 - Further evaluation required. Property where contamination is sus-
         pected and approaches established action levels, as determined by DoD policy and interna-
         tional agreements, but is not well characterized.
     2.3.3. Recommendations. For real property acquisition, make the following types of recommen-
     dations in the EBS report based on the conclusions related to the presence of hazardous sub-
     stances.
         2.3.3.1. Proceed with planned transaction. This applies if the property falls in categories 1-4,
         or those portions of the property falling into categories 5-7 are excluded.
         2.3.3.2. Do not proceed with an acquisition if property falls in categories 5-7 unless Air Force
         mission needs necessitate the transaction or other unusual circumstances exist. Procedures in
         section 2.4 apply.
  2.4. Procedures for Unremediated Property. Take the following additional actions before proceeding
  with acquisition, out-grant, or disposal of real property falling in categories 5-7.
     2.4.1. Health and safety experts shall determine risk and provide input into preparing the transac-
     tion document.
     2.4.2. Identify required mitigation measures and associated costs to reduce environmental, health,
     or safety risks associated with the property.
  2.5. Termination or Expiration of Interests . At the termination or expiration of an interest, docu-
  ment any environmental changes in a supplement to the EBS, or redo the EBS as appropriate.
  2.6. Coordination With the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). The EBS shall be
  used to support the environmental planning process. Use the EBS report as the first step in the EIAP
  for base closures.
