SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. General. The emphasis on environmental pollution prevention and abatement requires all
base activities, including housing occupants, contractors, and tenants who generate non-domestic
wastewater, to review their processes that generate wastewater and their disposal procedures.

                    GENERAL RESTRICTIONS FOR ALL ACTIVITIES

The following prohibitions apply to all domestic and non-domestic users regardless of and in
addition to any specific pretreatment standards. These prohibitions are from 40 CFR 403.5, with
modifications recommended in the Protocol for the Preparation of Installation Pretreatment
Programs (USACE, 1999)
A2.1. General Prohibitions: Users shall not discharge pollutants that will pass through the
WWTP or interfere with operation and/or performance of the treatment facility.
A2.2. Specific Prohibitions
Users shall not intentionally introduce the following pollutants into the sanitary sewer system:
a. Pollutants that create a fire or explosion hazard in the WWTP or its conveyance system. In no
case, will a waste stream have a flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (0F) using test
methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. These pollutants include, but are not limited to: gasoline,
kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, and pyrogenic or explosive materials.
b. Pollutants that will cause corrosive structural damage to the WWTP. In no case shall
discharges with a pH lower than 5.0 or greater than 10.0 standard units be made.
c. Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts that will or may cause obstruction to the flow in the
WWTP or its conveyance system, resulting in interference. These pollutants include, but are not
limited to: animal/vegetable fats, oils, and greases (FOG); petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL);
ashes; cinders; mud; lime slurry; straw; shavings; metal; glass; rags; feathers; tar; plastics; wood;
paunch; manure, or disposable diapers
d. Any pollutant, including biological oxygen demand (BOD) or chemical oxygen demand
pollutants, released in a discharge and at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration that will
cause interference with/at the WWTP and its conveyance system. These pollutants include, but
are not limited to aqueous film forming foams (AFFF).
e. Heat in amounts that will inhibit biological activity in the WWTP resulting in interference,
but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the WWTP exceeds 1040F unless the
PPM, in conjunction with ADEC, approves alternate temperature limits.
f. Petroleum-based products, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin will
not be discharged to the sewer, except for incidental amounts that are generated during
equipment and facility washing operations. Discharge will then only be allowed after the
effluent is pretreated through the use of an OWS or some other device designed to remove oil
from water.
g. Pollutants that result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the WWTP
and/or its conveyance systems in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety
problems.
h. Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the WWTP.
i. Any chemical surety materials, except as noted below. Simulated and experimental surety
agents that produce the characteristic effects of surety materials on living tissue (e.g., blistering,
cholinesterase inhibition, etc.), but have not been designated by the DoD as surety material, also
354FWI32-7003 26 JANUARY 2010                                                                 9


are prohibited from being discharged to the sanitary sewer. De minimis amounts of surety agents
may be discharged to the WWTP and its conveyance system if associated with decontamination
of personnel in accordance with contingency plans for biological or chemical attack.
j. Any RCRA-listed hazardous wastes or mixtures that contain those wastes, that do not meet the
requirements of 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv), and that do not meet the local discharge limits
established by the WWTP Pretreatment Plan.
k. Any wastewater containing radionuclide concentrations greater than natural background
levels, unless approved by the PPM.
l. Any substance that may cause a violation of the Eielson AFB WWTP wastewater disposal
permit, or render as hazardous the sludge produced by the WWTP.
m. Pollutants incorporated in any State standard for the purpose of protecting the WWTP, and as
specified in the WWTP's wastewater disposal permit, will be enforceable as pretreatment
standards.
A2.3. Specific Treatment Requirements

a. All silver-contaminated wastewater will be collected and disposed of through a silver
recovery unit.

b. Aircraft, AGE, and government or commercial vehicle washing shall be performed in wash
racks connected to an oil/water separator unless authorized by the Base Civil Engineer.

c. Ground water or storm water contaminated with petroleum products cannot be discharged in
sanitary sewers. Contact the Natural Resources Management Element, 354 CES/CEAN, for
approval and guidance.

d. Direct and/or indirect discharge of uncontaminated ground water or storm water to the
sanitary sewer system is prohibited unless authorized by the Base Civil Engineer to clear
utilidors of ground and/or storm water.

e. Shop floor drains will remain plugged until needed to drain authorized waste unless exempted
by CEOI and CEAN.
