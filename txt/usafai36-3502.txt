                                             Chapter 1

                  INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS PROGRAM (IEP)

1.1. Institutional Effectiveness (IE) Definition. IE is ―
                                                        the process of articulating the mission,
setting goals, and using data to form assessments in an ongoing cycle of goal setting and
planning‖ (Grossman & Duncan, 1989).
1.2. USAFA IEP.
     1.2.1. Purpose. USAFA’s IEP:
        1.2.1.1. Facilitates a culture of continuous improvement.
        1.2.1.2. Establishes USAFA’s Strategic Goals, USAFA’s Outcomes, and the USAF
        Institutional Competencies (GOCs) as the institutional standards by which USAFA’s
        effectiveness will be measured.
        1.2.1.3. Establishes Institutional Effectiveness Indicators (IEIs) as the high level,
        measurable indicators of success directly linked to USAFA GOCs.
        1.2.1.4. Institutional Assessment (IA), Program Evaluation (PE) and Institutional
        Research (IR) are the set of complementary and occasionally overlapping assessment
        activities (hereafter called IEP Efforts) which are used to assess the quality and
        effectiveness of plans, programs, activities, and/or other initiatives. The collective results
        obtained from IEP Efforts will provide information regarding the accomplishment of the
        GOCs.
        1.2.1.5. Delineates the reporting requirements necessary to document USAFA’s progress
        in meeting its GOCs.
        1.2.1.6. Supports funding and resource requirements.
        1.2.1.7. Increases efficiency through sharing of information.
        1.2.1.8. Drives accountability to the program level.
        1.2.1.9. Systematically measures the quality and effectiveness of education, training,
        developmental, and support programs.
        1.2.1.10. Provides information to program managers and the Institution for planning
        improvement.

                                           Chapter 2

     VISION, MISSION, PHILOSOPHY, GOALS, OUTCOMES, AND COMPETENCIES
                                   (GOCS)

2.1. Vision. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF),
and Superintendent share one vision for the Academy: USAFA … the Air Force’s premier
institution for developing leaders of character. AFPD 36-35, United States Air Force Academy,
promulgates the following to support this vision: ―   The United States Air Force Academy
(USAFA) will develop and commission officers of character, and serve as a proud symbol of the
Air Force to the American people‖ (AFPD 36-35, 1).
2.2. Mission. While aspiring to become the Air Force’s renowned character and leadership
development institution, the Academy must perform its mission effectively to fulfill policy
directives. The USAFA mission is: ―   To educate, train, and inspire men and women to become
officers of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation‖
(AFMD 12, United States Air Force Academy, 1).
2.3. Philosophy. The USAFA Officer Development System (ODS) (USAFA Pamphlet 36-
3527) is ―the overarching doctrinal framework for systematic development of USAFA cadets
toward achievement of the USAFA outcomes.‖ The ODS Guiding Principles are set forth in
Table 2.1 below.

Table 2.1. ODS Guiding Principles.
 1) Align the USAFA experience with accepted USAF practices.

 2) Emphasize cadet ownership and accountability for his/her development.

 3) Ensure all leaders and followers gain from each developmental experience, including both
 successes and failures.

 4) Establish a common core of experiences and multiple paths to similar outcomes.

 5) Strike an appropriate balance between quality and quantity of development experiences.

 6) Create depth of expertise sequentially and progressively based on a cadet’s developmental
 level using the Personal, Interpersonal, Team and Organizational (PITO) model.

 7) Couple adequate support with every challenge; tailor every challenge with an appreciation
 that cadets develop differently and will move through the process at different speeds.

 8) Use goal-oriented and standards-based approaches to build skill-set expertise.

 9) Assess the effectiveness of education, training and experiential processes in accordance with
 the USAFA IEP, USAFAI 36-3502.
USAFAI36-3502 21 OCTOBER 2008                                                               7


2.4. GOCs. IE will be measured by evaluating success relative to three primary nodes: the
USAFA Strategic Goals, USAFA’s Outcomes and the USAF Institutional Competencies.
   2.4.1. USAFA Strategic Goals. An extension of the Air Force Strategic Plan, USAFA’s
   Strategic Plan identifies strategic goals, objectives, and measures (ref. United States Air
   Force Academy Strategic Plan 2008-2013, Volumes I & II). The Academy’s seven strategic
   goals (Table 2.2) are broad focus areas that, when achieved, will better enable USAFA to
   achieve its mission essential tasks.
 8                                                        USAFAI36-3502 21 OCTOBER 2008


Table 2.2. USAFA Strategic Goals.
 1. Focus on character and leadership development. All cadet activities and institutional
 assessments will elevate and integrate character and leadership development. Our Air Force
 core values, “Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do,” are the
 foundation of character. We will redouble our efforts to blend character and leadership
 development into all aspects of the cadet experience and implement a cohesive program to
 assess cadet character transformation.

 2. Strengthen our communication and reputation. Strengthen the Academy’s strategic
 communications and enhance our reputation. Communicate USAFA’s reputation as a proud
 symbol of the Air Force to the American people. Maintaining and improving our
 communications processes will support our integration efforts.

 3. Produce highly educated and trained officers. In an institutionally-integrated manner,
 develop officers of character with in-depth academic, technical and military skills and
 competencies for leadership in air, space and cyberspace in Air Force and Joint operations.
 We will expand our unique opportunities to prepare our graduates to excel in support and
 operational roles across the spectrum of conflict.

 4. Enhance faculty, staff and cadet diversity. Ensure we have the faculty, staff, and cadet
 diversity to broaden the cadet-learning environment and prepare USAFA graduates to lead in
 a global expeditionary Air Force. We will use our total force expertise to expose our cadets to
 new ideas, beliefs, and experiences while emphasizing language and culture to enhance their
 worldview.

 5. Integrate institutional processes. Integrate the Academy’s strategic planning, business
 and program development processes and ensure our programs have defined outcomes and
 measures. We will make processes transparent and share information to make timely and
 accurate decisions. We will implement AF Smart Operations to better use resources and
 create flexibility to increase capability to execute our mission.

 6. Prepare and motivate the workforce. Provide a well-prepared and motivated workforce
 focused on the mission. We will develop and implement a force development program to
 attract, develop, retain and support our people and focus on their professional contributions so
 they can better use their talents in new and innovative ways.

 7. Secure and manage resources. Obtain and manage resources for our mission activities by
 maintaining effective institutional investment strategies and management processes. We will
 work to successfully define and present program proposals that garner corporate and sponsor
 support for our new and ongoing initiatives to better achieve our mission.
     2.4.2. USAFA Outcomes. Focus development throughout each cadet’s USAFA experience,
     and well into his/her Air Force career or other service to the Nation. Graduates must
     demonstrate the responsibilities, skills, and knowledge expected of professional
     commissioned officers. The Academy develops cadets to achieve institutional outcomes;
USAFAI36-3502 21 OCTOBER 2008                                                                 9


   consequently, every graduate is expected to achieve appropriate levels of these outcomes,
   regardless of different programmatic experiences. See Table 2.3.

   (ICL) (AFI36-2014, Attachment 5) requirements, USAFA will report ICL performance
   measures to external agencies as directed.
2.5. USAFA IEIs. A series of high-level indicators of success directly linked to the GOCs.
These indicators are designed to capture USAFA’s overall mission-effectiveness and institutional
health.
   2.5.1. Examples of IEI focus areas that are directly linked to the GOCs include, but are not
   limited to:
       2.5.1.1. Character and Leadership.
       2.5.1.2. Diversity/Climate.
       2.5.1.3. Graduate Success/Retention.
       2.5.1.4. Employee Satisfaction.
   2.5.2. The USAFA MIT, in consultation with the IEB, will be responsible for establishing
   and monitoring USAFA’s IEIs and determining whether or not each is achieved (see Section
   3.7).

     2.5.2.1. All IEIs will be established utilizing baseline rates and historical data and will
     document USAFA’s progress in achieving our GOCs.
     2.5.2.2. Measuring achievement of each IEI will involve systematically collecting
     information, analyzing the data with reference to past findings, and identifying what

                          PROCESSES AND ACCOUNTABILITY

3.1. Assessing IE. IEP Efforts will measure the quality and effectiveness of plans, programs,
activities and/or other initiatives. The collective results obtained from IEP Efforts will provide
information regarding the accomplishment of the GOCs. In order to facilitate decision-making,
IEP Efforts should seek to synthesize information/data across disparate activities. Resources
available to assist with IEP Efforts include the Office of Institutional Assessment (A9A), the
Office of Institutional Research (A9N), and Assessment Professionals within the Mission
Elements (MEs).
3.2. Linkage. Each plan, program, activity, and/or other initiative, etc. conducted at USAFA
will be linked to one or more of the GOCs and/or ODS Principles. If an IEP Effort does not
sustain at least one GOC, it should be reviewed to determine its contribution to USAFA’s IEP
and whether resources should be dedicated to its accomplishment.
3.3. Unit of Analysis. To improve performance and management decisions, IEP Efforts should
examine the appropriate units of analysis. This is often the level where resource allocation,
management and/or command decisions are made.
3.4. Accountability. Normally, functional responsibility for GOC assessment is delegated as
follows unless otherwise directed by the USAFA MIT: PE to the ME commanders and
HQ USAFA Functional Directors (FD); USAFA Outcomes Assessment (OA) to the OST; and,
IA, IR, and IEP implementation to the Director for Plans and Programs (USAFA/A5/8/9).
3.5. Efficiency. Every attempt shall be made to consolidate data collection for IEP Efforts to
minimize the impact on cadets and other personnel.
   3.5.1. Any new IEP Effort identified out of cycle which would normally be included in the
   USAFA IEP Matrix (Attachment 3) (reference criteria set forth in 4.2.3) shall be briefed to
   the MIT for approval and include project description and a detailed justification regarding the
   nature of the effort. Once approval has been given by the MIT, the IEP Effort now qualifies
   as a planned assessment and requires an IEPR (reference 4.2) If a short notice IEP Effort
   (meeting the criteria set forth in 4.2.3) occurs out of cycle and cannot be included for
   approval at the next MIT meeting, then an IEPR part 1 and outbrief to the MIT will occur at
   the next MIT meeting following execution.
   3.5.2. All IEP Efforts utilizing surveys must comply with AFI 36-2601 and USAFA
   Supplement 1, Air Force Personnel Survey Program.
3.6. Strategic Steering Group (SSG). The SSG, as defined in USAFAI 16-501, Strategic
Planning and Programming, is the senior forum for cross-functional consideration of the most
critical Academy strategic planning, institutional effectiveness and programmatic issues.
3.7. USAFA MIT.
   3.7.1. MIT Purpose. Reporting to the SSG, the MIT strategically aligns IEP Efforts to
   sustain an institutionally effective, operationally relevant, and mission-focused environment.
   The MIT achieves economies of scale by integrating data collection efforts in support of
   GOCs.

                           (TEMPLATE)

Highlights significant findings across all IEP Efforts, organized by GOC supported.
Example
GOC supported: Strategic Objective 3.1: Create integrated Learning Experiences across all
USAFA Mission Elements to develop and assess the USAFA Outcomes in cadets.

Significant highlights: Seven programs were conducted and evaluated in support of this goal
with results indicating overall indicators for success were met. Specifically, cadets exposed to
six of these programs demonstrated a 15% increase in knowledge about airpower. One program,
―XYZ‖ was eliminated due to lack of results. Findings were communicated back to course level
instructors and the OST Chair to provide opportunities for continued improvement.
Several global changes to improve programs were discussed and implemented. These include:

 ODS-4 Establish a common core of experiences and multiple paths to similar outcomes.
 ODS-5 Strike an appropriate balance between quality and quantity of development
          experiences.
 ODS-6 Create depth of expertise sequentially and progressively based on a cadet’s
          developmental level using the Personal, Interpersonal, Team and Organizational
          (PITO) model.
 ODS-7 Couple adequate support with every challenge; tailor every challenge with an
          appreciation that cadets develop differently and will move through the process at
          different speeds.
 ODS-8 Use goal-oriented and standards-based approaches to build skill-set expertise.
 ODS-9 Assess the effectiveness of education, training and experiential processes in
          accordance with the USAFA IEP, USAFAI 36-3502.

 Strategic Plan Goals = G
