SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The Ellsworth Air
Force Base (EAFB) supplement was revised to align with AFOSH Standard 91-501 and AFOSH
Standard 91-501, Air Combat Command (ACC) Supplement. This supplement is designed to
meet specific EAFB LOTO requirements within the concept established by the basic Air Force
(AF) directive. It revises LOTO safety procedures and program requirements for all EAFB
LOTO personnel and work centers. Updates include minor administrative changes throughout
 2                               AFOSHSTD91-501_ELLSWORTHAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012


the document, and changes to training plan requirements. Other changes include the
establishment of the Fall Protection Working Group, a requirement for a fall protection
management book, and clarification of Emergency Shower and Eyewash requirements consistent
with ANSI Standard 358.1-2009.


13.2.3.4. Each squadron with work centers that maintain fall protection equipment (i.e. trolleys,
harnesses, lanyards, ect…) will establish Fall Protection Management (FPM) Books. The FPM
books will be established at the appropriate level based upon the commander’s discretion but will
be no higher than flight level. Squadron commanders will also formally determine in writing the
level they prefer and copies of this determination will be sent to 28 BW/SEG and maintained in
each FPM book in TAB A. The FPM books will contain the following tabs:

- Tab A: Appointment letter (person responsible for the work center or flight level fall
protection program and any competent persons which are knowledgeable of the equipment being
used and how to inspect it and are not consider a ―user‖ of the equipment.

- Tab B: A listing of fall protection equipment used in the work center or flight.

- Tab C: Copies of all manufacturers’ instructions regarding the inspection, maintenance,
cleaning and storage of fall protection equipment. Harnesses, carabineers, lanyards, trolleys, are
just a few items which have manufacturers’ instructions that must be maintained. Additional
requirements for this tab will be either copies of or direct references to T.O. 00-25-245, AFOSH
Standard 91-501, paragraph 13.2.3, and AFOSH Standard 91-100, paragraph 8.2.5 as applicable
for flight line applications.

- Tab D: Inspection Logs and related documentation.

- Tab E: Unserviceable tags for defective equipment.

- Tab F: Fall protection training procedures.

- Tab G: Fall Protection Working Group meeting minutes.

13.2.3.5. (Added) All work centers or flight with fall protection requirements will have a
representative at the Fall Protection Working Group (FPWG). The FPWG will meet at least
quarterly or at the discretion of 28 BW/SEG to provide training, foster discussion regarding fall
protection challenges, and inform attendees of new/revised guidance from HAF and ACC.
Agenda items to include the date, time and location of the meeting and related minutes will be
documented and distributed by 28 BW/SEG.
19.4.4. (Added) Eyewash bottles are intended as supplemental equipment only. They do not
provide the minimum flush (15 minutes) required by AFOSH Standard 91-501 and will not be
approved by 28 BW/SEG or 28 MDOS/SGPB for use by work centers in lieu of self-contained
portable eyewash units with the exception of remote/field use applications. Remote/field use
applications include vehicles or facilities that do not have appropriate heating or plumbing

   shall provide training to all personnel where LOTO is utilized. Each training plan will be
   coordinated and approved by 28 BW/SEG annually. Training plans will be updated
   whenever new processes or equipment are introduced to the work center. The LOTO
   training plan shall include as a minimum:
       - Completion of the LOTO ancillary computer based training (CBT) located in Advance
       Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) under the Safety section.
       - Reading the work center LOTO specific procedures for each piece of equipment on
       which LOTO procedures are applied.
       - Reviewing LOTO sequences contained in AFOSH Standard 91-501 paragraphs
       21.7.2.4. and 21.7.2.5
   21.6.2.1.3.1. (Added) Familiarization training will be conducted for affected personnel who
   may work in areas where LOTO procedures are utilized, but who do not use the program
   themselves. Familiarization training will be conducted in conjunction with job safety
   training and incorporated into the work center’s job safety training outline in either Section 1
   or Section 2.
   21.6.2.1.3.2. (Added) USRs assigned to a unit with LOTO program(s) will complete LOTO
   ancillary training computer based training (CBT) located in Advance Distributed Learning
   Service (ADLS) under the Safety section. Authorized LOTO personnel will be designated in

         SEQUENCE OF LOCK OUT/TAG OUT PROCEDURES OF EQUIPMENT

The steps that will be used for lockout of the following piece of equipment are:

Equipment: (Name)
Location: (Located in Bldg and room#)
Power source: (Type of power supplied: Hydraulic, Electrical, Steam etc.)
Magnitude: (200 Voltage, 700 psi, 600 degrees Fahrenheit, etc.)
Lockout Device to be used: (What you plan on using; Padlock with key, chain with lock, valve cover)
Sequence of Lockout or Tagout System Procedures should include as a minimum:

1. Notify all work center and affected personnel that a lockout or tagout system is going to be utilized and the
reason. Ensure the individual knows the type and magnitude of energy that the machine or equipment utilizes and
understands the hazards it presents.

2. If the machine or equipment is operating, shut it down by the normal stopping procedures
Explain how you shut it down i.e. depress stop button, open toggle switch, etc.

3. Operate the switch, valve, or other energy isolating devices to verify that equipment is isolated from its energy
sources. Explain how to dissipate or restrain stored energy (such as that in springs, elevated machine members,
rotating flywheels, hydraulic systems, and air, gas, steam, or water pressure, etc.) by methods such as repositioning,
blocking, bleeding down, etc. (List the
types of stored energy and methods used to dissipate or restrain.)

4. Lockout or tagout the energy isolating devices with assigned individual locks or
tags (methods selected; i.e., locks, tags, additional safety measures, etc.).

5. After ensuring that no personnel are exposed, and as a check, operate the push button or other normal operating
controls to make certain the equipment will not operate (types of equipment checked to ensure disconnection).
CAUTION: Return operating controls to ―neutral‖ or ―off‖ position after the test.

6. The equipment is now locked out or tagged out.

Restoring Machines or Equipment to Normal Production Operations:

1. After the servicing or maintenance is complete and equipment is ready for normal production operations, check
the area around the machines or equipment to ensure no one is exposed.

2. After all tools have been removed from the machine or equipment, guards have been reinstalled, and personnel
are in the clear, remove all lockout or tagout devices. Notify personnel that the locks or tags have been removed and
the equipment is in service and verify proper operation of equipment.
