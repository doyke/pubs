This instruction implements elevated privilege on the network for information and information systems at
Hill AFB according to AFMAN 33-223 Identification and Authentication paragraph 5.4.3., DoD
8570.01-M Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, AFI 33-202 Network and Com-
puter Security, and HQ AFMC/A6 AFMC Policy on Elevated Privileges to Information systems and
Applications policy letter dated 10 July 2006. It defines roles, responsibilities, training, and certification
requirements for all users requiring elevated privileges (aka administrative rights). It also provides policy
for appointing, training, evaluating, tracking, and certifying elevated privileged users. It provides com-
manders and supervisors with information and guidance to grant/deny elevated privileges to the fewest
number of individuals necessary to complete the organizational mission. It applies to all Government Fur-
nished Equipment (GFE) and information on the HAFB network. It is applicable to all users connected to
a GFE and operated networks, to include Air National Guard (ANG), Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC), Air Combat Command (ACC), and other tenant units. This instruction applies only to military,
contractor personnel under contract by Department of Defense (DoD) and non-bargaining unit civilians
who develop, acquire, deliver, use, operate, or manage AF information systems (IS) requesting elevated
privileges. It will be updated when bargaining unit civilians are to be included. It applies to all devices on
the HAFB network, inclusive of Windows, Non-Windows, Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network
(NIPRNET), and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) on which elevated privileges may
be used. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are main-
tained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://
afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. This instruction also
prescribes the use of Hill AFB Forms Elevated Privilege Request/Agreement (HAFB Form 547) and Ele-
vated Privilege Approval (HAFB Form 548).
OVERVIEW
2                                                                                                 HILLAFBI33-402 31 JULY 2008


The implementation of Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) has brought about the changes in our way
of maintaining and using GFE. Limited User Access (LUA) was implemented as a result of SDC. LUA
procedures sharply reduce the use of elevated workstation rights as we progress closer to the completion
of the AF SDC. LUA is a key element in providing greater network security as part of the overall goal.
Reducing elevated privileges and standardizing AF clients could dramatically reduce the long-term
administrative workloads and reduce possible compromises (per TCNO 2006-248-301, Implementation
of Limited User Access on NIPRNET Clients). Elevated privileges (sometimes referred to as administra-
tive rights) to an information system are to be restricted to the fewest number of individuals necessary to
complete the organizational mission. In most cases, these privileges will be restricted to Client Support
Administrators (CSA), Functional System Administrators (FSA), or network administrators. A few
instances exist where some elevated privileges must be granted to an individual computer user to run
applications or perform functions in support of the organizational mission. Throughout this instruction,
Information System Security Officer (ISSO) will be referred to as Information Assurance Officer (IAO).

                                     ALTERNATE ACCOUNTS

2.1. Alternate Accounts. All network accounts will be given the “least privilege” necessary to accom-
plish the mission requirements. Alternate Accounts are accounts that are used by individuals that require
more privileges to execute their duties than a standard user. These accounts are sometimes referred to as
secondary accounts. Individuals may not use personal accounts for administrative duties. Two network
accounts will be maintained In Accordance With (IAW) AFMAN 33-223 paragraph 5.4.3 and AFI 33-202
V1C5 paragraph 4.2.1.7.1. One account to do their daily work (i.e. emailing) and the second account to do
their elevated privilege duties. The two authorized extensions for these alternate accounts are .ADM and
.CSA. Alternate accounts are required to have an alternate token card to log into the network to perform
their administrative tasks.

2.2. .ADM Extension Alternate Account. One or all of the following must be met to use this type of
account:
   2.2.1. The individual administers, maintains, and manages server(s) or applications.
   2.2.2. Individuals using this type of account have a greater responsibility. With their elevated rights,
   these individuals also have a greater possibility of affecting more users. Due to this, more training is
   required to attain this type of alternate account.
   2.2.3. IT-I and IT-II Cat B level positions use .ADM alternate accounts.
   2.2.4. If applicable, FSAs with .ADM alternate accounts are given rights in AD to create, add, mod-
   ify, delete, and modify security settings of all objects within their area of responsibility in AD. FSAs
   grant access to CSAs and normal user accounts.
   2.2.5. An alternate token card must be used with this account.
   2.2.6. Refer to AFMAN 33-223, paragraphs 3.4.2. and 3.6. for password expiration guidance. Pass-
   words will not be set to “Password never expires”.

2.3. .CSA Extension Alternate Account. One or all of the following must be met to use this type of
account:
   2.3.1. IT-Cat A use .CSA alternate accounts.
   2.3.2. The individual provides client support administration, maintain and manage workstations,
   peripherals, and/or applications.
   2.3.3. Currently .CSA account rights are not managed by the Domain Administration team. They are
   managed by the organizational FSA, which brings about the importance of these individuals being
   properly trained and certified.
   2.3.4. An alternate token card must be used with this account.
   2.3.5. Refer to AFMAN 33-223, paragraphs 3.4.2. and 3.6. for password expiration guidance. Pass-
   words will not be set to “Password never expires”.

                                                POLICY

3.1. Personnel Filling IT-I and IT-II Positions. Which require elevated privileges will complete speci-
fied training; meet background investigation requirement, and documentation as specified in this instruc-
tion without exception.
   3.1.1. Any user requiring elevated privileges on any NIPRNET/SIPRNET GFE, inclusive of servers
   that are on the HAFB network will be required to have an alternate account.

3.2. GFE Laptops that are Used Off the Network. (e.g. TDY, Deployment, home). FSAs/CSAs are
responsible to put user’s account into the laptop’s local power users group before using the laptop off the
HAFB network.
   3.2.1. Once user’s account has been put into the power users group the laptop must be disconnected
   from the HAFB network, otherwise, the user will be removed from the group by a Group Policy
   (GPO).
   3.2.2. Properly sanitize, document, authorize, and encrypt GFE laptops when they are to be used Out-
   side the Contiguous United States (OCONUS). For further guidance reference policy dated 17
   November 2006, Transportation of U.S. Government Information in Temporary Duty Status signed by
   AFSAC/XPD Nancy Hudson, Chief of Foreign Disclosure and Policy Office and AFI 33-202 V1, Net-
   work and Computer Security. In the Contiguous United States (CONUS) encryption is required.

     5.1.6. Wing/tenant lead IAO fills out the first section of HAFB Form 548 (e.g. name, elevated privi-
     lege level from HAFB Form 547). If there are multiple HAFB Forms 547 consolidate the names on
     HAFB Form 548. Electronically send both HAFB Forms 547 and 548 to the DOR. They request DOR
     to digitally sign HAFB Form 548 for final approval of elevated privileges.
     5.1.7. DOR digitally signs HAFB Form 548 and electronically sends the documents back to the wing/
     tenant lead IAO.
     5.1.8. Once forms have been completed FSA is now authorized to create the user’s alternate account
     (e.g. .CSA or .ADM). Wing/tenant lead IAO is responsible of informing the FSA to create new alter-
     nate account for the individual.
     5.1.9. Wing/tenant lead IAO maintains these electronic forms within ERM.
     5.1.10. Forms must be electronically sent to the Hill Help Desk for completion of process.

                                      TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Training Guidance. IAW AFMC policy letter, Elevated Privileges to IS and Applications policy let-
ter , DoD 8570.1-M and AFI 33-115 V2, the 75 CS has made the decision to combine the training require-
ments in AFI 33-115 V2 for elevated privileges with the training requirements stated in DoD 8570.01-M.
This decision was to minimize the redundancy and extensive training requirements for individuals that are
performing IA functions in their currently assigned positions. AFI 33-115 V2, requires individuals to
complete the Network Professional Certification Program depending on the job duties or positions where
they are assigned.
     6.1.1. Ensure individuals requesting elevated privileges obtain specified training that corresponds to
     the highest level function(s) they perform required by their position.

6.2. Minimum Training Requirement. For any personnel to be granted elevated privileges, they must
follow the procedures stated herein. The training requirement is illustrated in Attachment 2.
     6.2.1. As a baseline all personnel with elevated privileges must complete Network User License (IA
     CBT). At a minimum the lowest level of elevated privileges requires the CSA CBT.

6.3. Training for Personnel Filling IT-I Positions. They are required to complete one of the following:
Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), Certified Information Systems Security Professional
(CISSP), Global Information Assurance Security Expert (GSE), or Security Certified Network Architect
(SCNA). The recommended training track is the CISSP certification. These certifications require recerti-
fication.
     6.3.1. Virtual Training Environment (VTE) via www.cert.org, commercial classroom courses, and IT
     E-Learning Skill Port all have made the required training materials and courses available to become
     proficient on the subject matter. This training is also beneficial in preparation for testing to attain the
     Global Information Assurance Security Essentials Certification (GSEC) and CISSP certifications in
     order to meet the DoDD 8570.01 Information Assurance Training, Certification, and Workforce Man-
     agement, requirements.
     6.3.2. IT-I personnel which are contractors must have the required training prior to being granted ele-
     vated privileges. Training requirement and background investigation must be reflected on the Perfor-
     mance Work Statement (PWS) as a stipulation for employment. Current contracts must be updated to
     include this requirement within the next three years (no later than end of 2010).
     6.3.3. List “NCC Administrator” (assigned only to the NCC, this is not inclusive of FSAs) instead of
     listing individual systems on Form 547.

6.4. Training for Personnel filling an IT-II Category A Positions. They are required to take the CSA
CBT. Recertification of this CBT will only occur if the CBT is updated.
     6.4.1. Contractors do have access to this CSA CBT through IT E-Learning Skill Port.
     6.4.2. List the system information requested on HAFB Form 547. Training is a “one-time” require-
     ment unless this CSA CBT is updated and a retake will be required at that time.
NOTE: These personnel will only be granted elevated privileges to a single workstation.

6.5. Training for Personnel Filling IT-II Category B Positions. They are required to complete either:
A+, Network +, Security+, GSEC, SCNP, or Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP). The recom-
mended training tracks are A+ certification for individuals performing CSA duties and Security + for
individuals performing FSA duties. See Attachment 1 “Terms/Glossary” for defined duties for FSAs and
CSAs. Recertification is required to maintain the previously listed certifications. However, recertification
does not apply to A+, Network+ and Security+ Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA)
certifications.
   6.5.1. The CSA course taught by the Base Functional 3A0X1 Functional Manager, VTE via
   www.cert.org, commercial classroom courses, and IT E-Learning Skill Port all have made the
   required training materials and courses available to become proficient on the subject matter. This
   training is also beneficial in preparation for testing to attain the A+ or Security + certification in order
   to meet the DoD 8570.01-M requirements.
   6.5.2. IT-II Cat B personnel which are contractors must have the required training prior to being
   granted elevated privileges. Training requirement and background investigation must be reflected on
   the PWS as a stipulation for employment. Current contracts must be updated to include this require-
   ment within the next three years (no later than end of 2010).
   6.5.3. On the HAFB Form 547, list “FSA”, “CSA” or “Multiple Systems” instead of listing individual
   systems.

6.6. Training Sourced. This training may be sourced for civilians and military personnel, but are not
limited to the following:
   6.6.1. Formal CSA Course, taught by the Base 3A0X1 Functional Manager is available to meet the
   IT-II Cat B training requirements to grant elevated privileges.
   6.6.2. Commercial classroom courses (i.e., New Horizons).
   6.6.3. Computer-Based Training (CBT) Track, for A+, Security +, and CISSP are available for civil-
   ians and military through IT E-Learning Skill Port.

                                   DOD 8570.01-M REQUIREMENTS.

7.1. DoD 8570.01-M Program. This program requires individuals to attain formal certifications that are
assigned to positions that perform IA functions. In order to meet this requirement, Air Force Communica-
tion Agency (AFCA) will be funding for vouchers so that individuals will be able to comply with the cer-
tification requirement. Ensure IA personnel performing IA functions obtain/maintain a certification
corresponding to the highest level function(s) required by their position.

7.2. Certification Vouchers. To apply for a voucher for certification testing individuals must complete
the training, for A+, Security +, and/or CISSP through VTE via www.cert.org, commercial classroom
courses, CSA Course, or IT e-Learning.
     7.2.1. Individuals must request voucher through AFCA fill out the request for voucher online at:
     https://private.afca.af.mil/optn/topic_view.cfm?topic_n=DoD%20Directive%208570%20Imp
     lamentation.
     7.2.2. Once the request is submitted, individual’s supervisor is notified. If supervisor approves your
     request, it will be forwarded to your training manager. If training manager approves the request, the
     MAJCOM Information Assurance Manager (IAM) is the last in the chain to make the final decision.
     7.2.3. After online request has gone through the approval process, individual will receive an email
     with instructions on how to access the Transcender study materials. Individual must pass Transcender
     pre-test with a score of 90% or better 30 days after email notification has been received.
     7.2.4. After passing the pre-test individual will receive another e-mail from Transcender with their
     voucher number and instructions on how to schedule the certification exam.
        7.2.4.1. If you pass the certification exam the results are to be kept for personal tracking purposes.
        7.2.4.2. If you do not pass your certification exam your unit will be responsible for the fees asso-
        ciated with your next exam. NOTE: The program will only allow for one certification per posi-
        tion. If a new position requires a different cert you may apply for that voucher. Vouchers that are
        funded by AFCA will only be granted for the A+, Security+, or CISSP certifications. If individu-
        als choose to do one of the other types of certifications as listed herein, they must be funded by the
        individual or the individual’s unit.
     7.2.5. In an attempt to centrally manage the DoD 8570 training/certification requirements the Hill
     AFB civilian training office (OO-ALC/DP-CTO) has budgeted and contracted A+, Security+, and
     CISSP classes from local course providers. OO-ALC/DP-CTO will be responsible to contact the indi-
     vidual's supervisor who is affected by the 8570 to schedule them to take the corresponding class. Cer-
     tification exams will be administered thereafter. The classes will be offered until the 8570 certification
     requirements have been met. If funding falls through the individual requiring certification may use the
     alternative training and certifying path stated herein Chapter 6.

                                   OTHER TYPES OF ACCOUNTS

8.1. Service Accounts. These accounts are defined as accounts that are used by system services for
authentication. Individuals shall not log on interactively to service accounts. A fully qualified administra-
tor (FSA/CSA) will be responsible for the service account and its usage, management, and/or administra-
tion.
   8.1.1. A service account with elevated privileges requires formal approval using HAFB Forms 547
   and 548. FSA must create the service account after being notified by IAO.
   8.1.2. The elevated privilege service account will be added into the corresponding AD authorized
   security groups by the Hill Help Desk. These accounts will not have any elevated privileges in the AD
   structure, but only on the systems where they are used.
       8.1.2.1. Refer to AFMAN 33-223, paragraphs 3.4.2. and 3.6. for password expiration guidance.
       Passwords will not be set to “Password never expires”.
   8.1.3. All accounts and passwords will be monitored to enforce password composition, expiration and
   disabling of accounts.
   8.1.4. IAW AFMAN 33-223 paragraph 5.4.1., disabling of accounts will take affect with inactivity
   exceeding 45 days. Disabled accounts will be deleted 90 days from the date they were disabled. If
   account is deleted, formal approval request must be resubmitted.
   8.1.5. Non documented elevated privilege service accounts will be impounded and disabled.
   8.1.6. Non-elevated privilege service account will be handled IAW AFMAN 33-223 like any other
   user account by the FSA/CSA.

8.2. Organizational/Group User Accounts. These accounts are defined as accounts that are used by
multiple people. Occasionally, concerns about mission accomplishment necessitate using group user-
names and passwords. FSA/CSA allowing group accounts and passwords must maintain individual
accountability. A manual solution is to require account users to note access date and time on a log sheet.
The process must be fully documented in the System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA) and the
risk must be accepted by the Designated Approving Authority (DAA). IAW AFMAN 33-223, paragraph
3.7.4.
   8.2.1. Elevated privileges on these accounts are not authorized and will result in the account being
   disabled and impounded.

                                                 Chapter 9

                      CAUSES FOR REMOVAL OF ELEVATED PRIVILEGES

9.1. Actions. Any actions which go against policies, procedures, or guidance on network usage would be
grounds for removal of elevated privileges. (e.g. unauthorized installation of software, unauthorized hard-
ware on the network, failure to complete training herein, not able to attain background investigation, etc.)
     9.1.1. Individual requesting elevated privileges fails or declines to sign HAFB Form 547.
     9.1.2. Incomplete HAFB Forms 547 and 548 (i.e. missing signatures).

9.2. Training. If training is not completed within the specified time frame (See paragraphs 3.5. and 3.6.)
elevated privileges retention will be reviewed by BIAO.

9.3. Background Investigation. Background investigation must be favorably granted and up to date.

9.4. Suspension or Removal of Privileges. On discovery of an action inconsistent with the terms on
HAFB Form 547 or listed herein, the wing/tenant lead IAO will recommend to the user’s supervisor that
the user’s elevated privilege be suspended. Wing/tenant lead IAO notifies FSA to disable user’s alternate
account.
     9.4.1. The supervisor will notify the user immediately, in writing, of the pending elevated privilege
     suspension, including the specific reason for the suspension and the steps the user must take to have
     access reinstated.
     9.4.2. If there is cause for removal of elevated privileges supervisor must notify DOR. DOR must
     notify BIAO of decision to have this take affect. It is up to the DAAR to make the final decision if ele-
     vated privileges will be removed permanently.

9.5. Reinstatement. Ordinarily, a suspended user will be required to participate in remedial training.
Upon satisfactorily completing retraining, the wing/tenant lead IAO authorizes the FSA to reinstate the
user’s alternate account. However, there may be situations that indicate to the wing/tenant lead IAO and
the user’s supervisor that even with remedial training the user would pose a threat to the security of the
system or operations. Under such circumstances, the DAAR, following full review of the case file and all
associated documents, may remove a user’s elevated privileges indefinitely.

Terms
.ADM—Account is for system administrators that maintain and manage servers or applications and
require more privileges to execute their duties than a standard user.
FSAs use .ADM accounts and are given rights in AD to create, add, modify, delete, and modify security
settings of all objects within their area of responsibility in AD. They grant access to CSAs and normal
user accounts. CSAs use .ADM accounts and are given rights in AD to do account administration (i.e.
update user info in AD), change passwords, and join workstations onto the domain.
.CSA—Account is for users that maintain and manage a single workstation which require limited
elevated privileges.
Alternate Token Cards—DoD issued PKI certificates that are embedded in this type of card.
Appointment—Signed elevated privileges statement/request by elevated privileged user, signed approval
letter by DOR, up to date background investigation and completed training requirement for elevated
privilege.
Authorization—Training validated, received statement/request, received signed approval from the DOR
and after all has been validated they are placed in the appropriate groups in AD by the Hill Help Desk.
Client Support Administrator (CSA)—CSAs serve as the first line of help to resolve customers’
administrative and technical problems. CSAs take direction from the NCC and FSA. NCC direction takes
HILLAFBI33-402 31 JULY 2008                                                                                27


precedence over FSA direction. CSAs install, configure, and operate client/server devices. Also known as
workgroup manager (WM).
Designated Approving Authority (DAA)—An official with the authority to formally assume
responsibility for operating an information system or network within a specified environment at an
acceptable level of risk.
Designated Approving Authority Representative (DAAR)—An official that acts on behalf of the
DAA on an installation.
Devices—Workstations, servers, peripherals, switches, routers, etc.
Documented—HAFB Form 547 and 548 forms fully filled out. This is to identify ownership and
approval sought to obtain the elevated privilege account.
DOR—Designated Organizational Representative. Also known as the organizational/Unit Commander.
Electronic Records Management (ERM)—Method of ensuring electronic records (e-records) are
available and protected in order to support business operations, as well as meet statutory requirements to
provide appropriate access throughout the lifecycle of the record.
Elevated Privilege—The administrative rights that are granted to a user who has access to system
control, monitoring, administration, criminal investigation, or compliance functions. Elevated Privileges
typically provides access to the following system controls: Access to the control functions of the
information system/network, administration of user accounts, etc. Access to change control parameters
(e.g., routing tables, path priorities, addresses) of routers, multiplexers, and other key information system/
network equipment or software. Ability and authority to control and change program files and other users’
access to data. Direct access to operating system level functions (also called unmediated access) that
would permit system controls to be bypassed or changed. Access and authority for installing, configuring,
monitoring, or troubleshooting the security monitoring functions of information systems/networks (e.g.,
network/system analyzers; intrusion detection software; firewalls) or in performance of cyber/network
defense operations.
Foreign National (FN)—Individuals who are non-U.S. citizens including U.S. military personnel, DoD
Civilian employees, and contractors.
Functional System Administrator (FSA)—FSAs ensure functional communities of interest systems,
servers, workstations, peripherals, communications devices, and software are on-line and supported.
Their responsibilities extend from the user's terminal to the server, but do not normally include the
network backbone infrastructure. FSAs are considered part of the NCC. FSA not assigned to the NCC are
a logical extension of NCC functionality.
Information Assurance (IA)—Measures that protect and defend information and ISs by ensuring their
availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. These measures include
providing for restoration of IS by incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.
