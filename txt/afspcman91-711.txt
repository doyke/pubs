This manual implements Air Force Space Command Instruction (AFSPCI) 91-701, Launch Safety Pro-
gram Policy, and the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Air Force and the
Federal Aviation Administration on Safety for Space Transportation and Range Activities. The purpose
of this manual is to describe the Launch Safety (formerly known as Range Safety) authorities and respon-
sibilities of organizations internal to Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). This manual does not contain
Launch Safety requirements for Range Users. Range User Launch Safety requirements are contained in
Air Force Space Command Manual (AFSPCMAN) 91-710, Range Safety User Requirements Manual.
AFSPC organizations should familiarize themselves with AFSPCI 91-701, to fully understand AFSPC
Launch Safety Policy. Organizations should also review AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 1, Air Force
Space Command Range Safety Policies and Procedures; Volume 2, Flight Safety Requirements; Vol-
ume 3, Launch Vehicle, Payloads, and Ground Support Systems Requirements; Volume 4, Airborne
Flight Safety System Design, Test, and Documentation Requirements; Volume 5, Facilities and Struc-
tures; Volume 6, Ground and Launch Personnel, Equipment, Systems, and Material Operations Safety
Requirements; and Volume 7, Glossary of References, Abbreviations and Acronyms, and Terms since
these documents provide Launch Safety requirements for Range Users that complement the requirements
expressed in this manual. This manual also defines and implements the Launch Safety Program policy
and responsibilities for AFSPC ranges. It applies to all Headquarters (HQ) AFSPC, subordinate, and sup-
porting units. This manual also applies to Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units
when published in their respective 0-2 indexes. This manual may be supplemented as required by subor-
dinate units. All Space Wing (SW) supplements to this manual shall be coordinated with HQ AFSPC/SE
(Headquarters Air Force Space Command, Directorate of Safety) prior to issuance. Send correspondence
pertaining to this manual to the OPR at HQ AFSPC/SEC, 150 Vandenberg Street, Suite 1105, Peterson

                                                Chapter 1

                      PURPOSE, APPLICABILITY, POLICY, AND CHANGES

1.1. Purpose. AFSPCMAN 91-711 and its respective SW supplements provide the policy and require-
ments needed for AFSPC organizations to meet the Launch Safety Program mission. The Launch Safety
mission is to protect the public, launch base personnel (government and contractor), range infrastructure,
and third party personnel from the hazards associated with AFSPC range operations. Launch Safety is a
function performed by the Wing Safety organization at AFSPC ranges and includes: Systems Safety, Pad
Safety, Flight Analysis, and support to Flight Operations.
   1.1.1. The Launch Safety requirements contained in the AFSPC 91-7XX series publications, includ-
   ing this manual, are based on the following principles:
       1.1.1.1. Standardized design and safety requirements for launch/range systems.
       1.1.1.2. A set of requirements that, through experience, ensures a prudent level of protection is
       provided to the public during pre-launch and launch operations.
       1.1.1.3. A minimum set of criteria and requirements are necessary to ensure the protection of peo-
       ple and resources at AFSPC ranges. Therefore, to ensure each organization is protected from the
       activities of others, the AFSPC Launch Safety requirements provide a minimum set of criteria and
       requirements to ensure launch area safety.
       1.1.1.4. Wherever possible, accept national industry or commercial standards, either in part or in
       whole. Industry or commercial standards may be cited as a rationale or the basis for an aspect of
       design. If not cited in the AFSPC 91-7XX series of publications, however, all proposed standards
       shall be approved by both AFSPC ranges prior to use.

1.2. Applicability.
   1.2.1. This manual applies to all AFSPC organizations that implement Launch Safety requirements
   and/or support the implementation of Launch Safety requirements or conduct functions or activities
   that are covered by the AFSPC 91-7XX publications. Individuals performing Launch Safety functions
   at AFSPC ranges implement a wide variety of methods to meet the common goal of protecting the
   public, launch site personnel, and launch resources from unique risks of space launch range opera-
   tions. The AFSPC 91-7XX series publications and the respective SW supplements describe Launch
   Safety policy and identify Launch Safety requirements essential to accomplishing the safety mission.
   AFSPC organizations conducting operations or procuring facilities or equipment which are function-
   ally covered by AFSPCMAN 91-710 series shall comply with the requirements specified in AFSPC-
   MAN 91-710 series or obtain Wing Safety approval if they will not comply.
   1.2.2. AFSPC organizations are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, statutes, and reg-
   ulations. No policy or requirements in AFSPC 91-7XX series publications shall be considered as
   relief or authority to deviate from federal, state, or local laws, statutes, and regulations. If a conflict
   between requirements in any AFSPC 91-7XX series publication is discovered, the more stringent
   requirement shall apply, until a Change Request, Tailored Requirement, or Non-Compliance Request
   is approved by the 30/45 SW/SE (Western Range (WR)/Eastern Range (ER)) and coordinated with
   HQ AFSPC/SE. If a conflict cannot be resolved by choosing the more stringent requirement, notify
   AFSPC/SEC.

1.3. Launch Safety Policy.
    1.3.1. Range operations shall be accomplished to ensure that the risk to the public, range/third party
    launch area and personnel, and range/third party owned resources is maintained at an acceptable level
    of safety (acceptable launch risk) consistent with mission needs. This policy shall be implemented by
    employing risk management practices and procedures outlined in the AFSPC 91-7XX series publica-
    tions.
    1.3.2. Launch Safety refers to the following functions at AFSPC ranges: Systems Safety, Pad Safety,
    Flight Analysis, and support to Flight Operations. As the agents of the SW Commander (SW/CC),
    Wing Safety, through its Launch Safety Program, ensures that the public, launch site personnel (gov-
    ernment and contractor), and range infrastructure are protected from the inherent hazards of launch
    vehicles, payloads, and their associated supporting systems and facilities. These inherent hazards are
    posed both by the course of normal operations and because of anomalies. Wing Safety personnel
    endeavor to assure safety is achieved from the inception of a program until the last mission task is
    completed (for example, until all program assets are removed from the range). In this role of assessing
    and minimizing the danger posed by launch and pre-launch operations, Wing Safety is also known as
    Range Safety.
    1.3.3. The Wing Plans office is the front door for new programs planning to use AFSPC ranges. How-
    ever, Wing Safety works closely with range acquisition, range operations and maintenance organiza-
    tions starting from the time when a program is first proposed (Program Introduction) to ensure Launch
    Safety requirements are addressed through all phases of a program. Wing Safety strives to maintain
    the maximum flexibility in the methods used to achieve safety objectives and not to impose undue or
    overly restrictive safety requirements on the range. Wing Safety shall consider alternate proposals for
    meeting safety objectives. Early and continuous coordination with Wing Safety is the key to a suc-
    cessful Launch Safety/Mission partnership.

1.4. Changes to AFSPCMAN 91-711.
    1.4.1. AFSPCMAN 91-711 Changes. Requests for changes to AFSPCMAN 91-711 shall be submit-
    ted in writing to the Launch Safety Requirements Panel (LSRP). Change requests shall include the
    program name, system(s) affected, office of primary responsibility, original AFSPCMAN 91-711
    paragraph number and text, proposed text, and rationale for the change. Standard forms for change
    requests are available upon request from the 30/45 SW/SE offices.
       1.4.1.1. The LSRP shall disposition each change request, after careful consideration, in one of
       three ways: Recommend Approval, Recommend Approval with Comments, or Recommend Dis-
       approval. The LSRP shall forward their recommendations and proposed changes to AFSPCMAN
       91-711 to both Chiefs of Safety (45 SW/SE and 30 SW/SE) for their review. After their review, the
       Chiefs of Safety shall submit a joint 30/45 SW/SE disposition recommendation to HQ AFSPC/
       SEC (Headquarters Air Force Space Command, Directorate of Safety, Space Safety Division).
       1.4.1.2. HQ AFSPC/SEC shall conduct a United States Air Force/Federal Aviation Administra-
       tion (USAF/FAA) Common Standards Working Group (CSWG) review of the proposed change
       request and the proposed wing disposition of the proposed change. After CSWG review, HQ
       AFSPC/SEC will issue the final disposition of the proposed change (review, approval/disapproval,
       incorporation into AFSPCMAN 91-711, etc.).
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                          7


      1.4.1.3. The 30/45 SW Wing Safety Offices shall designate a representative from their wing to
      co-chair the LSRP. In addition to a co-chair, each range shall provide LSRP members from System
      Safety, Flight Analysis, Pad Safety, Flight Operations, and the Operations Group (OG), as appro-
      priate. The LSRP convenes on a periodic basis (at least annually) to process changes or noncom-
      pliance requests that will not impact launch schedules, and in emergency sessions to process
      requests that may impact launch schedule.

1.5. Space Wing Supplements.
   1.5.1. Each launch SW should develop a supplement to this document containing wing unique
   requirements. If the wing unique requirements are incorporated in something other than a supplement
   to 91-711, i.e., a tailored version or and operating instruction (OI) etc., they can. These other docu-
   ments are only coordinated internally with the local wing/base organization structure.
   1.5.2. SW supplements to this document shall be coordinated with the other launch wing and
   reviewed and approved by HQ AFSPC/SE prior to publishing.
   1.5.3. Changes to Wing Supplements to AFSPCMAN 91-711. Change or noncompliance requests
   to AFSPCMAN 91-711 SW supplements are initially processed at the SWs in accordance with (IAW)
   the procedures specified within the respective SW supplement. The Wing Chief of Safety is responsi-

               ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES

2.1. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF). HQ USAF, as owner and operator of the
AFSPC ranges, has regulatory responsibility for Launch Safety. The FAA, as the licensing agency of
Commercial Launch Operators (Range Users), shares this regulatory responsibility with the USAF for
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-licensed launches from USAF ranges.
   2.1.1. Headquarters Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC). HQ AFSPC is responsible for
   establishing and ensuring compliance with the AFSPC Launch Safety Program and its associated pol-
   icies and requirements. AFSPCI 91-701 specifies the overarching policies for AFSPC’s Launch
   Safety Program. AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volumes 1 through 7 establish Launch Safety requirements for
   Range Users and this publication, AFSPCMAN 91-711, establishes the Launch Safety requirements
   for organizations within AFSPC.
      2.1.1.1. Headquarters AFSPC Directorate of Safety (HQ AFSPC/SE). HQ AFSPC/SE has the
      authority and responsibility for the oversight of the AFSPC Launch Safety Program. HQ AFSPC/
      SE assigned HQ AFSPC System Safety oversight to the Chief of Safety, Space and Missile Center
      (SMC), whose office symbol for the System Safety function is HQ AFSPC/SES (Headquarters Air
      Force Space Command, Directorate of Safety, System Safety Division). HQ AFSPC/SES shall
      coordinate on all range system acquisition/design requirements and range system upgrades and/or
      modifications.
      2.1.1.2. Headquarters AFSPC Directorate of Air and Space Operations (HQ AFSPC/A3). HQ
      AFSPC/A3 has the authority and responsibility for providing policy, guidance, and resources for
      all AFSPC space and missile operations.
      2.1.1.3. Fourteenth Air Force (14 AF). 14 AF has operational authority and responsibility for
      the oversight of Department of Defense (DoD) launch and range operations and is responsible for
      ensuring the command and control and operational integration of launch and range systems which
      result in mission ready spacelift capabilities. The 14 AF/CC is also the Joint Functional Compo-
      nent Commander for Space (JFCC-SPACE). The JFCC-SPACE is responsible for optimizing
      planning, execution, and force management (as directed by United States Strategic Command) of
      the assigned missions of coordinating, planning, and conducting space operations. The Joint Space
      Operations Center (JSpOC) monitors the status of space range operations for impacts to the Com-
      mand and Control of space operation missions and the readiness of space systems for the
      JFCC-SPACE. The First Space Control Squadron (1 SPCS), assigned to 14 AF’s 614th Space
      Operations Group (a below-the-line organization reporting directly to the 14 AF/CC) is responsi-
      ble for providing conjunction assessment (CA) information for use in calculating collision avoid-
      ance (COLA) no launch periods (launch waits) for all launches from the 30 SW and 45 SW. 14
      AF/SE ensures the 14 AF/CC’s mishap prevention/risk management program objectives are opti-
      mized for mission success. 14 AF/SE shall establish a coordination process between the SWs to
      ensure consistent and standard Launch Safety requirements and criteria, processes, and approvals

       2.1.1.4.2. SMC shall comply with all the Launch Safety requirements specified in AFSPCI
       91-701, AFSPCMAN 91-710, and AFSPCMAN 91-711. The SMC SM shall ensure that all
       systems and products in the SMC-procured space and missile product line, (including systems
       and services located at AFSPC ranges (launch and range)) have Launch Safety requirements
       (AFSPCMAN 91-710 and/or AFSPCMAN 91-711) on contract. The SMC SM shall coordi-
       nate acquisition actions and contract modifications with SMC/SE. EWR 127-1 can be used for
       pre-existing (grandfathered) programs as specified by Wing Safety. The SMC SM or desig-
       nated safety representative will coordinate issues and actions resulting from reviews of proce-
       dures, processes, and interfaces/infrastructure with SMC/SE, and appropriate SWs.
       2.1.1.4.3. The SMC Launch and Range Systems Wing (SMC/LRSW) is responsible for the
       acquisition, modernization, and sustainment of range ground systems and products required by
       AFSPC ranges to conduct their Launch Safety programs. SMC/LRSW shall obtain coordina-
       tion/concurrence of requirements, for systems or products, with the applicable SW/SEs, 14AF/
       SE, and HQ AFSPC/SE organizations. For Range Safety critical systems, SMC/LRSW shall
       include SW/SEs in Request for Proposal reviews and scheduled program reviews, including
       SRR, SDRs, PDRs, CDRs, and associated TIMs. The 30 and 45 SWs require a minimum of 30
       days to review all data submittals. Although the Launch Safety requirements in AFSPCMAN
       91-710 are intended for Range Users, equipment designed/acquired for AFSPC ranges shall
       also comply with the requirements of AFSPCMAN 91-710 or EWR 127-1, as applicable, and
       the Combined Command Destruct System (Range Safety Requirements for the 30th and 45th
       SWs).
       2.1.1.4.4. Coordination of Launch Safety Requirements. The applicable SMC organization
       (Group, DET, System Wing, etc.) shall work with the 30/45 SW/SEs to resolve Launch Safety
       issues, including tailoring of requirements documents. The action SMC organization (Group,
       DET, System Wing, etc.) shall coordinate Launch Safety requirements/agreements/tailoring
       with SMC/SE. The SMC SM shall invite SMC/SE to participate in tailoring meetings/discus-
       sions with the applicable SW. SMC SMs shall provide the dispositions of all SMC-procured
       system noncompliance requests to SMC/SE and HQ AFSPC/SEC.”

       on all AFSPC range system requirements and range system upgrades and/or modifications.
       2.1.1.4.6. Each SMC/Wing/SM/DET with control authority of their spacecraft is responsible
       for the orbital safety program of their spacecraft until they relinquish control authority to a sat-
       ellite control center (from the end of Range Safety control and/or satellite separation from the
       launch vehicle through spacecraft on-orbit checkout and transfer of on-orbit authority). This
       includes COLA; for example, obtaining and responding to CAs from the JSpOC (1 SPCS).

                     FLIGHT SAFETY ANALYSIS POLICY AND PROCESSES

3.1. AFSPC Launch Safety Program. AFSPC operates two USAF-owned national ranges established
under DoDD 3200.11, for all users having a valid need for launch and test range capabilities. Operation of
AFSPC ranges carries with it specific responsibilities for public and Launch Safety. The objective of this
chapter is to codify the policy and requirements for the AFSPC ranges to ensure completion of the neces-
sary flight safety analyses and associated approvals as a prerequisite for the launch of any vehicle or the
conduct of any test from the ER or the WR.

3.2. Purpose. This chapter establishes the policy and requirements to ensure proactive and responsive
flight safety analysis (FSA) activities at AFSPC ranges. The following paragraphs identify those analyses
and processes that must be completed prior to obtaining approval for launch or test operations. Each SW
has definitive processes and software tools that are used to conduct the analyses and document their tech-
nical approach. The purpose of FSA is to protect people and resources, where practical, by identifying the
hazards associated with launch or test operations, containing and/or minimizing launch or test hazards,
and mitigating the remaining risks.
     3.2.1. The hazards typically associated with launch or test operations results from inert and explosive
     debris, chemical toxicity to propellants released inadvertently to the atmosphere or normal combus-
     tion of the propellant, and the distant focusing of an overpressure blast wave under certain meteoro-
     logical conditions. These hazards may be the result of a launch vehicle or test article malfunction and
     subsequent breakup or intact impact, or the combustion and release of chemical constituents during
     normal operations. The primary goal of the FSA approach is to contain the hazards and isolate the haz-
     ards from populated areas wherever practical. This is in accord with the primary policy that no hazard-
     ous condition is acceptable (acceptable hazard) if mission objectives can be attained from a safer
     approach, methodology or position, i.e., minimizing the hazards and conducting the mission as safely
     as reasonably possible. Where the possibility of hazardous conditions exist, this typically involves
     developing destruct lines with the goal of containing inert and explosive debris within pre-determined
     areas, restricting launch azimuths and stage drop areas, clearing or evacuating hazardous areas, wind
     restrictions, and/or the development of mission rules for the activation of FSSs if needed to destroy
     errant launch vehicles or test articles.
     3.2.2. The minimization of launch hazards may include avoiding land impact of jettisoned compo-
     nents (jettisoned bodies) and associated inert debris, not allowing large explosive debris to impact
     intact, controlling maritime hazards to sparsely populated or broad ocean areas, and only allowing
     flight over land when absolutely necessary. When hazards cannot be contained or minimized to an
     insignificant level, then assessments shall be performed to determine if the remaining risk is accept-
     able (acceptable launch risk). AFSPC Wing Safety Offices shall develop and maintain up-to-date soft-
     ware models and tools to assess the risks associated with any hazards that cannot be contained
     resulting from operations performed at the ranges. Currently these include hazards from inert and
     explosive debris, toxics, and DFO.

3.3. Risk Assessment Approach and Policy. The current AFSPC launch range risk assessment
approach is to evaluate the risk for each hazard and for each phase of the flight or test using the appropri-
ate analysis. The overall mission risk for each hazard is then established by accumulating (summing) the
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                            23


risks for all phases of the mission or operation. For example, inert and explosive debris risk shall be eval-
uated both for the launch area and downrange (overflight) portions of flight and then accumulated for a
total mission risk for that hazard. Since the toxic and DFO hazards associated with launch vehicles exist
primarily in the launch area, their respective mission risk is defined only by the analysis performed in that
phase of flight. Each hazard's risk is treated separately with an estimate of casualty expectancy, or the
average number of expected casualties.
   3.3.1. When assessing risk for flight analysis purposes, a casualty is assessed when an estimate of
   serious injury or worse occurs, including a fatality. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is appropriate
   for describing medical conditions sufficiently to allow casualty modeling for purposes of determining
   whether a launch satisfies the risk criteria for Launch Essential Personnel (LEP) and the Public (Gen-
   eral Public and Neighboring Operations Personnel (NOP)). Refer to Attachment 1, Glossary of Ref-
   erences, Abbreviations and Acronyms, and Terms for a more detailed explanation of the AIS. A
   serious injury or worse, as characterized by or compared to at least an AIS level 3 or greater, shall be
   used to quantify casualties in risk analyses performed to determine acceptability to launch or to con-
   duct test operations at AFSPC ranges.
   3.3.2. Accumulated Risk Criteria Levels. Accumulated risk is the combined collective risk to all
   individuals exposed to a particular hazard through all phases of an operation/flight. For the flight of an
   orbital launch vehicle, risk is accumulated from liftoff through orbital insertion. For the flight of a
   suborbital launch vehicle, risk is accumulated from liftoff through the impact of all pieces of the
   launch vehicle, including any payload. The various levels of hazard risks are described in AFSPC-
   MAN 91-710 Volume 1 Attachment 4.
   3.3.3. Included in the definitions are those for Individual Risk, Collective Risk, Accumulated Risk,
   and Aggregated Risk. Also provided are the definitions for Public (including General Public and
   Neighboring Operations Personnel) as well as Launch Essential Personnel. These definitions are also
   included in this publication, Attachment 1, Terms.

3.4. Risk Analysis: Risk analysis can be conducted using a simple and typically conservative approach
or with very sophisticated and complex tools. The purpose for developing and using very complex models
is often to reduce the conservatism in risk estimation and attempt to model real-world conditions as accu-
rately as possible. The tradeoff in using these sophisticated models is the cost associated with performing
the analysis, the accuracy of the assumptions, and the increased data requirements and fidelity of the mod-
els. The concern with using simple models is to ensure that the assumptions and input data are sufficiently
conservative to provide adequate protection to the population being protected.
   3.4.1. AFSPC ranges shall perform, or accept from Range Users, risk assessments using a tiered
   approach. Depending on the decision makers needs and the relative responsiveness required of the
   risk estimate, the tiered approach may employ risk assessment tools, procedures, and data products
   that range from relatively simple to extremely complex, to establish a casualty for each hazard associ-
   ated with a launch, test, or operation. If the relatively simple means provides a risk assessment that
   can be verified as conservative by Wing Safety, and insignificant with respect to the acceptable crite-
   ria, then no further analysis is required. However, as public encroachment increases, and as more
   powerful launch vehicles are developed and more hazardous tests are conducted at the ranges, the risk
   estimated with more simple approaches may exceed the acceptable criteria. Therefore, more sophisti-
   cated tools, methods, and higher fidelity data may be required to evaluate the risk, minimize or reduce
   the conservatism in the estimates and determine acceptability; and typically with significant increases
24                                                              AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


     in cost and schedule. The simple risk models (tier 1) will generally have associated minimum thresh-
     old limits for personal injury such that the flight safety analyst assumes that exceeding these limits
     will result in a casualty. The more complex risk assessments (tier 2) employ technically sound and
     empirically substantiated injury models relating the probability of serious injury to the degree of haz-
     ard exposed to a population.
     3.4.2. Hazard Thresholds:
        3.4.2.1. Inert debris. Two minimum hazard threshold screens shall be used for a tier 1 inert debris
        risk analysis. The first screen assumes a debris piece with a kinetic energy of 11 foot-pounds or
        greater will result in a casualty due to blunt trauma. The second screen shall account for a casualty
        due to a penetrating injury by an inert piece of debris and based on a injury threshold level of 8
        foot-pounds per inch squared, or will be defined by Wing Safety during tailoring discussions.
        3.4.2.2. Explosive Debris. Minimum threshold criteria for a tier 1 analysis shall be used to deter-
        mine when the overpressure associated with propellant debris capable of exploding on ground
        impact can hazard a person in the open, or adversely affect ships and boats located within a
        defined distance from an exploding debris piece. The first criteria is used for a person in the open
        and assumes that exposure to an overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (psi) or greater will
        result in a casualty due to a blast load of an explosive debris piece. The second criterion associated
        with an exploding debris piece is applied for protection of ships and boats and their associated hit
        probability. Flight analysts shall calculate an overpressure distance for ships and boats using 1.0
        psi and 0.4 psi, respectively. This will result in a maximum radius such that a vessel within the
        respective radius about the surface impact point will be considered hit by the debris piece.
        3.4.2.3. Toxic Exposure and Distant Focusing Overpressure. Each AFSPC range uses highly tech-
        nical models to determine toxic and DFO hazards that incorporate minimum threshold screening
        criteria prior to estimating risk with sophisticated injury models and as such do not incorporate a
        tiered approach.

3.5. Public. The USAF divides the Public into two categories; the General Public and NOP. NOP was
defined to account for the special qualifications associated with personnel conducting operations occur-
ring within the vicinity of, but not associated with, the current launch.
     3.5.1. General Public. The General Public consists of all persons that are not in the LEP or NOP cat-
     egories. For a specific launch, the General Public includes visitors, media, and other non-operations
     personnel at the launch site as well as persons located outside the boundaries of the launch site that are
     not associated with the specified current launch.
     3.5.2. Neighboring Operations Personnel (NOP). NOP are individuals, not associated with the
     specific launch or operations currently being conducted, who are required to perform safety, security
     or operationally critical tasks at the launch base and who are notified of a neighboring hazardous oper-
     ation and are either trained in mitigation techniques or are accompanied by a properly trained escort.
     Because of this special qualification, NOP shall be included in the same risk category(s) as LEP.

3.6. Risk to General Public. No hazardous condition is acceptable (acceptable hazard) if mission objec-
tives can be reasonably obtained from a safer approach, methodology, or position. Containment of the
hazard shall be accomplished when possible. When containment of the hazard is not possible, a risk anal-
ysis shall be performed. When the decision maker has agreed that the risk is within acceptable levels
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                               25


(acceptable launch risk), and cannot be further reduced by reasonable methods, the hazardous operation
may proceed. Launch area and downrange overflight shall be evaluated and the total risk accumulated.
Individual hazardous activities may only exceed guidance levels based on national need.
   3.6.1. Launch Vehicles. Initiation of launch vehicle flight may be accomplished if the FSA satisfies
   all of the following public risk criteria:
       3.6.1.1. Risk to any individual member (individual risk) of the general public does not exceed a
       casualty expectation of 1 x 10-6 for each hazard per launch.
       3.6.1.2. Risk associated with the flight to all members of the general public (collective risk),
       excluding persons in waterborne vessels and aircraft, does not exceed a casualty expectation of 30
       x 10-6 for each hazard per launch.
       3.6.1.3. The cumulative hit probability of inert and explosive debris impact for each group of pub-
       lic and mission support waterborne vessels in all impact areas identified by Wing Safety does not
       exceed 1 x 10-5.
       3.6.1.4. Aircraft shall not be exposed above 1 x 10-6 collective probability of impact. A more con-
       servative criterion of a 1 x 10-8 collective probability of impact (that is also used for ships) may be
       used for aircraft to account for risk uncertainty caused by variability in aircraft type, position, alti-
       tude, and speed.
       3.6.1.5. Trains shall not be exposed above 1 x 10-6 probability of impact.
       3.6.1.6. For all launch vehicles, jettisoned components, propagated debris, and payloads with the
       potential to collide with manned orbiting objects, the level of protection provided to the spacecraft
       shall be: (1) ensuring a spherical miss distance of 200 km or (2) ensuring an ellipsoidal miss dis-
       tance of 200 km in-track and 50 km perpendicular to the in-track axis or (3) not exceeding a prob-
       ability of impact greater than 1 x 10-6 per spacecraft. COLA analysis is used in the minus count to
       protect orbiting objects from collision with a launch vehicle or its jettisoned components. A
       COLA closure time period (no launch) is calculated for any object violating the criteria described
       below. A COLA closure time period shall result in a launch hold for that time period. A mission/
       launch scrub occurs only if the closure time period conflicts with any remaining time for the mis-
       sion launch window. At present, Wing Safety only requires COLAs for manned objects such as the
       International Space Station, Space Transportation System, and critical supply vehicles to manned
       objects.
   3.6.2. Directed Energy. Directed energy systems include, but are not limited to, lasers and neutral
   particle and ion beams with any combination of surface, air, or space locations for the energy source
   and target. The term “laser” as used in this document as a generic reference to all directed energy sys-
   tems. Operations involving laser illumination require a Wing Safety approved process to ensure per-
   sonnel will not be exposed to hazardous laser emissions. Where total protection against exposure is
   not possible through the design process, clearance areas and access controls shall be established. Laser
   operations shall be in compliance with American National Standards Institute Standards Z136.1
   (American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers) and Z136.6 (American National Standard
   for the Safe Use of Lasers Outdoors) and AFOSHSTD 48-139 (Laser Radiation Protection Pro-
   gram). Coordination with the USSTRATCOM’s Laser Clearinghouse, operating out of Cheyenne
   Mountain Operations Center/J3S is required for all Class 3 and 4 lasers operated outside of a confined
   laboratory environment that will or may have the potential to propagate above the horizon. A risk
   approach may be developed and used if the containment approach is not practicable; with acceptable
26                                                              AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


     risk criteria (acceptable launch risk) approved by the decision maker. Laser operations shall be
     reviewed by Wing Safety at the 30 SW and by the Laser Safety Working Group at the 45 SW. This
     review shall include the following:
        3.6.2.1. Providing guidance to the Range User for satisfying Launch Safety requirements.
        3.6.2.2. Assessing the hazards associated with the specific laser operation being proposed.
        3.6.2.3. Recommending laser operation constraints.
        3.6.2.4. Issuing advisories regarding the specific laser operation.
     3.6.3. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAV operations or tests may be accomplished if the FSA
     satisfies one of the below general public risk criteria. UAV operations or tests must show a level of
     risk to the general public no greater than that of an operation or test of a piloted aircraft.
        3.6.3.1. The flight is confined to unpopulated areas with the exception of take-off and landing
        when the level of risk is controlled to be no greater than that of a piloted aircraft. Recognition of
        failure modes which could result in the UAV leaving the assigned airspace, and the history of the
        vehicle's response to the failure modes must be considered. Additional safeguards may be required
        to ensure the vehicle remains within assigned airspace.
        3.6.3.2. Risk to the general public does not exceed a casualty expectation of one in one million
        flight hours. When empirical data is not available, this condition is met if the route is confined to
        sparsely populated areas and qualitative methods indicate casualty expectation is negligible.
     3.6.4. Reusable Launch Vehicles. Reserved.

3.7. Risk to LEP and NOP. Initiation of the flight of a launch vehicle may only be approved if the FSA
satisfies the following risk criteria for LEP and NOP for the following hazards:
     3.7.1. An AFSPC range may approve launch vehicle flight only if the risk to an individual LEP or
     NOP member does not exceed a casualty expectation of 10 x 10-6 for each hazard per launch.
     3.7.2. An AFSPC range may approve the flight of a launch vehicle only if the risk associated with the
     flight to all LEP members does not exceed a casualty expectation of 300 x 10-6 for each of the defined
     hazards per launch.
     3.7.3. The SW/CC can allow for NOP to be accumulated with and assessed at the same risk level
     (casualty expectation) as LEP (300 x 10-6).
     3.7.4. The cumulative hit probability criteria to waterborne vessels and aircraft as stated in paragraphs
     3.6.1.3. and 3.6.1.4. apply to LEP, NOP, and mission support vessels in all impact areas identified by
     Wing Safety.

3.8. Flight Safety Analysis (FSA). A FSA assessment shall demonstrate that an AFSPC range will, for
each launch, control the risk to the public from hazards associated with normal and malfunctioning launch
vehicle flight. The analysis shall employ hazard isolation, risk assessment, or a combination of risk
assessment and partial isolation of the hazards, to demonstrate control of risk to the public.
     3.8.1. Hazard Isolation. When demonstrating control of risk through hazard isolation, the analysis
     shall establish the geographical areas from which the public shall be excluded during flight or opera-
     tions at the launch site and any operational controls needed to isolate all hazards from the public.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                            27


  3.8.2. Risk Assessment. When demonstrating control of risk through risk assessment, the analysis
  shall account for the variability associated with:
     3.8.2.1. Each source of a hazard during flight.
     3.8.2.2. Response mode of the launch vehicle to include planned events as well as failure modes.
     3.8.2.3. Each external environment and launch vehicle flight environment.
     3.8.2.4. Populations and accompanying sheltering exposed to hazards associated with flight or
     test operations.
     3.8.2.5. The performance of any FSS, including time delays associated with the system.
  3.8.3. Combination of Risk Assessment and Partial Isolation of Hazards. When demonstrating
  control of risk through a combination of risk assessment and partial isolation of hazards from the pub-
  lic, the analysis shall demonstrate the residual public risk due to any hazard not isolated from the pub-
  lic or that the LEP satisfies the respective public and LEP risk criteria.
  3.8.4. Trajectory Analysis. A FSA shall include a trajectory analysis that includes the following
  items:
     3.8.4.1. For any time after liftoff, the limits of a launch vehicle’s normal flight, as defined by the
     nominal trajectory and potential three-sigma trajectory dispersions about the nominal trajectory.
     The three-sigma trajectories may consist of the left, right, maximum, minimum, steep and lateral
     as well as various three-sigma trajectories that are dependent on vehicle type and time of year.
     These are defined in AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 2, Attachment 2A.
     3.8.4.2. A fuel exhaustion trajectory that produces instantaneous impact points (IIPs) with the
     greatest range for any given time after liftoff for any stage that has the potential to impact the Earth
     and does not burn to propellant depletion before a programmed thrust termination.
     3.8.4.3. For the various types of missions (single launch azimuth, variable launch azimuth, vehi-
     cles exhibiting multiple steering options during ascent, multiple propellant engines normally
     ignited during liftoff, etc.) specific trajectories should be provided for the varying engine out con-
     ditions or options (see Table A1.3 of AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 2, Attachment 1).
     3.8.4.4. Wind Effects. A trajectory analysis shall account for all wind effects, including profiles of
     winds that are no less severe than the worst wind conditions under which flight might be
     attempted, and shall account for uncertainty in the wind conditions.
  3.8.5. Malfunction Turn Analysis. A FSA shall include a malfunction turn analysis that establishes
  the launch vehicle’s maximum turn capability in the event of a malfunction during flight. A malfunc-
  tion turn analysis shall account for each cause of a malfunction turn, such as thrust vector offsets or
  nozzle burn-through, etc. For each cause of a malfunction turn, the analysis shall establish the launch
  vehicle’s turning capability using a set of turn curves or a family of malfunction trajectories. This is
  defined in AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 2, Attachment 2C. The analysis shall account for:
     3.8.5.1. All trajectory times during the thrusting phases of flight.
     3.8.5.2. The relative probability of occurrence of each malfunction turn of which the launch vehi-
     cle is capable.
     3.8.5.3. The time, as a single value or a probability time distribution, when each malfunction will
     terminate due to vehicle breakup.
28                                                               AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


        3.8.5.4. Identify what terminates each malfunction turn, such as aerodynamic breakup or inertial
        breakup, etc.
        3.8.5.5. Identify the launch vehicle’s turning behavior from the time when a malfunction begins to
        cause a turn until aerodynamic breakup, inertial breakup, or ground impact. The analysis shall
        account for trajectory time intervals during the malfunction turn that are sufficient to establish turn
        curves that are smooth and continuous.
        3.8.5.6. For each malfunction turn, identify the launch vehicle velocity vector turn angle from the
        nominal launch vehicle velocity vector.
        3.8.5.7. For each malfunction turn, identify the launch vehicle velocity turn magnitude from the
        nominal velocity magnitude that corresponds to the velocity vector turn angle.
        3.8.5.8. For each malfunction turn, identify the orientation of the launch vehicle longitudinal axis
        measured relative to the nominal launch vehicle longitudinal axis or Earth relative velocity vector
        at the start of the turn.
        3.8.5.9. Malfunction Turn Data requirements for Range Users are listed in AFSPCMAN 91-710
        Volume 2, Attachment 2C.
     3.8.6. Inert and Explosive Debris Analysis. A FSA shall include an inert and explosive debris anal-
     ysis. For any test or operation producing inert or explosive debris, an analysis shall identify all hazard-
     ous launch vehicle debris that results from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight.
        3.8.6.1. Launch Vehicle Fragmentation Analysis. An inert and explosive debris analysis shall
        account for each cause of launch vehicle fragmentation, including at a minimum:
            3.8.6.1.1. Any FTS activation.
            3.8.6.1.2. Launch vehicle explosion.
            3.8.6.1.3. Aerodynamic loads.
            3.8.6.1.4. Inertial loads.
            3.8.6.1.5. Atmospheric reentry heating.
            3.8.6.1.6. Impact of intact vehicle.
        3.8.6.2. Inert and Explosive Debris Fragment Lists. An inert and explosive debris analysis shall
        produce lists of inert and explosive debris catalogs. The lists shall account for all launch vehicle
        inert and explosive debris fragments, individually or in groupings of fragments whose characteris-
        tics are similar enough to be described by a single set of characteristics. The inert and explosive
        debris lists shall describe the physical, aerodynamic, and harmful characteristics of each inert and
        explosive debris fragment, including at a minimum: (This data is included in AFSPCMAN
        91-710, Volume 2, Attachment 2B).
            3.8.6.2.1. Origin on the vehicle, by vehicle stage or component, from which each fragment
            originated.
            3.8.6.2.2. Whether it is inert or explosive.
            3.8.6.2.3. Weight, dimensions, and shape.
            3.8.6.2.4. Lift and drag characteristics.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                             29


         3.8.6.2.5. Properties of the incremental velocity distribution imparted by breakup.
         3.8.6.2.6. Axial, transverse, and tumbling area.
  3.8.7. Flight Safety Limits Analysis. A FSA shall identify the location of populated or other pro-
  tected areas, and establish flight safety limits (destruct lines) that define when an FSS shall terminate
  a launch vehicle’s flight to prevent the hazardous effects of the resulting inert and explosive debris
  impacts from reaching any populated or other protected area and ensure that the launch satisfies the
  public risk criteria. The population used for analysis shall take variations due to growth in the local
  populous and temporary changes due to seasonal or special circumstances.
     3.8.7.1. Flight Safety Limits. The analysis shall establish flight safety limits for use in establish-
     ing flight termination rules. The flight safety limits shall account for all temporal and geometric
     extents on the Earth’s surface of a launch vehicle’s hazardous inert and explosive debris impact
     dispersion resulting from any planned or unplanned event for all times during flight. Flight safety
     limits shall account for all potential contributions to the inert and explosive debris impact disper-
     sions, including at a minimum:
         3.8.7.1.1. Time delays, as established by the time delay analysis.
         3.8.7.1.2. Residual thrust remaining after flight termination implementation or vehicle
         breakup due to aerodynamic and inertial loads.
         3.8.7.1.3. All wind effects.
         3.8.7.1.4. Velocity imparted to vehicle fragments by breakup.
         3.8.7.1.5. All lift and drag forces on the malfunctioning vehicle and falling inert and explosive
         debris.
         3.8.7.1.6. All launch vehicle guidance and performance errors.
         3.8.7.1.7. All launch vehicle malfunction turn capabilities.
         3.8.7.1.8. Any uncertainty due to map errors and launch vehicle tracking errors.
         3.8.7.1.9. Gates. If a launch involves flight near or directly over any populated or other pro-
         tected area, the FSA shall establish a gate to protect those populated areas from errant launch
         vehicles (Gate Analysis).
     3.8.7.2. Designated Inert and Explosive Debris Impact Limits. The analysis shall establish desig-
     nated impact limit lines (ILLs) to bound the area where debris with a ballistic coefficient of three
     or more is allowed to impact if the FSS functions properly.
  3.8.8. Straight-Up Time/Red Time Analysis. The 45 SW and the FAA currently use the term
  “Straight-Up Time Analysis” while the 30 SW uses the term “Red Time Analysis.” In order to stan-
  dardize terminology, the 30 SW shall change their terminology to match that of the 45 SW and FAA
  over time during normal publication etc. changes. A FSA shall establish the straight-up time for a
  launch for use as a flight termination rule. The analysis shall establish the straight-up time as the latest
  time after liftoff, assuming a launch vehicle malfunctioned and flew in a vertical or near vertical direc-
  tion above the launch point, at which activation of the launch vehicle’s FSS or breakup of the launch
  vehicle would not cause hazardous inert or explosive debris, and it's associated overpressure and sec-
  ondary fragmentation, to affect any populated or other protected area.
30                                                              AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


     3.8.9. Gate Analysis. For a launch that involves flight directly over or near a populated or other pro-
     tected area, the FSA shall include a gate analysis. The analysis shall establish the portion of a flight
     safety limit, a gate, through which a normally performing launch vehicle’s IIP will be allowed to pro-
     ceed. An IIP shall enable the flight safety analyst and flight control officer to determine whether the
     launch vehicle’s flight is in compliance with general public risk criteria. When establishing that por-
     tion of a flight safety limit, the analysis shall demonstrate that the launch vehicle flight satisfies the
     flight safety requirements.
     3.8.10. Terminal Area Safety Limit Analysis (TASL). For a suborbital launch that involves over-
     flight or near overflight of a populated or otherwise protected area prior to the planned safe flight
     state, the FSA shall perform a hold-and-resume gate analysis for each populated or otherwise pro-
     tected area. The TASL analysis shall account for:
        3.8.10.1. Terminal Area Gate. For launches that involve overflight near populated areas, a gate
        shall be constructed such that while the vehicle’s tracking icon is within region, the launch vehicle
        shall not cause inert and explosive debris or critical overpressure hazards to impact upon the pro-
        tected area following a launch vehicle breakup. When the launch vehicle flight is outside the gate,
        the MFCO is authorized to initiate flight termination action.
        3.8.10.2. No Destruct Markers/Icons. No destruct markers/icons shall be established for over-
        flight of an uncontained populated or otherwise protected area. A no destruct region shall be any
        area in which a commanded flight termination action is discouraged because of the increased
        debris impact dispersion and risk following a destruction action. Within this region an anomalous
        performing vehicle may be allowed to continue its flight until a safer location is reached under
        which to terminate flight.
        3.8.10.3. Terminal Area Destruct Lines (TADL). A TADL shall be a closed continuous contour
        that encompasses any populated or otherwise protected area located completely within the ILLs.
        The TADL shall encompass a populated or otherwise protected area such that flight termination or
        breakup of the launch vehicle while the tracking icon is outside the region would not cause hazard-
        ous inert and explosive debris or overpressure to endanger the populated or otherwise protected
        area. Encroachment on the TADL by the tracking icon would authorize flight termination action.
     3.8.11. Data Loss Flight Time (Green Number/Critical Time) and Planned Safe Flight State
     Analysis. AFSPC ranges currently use the terms “Green Number” (45 SW) and “Critical Time” (30
     SW), however both wings shall change their terms over time as they update their documents, etc to
     “Data Loss Flight Time” as used by the FAA. For each launch, a FSA shall establish a Data Loss
     Flight Time (Green Number/Critical Times), and a planned safe flight state to establish each flight ter-
     mination rule that applies when launch vehicle tracking data is not available for use by the flight
     safety crew.
        3.8.11.1. Data Loss Flight Times (Green Numbers/Critical Times). A FSA shall establish the
        shortest elapsed thrusting time during which a launch vehicle can move from normal flight to a
        condition where the launch vehicle’s hazardous inert and explosive debris impact dispersion
        extends to any protected area as a Data Loss Flight Time (Green Number/Critical Time). The anal-
        ysis shall establish a Data Loss Flight Time (Green Number/Critical Time) for all times along the
        nominal trajectory from liftoff through that point during nominal flight when the minimum
        elapsed thrusting time is no greater than the time it would take for a normal vehicle to reach the
        overflight gate, or the planned safe flight state, whichever occurs earlier.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                          31


         3.8.11.1.1. Minimum Time to Endanger (MTE). The first time that a launch vehicle has suffi-
         cient energy to hazard the area outside the ILL (assumes flight in the worst case direction). If
         no sensor has acquired launch vehicle track by MTE, the MFCO is authorized to terminate the
         flight.
         3.8.11.1.2. No Longer Endanger (NLE).
             3.8.11.1.2.1. For suborbital missions, NLE shall be established as the time or position on
             the nominal trajectory at which the vehicle no longer has sufficient energy to endanger
             areas outside the ILLs.
             3.8.11.1.2.2. For orbital missions, NLE shall be established as the point in flight where the
             time required for the impact point to travel along the nominal trajectory to the overflight
             gate is less than the travel time to all other points along the boundary lines.
         3.8.11.1.3. Safe All the Way. Safe All the Way refers to when a launch vehicle no longer has
         the energy or turn capability for the IIP to reach a destruct line from the nominal trajectory.
  3.8.12. Time Delay Analysis. A FSA shall include a time delay analysis that establishes the mean
  elapsed time between the violation of a flight termination rule and the time when the FSS is capable of
  terminating flight for use in establishing flight safety limits.
     3.8.12.1. Analysis Constraints. A time delay analysis shall determine a time delay distribution
     that accounts for the following:
         3.8.12.1.1. The variance of all time delays for each potential failure scenario, including but
         not limited to, the range of malfunction turn characteristics and the time of flight when the
         malfunction occurs.
         3.8.12.1.2. A flight safety official’s decision and reaction time, including variation in human
         response time; and
         3.8.12.1.3. Flight termination hardware and software delays including all delays inherent in:
             3.8.12.1.3.1. Tracking systems.
             3.8.12.1.3.2. Data processing systems, including all filter delays.
             3.8.12.1.3.3. Display systems.
             3.8.12.1.3.4. Command control systems; and
             3.8.12.1.3.5. Flight termination systems.
  3.8.13. Flight Hazard Area (FHA) Analysis. A FSA shall include a FHA analysis that identifies
  any regions of land, sea, or air that shall be surveyed, public notices provided, controlled or evacuated
  in order to control the risk to the public from inert and explosive debris impact hazards. The analysis
  shall account for, at a minimum:
     3.8.13.1. All trajectory times from liftoff to the planned safe flight state, including each planned
     impact, for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch.
     3.8.13.2. Regions of land potentially exposed to debris resulting from normal flight events and
     events resulting from any potential malfunction.
32                                                              AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


        3.8.13.3. Regions of sea and air potentially exposed to inert and explosive debris from normal
        flight events, including planned impacts.
            3.8.13.3.1. Buoyancy analysis to determine if planned jettisoned components will become a
            maritime hazard.
        3.8.13.4. In the vicinity of the launch site, any waterborne vessels, populated offshore structures,
        or aircraft exposed to inert and explosive debris from events resulting from any potential abnormal
        flight events, including launch vehicle malfunction.
        3.8.13.5. Any operational controls implemented to control risk to the public from inert and explo-
        sive debris hazards.
        3.8.13.6. Inert and explosive debris identified by inert and explosive debris analysis.
        3.8.13.7. All launch vehicle trajectory dispersion effects in the surface impact domain.
        3.8.13.8. Public Notices. A FHA analysis shall establish the aircraft hazard areas for Notices to
        Airmen (NOTAM) and a ship hazard area analysis shall establish the ship hazard areas for Notices
        to Mariners (NTM) that encompass the three-sigma impact dispersion volume for each planned
        inert and explosive debris impact.
     3.8.14. Probability of Failure Analysis. All flight safety analyses for a launch, regardless of hazard
     or phase of flight, shall account for launch vehicle failure probability in a consistent manner. A launch
     vehicle failure probability estimate shall use accurate data, scientific principles, and a method that is
     statistically and probabilistically valid. For a launch vehicle with fewer than two flights, the failure
     probability estimate shall account for the outcome of all previous launches of vehicles developed and
     launched in similar circumstances. For a launch vehicle with two or more flights, launch vehicle fail-
     ure probability estimates shall account for the outcomes of all previous flights of the vehicle in a sta-
     tistically valid manner.
        3.8.14.1. In-Flight Failure. For FSA purposes, a failure occurs when a launch vehicle does not
        complete any phase of normal flight or when any anomalous condition exhibits the potential for a
        stage or its inert and explosive debris to impact the Earth or reenter the atmosphere during the mis-
        sion or any future mission of similar launch vehicle capability. A launch mishap or accident con-
        stitutes a failure. A launch incident should be evaluated to determine if the anomalous condition
        exhibits the potential for a stage or its inert and explosive debris to impact the Earth or reenter the
        atmosphere during the flight of any future mission.
        3.8.14.2. Flight. For flight analysis purposes, flight begins at a time in which a launch vehicle nor-
        mally or inadvertently lifts off from a launch platform.
        3.8.14.3. Liftoff. Liftoff occurs with any motion of the launch vehicle with respect to the launch
        platform. The term liftoff is most often used in the context of motion with respect to a fixed asset,
        such as a launch pad or sea platform. But here, liftoff also includes separation from a carrier air-
        craft. For other types of launch platforms the determination of liftoff shall be on a case-by-case
        basis, and may need to consider the threat to the general public prior to separation of the launch
        vehicle, such as when a balloon-launching craft is airborne.
     3.8.15. Debris Risk Analysis. A FSA shall demonstrate that the risk to the public potentially
     exposed to inert and explosive debris hazards from any one flight of a launch vehicle satisfies the pub-
     lic risk criterion for inert and explosive debris. An inert and explosive debris risk analysis shall
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                           33


  account for risk to populations on land, including regions of launch vehicle flight following passage
  through any gate in a flight safety limit established as required by overflight gate analysis. An inert
  and explosive debris risk analysis shall account for any potential casualties to the public as required by
  the inert and explosive debris thresholds and the public risk criteria.
  3.8.16. Toxics.
     3.8.16.1. Release Hazard Analysis. A FSA shall establish flight commit criteria that protects the
     public from any hazard associated with toxic release and demonstrates compliance with the public
     risk criterion. The analysis shall account for any toxic release that will occur during the proposed
     flight of a launch vehicle or that would occur in the event of a flight mishap. The analysis shall
     account for any operational constraints and emergency procedures that provide protection from
     toxic release. The analysis shall account for all members of the public and LEP that may be
     exposed to the toxic release, including all those on land and on any waterborne vessels, populated
     offshore structures, and aircraft that are not operated in direct support of the launch.
     3.8.16.2. Toxic Modeling. A variety of predictive models and analytical techniques are used to
     ensure that the public and launch area personnel are not exposed to toxic chemicals in concentra-
     tions that exceed applicable threshold limits. Key considerations that shall be addressed include,
     but are not limited to, the specific commodities loaded and their quantity; potential agents result-
     ing from mixing and/or reactions; nature or mechanism of release; and weather parameters such as
     wind speed, wind direction, temperature, temperature gradient, inversion layer, surface reflection
     coefficient, exposure response functions, and cloud cover as well as the uncertainty of these
     parameters.
  3.8.17. Blast.
     3.8.17.1. General. The Blast Damage Assessment model shall address intermediate hazardous
     range effects of a shock wave from an inadvertent detonation, such as from a launch vehicle mal-
     function, impact, or destruction.
     3.8.17.2. Near Field. Personnel located at near-in areas of overpressure above one psi shall be
     evacuated and are not considered in the assessment.
     3.8.17.3. Intermediate Field. It is the intermediate distance with overpressures between 0.1 to 1.0
     psi that are of concern. The area encompassing overpressures in this range varies considerably
     with local meteorological conditions.
     3.8.17.4. Distant Focusing Overpressure. A FSA shall establish flight commit criteria that protect
     the public from any hazard associated with DFO effects due to potential explosions during launch
     vehicle flight and demonstrate compliance with the public risk criteria. The analysis shall account
     for DFO or overpressure enhancement given real time meteorological conditions and terrain char-
     acteristics. The potential for broken windows and associated casualties due to peak incident over-
     pressures of 1.0 psi and below shall be determined. The explosive capability of the launch vehicle
     on pad at liftoff, at impact, at altitude, and potential explosions resulting from debris impacts,
     including the potential for the mixing of liquid propellants, shall be considered. The FSA shall
     consider the characteristics of the launch vehicle flight and the surroundings that could affect the
     population’s susceptibility to injury, such as the type of shelter and the time of day of the proposed
     launch. The analysis shall also consider the characteristics of the potentially affected windows,
     including size, location, glazing material, orientation and condition (if available), and the hazard
     characteristics of the potential glass shards.
34                                                            AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


        3.8.17.5. Far Field. At far-out distances, with overpressures of less than 0.1 psi, the hazards are
        relatively minor.
     3.8.18. Collision Avoidance (COLA) Analysis. A FSA shall include a COLA analysis that estab-
     lishes each launch wait in a planned launch window during which a Range User shall not initiate flight
     in order to protect any manned orbiting object. The analysis shall be performed on all components or
     propagated debris achieving altitudes greater than 150 km. Based on the COLA analysis, the FSA
     shall identify “launch wait” periods within the launch widow. The launch wait periods are no launch
     periods. Wing Safety shall ensure that the Range Users account for uncertainties associated with
     launch vehicle performance and timing and ensure that any calculated launch waits incorporate all
     additional time periods associated with such uncertainties. A Range User shall implement any launch
     waits as flight commit criteria.
        3.8.18.1. Orbital Launch. For an orbital launch, the COLA analysis shall establish any launch
        waits needed to ensure that the launch vehicle, any jettisoned components or propagated debris,
        and payloads do not violate the criteria in 3.6.1.6. for manned orbiting spacecraft during ascent to
        orbital insertion plus an analyst defined number of revolutions to account for the objects’ orbit
        type, its altitude exceeding the manned spacecraft altitude by the appropriate miss distance; and
        sufficient time for the object to be catalogued by the JSpOC (1 SPCS).
        3.8.18.2. Suborbital Launch. For a suborbital launch, the COLA analysis shall establish any
        launch waits needed to ensure that the launch vehicle, any jettisoned components or propagated
        debris, and any payload do not violate the criteria in 3.6.1.6. for manned orbiting objects through-
        out the flight.
        3.8.18.3. Wing Safety shall document and provide to the SW Operations Group (Range) the mis-
        sion-specific COLA results. This documentation shall identify mission-specific launch wait peri-
        ods and mission-specific COLA criteria including items such as the operations number, operation
        description, spacecraft evaluated, and encounter results.
        3.8.18.4. Analysis Not Required. COLA analysis may not be required if the three-sigma maxi-
        mum altitude capability of the launch vehicle, jettisoned components or planned debris is greater
        than 50 km below the orbital perigee of a manned object.
     3.8.19. Analysis for an Unguided Suborbital Launch Vehicle Flown with a Wind We i g h t i n g
     Safety System. For each launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weight-
     ing safety system, the FSA shall:

   3.8.21. Flight Safety System. For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a Range
   User shall use a FSS that satisfies the following:
      3.8.21.1. In the vicinity of the launch site. For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and pay-
      load, a Range User shall use a FSS in the vicinity of the launch site if the following exist:
         3.8.21.1.1. Any hazard from a launch vehicle, vehicle component, or payload can reach any
         protected area at any time during flight; or
         3.8.21.1.2. A failure of the launch vehicle would have a high consequence to the public.
      3.8.21.2. In the downrange area. For each vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a Range User
      shall provide a FSS downrange if the absence of a FSS would significantly increase the accumu-
      lated risk from inert and explosive debris impacts.
   3.8.22. Mission Rules.
      3.8.22.1. Wing Safety is responsible for developing mission rules that document, in detail, flight
      control requirements and procedures to be applied during the launch mission, in particular appli-
      cation of flight control and flight termination criteria or special conditions for continuing the mis-
      sion. In addition, the document may define specific rules such as launch hold criteria and
      procedures, emergency procedures and evacuation procedures of the flight control center during
      the countdown and in-flight. Wing Safety, Flight Analysis, and the Range User may develop
      unique mission rules on a case-by-case basis.
      3.8.22.2. Mission rules shall be approved by the SW/CC.

4.1. System Safety.
     4.1.1. Launch vehicles, payloads, their associated ground support systems, and their associated facil-
     ities are the source of many hazards that potentially endanger the general public, launch base person-
     nel, and government resources. System Safety is the discipline that analyzes these hazards and
     through the application of engineering and management principles, criteria, and techniques attempts
     to eliminate the hazards or reduce the risk the hazards present to acceptable levels (acceptable hazard)
     through design and protective measures. Among these hazards are toxic propellants, explosives, ion-
     izing radiation, energy sources, as well as many others.
        4.1.1.1. The Safety Assessment Section’s System Safety mission is to protect the general public,
        the launch site, and all government resources from the hazards generated by all programs using
        AFSPC ranges. The specific System Safety responsibilities of the Wing Safety, Safety Assessment
        Section are identified in Chapter 2 of this publication.
     4.1.2. These hazards and protective measures are addressed in detail in AFSPCMAN 91-710 Vol-
     umes, 3, 5, and 6 (for programs existing prior to the inception of AFSPCMAN 91-710, protective
     measures are found in EWR 127-1, Chapters 3, 5, and 6). Although intended for Range Users, the
     AFSPC ranges and range contractors shall comply with the requirements of AFSPCMAN 91-710 or
     EWR 127-1, as applicable. The major System Safety sections of AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volumes 3, 5,
     and 6 are presented in Table 4.1. In addition, AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 1 and EWR 127-1, Chap-
     ter 1 identify Range User requirements pertaining to the System Safety Program and provide addi-
     tional information relating to the intent of a System Safety Program.

5.1. Purpose. This chapter describes policies, identifies data and systems requirements, and provides
procedures required to define hazardous areas and protect personnel from the hazards associated with
launch vehicles and payloads launched on AFSPC ranges. This chapter provides AFSPC ranges with
information regarding LSLCC (formerly Range Safety Launch Commit Criteria). This information is pro-
vided to assist AFSPC ranges in understanding and planning for potential Wing Safety holds or scrubs as
a result of safety violations during the launch countdown. For detailed guidance on specific missions/
launches, refer to AFSPC Launch Safety supplemental documents at the wing level. The following topics
are addressed in this chapter:
   5.1.1. Safety Clearance Zones (Section 5.3.).
   5.1.2. Launch Area Air and Sea Surveillance (Section 5.4.).
   5.1.3. Jettisoned Bodies Impacting Land in the Launch Area (Section 5.5.).
   5.1.4. LSLCC are those criteria associated with launch day parameters that shall be met prior to final
   Wing Safety approval for launch. These criteria ensure public, launch site, and launch complex safety.
   They include launch vehicle, range, and environmental factors.
       5.1.4.1. Content. Descriptions of each LSLCC are included in each applicable section of this
       chapter. Where possible, the exact criteria used during the countdown are provided. General crite-
       ria are provided for cases in which the criteria are too complex to address in this document and/or
       where the criteria is in a state of flux. Wing Safety offices of primary responsibility (OPRs) and
       referenced documents are provided as sources of additional information. The LCC for each of the
       types of hazards (debris, blasts, and toxics) is: the general public shall not be exposed to a collec-
       tive casualty expectation risk level of more than 30 casualties in 1 million (30 x 10-6) for each haz-
       ard per mission and not more than an individual casualty expectation risk of 1 in 1 million (1 x
       10-6) for each hazard per mission. Addition information on LSLCC is specified in AFSPCMAN
       91-710, Volume 6, Attachment 7.
       5.1.4.2. Applicability. The requirements identified in this chapter are applicable to the flight anal-
       ysis and control functions of the AFSPC ranges. These requirements shall be met to ensure
       launches do not pose an unnecessary risk. Not all LSLCC are applicable to all launch vehicles.
       Additional specific LSLCC may be provided as part of the RSOR for each individual operational
       program.
       5.1.4.3. Reference Documents. Vehicle specific ground safety systems LSLCC shall be docu-
       mented in the RSOR. Mission specific modifications to the RSOR are published for each opera-
       tion in the Ops Sup to the RSOR.

5.2. Responsibilities and Authorities.
   5.2.1. Space Wing Commander. The SW/CC or his designated representative has final authority
   with regard to allowing personnel to remain within hazardous areas.

sonnel. These zones are established for each launch vehicle and/or payload at specific processing facilities
to include launch complexes. Safety clearance zones include Hazardous Clear Areas and Hazardous
Launch Areas.
   5.3.1. Hazardous Clear Areas.
       5.3.1.1. General Description. Hazardous clear areas are safety clearance zones for ground pro-
       cessing that are defined in the PSP/Launch Complex Safety Plan for each operating facility. Haz-
       ardous Clear Areas include BDAs, Control Area Clears, and Toxic Hazard Zones (THZs).
       5.3.1.2. Applicability. All launch vehicles and, if necessary, associated payloads shall be evalu-
       ated and hazardous clear areas determined.
       5.3.1.3. Hazardous Clear Areas.
           5.3.1.3.1. BDA: Clearance prior to establishment of a major explosive hazard such as vehicle
           fuel/oxidizer load and pressurization. This is the area subject to fragment and near-field over-
           pressure resulting from the explosion of the booster/payload while on the launch pad.
           5.3.1.3.2. Control Area Clears: A hazardous clear area; clearance of defined areas required to
           protect personnel from hazardous operations.
           5.3.1.3.3. THZ: Clearance area of a sector in which toxic material may exceed predetermined
           concentration levels considered hazardous to personnel.
   5.3.2. Hazardous Launch Areas.
       5.3.2.1. General Description.
           5.3.2.1.1. Hazardous Launch Areas are Safety Clearance Zones used during launch operations
           and include the FCA, FHA, Launch Danger Zone (LDZ) (ER only) or Boat Exclusion Area
           (BEA) (WR only), Launch Safety Area (LSA), Vehicle Clear Areas, and the ILLs.
           5.3.2.1.2. Wing Safety shall develop and publish a generic Hazardous Launch Area and a
           generic DoL BDA for each launch complex in the DAIP. Based on the generic information in
           the DAIP and the specific information from a particular launch, Wing Safety shall issue a mis-
           sion-specific Roadblock Access/DAIP letter that defines the DoL Hazardous Launch and
           BDAs for each individual launch operation. This letter shall also identify the number and pop-
           ulation type (LEP, NOP, etc.) within the Hazardous Launch Areas.
           5.3.2.1.3. Vehicle Clear Areas.
               5.3.2.1.3.1. If an anomaly occurs during a launch, vehicles (cars, trucks, trailers, special-
               ized mobile equipment, etc.) located within the appropriately specified hazardous areas are
               subject to damage. Therefore, it is the policy of the Wing to prohibit non-approved vehi-
               cles (private, government, or contractor-owned) from parking within these hazardous
               launch areas. Risk assessments may be performed for persons occupying or associated
56                                                           AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


               with these vehicles to determine if they meet the personnel risk criteria in AFSPCMAN
               91-710 Volume1 and whether the launch countdown can proceed.
        5.3.2.2. Hazardous Launch Area Clearance.
           5.3.2.2.1. Concurrence from the Chief of Safety shall be obtained for all personnel required or
           requesting to be within a Hazardous Launch Area during a launch operation. NOTE:
           Launch-essential personnel may be permitted within the ILLs and the FCA, but only within
           the FHA if located in blast-hardened structures with adequate breathing apparatus. NOP
           located at required work areas may be permitted inside the ILLs if they are performing safety,
           security, or operationally critical functions with approval of the SW/CC or his/her designated
           representative.
           5.3.2.2.2. The General Public is not permitted inside the FCA. An assessment shall be made
           as to whether the individual and collective risk meets the criteria established in AFSPCMAN
           91-710 Volume 1.
           5.3.2.2.3. Requests for personnel to remain in these hazardous launch areas shall be submitted
           to Wing Safety, with justification, by L-20 days to permit approval action prior to L-1 day.
           5.3.2.2.4. The PSO shall confirm the land portions of the FHA and FCA are clear and report
           to the MFCO.
           5.3.2.2.5. The report that the FHA, FCA, and ILL are clear shall occur at a designated time in
           the launch countdown.
           5.3.2.2.6. The PSO (through the Launch Support Team at the WR) shall compile a list of per-
           sonnel authorized to remain in hazardous launch areas, work with Flight Analysis to ensure
           personnel are located in safe locations, obtain the appropriate safety approvals, and provide
           the list to the appropriate range office who will clear and secure the areas.
        5.3.2.3. Applicability. All launch vehicles and, if necessary, associated payloads shall be evalu-
        ated and hazardous launch areas determined.
        5.3.2.4. Hazardous Launch Area Access LCC.
           5.3.2.4.1. FHA. Only launch-essential personnel in approved blast-hardened structures with
           adequate breathing protection are permitted in this area during a launch.
           5.3.2.4.2. FCA. Only launch-essential personnel with hazard protection equipment specified
           by Wing Safety including adequate breathing protection are permitted in this area during
           launch.
           5.3.2.4.3. BEA or LDZ. Ships and aircraft shall be identified in this area and cleared prior to
           launch.
           5.3.2.4.4. ILL. LEP and NOP are permitted within ILLs during a launch. Non-essential per-
           sonnel, with SW/CC approval, may be permitted in this area during a launch. The individual
           and collective risk of personnel inside the ILL shall not exceed acceptable (acceptable launch
           risk) standards as stated in AFSPCMAN 91-710 Volume 1.

5.4. Launch Area Air and Sea Surveillance.
     5.4.1. Launch Area Surveillance General Description.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                          57


     5.4.1.1. Launch area surveillance includes land and air areas designated as the ILL, FHA and the
     FCA. At AFSPC ranges, it also includes air and sea areas designated as the BEA, LSA, and LDZ.
     5.4.1.2. The determination of a Launch Area Surveillance GO FOR LAUNCH is provided by the
     appropriate launch countdown personnel to the MFCO who makes the final determination for
     CLEAR-TO-LAUNCH based on information from the above sources and any other sources avail-
     able during the final phases of the launch countdown.
     5.4.1.3. Designated clearance areas, warning areas, and restricted airspace areas shall be active
     and controlled according to this document, Safety Operating Instructions, 45 and 30 SW instruc-
     tions, and FAA directives and regulations.
  5.4.2. Hazardous Area Surveillance and Control.
     5.4.2.1. Surveillance Aircraft. Aircraft support for surveillance control is required for all launches
     at the ER and all pad launches at the WR.
     5.4.2.2. Radar Surveillance. Where available, land-based range radars or other assets from assist-
     ing government agencies are required to perform air and sea surveillance of the hazardous launch
     area.
         5.4.2.2.1. Marine Band Surveillance Radar. A Marine Band Surveillance Radar is required to
         survey for surface craft during pad launches and provide coverage from L-180 minutes for
         STS missions and from L-120 minutes for all other missions and until the area is determined
         clear from normal flight or from a launch vehicle malfunction.
     5.4.2.3. Small, Solid Propellant Rockets and Inert Body Drop Test Impact or Drop Area Surveil-
     lance. For small, solid propellant rocket launches or inert body drop tests, the impact or drop area
     surveillance will typically be within fifty nautical miles of shore. In such cases, surveillance
     requirements of the impact area shall be specified in the applicable RSOR.
     5.4.2.4. Marine Radio Broadcast Warnings. Marine radio broadcast warnings shall be made to
     inform vessels of the effective closure times for designated hazardous sea areas.
     5.4.2.5. NOTAMs and NTMs.
         5.4.2.5.1. Flight Analysis shall identify to ROPS/Range Scheduling the areas that are hazard-
         ous to ships and aircraft for all normally jettisoned and impacting stages by F-10 days at the
         ER and F-30 days at the WR.
         5.4.2.5.2. The ROPS/Range Scheduling is responsible for disseminating the NOTAM and
         NTM to aircraft and shipping interests, respectively.
     5.4.2.6. FAA Designated Control Areas.
         5.4.2.6.1. Control of air traffic in FAA designated areas around the launch area shall be main-
         tained and coordinated between the appropriate range officers and the FAA to ensure that air-
         craft are not endangered by launches and that launches are not delayed by the presence of
         aircraft.
     5.4.2.7. Surveillance Control. Specific surveillance control requirements shall be specified in the
     appropriate RSOR and/or wing supplements to this document.
  5.4.3. Launch Area Air, Land, and Sea Surveillance Launch Commit Criteria (LCC). Areas to
  be cleared of boats, ships, and trains are defined by Flight Analysis and based on hit probability con-
58                                                              AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


     tours and/or THZs, including known impact areas of jettisoned stages/bodies and destruct debris
     resulting from malfunction scenarios plus the areas and altitudes in which toxic hazards will exist.
     Hazardous Launch Areas are defined by NOTAM and those areas within the coverage capabilities of
     local land based radars or support aircraft are surveyed on launch day for intruder aircraft and are ana-
     lyzed as a potential for risk to the launch vehicle or the aircraft.
        5.4.3.1. Applicability. These criteria are applicable to all launch operations within the capability
        of the range’s surveillance assets.
        5.4.3.2. Boat and Ship Traffic LCC. If the sum total of the individual hit probabilities of all targets
        plotted within, or predicted to be within, the established probability contours exceeds acceptable
        risk criteria as stated in AFSPCMAN 91-710 Volume 1, a launch hold or mission/launch scrub
        may be initiated.
        5.4.3.3. Aircraft LCC. For an aircraft posing a threat to itself or the launch vehicle by its expected
        position being within predetermined hazard corridors, a launch hold or mission/launch scrub may
        result until the aircraft clears the hazard corridor.
        5.4.3.4. OPRs.
            5.4.3.4.1. At AFSPC ranges, the ROPS is the OPR for launch area air and sea surveillance.
            During the launch countdown, ROPS personnel shall provide surveillance information to the
            appropriate countdown personnel.
            5.4.3.4.2. The Wing Safety Flight Analysis office is the OPR for analysis of the hazard areas
            and the vessel exclusion areas (BEA or LDZ). The Flight Analysis office also provides analy-
            sis support on launch day for interpretation and application of policy for public safety.

5.5. Jettisoned Bodies Impacting Land in the Launch Area.
     5.5.1. General Description. AFSPCMAN 91-710 prohibits the planned impact of jettisoned compo-
     nents on any land mass. However for certain launch vehicles, the possibility exists for jettisoned bod-
     ies such as nozzle closures to impact in the launch area near occupied facilities or resources requiring
     protection. In these cases, impact is allowed when the risks associated are mitigated or minimized.
     Wing Safety shall perform jettisoned body impact prediction analysis/runs on DoL. Hit probability
     contours are created and used in conjunction with launch day impact prediction runs to determine pos-
     sible threat near the predicted impact. If a launch hazard results from the jettisoned body analysis,
     Wing Safety is authorized to initiate a launch hold or launch scrub.
     5.5.2. Applicability. All vehicles jettisoning components in the launch area with the potential to
     impact land.
     5.5.3. Jettisoned Bodies LCC. Launch day impact prediction runs are made and the associated prob-
     ability contours or impact dispersions are overlaid with the launch areas. A launch hazard may result
     in a launch hold or mission/launch scrub condition.
        5.5.3.1. OPRs. The Flight Analysis office is the OPR for jettisoned bodies impacting land.

5.6. Blast (including DFO) LCC.
     5.6.1. The BLAST model addresses intermediate hazardous range effects of a shock wave from an
     inadvertent detonation, such as from a launch vehicle malfunction, impact, or destruction. Near-in
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                            59


   areas of overpressure above one pound per square inch (psi) are evacuated of personnel and are not
   considered in the assessment. At far-out distances, with overpressures of less than 0.1 psi, there are
   relatively small hazards. It is the intermediate distance with overpressures of 0.1 to 0.5 psi that are of
   concern. The area encompassing overpressures in this range varies considerably with local meteoro-
   logical conditions.
   5.6.2. This launch commit criteria is generally applicable to large launch vehicles with large amounts
   of propellants, solid rocket motor launch vehicles with high energy propellants, and launch vehicles
   using launch complexes near the borders of general population.
   5.6.3. The risk associated with the total flight to all members of the general public, excluding persons
   in waterborne vessels and aircraft, shall not exceed an expected average number of 0.00003 casualties
   (EC < 30 x 10-6) from far field blast overpressure. The EC criterion for blast applies to each launch
   from liftoff through orbital insertion, including planned impact for an orbital launch, and through final
   impact for a suborbital launch. If the EC for blast exceeds the above requirements Wing Safety shall
   recommend the range go “red” until another BLAST model run can be made with updated meteoro-
   logical data and the blast risks are re-evaluated
   5.6.4. The risk to an individual member of the public shall not exceed an EC of 0.000001 per launch
   (EC < 1 x 10-6).
   5.6.5. The acceptable risk for DFO for window breakage related casualties is a collective EC < 30 x
   10-6.
   5.6.6. Mission-specific blast launch commit criteria shall be addressed in the RSOR.

5.7. Toxic LCC.
   5.7.1. All launch vehicles, including payloads, with potentially hazardous chemicals shall be subject
   to the toxic LCC.
   5.7.2. The acceptable limits for various toxic commodities are governed by a number of standards,
   statutes, and specifications. These standards, statutes, and specifications are subject to frequent revi-
   sion based on controlled studies, real-world events, and other discoveries. Additionally, commodity
   loads vary among launch vehicle classes and differences exist between variants within the same
   launch vehicle class. For these reasons and because of the evolving nature of predictive models used,
   a general toxic LCC cannot be stated.
   5.7.3. The risk associated with the total flight to all members of the general public, excluding persons
   in waterborne vessels and aircraft, shall not exceed an expected average number of 0.00003 casualties
   (EC < 30 x 10-6) for toxic release (exposure to rocket propellant effluent). The EC criterion for toxics
   applies to each launch from liftoff through orbital insertion, including the planned impact for an
   orbital launch and through final impact for a suborbital launch. If the expected casualties of an expo-
   sure to a toxic commodity exceed these limits, Wing Safety shall recommend that the range go “red”
   until another run can be made with updated meteorological data and the toxic risks are re-evaluated.
   5.7.4. The risk to an individual member of the public due to toxics shall not exceed an EC of 0.000001
   per launch (EC < 1 x 10-6).
   5.7.5. Mission-specific toxic LCC shall be addressed in the RSOR.
60                                                             AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


5.8. Debris LCC. All launch vehicles with potentially hazardous launch vehicle debris are subject to the
following launch commit criteria.
     5.8.1. Wing Safety shall forecast T-0 winds and compare with actual winds and statistical wind data
     and determine the effects of potential launch vehicle debris impacts. If forecasted T-0 winds cause
     potential launch vehicle debris dispersions to exceed acceptable statistical wind dispersion limits, a
     launch hold or launch scrub shall be implemented.
     5.8.2. The risk associated with the total flight to all members of the general public, excluding persons
     in waterborne vessels and aircraft, shall not exceed an expected average number of 0.00003 casualties
     (EC < 30 x 10-6) from impacting inert (launch area and overflight) and explosive debris (structures,
     near field window breakage, and open). The EC criterion for debris applies to each launch from liftoff
     through orbital insertion, including planned impact for an orbital launch, and through final impact for
     a suborbital launch. If the expected casualties of an exposure to debris exceed these limits, Wing
     Safety shall recommend that the range go “red” until another run can be made with updated meteoro-
     logical data and the debris risks are re-evaluated.
     5.8.3. The risk to an individual member of the public due to debris shall not exceed an EC of 0.000001
     per launch (EC < 1 x 10-6).
     5.8.4. The probability of debris impact to all waterborne vessels (Piv) shall not exceed 0.00001
     (Piv < x 10-5) in each debris impact hazard area identified by Wing Safety.

5.9. Launch Safety Weather-Related LCC. The Launch Safety weather-related LCC is a set of LCC
that involve meteorological conditions that may affect launch operations; for example, upper level winds
in the Flight Hazard Area (FHA), low level wind and temperature profiles (blast/toxic propagation), natu-
ral/triggered lightning and/or ceiling and visibility (optical restrictions).
     5.9.1. AFSPC ranges shall ensure that Launch Safety weather-related LCC are developed using rec-
     ommendations by the Lightning Advisory Panel and the Weather Squadron. During day-of launch
     operations, the Weather Squadron shall evaluate Launch Safety and Range User weather LCC to
     ensure that there are no weather threats to the launch. Wing Safety and the Weather Squadron shall
     ensure compliance with the Launch Safety weather requirements, including natural and triggered
     lightning, in AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 6, Attachment 7.
     5.9.2. Launch Safety weather-related LCCs may be waived only by the SW/CC, under special situa-
     tions.
     5.9.3. Launch wind LCC.
        5.9.3.1. Wing Safety shall perform wind-effects calculations on the morning of F-1 work day and
        again at approximately L-5 hours on DoL for all major launches. The following procedure shall be
        adhered to:
        5.9.3.2. On the F-3 day, the Weather Squadron shall provide the T-0 weather forecast data. Debris
        risk analyses are conducted based on the F-1 or L-1 day forecast data at the WR.
        5.9.3.3. At L-5 hours, the Weather Squadron shall provide an update to the T-0 weather forecast
        data.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                        61


       5.9.3.4. No later than L-4.5 hours, Wing Safety shall run the wind check program (ER only).
       Flight Analysis shall complete the debris risk analysis no later than L-3.5 hours and the results
       provided to the MFCO and the Chief of Safety (WR only).
       5.9.3.5. No later than L-4 hours, Flight Analysis shall provide the results of the wind check pro-
       gram to the MFCO.
       5.9.3.6. If a HOLD in the launch countdown invalidates the predicted wind data or if a later wind
       prediction is made, it may be necessary to repeat the above T-0 weather forecast data and re-run
       the wind check program.
       5.9.3.7. Wing safety shall compare forecasted T-0 winds and actual winds with statistical wind
       data and determine the wind effects on potential launch vehicle debris. A launch hold or scrub
       shall be implemented if the forecasted T-0 winds are predicted to cause launch vehicle debris dis-
       persions in excess of acceptable statistical wind dispersion limits (ER only).
   5.9.4. The weather data and associated safety analysis requirements shall be listed in the RSOR.

5.10. Launch Countdown Requirements. A complete end-to-end system check shall be performed dur-
ing the launch countdown using recorded data inputs and RSD recordings that have been verified by Wing
Safety.
62                                                            AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


                                                Chapter 6

                        FLIGHT SAFETY SYSTEM (GROUND ELEMENTS)

6.1. Flight Safety System Composition. The entire FSS consists of the airborne and ground FTSs, air-
borne and ground tracking systems, and airborne and ground telemetry data transmission systems. This
publication only addresses the Launch Safety requirements for the ground components of the FSS.
Requirements for the airborne components of the FSS are in AFSPCMAN 91-710. The ground element of
the FSS consists of the TDTS, the RTS, and the FTS. The RTS includes a RSD system, which displays
vehicle flight performance data that the MFCO uses as the basis for a flight termination decision. The
TDTS provides for the transport of onboard launch vehicle position and performance data to the RSD and
the Range User. The CDS provides the MFCO the capability to terminate the vehicle’s flight.

6.2. FSS Requirements.
     6.2.1. General FSS Requirements. The SW/CC has final approval authority for FSS requirements.
     The SW/SE shall review, coordinate, and concur on the design, test (including modifications to tests),
     modification, and operation of all FSS ground segments prior to use on AFSPC ranges. FSS Launch
     Safety requirements for Range Users and for the airborne segment of the FSS are in AFSPCMAN
     91-710 (for programs existing prior to the inception of AFSPCMAN 91-710, EWR 127-1 Chapter 4
     applies). As specified in AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 4, RCC 319 may be used as the source docu-
     ment for FSS Range User requirements and may be tailored in lieu of AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 4
     as determined by Wing Safety.
        6.2.1.1. Wing Safety shall review and approve the Range User’s Flight Termination System
        Report. The contents/requirements for the Flight Termination System Report are specified in
        AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 4.
        6.2.1.2. Concurrence by Wing Safety is required for all development, modification, maintenance,
        and sustainment activities of the ground portion of the FSS. Launch Safety requirements shall be
        implemented for all systems used to provide for public safety and/or prevent the inadvertent flight
        termination of an otherwise nominal launch vehicle. Wing Safety shall review any change or mod-
        ification made to a Wing Safety-approved FSS, to include modifications to or substitutions of
        associated equipment, components, component identification, test procedures, basic characteris-
        tics, and rating, or any changes affecting the configuration or integrity of the FSS to determine if
        the previously awarded Wing Safety approval should be revoked and if component/system
        re-qualification is required.
        6.2.1.3. Wing Safety participation is required in all FSS acquisitions and upgrades. Participation
        includes involvement in requirements development, design reviews, and test plan and procedure
        development as well as attending FSS design reviews, monitoring FSS development and opera-
        tional testing conducted IAW acquisition and commissioning/acceptance processes. Wing Safety
        shall review and approve all test plans and revisions to test plans IAW AFSPCMAN 91-710, Vol-
        ume 4 or EWR 127-1, Chapter 4 whichever is on contract. Wing Safety shall not approve for flight
        any FSS components that fail to meet manufacturer specifications or the requirements in AFSPC-
        MAN 91-710, Volume 4 or RCC 319 as appropriate until Wing Safety-approved corrective actions
        have been implemented.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                             63


       6.2.1.4. The FSS commissioning/acceptance process shall include real-world operations to verify
       new or upgraded FSS performance before the deactivation of legacy systems, unless otherwise
       approved by Wing Safety. This process typically involves parallel operations where both the leg-
       acy and new systems perform side by side (shadow mode). Wing Safety shall determine the num-
       ber of required parallel operations (both shadow backup and shadow prime). The factors that
       determine the number of parallel operations include, but are not limited to, the inherent risk to
       public safety, risk of terminating a nominal mission, and the availability of test data to sufficiently
       exercise the system.
       6.2.1.5. Commissioning/acceptance of all ground system segments of the FSS requires Wing
       Safety concurrence prior to operational use (support of a launch or any hazardous operation).
       6.2.1.6. All AFSPC organizations involved with the development, acquisition, modification/
       upgrade, test, commissioning/acceptance, or operation of any ground segment of the FSS or sys-
       tems that interface with any ground segment of the FSS shall ensure that Wing Safety is notified
       in writing (includes email) of all activities needed to meet the above stated Launch Safety require-
       ments.
   6.2.2. FSS Requirements for Manned Vehicles.
       6.2.2.1. The effect of abort action on engine shutdown for manned systems with an FTS shall be
       approved by Wing Safety.
       6.2.2.2. Payloads and their booster stages transported on or within a manned portion of a vehicle
       will be evaluated by Wing Safety to determine the need for an FTS.

6.3. Range Pre-Launch Activities. The AFSPC ranges and Wing Safety shall support the pre-launch
checkout of airborne and ground FSSs to ensure all systems meet safety requirements.
   6.3.1. AFSPC Wing Safety offices shall support flight safety system (airborne elements) pre-launch
   activities/tests as contained in AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 4, Chapter 5 to ensure safety systems are
   functioning properly.
   6.3.2. MFCOs or their designated representatives shall support flight safety system (ground elements)
   pre-launch activities/tests as contained in AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 4, Chapter 5 to ensure safety
   systems are functioning properly.

6.4. RTS Requirements. An RTS is composed of the hardware, software, and manpower required to
transmit, receive, process, and display selected launch vehicle data. This data, when qualified as described
below, allows a MFCO to compare actual and nominal flight trajectories, verify performance in conjunc-
tion with vehicle telemetry, and identify violations of destruct criteria. With this information, the MFCO
knows when a flight rule has been violated and flight termination actions are required.
   6.4.1. RTS requirements are:
       6.4.1.1. Metric tracking and vehicle telemetry data is required to provide the MFCO with knowl-
       edge of vehicle’s present position with respect to the nominal trajectory and predicted debris
       impact locations until final impact point for launch vehicles with suborbital trajectories and
       through orbital insertion for orbital vehicles.

     6.4.1.2. Range tracking instrumentation data sources and associated range safety display system
     information shall be designed to ensure that no hardware or software single point of failure denies
     the MFCO the capability to monitor in-flight launch vehicle performance.
     6.4.1.3. The overall RTS shall be robust, flexible, highly fault tolerant, allow for catastrophic fail-
     ure in a single system without loss of all tracking data and remain partial mission-capable as mul-
     tiple component failures occur (graceful degradation).
     6.4.1.4. Metric tracking sources such as radars, optic tracking sites, telemetry inertial guidance
     (TMIG) data, and Global Positioning System (GPS) data shall provide real-time state vectors
     (position and velocity). These resultant state vectors are inputs for the range processing and dis-
     play systems known as the RSD system. An RSD shall be capable of displaying all tracking source
     data and shall be able to process and display data from at least two adequate and independent met-
     ric tracking sources from T-0 (T minus Time) until final impact point for launch vehicles with sub-
     orbital trajectories and throughout each phase of powered flight up to orbital insertion or the end
     of Wing Safety responsibility for orbital vehicles.
        6.4.1.4.1. A metric tracking source is considered adequate if it meets the following reliability,
        accuracy, and timeliness requirements:
            6.4.1.4.1.1. The airborne system reliability goal shall be 0.995 at the 95 percent confi-
            dence level for transponder systems and 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level for global
            positioning systems.
            6.4.1.4.1.2. The ground system reliability shall be 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level
            for one hour duration. Systems that cannot meet this requirement will be addressed by
            Wing Safety on a case-by-case basis.
            6.4.1.4.1.3. A reliability analysis should be performed IAW guidelines set forth in Military
            Handbook-781 to demonstrate the reliability design was used in the concept and detailed
            design of the components and/or system.
            6.4.1.4.1.4. Timeliness and 3-sigma present position (PP) and IIP uncertainty resulting
            from all error sources shall meet the accuracy requirements specified in AFSPCMAN
            91-710 and the respective SW supplements to AFSPCMAN 91-711.
        6.4.1.4.2. An RTS metric tracking source is considered independent if it is electrically,
        mechanically, and structurally separate from the vehicle guidance and telemetry systems and
        any other tracking source, so that one tracking source will not influence another tracking
        source.
     6.4.1.5. Wing Safety shall ensure the applicable requirements of RCC 324, Global Positioning
     and Inertial Navigation Range Tracking Systems, Commonality Standard, are satisfied. Though
     RCC 324 is primarily intended for global positioning systems and inertial navigation systems, the
     system performance requirements can be used for almost any tracking source. The determination
     of whether these performance requirements are adequate or whether the RCC 324 tailoring pro-
     cess needs to be implemented shall be determined by Wing Safety. Wing Safety shall make this
     determination based on the quality, history, and number of tracking of sources being provided as
     well as the risks posed by the specific vehicle mission.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                              65


6.5. TMIG Data as a Metric Tracking Source. TMIG data is a mandatory tracking source for pro-
grams using a launch vehicle inertial guidance system when validated by the AFSPC range or certified to
the RCC Standard 324. The TMIG data is required at a 10 samples per second update rate from T-0
through the end of Wing Safety responsibility.

6.6. GPS System Data as a Metric Tracking Source. See RCC 324 for GPS requirements.

6.7. RSD Requirements.
   6.7.1. An RSD system is required as the primary information display system used by the MFCO to
   evaluate launch vehicle flight.
   6.7.2. Flight Analysis (a part of the Launch Safety Section of Wing Safety) shall provide RSD
   requirements, instructions, and data necessary for display generation to range personnel responsible
   for RSD systems operations.
   6.7.3. Real-Time Prediction Requirements.
       6.7.3.1. PP and IIP solutions shall be provided for display on the RSD at a rate of 10 samples per
       second or faster.
       6.7.3.2. The PP and IIP solutions shall be computed from data supplied by the tracking sources
       identified in the RSOR and/or its operational supplement as applicable.
       6.7.3.3. PP and IIP computations and displays shall be single failure tolerant.
       6.7.3.4. Range specific real-time calculated IIP accuracy requirements are provided in AFSPC-

   6.7.6. Telemetry Display Requirements.
       6.7.6.1. Specific telemetry display requirements shall be documented in the RSOR or Ops Sup for
       a mission.

6.8. Command and Control System (CCS). The CCS provides the MFCO with the capability to termi-
nate launch vehicle flight if an FTS is used and flight termination criteria are violated or mission rules call
for the MFCO to initiate flight termination action. The Command Destruct System is a subset of the CCS.
Detailed CDS performance requirements are contained in the Combined Command Destruct System
Range Safety Requirements (CCDSRSR) document for the 30/45 SWs. Wing unique CCS requirements

                                               Chapter 7

           FLIGHT CONTROL POLICY AND COUNTDOWN HOLD AUTHORITY

7.1. Flight Control Policy.
   7.1.1. Wing Safety shall verify that all launch vehicles launched from or onto AFSPC ranges have a
   positive, range-approved method of controlling errant launch vehicle flight to meet the objectives of
   minimizing risks to the public and launch-essential personnel. When required, flight control systems
   on launch vehicles using AFSPC ranges shall include an airborne FSS that shall meet all the require-
   ments of AFSPCMAN 91-710, RCC 324 and RCC 319.
       7.1.1.1. Flight Control Mission. The Flight Control mission supports and enforces the Flight Con-
       trol policy and is executed by the MFCO. The Flight Control mission begins when the system or
       procedures used to exercise positive control of launch vehicle flight is activated during the launch
       countdown and is completed at Flight Control End of Mission (EOM). During the Flight Control
       mission, the MFCO’s Launch Safety responsibilities include: a safety assessment of the readiness
       of the operation to proceed; final Launch Safety Go/No-Go recommendation; monitoring launch
       vehicle performance in flight; and serving as the sole decision-making authority and initiator of
       the flight termination system (if required).
       7.1.1.2. Flight Control EOM represents the end of Flight Control responsibility and is determined
       by Launch Safety analysis which is based on Range User data, mission objectives, and the risk to
       the public. Due to the unique mission objectives, Flight Control EOM is unique to the mission.
       Examples of Flight Control EOM include, but are not limited to: orbital insertion; end of powered
       flight (caused either by fuel depletion/shutoff or flight computer shutdown); nominal loss of sig-
       nal; a planned vehicle event or vehicle aspect angle; separation of the last stage that contains a
       flight termination system; or completion of destruct actions or errant missile actions.
       7.1.1.3. Launch Safety Flight Control requirements (i.e.; launch constraint criteria and committed
       coverage plans) shall be contained in wing level documentation (e.g. RSOR, RSOR supplements,
       etc.) and shall be enforced by the MFCOs. These Launch Safety flight control requirements shall
       be the basis for the Launch Safety Go/No-Go (launch commit) for launch.
   7.1.2. In all instances, the MFCO shall make a decision concerning continued flight or flight termina-
   tion based on interpretation of real-time events, mission rules, all available data sources, and sound
   judgment. If any of the following validated abnormal conditions exist, the MFCO is authorized to ini-
   tiate flight termination action:
       7.1.2.1. Validated data confirms the launch vehicle has violated established flight safety criteria,
       in particular that the launch vehicle IIP has violated the destruct line limits.
       7.1.2.2. The launch vehicle exhibits gross deviation or obvious erratic flight where, in the judg-
       ment of the MFCO, continued flight may pose an unacceptable Launch Safety risk (to include loss
       of positive control) though the above destruct criteria are not violated.
       7.1.2.3. The performance of the launch vehicle is unknown and the capability exists to violate
       flight safety criteria.
       7.1.2.4. The MFCO may implement special mission rules as requested by the Range User or as
       determined from pre-launch flight analysis. Wing Safety shall approve any special mission rules.
68                                                             AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


        7.1.2.5. Wing Safety shall provide the mission rules and flight termination policy to the Range
        User.
     7.1.3. Command Capability. AFSPC ranges shall ensure that range managed instrumentation pro-
     vides uninterrupted command capability for all systems that use an FTS or thrust termination system.
     For systems that use command receiver decoders, capture from FTS turn-on through flight control end
     of mission is required.

7.2. Launch Commit Decision and Hold Authority.
     7.2.1. The MFCO is responsible for the launch commit decision from a Launch Safety perspective.
     The launch commit decision shall be based on the ability of range instrumentation to meet minimum
     Launch Safety requirements and a real-time assessment of public safety impacts. The MFCO shall
     perform final checkout of Wing Safety instrumentation (RSD, CDS, and TDTS) prior to accepting the
     system for operational launch commit.
     7.2.2. The MFCO is authorized to initiate launch holds during the countdown for violations of LCC.
     7.2.3. The MFCO is authorized to approve waivers for “required” Launch Safety requirements on
     DoL, unless specified differently in the mission rules.
     7.2.4. The MFCO may upgrade required Launch Safety requirements to mandatory, unless specified
     differently in the mission rules.
     7.2.5. The SW/CC (Spacelift Commander on DoL) exercises waiver authority for mandatory Launch
     Safety requirements.

7.3. Launch Aborts and Mission Scrubs.
     7.3.1. Launch Aborts. In the event of a launch abort, when the status of the launch vehicle is
     unknown, the range shall assume that the vehicle may liftoff without warning. Under this circum-
     stance, the range shall not release instrumentation until all Launch Safety requirements have been met
     or are no longer necessary.
        7.3.1.1. Launch Abort and Misfire/Hangfire Operations.
            7.3.1.1.1. Any failure to launch or ignite properly shall be treated as a hangfire until it can be
            definitely established that a misfire has occurred or until the 30-minute waiting period has
            elapsed. The 30-minute waiting period does not apply to ballistic missile launch vehicles in
            cases where it is directed otherwise by approved technical orders (WR only).
            7.3.1.1.2. The FSS shall remain configured in a manner that will enable the MFCO to take
            destruct action if necessary until Pad Safety (ER)/Flight Safety Project Officer (WR) has veri-
            fied to the MFCO that the launch vehicle is no longer in a launch configuration.
            7.3.1.1.3. In the event of a launch abort or misfire or following expiration of the 30-minute
            wait period in the case of a hangfire with solid propellant stages or solid propellant starter
            devices, Pad Safety shall perform the following activities:
                7.3.1.1.3.1. Ensure the ignition firing circuit has been disabled.
                7.3.1.1.3.2. After approval from the MFCO, allow rotation of the FTS S&A to safe.
                7.3.1.1.3.3. Inform the MFCO that the FTS S&A devices are in the safe position.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                           69


             7.3.1.1.3.4. Allow the command receivers to be turned off after coordination with the
             MFCO.
             7.3.1.1.3.5. Inform the MFCO that the safing devices are reinstalled.
             7.3.1.1.3.6. Wing Safety shall make a launch complex inspection in conjunction with the
             Range User and allow access to the launch complex for work when it is safe to do so.
             7.3.1.1.3.7. Adjust or lift roadblocks as required.
             7.3.1.1.3.8. When no further launch attempt is contemplated, verify that hazardous ord-
             nance items are disconnected electrically and shielded and, if required, removed for return
             to the storage area.
             7.3.1.1.3.9. Request support from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team when
             disarming of ordnance systems or components cannot be accomplished using normal
             methods.
             7.3.1.1.3.10. If necessary, the EOD team shall initiate render-safe procedures.
          7.3.1.1.4. Launch Vehicles Using Liquid Propellant Stages Abort or Misfire/Hangfire Opera-
          tions. Pad Safety shall monitor the detanking of propellants, where applicable.
          7.3.1.1.5. Launch Vehicles Using Solid Propellant Stages or Solid Propellant Starting Devices
          Abort or Misfire/Hangfire Operations.
             7.3.1.1.5.1. In the event of a hangfire, Pad Safety (ER)/FSPO (WR), the Range Squadron,
             and the Range User shall ensure the FSS remains configured in a manner that will enable
             the MFCOs to initiate destruct actions, if necessary, in the event of an unforeseen launch.
             7.3.1.1.5.2. Pad Safety shall restrict access to the launch pad until it is verified that power
             did not reach the initiator (misfire) or it can be assumed that power did reach the initiator
             (hangfire) and a 30-minute wait period has elapsed.
   7.3.2. Mission Scrubs. In cases where the mission and/or launch countdown is terminated under nor-
   mal circumstances, the range shall not release instrumentation until all Launch Safety requirements
   have been met. The command destruct receivers shall remain captured until the FTS is safed IAW
   Wing Safety approved recycle procedures.

7.4. Communications.
   7.4.1. The Flight Control communication circuit requirements shall be specified in the applicable
   RSOR, Ops Sup, or operations directive (OD).
   7.4.2. Checkout and Operation of Communication Networks.
      7.4.2.1. The Range shall ensure all communication networks required in an RSOR or Ops Sup are
      checked out and operational prior to the scheduled time for FTS destruct checks or L-2 hour,
      whichever is earliest in the countdown.
          7.4.2.1.1. The Range shall ensure MFCO communications are recorded for all launches. The
          recording shall be continuous from L-10 minutes through the flight control EOM.

     Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation) and/or the National Transportation Safety Board
     (NTSB) may lead the investigation IAW the Memorandum of Understanding Between the National
     Transportation Safety Board, Department of the Air Force, and the Federal Aviation Administra-
     tion Regarding Space Launch Accidents (September 7, 2004), 49 CFR 830, National Transportation
     Safety Board, and the terms of the applicable license or permit issued by FAA/AST.
     8.1.3. Under certain conditions, a mishap involving an FAA licensed or permitted mission may be
     investigated by the Launch Operator/Range User as determined by FAA/AST under the provisions of
     14 CFR, Part 401, Organization and Definitions, Part 406, Investigations, Enforcement and Admin-
     istrative Review, Part 413, License Application Procedures, Part 415, Launch License, and the appli-
     cable license.
     8.1.4. For mishaps involving NASA missions, NASA will investigate IAW the mission-specific Con-
     tingency Action Plan (CAP) developed by NASA.

8.2. It is the policy of the USAF to understand the cause and preventative action for any mishap that has
the potential to impact USAF personnel, resources, and current or future launch missions. Therefore, the
USAF reserves the right to participate, in a non-intrusive basis, in all investigations of mishaps occurring
on AFSPC ranges that are of interest to the USAF, regardless of who owns the mission. Mishaps of inter-
est are those that affect or could affect operations on an AFSPC range, public safety, launch area safety,
launch complex safety, or government resource safety (also known as resource protection). Additionally,
due to the similarity of launch vehicles, it is desirable for the licensing authority (the FAA/AST) to partic-
ipate in all mishap investigations of interest. Therefore, an FAA/AST representative shall be invited to
participate in USAF mishap investigations that are of interest to the FAA/AST. For additional guidance,
see AFSPC Safety Guide SE-001, AFSPC Space Launch Mishap Investigation Guide, 30 SW Plan
91-204, Volume II, Investigation of Launch and Launch Processing Mishaps Response Plan, 45 SW
OPLAN 91-204, Volume II, Investigation of Launch and Launch Processing Mishaps, and 45 SW
Handbook 91-205, Launch Mishap Investigation Guide.
     8.2.1. HQ AFSPC shall implement mishap investigation procedures IAW AFI 91-204 and the AFSPC
     supplement to AFI 91-204. For AFSPC Class A mishaps, the AFSPC/CC is the mishap convening
     authority.
     8.2.2. The 30 SW and 45 SW shall appoint an Interim Safety Board (ISB) president prior to each gov-
     ernment, civil, or commercial launch, regardless of mishap accountability for that launch. The pri-
     mary purpose of the ISB is to preserve evidence from a mishap. The SW shall assist the ISB to ensure
     all equipment associated with the mishap is impounded and turned over to the formal Safety Investi-
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                        73


   gation Board. The responsibilities of the ISB are specified in AFI 91-204, AFMAN 91-222, and
   AFSPC Safety Guide SE-001.

8.3. The USAF shall support and assist non-USAF mishap investigations IAW applicable interagency
agreements and applicable Commercial Space Operations Support Agreements.

8.4. Wing Safety should be provided with the investigation results of any mishap or incident occurring on
AFSPC ranges for identification and implementation of appropriate lessons learned. Wing Safety shall
control mishap information IAW AFI 91-204 and AFMAN 91-222.

8.5. Wing Safety shall notify the appropriate SMC organization of any mishap associated with SMC pro-
grams.

8.6. The SW/CC may conduct formal investigations into any mishap and incident on his/her range that
affects or could affect public safety, Launch Safety, launch area safety, or launch complex safety.

Terms
—(the words that are italicized in the following list of terms also have definitions in this section)
abbreviated injury scale—An anatomical scoring system that was first introduced in 1969 by the
Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine that has been revised and updated over the
years to provide a reasonably accurate means of identifying and ranking the severity of injuries. The
abbreviated injury scale (AIS) ranks injuries on a scale from 1 through 6, with 1 being a minor injury, 5
being a severe injury, and 6 being a non-survivable injury. The AIS is a scale used to distinguish serious
injuries from those of lesser severity for purposes of modeling the human casualty response to a hazard.
At AFSPC ranges, any injury that (due to its severity) qualifies as an AIS level higher than 3 (greater
severity) are accounted for in casualty models as serious injuries.
abort—see launch abort.
82                                                           AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007


acceptable hazard—determination of the acceptability of any hazard imposed by a launch vehicle/
missile or orbital vehicle launched from or onto the range is solely the responsibility of the Space Wing
Commander; the acceptability varies with operational requirements and/or national need and is
determined by the Space Wing Commander on a case-by-case basis.
acceptable launch risk—the figure of 30 x 10-6 used by AFSPC ranges as the acceptable risk level for
each hazard without high management review and approval; the figure of 1 x 10-6 used by AFSPC ranges
as the acceptable risk level for an individual without high management review and approval.
accumulated risk—the combined collective risk to all individuals exposed to a particular hazard through
all phases of an operation.
adequate—refers to the capability of tracking sources to provide real-time state vectors (position and
velocity) to meet accuracy, timeliness, and reliability criteria specified in AFSPCMAN 91-710 Volume 2
and is defined by error statistics for each tracking source.
aerial vehicle—a vehicle designed to operate in the air or within the atmosphere
AF/FAA Common Standards Working Group—a group of AF and FAA Launch Safety experts formed
to develop and maintain common safety standards and requirements for commercial launch operations at
Federal and non-Federal ranges.
AFSPC ranges—all ranges owned and operated by Air Force Space Command; currently this refers to
the ranges owned and operated by the 30 SW and 45 SW located on Vandenberg Air Force Base
(California) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (Florida).
aggregated risk—the accumulated risk due to all hazards associated with a flight; see accumulated risk.
anomaly (space launch system anomaly)—any parameter (pressure, temperature, voltage, acceleration,
etc.) or event that deviates outside the prescribed or expected range of values; any occurrence that
represents an unusual, irregular, abnormal, or unexplained departure from expected results.
azimuth—an arc of the horizon measured between a fixed point and the vertical circle passing through
the center of an object; quantities may be expressed in positive quantities increasing in a clockwise
direction, or in X, Y coordinates where south and west are negative; may be referenced to true north or
magnetic north depending on the particular system used; see launch azimuth.


Blast Danger Area—a hazardous clear area; clearance prior to the establishment of a major explosive
hazard such as vehicle fuel/oxidizer load and pressurization; the area subject to fragment and direct
overpressure resulting from the explosion of the booster/payload.
boat—A watercraft, usually smaller than most ships. Some boats are commonly carried by a ship or on
land using trailers. A boat consists of one or more buoyancy structures called hulls and some system of
propulsion, such as a screw, oars, paddles, a setting pole, a sail, paddlewheels or a water jet.
boat exclusion area—An area that consists of the downrange hazard or caution areas; private surface
vessels are prohibited in downrange hazard and caution areas. The flight safety analysis evaluates the risk
to a boat in the downrange hazard or caution area by plotting the boat’s position on a map and examining
the corresponding risk contour. Downrange vessels supporting the operation may support in the caution
area.
AFSPCMAN91-711 1 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                             83

collective risk—the total combined risk to all individuals within a category (for example,
launch-essential personnel, general public) exposed to a particular hazard during a specific period of time
or event; unless otherwise noted, the mean number of casualties predicted (Ec) to result from a given
hazard.
collision avoidance/collision avoidance analysis—a process designed to prevent collisions between
on-orbit tracked objects or to prevent collisions between on-orbit tracked objects and launched vehicles
(including spent stages)/payloads by determining and implementing courses of action through careful
analysis of validated conjunction assessments and satellite health and mission requirements; the process
includes establishing launch wait periods in either the launch window or spacecraft thrust firings based on
validated conjunction assessments and accounts for uncertainties in spatial dispersions, arrival time of
orbiting objects and/or the launch vehicle/payload, and modeling accuracy; there are two different types
of collision avoidance, safety collision avoidance and mission assurance collision avoidance.
collision avoidance closure period—see launch wait and launch hold.
collision avoidance no launch period—see launch wait and launch hold.
command control system—the portion of a flight safety system that includes all components needed to
send a flight termination control signal to an onboard vehicle flight termination system; a command

tracked orbiting objects or between a tracked orbiting object and a launched vehicle (including spent
stages)/payload; conjunction assessment is performed in association with a specified miss distance
screening criteria or the corresponding probability of collision; associated with the closest approach
assessment is the closest approach distance, the times of launch and/or orbital firing that would result in
the closest approach and meeting the miss distance or collision probability criteria; a probability of
