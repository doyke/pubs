SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been revised to update core and flexible band hours and to allow for a gliding
work schedule. A (|) indicates revision from the previous edition.
1. Objective: To improve morale and quality of life while maintaining productivity. Alternate
Work Schedules (AWS) programs have a potential to enable managers and supervisors to meet
their program goals while, at the same time, allowing employees to be more flexible in
scheduling their activities. As employees gain greater control over their time, they can, for
 2                                                                   911AWI36-801 4 MAY 2011


example, balance work and family responsibilities more easily, become involved in volunteer
activities, and take advantage of educational opportunities.
2. Conditions and Regulatory Restrictions:
     2.1. No employee will be required to participate in this program.
     2.2. Employees will submit an initial schedule request such as Attachment 1, Flexitour
     (FWS)/Gliding Schedule (GS)/Compressed Work Schedule (CWS) Request. If an
     employee desires a change to their initial schedule, another request must be submitted. If the
     supervisor cannot approve an employee’s request the employee and the supervisor will
     discuss possible alternatives. Supervisors will make every reasonable effort to honor an
     employee’s request subject to constraints such as work requirements, mission impact, and
     safety. Upon request, disapprovals will be justified in writing to the employee.
        2.2.1. New employees may be allowed to work an alternate work schedule as soon as
        possible. However, supervisors may require a new employee to work during the official
        business hours, 0730 to 1600, until he/she becomes sufficiently oriented to work
        independently during flexible time without supervision.
     2.3. To maintain schedule stability and minimize the opportunity for errors, employees will
     remain on their approved work schedule for not less than four (4) pay periods except in rare
     instances to accommodate extreme hardship reasons when work conditions permit. Changes
     to schedules should be held to a minimum and approved only for valid reasons.
     2.4. All individual sections will be responsible for developing and maintaining alternate
     work schedules sufficient to ensure organizational coverage Monday through Friday.
     Combinations of FWS, GS and CWS may be implemented within the same branch/division if
     administrative capabilities exist and implementation of both work schedules would not create
     an unmanageable situation that would cause an adverse impact on mission accomplishment.
     The ―organizational unit‖ as a whole will remain open for business for five (5) calendar days
     per workweek, Monday through Friday, except in individual sections authorized to operate
     only four (4) days by the employer.
     2.5. In order to provide flexibility sufficient to ensure fair results and meet the needs of the
     organization, should changes to employees/sections alternate work schedules be made
     without his/her agreement, the employee may grieve the changes.
     2.6. Nothing in the 911 AW AWS Program represents nor is intended as a relinquishment of
     any management right. Management retains the right to:
        2.6.1. Determine the number and kinds of employees on duty during hours/days of any
        given day or pay period to ensure that essential work is accomplished.
        2.6.2. Exempt from the FWS, GS or CWS, any employee or groups of employees.
        2.6.3. Restrict an employee’s choice of days off if it would have an adverse impact to
        mission accomplishment.
     2.7. An alternate work schedule may be withdrawn or altered by the immediate supervisor to
     meet organizational/mission requirements or due to employee abuse. Upon request,
     justification for the change will be in writing and provided to the employee.
3. Duty Hours: CORE HOURS                                     FLEXIBLE BAND
911AWI36-801 4 MAY 2011                                                                          3


0900          1500                           0600               1930
   3.1. Core hours are defined as those hours during each workday that an employee on AWS
   must be present for duty or in an approved leave status. AWS core hours will be 0900-1500,
   Monday through Friday. All employees including those on FWS, Gliding or CWS, must be
   present for work or on approved leave during these core hours.
   3.2. The flexible band (bandwith) reflects the earliest start time and latest ending time for an
   employee’s normal duty day. An employee may start as early as 0600 or any time thereafter
   until 0900 in quarter-hour increments and must end the normal duty day by 1930.
   3.3. Lunch Period – A 30 minute minimum lunch period is required for all employees
   working six (6) consecutive hours. Lunch period must be scheduled between the hours of
   1100 and 1300 and may range from 30 minutes to a maximum of two hours. Lunch periods
   for employees on a Compressed Work Schedule (CWS) and Flexitour (FWS) must be fixed.
   Lunch periods for employees on a Gliding Schedule FWS may vary but must fall within the
   1100-1300 time frame. Lunch periods on any work schedule will not be taken at the end of
   the workday in order to shorten the duty day.
   3.4. Administrative Leave/Excused Absence – In order to minimize the problem of
   determining how much excused absence should be granted to employees on an Alternate
   Work Schedule, parties agree that determination of the amount of time should be retained by
   the Employer to be based on various conditions and situations. For employees on a Flexitour
   or CWS: in determining the amount of excused absence for voting, donating blood, or bad
   weather, use the employee’s regularly scheduled arrival time. For employees on a Gliding
   Schedule rules will be suspended. All employees will compute their start time from 0730
   and end the workday at 1600. In the case of bad weather when the base opening is delayed,
   employees on FWS, GS or CWS will report to work at the same specified time as other
   employees unless that specified time is before their normal report time. Employees who are
   sent home early because of weather will leave at the designated time. (Reference AFI 36-
   815, Absence and Leave)
   3.5. Holiday Pay/Leave: When required to perform actual work on a holiday, employees
   will be paid holiday pay for the number of hours normally scheduled to work on that
   particular day. When required to perform work on a holiday the employee is entitled to
   holiday leave for the same number of hours they are normally scheduled to work that day.
   3.6. Annual/Sick Leave: Employees will be charged for the number of hours, in quarter
   hour increments, normally scheduled to work on a particular day.
   3.7. Premium pay for overtime work shall not apply to the hours that constitute a
   FWS/CWS. Hours worked in excess of the FWS/CWS shall be overtime/compensatory
   hours and shall be governed by applicable regulations.
   3.8. An employee on any schedule who performs work on a holiday is entitled to pay at a
   rate of basic pay, plus premium pay, at a rate equal to the basic pay rate, for work that is not
   in excess of the basic work requirement. For hours worked on a holiday in excess of the
   basic work requirement, the employee is entitled to overtime pay in accordance with
   applicable regulations.
 4                                                                  911AWI36-801 4 MAY 2011


     3.9. Combinations of FWS, GS and CWS are not authorized for an individual employee.
     For example, an employee on FWS may not consistently work credit hours in order to use
     those credit hours to take the same day off each week or the same day off every other week.
     Such a practice constitutes a CWS and must be requested and approved as such.
     3.10. Employees required to work the 2nd shift or uncommon tour of duty (days required to
     support Reserve weekend missions) will revert back to their normal schedule after
     completion of the 2nd shift or uncommon tour of duty.
     3.11. If mission dictates, the supervisor may request an employee change their approved
     schedule. Volunteers will be solicited and, should no one volunteer, employees with the least
     amount of total creditable service (Service Computation Date leave) will be required to
     change their schedule. The maximum possible advance notice will be given to all
     employees.
4. Flexible Work Schedule (FWS): The FWS available to employees at the 911th Airlift Wing
is called the Flexitour FWS. Flexitour is a schedule consisting of eight (8) hours per day, five (5)
days per week that allows an employee to select starting and stopping times, requiring
supervisory approval, within the established bandwidth described in paragraph 3.2 of this
publication. Once selected, the hours are fixed until the employee submits a change to their
work schedule. For example: An employee may choose to begin work on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday at 0700, and choose to begin work on Tuesday and Thursday at 0800. This employee
may not choose to arrive at 0800 on Monday without taking some type of approved leave from
0700 to 0800. Likewise, the employee would be eligible to earn one (1) credit hour, with
supervisory approval, if he/she reported to work at 0700 on Tuesday since the approved, fixed
work schedule states the duty day on Tuesday begins at 0800.
     4.1. Eligible employees who desire to participate in the Flexitour program may begin the
     workday at 0600 or anytime thereafter on half hour increments, but must be on duty or leave
     status during the core hours of 0900-1500 hours.
     4.2. Credit Hours – Hours in excess of the employee’s scheduled workday. Credit hours
     may only be earned by an employee on the FWS (not the CWS). Credit hours are performed
     voluntarily at the employee’s option but must have supervisory approval.
        4.2.1. Credit hours may not be earned for travel or for training. These events are not
        considered voluntary in nature and therefore do not meet the definition of credit hours.
        4.2.2. There is no limit on the total number of credit hours that may be accumulated and
        used during the pay period. However, a full-time employee cannot carry more than 24
        credit hours from one pay period to the next. Documentation of credit hours will be
        maintained by the supervisor. It is the employee/supervisor’s responsibility to zero out
        any credit hours prior to employee transfer, termination, etc.
        4.2.3. The use of credit hours, like annual leave, will be scheduled by the employee in
        advance. Credit hours must be earned before used. Final approval for use of credit hours
        is up to the supervisor based on mission needs. Credit hours are to be counted as part of
        the basic work requirement to which they are applied. Credit hours may not be used by
        an employee to increase his or her entitlement to overtime pay.
911AWI36-801 4 MAY 2011                                                                          5


       4.2.4. The manager/supervisor has the choice of using Attachment 2, Daily Attendance
       Sheet or a supervisory time log for employees on the flexitour FWS. Those on
       permanent shifts (i.e. 4 ten-hour days, 5-4-9 schedule, or the standard 5 eight-hour days)
       will not be required to sign in and sign out.
       4.2.5. When an employee is no longer subject to a FWS program, the employee must be
       paid for accumulated credit hours at his or her current rate of pay. Payment for
       accumulated credit hours is limited to not more than 24 hours for a full time employee
       and for a part time employee, not more than one-quarter of the employee’s biweekly
       work requirement. An employee may not be paid Sunday pay or holiday pay for credit
       hours.
   4.3. Overtime hours for employees under FWS programs are all hours of work in excess of
   eight in one day or forty in one week, which are officially ordered in advance by
   management. The requirement that overtime hours be officially ordered in advance also
   applies to non-exempt employees under Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
5. Gliding Schedule is a schedule consisting of eight (8) hour days, five (5) days per week
that allows employees to vary their arrival and departure times within flexible time bands
on a day-to-day basis.
   5.1. Arrival and Departure Times:
       5.1.1. Morning Flexible Hours: 0600-0900. Employees may begin their workday
       according to their own preference within these hours.
       5.1.2. Afternoon Flexible Hours: 1500-1930. Employees may select their own departure
       time within these hours after the daily work requirement is completed unless ordered to
       perform overtime work.
   5.2. Supervisors may establish methods to track employee arrival and departure times. The
   Daily Attendance Sheet at Attachment 2 of this publication may be used for this purpose.
   5.3. Supervisors must ensure that adequate coverage is provided during the hours of 0730-
   1600 to ensure accomplishment of the mission and that customer service and overall office
   efficiencies are not affected by employees’ participation in a Gliding Schedule. Employees
   will still be held responsible for ensuring their reporting times adhere to established customer
   service hours of operation.
   5.4. Participation in the Gliding Schedule must not become incompatible with the proper
   performance of employees’ duties or with efficient accomplishment of the workload
   commitments of their organization.
   5.5. On days when a delayed arrival is announced because of hazardous weather, the Gliding
   Schedule rules will be suspended. Employees will compute their start time from 0730. The
   end of the workday will be 1600 for employees on the Gliding Schedule.
6. Compressed Work Schedule: The CWS is a fixed work schedule that allows employees to
fulfill their basic workweek requirement in fewer than 10 days during a biweekly pay period.
The regularly scheduled day off under the CWS program is referred to as Scheduled Day Off
(SDO).
6                                                               911AWI36-801 4 MAY 2011


    6.1. Employees must choose between two CWS schedules. The eight day CWS consists of
    eight 10-hour days per pay period with one day off every week. The nine day CWS consists
    of eight 9-hour days and one 8-hour day per pay period with one day off every other week.
    6.2. Eligible employees who desire to participate in the CWS program must be on duty or
    appropriate leave during the core hours of 0900-1500 hours. In addition, the scheduled
    workday will not begin earlier than 0600.
    6.3. Credit Hours:   There is no provision for credit hours under a Compressed Work
    Schedule program.
    6.4. Temporary Duty (TDY) or Training: When an employee is TDY or attends training it
    may be necessary to revert to an 8-hour workday for the pay period and upon return from
    training or TDY, revert back to the original CWS. The alternate work schedule request form
    should be completed to document the change in work schedule to accommodate training or
    TDY.
    6.5. Holidays and Scheduled Days Off (SDOs): When the holiday falls on the non-workday
    designated as the ―in lieu of‖ Sunday, observe the next regularly scheduled workday as a
    holiday. When a holiday or designated observed day falls on an employee’s non-workday
    (Monday through Saturday), the workday immediately preceding the day is observed as a
    holiday.
    6.6. Overtime hours for employees under CWS programs are all hours of work in excess of
    the number of hours normally scheduled to work on a particular day (8, 9 or 10), which are
    officially ordered in advance by management. The requirement that overtime hours be
    officially ordered in advance also applies to non-exempt employees under FLSA.
