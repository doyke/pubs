          Uses positive instructional techniques. Figure 1.1 lists available instructor training
           aids on loan from local sources to meet this requirement. You don't need to retain
           these training aids in the Financial analysis office file.
          Carefully plan, organize, and present initial RMS training sessions to do the job.
           Because each installation is different, local training programs must be as flexible as

                                           Chapter 2

              PREPARING AND EXECUTING THE FINANCIAL PLAN (FP)

2.1. Issuing the Budget Call.      SAF/FMB will issue annual instructions for preparing and
submitting the Financial Plan.
   2.1.1. In the Budget Call, SAF/FMB will provide:
          Two levels of funding: a Part I funded level that equals the planning number
           provided with the call instructions; and a Part II unfunded level that includes all
           requirements exceeding the planning number. (See Attachment 4).
          Special guidance and instructions, including mechanized submission.
   2.1.2. Major commands (MAJCOM) and field operating agencies (FOA) may supplement
   the SAF/FMBO call with their own specific instructions.
2.2. Balancing the Program. Carefully distribute Part I of the FP, using the HQ USAF-
provided planning targets. Consolidate requirements from each RC to form the total requirement
and a balanced program.
      Test your Part I distributions. Assume you will get no amount higher than Part I to carry
       out new fiscal year's mission; then determine if you can accomplish the mission without
       additional funds.
      Determine if the current funding distribution will produce a higher level of mission
       accomplishment than any other possible distribution. Reconsider your Part I distribution
       if it doesn't meet this criterion.
2.3. Enhancing Flexibility and Credibility. Give commanders and managers at all levels
considerable flexibility in distributing Part I anticipated funding. Each manager should have the
chance to plan using next year's tentative funding to best accomplish the organization's mission.
If necessary, commanders should recommend program changes (e.g., flying hours, manpower
authorizations, equipment authorizations, or organization) for Headquarters US Air Force (HQ
USAF) approval. Usually, the next higher level of review will approve credible distribution
plans. Expect changes or disapproval if you put higher priority needs in Part II.
2.4. Reviewing the Financial Plan (MAJCOM). Installations and units complete their FPs
on request and forward them to their MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will:
      Review installation program and cost data.
      Determine the validity of the Part I distribution and Part II requirements as well as
       conformity to MAJCOM instructions.
      Review and validate installation and unit submissions, consolidate the results, and submit
       the command financial plan to HQ USAF.
2.5. Reviewing the Financial Plan (HQ USAF).        HQ USAF will:
 12                                        AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


      Correlate the total amounts approved for field commanders with the anticipated amounts
       appropriated by Congress. (Congress normally holds hearings on the President's Budget
       between January and April.)
      Adjust the FP using the latest program guidance.
      Send the command next year's initial planning targets by 30 September.
2.6. Issuing and Updating Operating Budget Authority (OBA) Documents. HQ USAF
will provide funding documents (OBA) to MAJCOMs several times each year to show and
explain changes from the initial operating program. (The OBA document shows the official
obligation and expense authority on AF Form 1449, Operating Budget Authority, or a
mechanized equivalent. Accompanying the OBA is an optional listing showing the authority by
program element, DoD element of expense, and "when issued." This listing is for the
information of the command or unit.) HQ USAF narrative guidance explains reasons for
significant markups or markdowns to fund requests and identifies imposed limitations (floors and
ceilings). MAJCOMs will:
      Reprogram annual obligation authority within budget activity (BA) consistent with
       limitations stated in the OBA document. For example, you may reprogram quarterly
       direct obligation authority between BAs provided no quarterly program exceeds the
       corresponding annual BA authority.
      Notify higher headquarters of significant changes in fund distribution along with an
       explanation on when and why plans changed.
2.7. Executing the Annual Budget. Air Force activities may begin incurring obligations
when SAF/FMB issues budget authority. SAF/FMB will issue OBA documents when Congress
enacts the DoD appropriations. When Congress hasn't passed the new fiscal year's
Appropriation Act by the start of the new fiscal year, SAF/FMB will provide interim guidance
(usually based on Congressional passage of Continuing Resolution Authority, which allows DoD
activities to spend money pending passage of the DoD Appropriations Act).
2.8. Reporting Monthly and Quarterly Status. HQ USAF requires a monthly report from
each command, RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE, Status of Funds Data Base Transmission Report,
that shows current year-to-date expenses, obligations, commitments, and prior year data.
Commands and bases will analyze these reports for lags or accelerations in planned programs.
(See Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 for reports available to base-level managers.) SAF/FMB may
require explanations when commands are ahead of or behind schedule.
2.9. Closeout Procedures and Closeout Report.          In managing Air Force funds, we want to:
      Use available funds most effectively for recognized operational needs.
      Ensure all obligations recorded by 30 September are valid, so we don't lose funds because
       of administrative errors.
      Aim to close out as successfully as possible.
   2.9.1. Closeout Procedures. SAF/FMB issues yearend closeout instructions and guidance
   to MAJCOMs (and FOAs). Usually, MAJCOMs will issue their own instructions covering
   standard closeout actions. In addition, each base has its own closeout checklist of required
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                         13


   actions. SAF/FMB has not established a single set of Air Force closeout procedures because
   each MAJCOM is different. MAJCOMs usually will:
          Appoint a special closeout officer and request each base appoint a closeout point of
           contact.
          Establish a schedule of events with specific deadline dates.
          Send special messages to bases with additional guidance or requesting additional
           information and reports when needed.
          Send special interest messages that deal with specific projects or programs (Stock
           Fund, Medical, Military Family Housing, etc.).
   2.9.2. Closeout Report. A financial plan mainly shows how a user intends to accomplish
   a program and use the provided commitment and obligation authority. Analyze how well the
   user did in the closeout report. Provide:
          Reasons for actual performance differing substantially from planned performance.
          Reviews to compare actual fiscal year accomplishments to projections and measure
           the effective use of total OBA.
2.10. Managing Air Force Resources. Command and base personnel need to know specific
actions for administering the financial management program. Other chapters of this AFI cover
certain technical procedures; e.g., computing expense and obligation authority, making inputs to
accounting and finance, etc. Apply the following administrative procedures (not mandatory nor
all-inclusive) for good management at command and base-level:
      Fix responsibility when possible. The commander is ultimately responsible for
       formulating and executing the financial plan. Identify other managers with their specific
       financial management responsibilities (e.g., the civil engineer with real property
       maintenance and repair, the transportation officer with vehicle and transportation
       requirements). Identify corollary offices of responsibility (e.g., aircraft maintenance
       requirements based on the flying hours that Operations manages). Establishes a Financial
       Working Group (FWG) and Financial Management Board (FMB) to review FPs.
       Confirm responsibilities in writing.
      Identify base programs and tasks.
      Price approved programs by responsibility center, program element, and budget activity.
      Have the FWG review and FMB approve the priced program.
      Write defensible and concise narrative justification for the FP to explain why you need
       the funds.
      Evaluate and advise the commander and staff on the approved obligation authority.
       Highlight the funding level effects on base mission. (See Chapter 6 for additional
       details.)
      Present the recommended funding distribution to the FWG.
 14                                       AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


      Present the FWG's recommended funding distribution to the FMB and commander for
       approval.
      Use the FMB's and commander's assessment of priorities to distribute the expense and
       obligation authority to the responsibility centers. (See Chapter 6).
      Establish procedures, with the commander's guidance, to buy the highest priority goods
       and services within the available obligation authority.
      Review and analyze reports that compare actual expenses and obligations with
       established targets. (See Chapter 9).
      Meet with resource advisors and responsibility center managers frequently to discuss
       problems and propose solutions. Brief the FMB and commander on the status of funds,
       including reasons for variances between actual and planned performance.
      Ensure that the financial analysis office, resource advisors, and responsibility center
       managers immediately followup to correct fund imbalances.
2.11. Administering Management Control Points:
   2.11.1. Cost Center (CC).       This organization gathers and distributes cost data. The cost
   center manager:
          Regulates the daily use of workhours, supplies, equipment, and services in producing
           or doing things.
          Continually monitors the relationship between resources used and products produced
           to allow for informed resource realignments.
   2.11.2. The Responsibility Center Manager (RCM). The RCM normally heads an
   organization that plans, organizes, directs, and coordinates activities of subordinate
   organizations and functions. RC managers are the principal level that manages financial
   resources. The RC manager:
          Directs work by subordinate functions (usually, CCs) that, in turn, use resources to do
           that work.
          Appoints a resource advisor (usually at the squadron or group organizational level) to
           oversee technical details of operations relating to resource use.
   2.11.3. Resource Advisors.      The resource advisor:
          Participates actively in resource management, including the planning, programming,
           budgeting, acquiring, consuming, storing, and disposing of resources.
          Is directly responsible to the RCM.
2.12. Establishing Review Committees. Achieve participatory management by establishing
financial committees (Financial Working Group and Financial Management Board) at each level
of command to review estimates and create and carry out budgets. Designate required
membership for each committee. MAJCOMs may waive establishing the FWG where, due to
the organization's size, both committees would have essentially the same membership.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                    15


   2.12.1. The Comptroller or the financial analysis officer chairs the Financial Working
   Group (FWG) and designates appropriate resource advisors and other members to comprise
   the FWG. The FWG:
          Reviews program and cost factors, compares actuals with prior year costs, reviews
           justifications, periodically evaluates performance against estimates, and submits a
           recommended financial plan to the FMB.
          Maintains FWG minutes for higher authority review.
          Meets when needed to support the FMB.
   2.12.2. The Financial Management Board (FMB) is the senior advisory committee. The
   Commander or the Deputy Commander chairs the committee. Group commander level
   members and the Comptroller (at installations), Directors, and special staffs (at commands)
   comprise the membership.
          The FMB approves budgets, financial plans, and revisions. The FMB also distributes
           the annual funding, establishes priorities, and ensures consistency with programs and
           missions.
          FMB approval represents the final, approved installation or command budget
           submitted to higher command and the final distribution of funds received from higher
           command.
          The chairperson calls FMB meetings. The FMB retains minutes for review by higher
           authority.
2.13. Preparing Data for Review Authorities. Provide the material to the members of the
FMB and FWG for their review prior to the formal session. The financial analysis officer:
      In formulating the budget, consolidates separate RC estimates for the appropriate
       committee review.
      In distributing the approved financial plan, prepares a comparative analysis of financial
       authority requested and received, separately identifying fixed and variable requirements.
2.14. Briefing Committees:
   2.14.1. The financial analysis officer instructs personnel how to brief the FMB and FWG
   effectively. Briefing consists of:
          Reviewing pertinent instructions in the "call" from higher headquarters.
          Reviewing how the financial plan works, including explaining Part I and Part II, and
           balancing the Part I distribution.
          Distributing suggested obligation authority, after receiving the OBA.
   2.14.2. Emphasize these points in the briefing:
          Don't put high priority requirements in Part II.
          Don't overstate budget requirements (affects your credibility).

          Be careful using prior year obligation data as it can be misleading (may include
           onetime costs). Usually future programs are different from current programs.
          Base decisions on the requirement's merit and not on the staff officer's enthusiasm (or
           dire predictions).
          Check new program's current rates of execution. Consider other factors (such as
           construction lead-time and hiring difficulties).
   2.14.3. Have program data (personnel strength, flying hours, construction programs, etc.)
   available for committee personnel for the period covered.
2.15. Controlling and Executing the OBA. Upon receiving the OBA, the installation (FWG,
FMB and commander) will establish a plan, phased by quarter for the fiscal year, that funds the
highest priority requirements. Develop a well-defined, written plan supported by command
policy and enforced by the local commander. Institute written management controls at the start
of the year to prevent waste of resources. Common management controls include:
   2.15.1. Civilian Personnel Costs.        Commander designates key executives to approve
   overtime and overhire requests. A corporate board chaired by the installation commander
   ensures that civilian resources are used most efficiently and effectively. Details are covered
   in AFI 36-502, Managing Civilian Personnel Resources.
   2.15.2. TDY Travel.     The commander designates key officials to approve TDY. Consider:
          Need for TDY travel.
          Screening requests for travel by privately owned automobile and other special
           authorizations.
          Using military transportation when available.
          Requiring military personnel and encouraging civilian personnel to use available
           government or contract quarters.
          Reviewing the number of people involved and length of TDY.
   2.15.3. Contract Services. Tightly control use of contracts. The RCM reviews existing
   contracts periodically (once a year or more) to determine if contracts still fill a need. The
   FWG screens all contracts for need during financial plan preparation.
   2.15.4. Supplies. Distribute reports from the standard base supply system to resource
   advisors and cost center managers. These reports show supply transactions and management
   indicators affecting materiel and financial resources. Monitor and analyze reports to ensure
   customers order only essential supplies in the quantities necessary to accomplish missions.
          Resource advisors, cost center managers, and RCMs must take appropriate
           management actions (including curtailing orders) to remain within authorized targets,
           when there are no additional funds.
          Strongly encourage customers to cancel supplies-on-order and turn in excess supplies
           on-hand when a valid need no longer exists (because of a mission change or other
           reasons).
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                    17


        Investigate financial management indicators (such as credit or noncredit turn-ins) that
         are abnormally high or low.
  2.15.5. Equipment. Pay attention to equipment management. This ensures you apply
  limited financing to priority requirements.
  2.15.6. Utilities.   Establish an effective Civil Engineering Utilities Conservation Program.
  2.15.7. Staff Coordination.       Managers planning operational exercises, establishing new
  logistics ideas, or initiating other special programs must coordinate with the financial
  analysis office to ensure programming and support for the planned activities.
  2.15.8. Other. Add controls when needed to manage such items as staff car use, purchase
  and rental of word processors and photocopiers, base bus routes, use of ground vehicle fuels,
  and rental of mobile equipment, etc.

                                           Chapter 3

                            ISSUING AND DISTRIBUTING OBAS

3.1. Overview.       Apply this chapter in distributing Military Personnel and Operation and
Maintenance O&M appropriation fund authorities. Refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, for other
appropriations. See AFPD 65-6 for Air Force policy on providing optimum funding flexibility at
all levels and controlling Operating Budget Authority (OBA) amounts so they don't exceed the
authority received by the issuing activity. When issuing OBAs, SAF/FMB and subordinate
levels will identify restrictions imposed by the legislative and executive branches of the
government and by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Subordinate activities must ensure
that the OBAs you issue are consistent with the budget authority received with regard to funding
classifications and limitations.
3.2. Controlling Yearend Spending. Don't spend financial resources at the end of a fiscal
year merely because they are available. Identify and report unused financial resources (e.g., from
savings, program slippages, or other causes) to higher headquarters for possible withdrawal.
Notify your headquarters in time to permit using the funds for higher priority mission
requirements.
3.3. Issuing OBAs (HQ USAF):
   3.3.1. SAF/FMBO will issue Operation and Maintenance OBAs for the current fiscal year:
          On AF Form 1449 (or a mechanized equivalent).
          At the budget activity level.
          For direct funding authority.
   3.3.2. SAF/FMBOP will issue a centrally managed OBA to operating agency code (OAC)
   48 for military personnel expenses.
          DFAS-DE (OAC 45) will automatically load availability authority into the Air Force
           accounting system and report on military personnel expenses incurred at standard
           rates.
          Installations won't receive OBAs for military personnel expenses but must report
           expenses (computed at standard rates) through the data base transfer report. (See
           Chapter 8 for information on military personnel expenses.)
   3.3.3. Continue to comply with prior fiscal year OBAs, including any limitations. Prior year
   OBAs remain in effect as separate documents until the account expires. Don't obligate
   unused prior year obligation authority to fund current year obligations; you may use it for
   prior year obligation adjustments. (See DFAS-DE Regulation 170-8 and AFI 65-601, Vol 1.)
3.4. Issuing OBAs (MAJCOMs). Upon receipt of an OBA from SAF/FMB, MAJCOMs will
subdivide the OBA to installations. Include the same content as the OBA received. Comply
with objectives in paragraph 3.1. MAJCOMs that centrally monitor reimbursable programs will
structure installation OBA documents accordingly.
3.5. Distributing OBAs at Installation Level:
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                   19


   3.5.1. Upon receipt of an OBA at installation level (the ultimate user), the installation
   distributes the OBA to maintain control on legal limitations, to ensure use according to the
   approved OBA, and to provide for local management requirements. The financial analysis
   office or financial services office loads the OBA distribution or subdivision into the
   accounting data base. (See OBA loading in Chapter 6).
   3.5.2. Installations sometimes finance subordinate units (for example, a group, squadron,
   detachment) located on or near another installation. Issue financing on AF Form 616, Fund
   Cite Authorization. When the tenant is large or it's impractical to use AF Form 616, the
   parent command issues the host base an OBA for the tenant's funding requirements.
3.6. Distributing Tenant OBAs.         The installation distributes OBAs received for tenant
organization support in the same manner it distributes its own OBA. Follow responsibilities
assigned in the host-tenant agreement.
      When the tenant does its own budget function, the tenant will distribute or load the
       budgeted amounts. If the tenant has no budget capability, the host's Financial Analysis
       Office or Financial Services Accounting Office will load the tenant's approved OBA.
      The organization issuing the tenant's OBA will attach their requested distribution by
       program element and major RC.
 20                                       AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


                                          Chapter 4

          ADMINISTERING TARGETS, LIMITATIONS, AND OBA CONTROLS

4.1. Complying With Targets and Limitations In Operating Budget Authorities:
   4.1.1. Follow official policies on administrative control of OBAs in DFAS-DE Regulation
   177-16, Administrative Control of Appropriations, and included on your OBA document.
   SAF/FMB will issue the total OBA consistent regarding classifications, authorities, and
   constraints with the total OBA received from OSD. Operating agencies below HQ USAF
   level must ensure the same consistency between OBAs issued by them with those received
   from SAF/FMB. All activities must comply with two basic types of restrictions. Don't
   exceed:
          The rigid restrictions subject to AFR (DFAS-DE) 177-16.
          Targets or advisory guides.
      4.1.1.1. Limitations. These are subject to the fund control requirements of Title 31 of
      the United States Code and AFR (DFAS-DE) 177-16, and include limitations imposed by
      statute and any absolute restriction imposed administratively that modifies or restricts the
      terms of fund authorizations. You must report any violation of these limitations.
      4.1.1.2. Targets. Don't exceed a target without the issuing agency's prior approval. If
      you discover a target variance, notify the issuing authority in writing immediately.
   4.1.2. Recipients who reissue OBAs to a lower level may not remove or add to restrictions
   in the documents they receive. Refer to the OBA document for specific information on legal
   limitations and targets.
      4.1.2.1. Annual direct O&M authority by Budget Activity (BA) for a particular fiscal
      year is a legal limitation under Title 31.
              You can reprogram quarterly authority between BAs during the first three
               quarters of the FY as long as you don't exceed the annual authority by BA.
              During the 4th quarter, you may not exceed the total funding in each BA (it must
               equal the amount shown on the funding document received from higher
               headquarters).
      4.1.2.2. The O&M reimbursable program is an annual program for the appropriation.
      Earned reimbursements that exceed the authorized annual reimbursable program
      automatically increase the reimbursement program or total obligation authority. (See AFI
      65-601, Volume 1, for appropriation reimbursement procedures.)
      4.1.2.3. Activities may not exceed the total O&M authority for a particular fiscal year (it
      is a legal limitation under Title 31 U.S.C. on a cumulative quarterly basis).
      4.1.2.4. Within the O&M total direct obligation authority, comply with the following
      legal limitations:
              Contingencies (ceiling).
              Line item limitations.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                     21


              Don't exceed any other limitation without prior approval from the issuing
               authority. (The issuer will identify these legal limitations on the OBA document.)
4.2. Administering Controls:
   4.2.1. SAF/FMB and MAJCOMs, as applicable, will issue each field activity an OBA
   document that identifies the (O&M) direct obligation authority.
   4.2.2. The total O&M obligation authority is subject to precertification procedures. Comply
   with modified commitment accounting procedures for O&M appropriations in AFR (DFAS-
   DE) 170-13 to preclude violating cumulative quarterly obligation authority shown on the
   OBA document.
          Financial Services Officers (FSO) must not certify availability of funds for more than
           cumulative quarterly obligation authority.
          For certifying funds beyond the cumulative quarterly obligation authority, see AFR
           (DFAS-DE) 170-13.
   4.2.3. All personnel authorized to certify the availability of funds, to commit funds, to
   authorize or incur obligations, or to spend Air Force funds, must be familiar with AFR
   (DFAS-DE) 177-16.
4.3. Administering Targets and Limitations in Other Appropriations. Air Force activities
manage and control other appropriations by issuing budget authorizations, allocations,
suballocations, allotments, and suballotments.
      The issuer will clearly identify each specific limitation (imposed by the legislative and
       executive branches of the Federal Government, the Department of Defense, and the
       Department of the Air Force) on the "Limitation" portion of the allocation document.
      Recipients issuing budget authorizations, suballocations, allotments, or suballotments
       may not remove nor add to restrictions in the documents.

                                           Chapter 5

       LOADING THE OPERATING BUDGET AUTHORITY INTO THE GENERAL
                  ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR OPERATIONS

5.1. Using the OBA and OBA Document. Funds issuers use OBAs to transfer authority to
incur obligations and expenses to subordinate units and to provides the basis for fiscal control
required by law. HQ USAF (SAF/FMB):
      Issues the OBA from HQ USAF-held appropriations to each major command
       (MAJCOM) and field operating agency (FOA) on an AF Form 1449, Operating Budget
       Authority, or a mechanized equivalent. The OBA provides the annual operating budget
       authority and the phased quarterly obligation authority in three distinct categories:
          Direct Authority by Budget Activity (BA). Provides authority to incur expenses and
           obligations for each BA, subject to the restrictions and qualifications written on the
           document and in AFR (DFAS-DE) 177-16. Each BA identifies financial resources as
           follows: Operation and Maintenance expense, other obligation, and expense
           authority.
          Total Direct Program. The sum of all BAs identified by the same subdivisions as in
           Direct Authority by Budget Activity.
          Total Operating Budget.
      Issues only direct obligation and expense authority.
      Loads reimbursement authority to match the earned reimbursements. An approved OBA
       constitutes the fund authority granted to the operating level.
5.2. Computing Total Authority To Load. Usually, issuers will provide OBA document
authorities in the same format as the general accounting system data base fund summary records
(FSR). Activities receiving OBAs will:
      Load expense and obligation authority to provide targets for tracking expenses and
       obligations plus provide limitations for appropriate fund control.
      Prepare and load target distribution by responsibility center or cost center (RC or CC) and
       element of expense investment code (EEIC).
5.3. Relating OBA Document Amounts and Computer Records. The current fiscal year
OBA document shows current year expense and obligation authority for O&M. Load detail fund
targets into the general accounting system data base program summary records (PSRS) for the
current year and 5 prior years. (Keep in mind that obligation authority for prior year undelivered
orders outstanding carryover is in the OBA document for the applicable prior fiscal year, not on
the current fiscal year OBA document.)
   5.3.1. Fund Type Codes. DFAS-DE Regulation 177-370 lists all applicable fund type
   codes for the general accounting system. But, the examples for loading the OBA used in this
   chapter show only the two fund type codes pertaining to the (3400) appropriation: fund type
   L (direct obligation authority and total actual authority) plus fund type M (reimbursement
   authority).
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                      23


   5.3.2. Handling Current Year Authorities and Records. Load authority pertaining to
   current operating budget year and current fiscal year (COBY/CFY) in OBA documents to
   COBY/CFY records. Examples for FY 94 are COBY=4 and CFY=4.
          Combine direct and reimbursable authorities for each BA. Load by RC/CC and EEIC
           to fund type L records without sales code and to fund type L records with a sale code
           when loading the obligation as an undelivered order outstanding with a corresponding
           reimbursable account entry (payroll-only excluded).
          Load reimbursable authority by BA, RC/CC, EEIC, and SC so that type M fund
           records match earned reimbursements.
   5.3.3. Handling Prior Year Authorities and Records. On the first day of the fiscal year,
   the general accounting system computer yearend conversion procedures programmatically
   remove (from prior operating budget year and prior fiscal year (POBY/PFY) accounts) the
   PFY obligation authority obligated as undelivered orders outstanding on record as of the last
   day of the PFY.
          Record this amount in the COBY/PFY accounts. Also establish and adjust all other
           POBY and PFY authorities by the yearend conversion program.
          Combine recorded amounts manually to determine correctness of load for PFY
           authorities because of the split of PFY obligation authority, COBY/PFY and
           POBY/PFY. Make adjustments to the PFY as needed.
5.4. Distributing OBA Document Authority. Upon receiving the OBA Document, the
Financial Working Group and the financial analysis office recommend distributions of quarterly
and annual authority for Financial Management Board approval. Objectives are to:
      Establish OBA targets at the responsibility center (RC) manager level.
      Target certain special activities (tenants and common expense accounts) at five digit cost
       centers (CC) or six-digit cost account level.
      Establish targets at organization points where management makes decisions.
      Align amounts with the squadron or comparable level RC (usual practice). Targeting at
       the fifth or sixth digit level of the RC/CC rarely assists in managing funds and produces
       much unnecessary work.
      Load targets at the RC/CC level required to maintain program element identification and
       to support other command directed action.
5.5. Loading Targets in the General Accounting System. Usually you will use AF Form
1269, Request for Load or Change in Fund Targets, to load annual and quarterly OBA targets
into the base-level general accounting system. Use AF Form 1269 to transmit quarterly and
annual obligation authority fund targets. Send data to the Financial Services Accounting Liaison
Office for entry into the accounting system records. Optional procedures:
      Financial analysis office may enter fund target load data directly into the accounting data
       base through a remote computer terminal, when mutually agreed between the Financial
       Analysis Officer and Financial Services Officer.
 24                                      AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


      Use local or command forms instead of the AF Form 1269 to satisfy unique
       requirements. (See DFAS-DE Regulation 177-206 and DFAS-DE Regulation 177-370
       for AF Form 1269 instructions.)
5.6. Loading Targets in the Base Supply System. Load detailed fund targets into the standard
base supply system (SBSS) and Medical Materiel Accounting System (MMAS) by organization
cost center records (OCCR) and project fund manager records (PFMR). Do this for purchases of
supplies and equipment from the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) for the current
operating year.
   5.6.1. Use AF Form 1269 to properly monitor and control requests establishing or changing
   supply and equipment fund targets loaded in OCCRs and PFMRs. This is the source
   document to establish, increase, or decrease PFMR and OCCR fund targets that authorize
   purchases from the DBOF. Use local or command forms instead of AF Form 1269 when
   needed to satisfy unique requirements (provided both FMA and FSO agree).
   5.6.2. The financial analysis office (FAO) or resource advisor (as established by MAJCOM
   or local procedures) prepares the AF Form 1269. The person who prepares the form signs in
   the "Remarks" section and adds his or her routing symbol and telephone number.
          The FAO makes sure the AF Form 1269 is correct.
          Have the analyst who checks the form sign in the "FMA Approved By" block to show
           the FAO review and approval.
          Forward the original and one copy to Financial Services Accounting after the FAO
           approves AF Form 1269.
       5.6.2.1. Financial Services Accounting Liaison office loads the targets into the general
       accounting system computer, the MMAS, or SBSS. They maintain the originals on file
       until completion of the applicable fiscal year.
   5.6.3. Use the automated MMAS and the SBSS to control and monitor supply and
   equipment fund targets.
          The MMAS accumulates and provides financial data for all medical and dental supply
           and equipment accounts.
          MMAS establishes and maintains PFMR and OCCR fund targets for purchases of all
           medical-dental supplies and equipment.

                              DATA ELEMENTS AND CODES

6.1. Overview. This chapter provides source references for data elements and account codes
used in budget and financial management.
6.2. Using Data Elements. See Figure 6.1 for data elements commonly used in financial
analysis.
      Use these codes, as appropriate, to program, budget, and account for appropriations used
       by Air Force activities.
      Each command or operating agency provides subordinate units with the data elements
       authorized for use in budgeting and accounting for funds they administer.
      At base level, the financial analysis and accounting offices jointly ensure proper use of
       those data elements authorized by the funding command or operating agency.
      See AFR (DFAS-DE) 170-5 for instructions related to assigning responsibility center or
       cost center (RC/CC) codes. MAJCOMs provide all funded units information about these
       codes.
      See AFI 65-601, Volume 2, for annual appropriation symbols, budget codes and
       descriptions.
6.3. Using the Account Structure. See Attachment 5 for examples of typical accounting
classification account structures. These examples will help you determine the accounting
classification (sometimes called a fund cite) required on commitment and obligating documents.
      For Air Force tenant transactions, the host's accounting and finance office will use the
       tenant's parent command RC/CC codes. When required to segregate costs of host base
       and tenant units, use the alpha major command identity code for the first digit of the
       tenant cost center.
      Refer to DFAS-DE Regulation 177-120 for examples of central procurement accounting
       classifications used for Air Force Contract Management Division (AFCMD) and Defense
       Contract Administration Services Region (DCASR) transactions.

7.1. Using These Ledgers. Use these ledgers to summarize accounting records kept in the
computer that stores general accounting and finance data and to provide the fund's status as of
the current date or as of the previous end-of-month. There are two separate products: (1)
Operating Budget Ledger (OBL) for operating budget accounts (fund types L and M); (2)
Allotment Ledger for other appropriations and other reimbursement accounts (all fund types
except L and M). Each has several report options (see Attachment 7).
   7.1.1. The ledgers provide detailed, special, and summary data on various accounts or types
   of funds. The Financial Services Office (FSO) Accounting liaison will determine the detail
   volume, the summation amount, and the number of accounts from the Communications
   Squadron.
          To show status, include both the FY obligation controls at various levels and the
           OBY expense tracking at summary level for operating budget accounts.
          Use amounts shown on the ledger to analyze obligation and expense accounts and to
           verify fund availability.
   7.1.2. The ledgers using the "Detail" option provide accounting indicative data, including
   Fund Summary Review (FSR) and Program Summary Review (PSR) addresses. Use this
   information inquiring on the computer and preparing budget target loads, and when
   analyzing expense and obligation rates.
7.2. Frequency. The Financial Services Accounting Liaison office requests the OBL or the
allotment ledger when required by the Financial Services Office (FSO) or Budget. Budget and
FSO will jointly determine the frequency of the lists. For effective management and to decrease
printed output and computer use time, don't ask for unnecessary reports (detail or summary).
      Limit the product only to needed options or accounts. Request only the portions and
       options required to manage funds or to review and correct accounting records.
      You may request the OBL, the allotment ledger, or both ledgers simultaneously. In
       addition, you may request a listing of the special totals for the OBL fund status, allotment
       ledger, or both ledgers. the normal "Detail" OBL and allotment ledger automatically
       provides special totals.
7.3. Loading Annual and Quarterly Authorities. Load targets correctly and promptly into the
FSO records.
      Load annual and quarterly obligation authority targets to current fiscal year (CFY) or
       current operating budget year (COBY). column headings on the OBL are FY and OY,
       respectively.
      Programmatically enter targets to cover undelivered orders outstanding (UOO) carried
       over into the CFY through yearend conversion procedures (see Chapter 6).

  7.3.1. Budget establishes certification and reprogramming levels and tells the FSO. These
  levels are budget activity (BA), program element code (PEC), special element of expense
  investment code (EEIC), or imposed limitation (floors, ceilings, and fences).
  7.3.2. The ledgers show the authorities on a cumulative basis and compare them with actual
  obligations to determine the amount available for obligation by fiscal year (FY).

                                            Chapter 8

       ADMINISTERING, EXPENSING AND REPORTING MILITARY PERSONNEL
                                 COSTS

8.1. Managing Military Personnel Expense Authority. The Air Force uses centrally managed
allotment (CMA) procedures to manage the Military Personnel appropriation. Responsibilities:
       SAF/FMBOP. Authorizes funding for military personnel to support Air Force missions.
        SAF/FMBOP doesn't distribute funding to any lower level of command but permits
        disbursing officers throughout the Air Force to make authorized payments against the
        CMA. Use this authority to incur authorized expenses for assigned military personnel.
       Serves as focal point for administration of financial expense authority associated with
        military personnel programs.
       Manages the CMA.
       Coordinates military personnel information with personnel and financial management
        activities at HQ USAF and with other DoD components.
       Ensures consistency of funding allocations with planned military personnel programs.
       Verifies the reliability of reported expense for military personnel by closely watching and
        analyzing rate variance between expenses at standard rates and actual entitlements.
       Monitors differences between budgeted and actual expense authority for military
        personnel, and recommends corrective action if required.
       Base-Level Personnel Offices. Initiate authorizations to pay entitlements based on the
        military member's validated status.
       DFAS-DE and Base-Level Financial Services Offices. Pay the member's entitlements
        based on their validated status and statutory entitlements. (Pay and allowances are
        statutory entitlements automatically incurred until the member separates.)
8.2. Using Standard Rates for Military Personnel:
       Use composite standard rates when computing and recording military personnel costs as a
        part of total base-level operating expenses.
       The Financial Services Accounting Liaison office distributes military personnel costs at
        standard rates to expense accounts. Organizations responsible for cost systems distribute
        their own military personnel costs based on standard rates.
       Use standard rates plus applicable acceleration factors to compute amounts reimbursed
        by non-Department of Defense (DoD) federal agencies and nonfederal organizations for
        reimbursable military personnel services. Also use standard rates for programming and
        accounting.
8.3. Controlling Other Military Personnel Expenses.           SAF/FMBOP centrally controls
expense authority for permanent change of station movements, subsistence and other
miscellaneous personnel costs, and the reimbursement program.

   8.3.1. PCS Expenses. Base the PCS travel and transportation program on Air Staff-
   approved programs, policies, and actions that result in military PCSs. Duties:
          SAF/FMBO maintains fund control by establishing administrative limitations (with
           HQ USAF/DPX and HQ USAF/DPP) on the number of PCS moves by type of move
           -- accession, training, separation, operational, rotational, and unit moves.
          Air Force Manpower and Personnel Center (AFMPC) directs most PCS travel
           assignment actions.
          AFMPC controls the number of MAJCOM-directed intracommand PCSs by
           establishing move quotas allocated by specific numbers and types.
   8.3.2. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS). DFAS-DE pays BAS centrally through the
   Joint Uniform Military Pay System (JUMPS). (The BAS rate is established by statute is a
   part of the total pay package.)
   8.3.3. Reimbursement Authority:
       8.3.3.1. SAF/FMBOP issues reimbursement program authority to cover anticipated
       earnings from:
              Other government agencies (for military personnel assigned on a full-time basis
               for the benefit of those agencies).
              The foreign military sales (FMS) program.
              Non-DoD federal agencies and nonfederal organizations to whom the Air Force
               provides military personnel services.
              Defense Business Operations Fund Activities (DoD Comptroller provides rates).
       8.3.3.2. DFAS-DE develops, consolidates and reports reimbursable expenses (earnings),
       based on earned reimbursements reported in the locally-produced RCS: HAF-
       ACF(AR)7801), Status of Funds-Data Base Transfer, report.
       8.3.3.3. The base-level financial analysis office:
              Monitors the overall reimbursement program.
              Ensures all earned reimbursements from the military personnel appropriation
               reported to DFAS-DAO are properly recorded in the RCS: HAF-ACF(AR)7801
               report and local base-level reports on financial management.
8.4. Administering and Reporting Military Personnel Expense Authority (MAJCOM and
Base Level). SAF/FMBOP and DFAS-DE are mainly responsible for administering and
monitoring MPA expenses. But field activities (personnel, financial analysis and financial
services) must ensure accuracy of the expense data for military personnel (computed at standard
rates) and reimbursement data reported to higher headquarters through the RCS: HAF-
ACF(AR)7801 report. Bases and installations must correct any system errors regarding incorrect
data accumulation, accuracy of assigned strengths, and rate standards. Military personnel
expenses are integral to total operating costs. Responsibility center managers may exclude
military personnel expenses from base-level financial management reports by using the non-
reportable element of expense concept.

                                          Chapter 10

                       RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RMS)

10.1. Overview. This chapter shows how to start and maintain resource management system
(RMS) for the operation and maintenance. The procedures apply mainly to base-level operations
but may also apply to other operating locations.
   10.1.1. The term "resource management system" doesn't refer to a single separate program.
   The Air Force's RMS:
            Involves various systems focusing on outputs and resources used, on managers
             effectively using resources, on measuring actual performance compared to planned
             performance, and on using financial plans and accounting to enhance management
             control at each organizational level.
            The program is based on the Department of Defense (DoD) Planning, Programming
             and Budgeting System (PPBS).
   10.1.2. The RMS provides a way to establish priorities, choose policies, and act to get the
   desired results and required resources at an acceptable cost.
   10.1.3. RMS elements include the financial plan, management and accounting systems,
   participatory and committee management, resource management teams, and resource
   management training. (See AFP 170-1, Resource Manager's Handbook.)
10.2. RMS Duties. Air Force managers oversee activities that cost money. Oversight involves
more than legal accountability. MAJCOMs and HQ USAF make many decisions about using
resources (e.g., flying hour allocations and manpower authorizations). Although base-level
resource managers don't control initial allocation of all their resources, they must effectively
manage these resources.
   10.2.1. Commanders. Financial management is inherent to command. Commanders:
            Review, validate, and balance the financial plan to ensure successful financial
             management.
            Actively review financial programs for each of the responsibility centers reporting
             directly to them.
            Improve resource management by inquiring about program conditions, reviewing
             causes, weighing alternatives, and directing action.
            Ensure RMS success by allocating sufficient resources to RMS training and
             Resource Management Team efforts.
   10.2.2. Comptrollers. The comptroller supports the organization's mission and the Air
   Force by providing sound financial management and advice to the commander and staff. The
   comptroller:
            Promotes responsible and proper financial management throughout the organization
             to ensure the economical and efficient use of resources consistent with statutory and
             regulatory requirements.

          Applies policies and procedures enabling the organization to carry out accounting,
           budget, and cost functions.
          Is the chief personnel manager of the comptroller organization and usually is the
           commander of a comptroller squadron.
  10.2.3. Responsibility Center (RC) Managers. The RC manager plans, directs, and
  coordinates subordinate organizations" activities. The RC manager:
          Reviews resource requirements of subordinate units.
          Integrates requirements into an RC operating budget.
          Justifies requirements before the commander's review authorities.
          Determines the proper distribution of the approved RC financial plan.
          Analyzes subordinate organizations" plans and performance at least monthly.
           Identifies imbalances in resource distribution and their cause and makes sure that
           resource consumption contributes effectively to mission accomplishment. Analyzes
           alternative actions and balances programs.
          Understands and complies with AFR (DFAS-DE) 177-16, Administrative Control
           of Appropriations.
          Appoints Resource Advisors (RA). RA selection is important. Consider these
           qualities in selecting an RA. The RA should have:
               A working knowledge of the organization's mission, the mix of resources
                required to do the mission, and the historical cost record.
               A knowledge of the accounting system for operations, the procurement system,
                and the supply system, with particular concentration on data entry, flows, and
                reports produced.
               An ability to distinguish between apparent and real causes.
               An ability to deal successfully with personnel in subordinate, lateral, and
                higher level organizations.
               A questioning nature with mature judgment, usually resulting from experience.
               Sufficient time to do all necessary resource management requirements for their
                unit. Preferably, RAs should be able to fulfill their resource management
                duties for at least 1 year.
  10.2.4. Cost Center (CC) Managers. The Cost Center is the basic production organization.
  The CC manager regulates the consumption of workhours, supplies, equipment, and services
  in producing things and doing tasks. CC managers shift resources to or from the various
  production tasks within the CC to ensure the proper mix or to provide the emphasis required.
  The CC manager:
          Starts building the financial plan.
          Determines the validity of the financial plan as a whole and develops resource
           requirements and narrative justifications.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                      39


            Fosters daily awareness of the relationship between resources used and products
             produced and realigns resource as approved by superiors.
   10.2.5. Resource Advisors (RA). RC managers appoint RAs. A CC manager may also
   appoint an RA if the size of the CC warrants. RAs:
            Monitor and help prepare estimates for resources.
            Help develop obligation and expense targets.
            Monitor the use of resources in daily operations.
            Provide RMS training to cost center managers.
            Represent the RC manager in the Financial Working Group.
            Assist the comptroller during fiscal year-end closeout.
            Serve as the primary point of contact with comptroller personnel and other RAs on
             resource management matters pertaining to their responsibility center.
            Know the details of the organization's cost, program, and fiscal requirements;
             understand the relationship between output and cost.
            Understand the use of management reports produced by the accounting system for
             operations and the materiel management system.
            Interpret these management reports and recommend necessary management actions
             to the RC or CC manager.
10.3. Participatory Financial Management. A corporate organizational approach which
combines efforts of the commander and supporting staff is the most effective, efficient way to set
priorities or to reduce, defer, or eliminate programs. To provide collective resource management
action, each base-level organization must establish and maintain a financial management
structure, consisting of a Financial Management Board (FMB) and a Financial Working Group
(FWG). Small organizations, where the FMB and FWG composition would essentially be the
same, may form a single committee. (MAJCOMs may require approval before combining the
FWG and FMB.)
   10.3.1. The Financial Management Board. The senior or host commander at each base,
   field operating agency, or direct reporting unit establishes the FMB. The FMB determines
   program priorities and ensures effective allocation of resources.
        10.3.1.1. Top level managers, with membership tailored to the type of organization
        structure involved, comprise the FMB. The list below shows the composition of a typical
        wing or base FMB. The FMB chairperson may choose additional or reduced voting, as
        well as advisory nonvoting membership.

Staff                                              Position

Comptroller                                        Advisor
Financial Analysis Officer                         Recorder


        10.3.1.2. The chairperson convenes the FMB. The recorder prepares minutes of
        meetings, files the original in the financial analysis office, and provides copies to FMB
        and FWG members.
        10.3.1.3. RC managers, directly subordinate to FMB members, attend meetings as
        technical advisers when appropriate. They provide impact data during deliberation on
        FMB's recommendations.
        10.3.1.4. The FMB reviews, approves, or disapproves recommendations made by the
        Financial Working Group to ensure balanced valid financial programs and to consider all
        known or anticipated program requirements. The FMB must review, revise as necessary,
        and approve all appropriated fund financial plans.
              The FMB's composition places the base-level financial management emphasis on
               line managers who head major RCs directly related to the accomplishment of the
               base mission. FMB decisions cover the base's overall programs.
              These decisions evolve from reviewing, evaluating, and approving the financial
               plans or revisions. FMB recommends distribution of financial plan targets to base
               organizations and identifies unfunded requirements and other actions affecting the
               financial operations of the base.
        10.3.1.5. The FMB members:
              Review requirements for approved programs and activities to ensure balanced
               financial support throughout.
              Review and approve the distribution of quarterly and annual obligation targets.
               You can delegate this authority to another body; e.g., FWG. The FWG reviews
               and approves programs for deferring, reducing, eliminating, or moving to the
               financial plan's unfunded portion.
              Evaluate and list in priority sequence all unfunded requirements.
              Review and approve investment equipment (57*3080 Appropriation) items for
               purchase (unless they delegated this authority to a separate committee).
   10.3.2. The Financial Working Group. Both line and staff RA and RC managers serve as
   FWG members. The FWG manages commodities and resources integral to the operating
   activities of the base or unit. RAs or RC managers on the FWG participate in developing all-
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                     41


   inclusive budgets and financial plans for an organization or program and monitor the daily
   use of resources in their RCs.
        10.3.2.1. RAs or RCMs from the functions listed below compose the typical FWG
        membership. The chairperson may decide on additional or reduced voting and advisory
        nonvoting membership, is at the chairperson's discretion and may vary, based on local
        management needs.

Staff                                              Position


Financial Analysis Officer                          Chairperson

Contracting                                         Advisor



        10.3.2.2. Convene FWG meetings as necessary, to support the FMB. Hold meetings at
        least once a month for effective financial management. The chairperson prepares a
        memorandum for the record and files it in the financial analysis office.
        10.3.2.3. The FWG develops requirements and revisions for the base or unit financial
        plan. The FWG reviews all appropriated fund financial plans and makes
        recommendations to the FMB for final approval. FWG members:
               Integrate support requirements from organizations" prioritized list of financial
                requirements with a balanced mission program.
               Analyze the FWG's financial plan thoroughly and impartially to achieve high
                credibility.
               Act as the commanders" agents, as well as the parent activities" representatives,
                during the review.
        10.3.2.4. The FWG identifies unfunded requirements, recommends priorities, and
        presents them to the FMB for approval.
        10.3.2.5. The FWG recommends for FMB approval adjustments of financial plan targets
        between RCs to correct imbalances in resources distribution imbalances.
        10.3.2.6. The FWG members:

                 Help develop of requirements for base operating budgets and other appropriated
                  funds.
                 Represent their organizations on matters concerning distributing quarterly and
                  annual operating budget authority to the RC level.
                 Offer technical guidance to base activities on using their primary responsibility
                  resources.
                 Monitor financial plan execution by reviewing obligation data to ensure quarterly
                  and annual programs are valid and adequate.
                 Recommend reprogramming or other management action to the FMB when
                  needed.
10.4. Administering the Operating Budget and Financial Plan. Base-level managers must
play an active role in preparing and administering their portion of the budget. There are many
unique requirements, budgeting methods, cost factors, and other variable elements involved
preparing budget and financial plans. It isn't practical to standardize the preparation and
administration of base-level financial plans across the Air Force. Each base or unit must involve
operating managers in financial plan formulation, justification, review, and execution.
   10.4.1. Distributing the Approved Operating Budget Authority (OBA). Upon receiving
   the OBA from higher headquarters, the FWG and FMB distribute the funded amounts to RC
   managers.
                After analyzing the OBA, the FWG submits proposed targets to the FMB for each
                 RC receiving funding.
                The financial plan lists amounts by major EEIC grouping and summarizes
                 information at a meaningful level.
                The RC considers EEIC amounts as targets and distributes the OBA in this manner,
                 (unless higher headquarters placed specific limitations on any EEIC amount). RC
                 managers usually don't impose additional restraints other than those on the base's
                 OBA.
   10.4.2. Establishing and Maintaining Targets. Targets translate mission requirements into
   the dollar value required to do that mission. (See Chapter 5 and AFR (DFAS-DE) 177-16
   for targets and limitations.)
       10.4.2.1. Targets" purposes are to:
                 Serve as guides for consuming resources, stated in the dollar value terms of the
                  targets established.
                 Provide the measure to determine planning effectiveness.
                 Provide the control mechanism to manage overall financial plans.
                 Establish the process of periodic reviews to identify resource overages and
                  shortages. This permits resource redistribution to greatest need areas.
       10.4.2.2. Targets apply at:
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                   43


           Management decision levels selected by the command or base.
           The level that has the most significant impact on resource consumption -- usually
            the second or third RC levels.
     10.4.2.3. Established targets (base-wide and at the major RC level) usually remain stable
     for at least one quarter, unless modified by mission changes. View EEIC amounts in
     their proper perspective (within a program element at command level and within RC
     targets at base level).
           EEIC amounts are financial planning guides.              They aren't statutory or
            administrative limitations on obligations. Don't use amounts as mandatory goals,
            but they may be subject to limitations, such as ceilings, floors, fences, etc.
           Don't chase obligations with associated targets -- that is, don't increase a target
            solely to prevent exceeding that target.
     10.4.2.4. RC manager's principal financial concerns:
           Ensure actual obligations are in line with their quarterly and annual operating
            budget authority totals.
           Examine obligations to determine if appropriate for output production and
            mission accomplishment.
     10.4.2.5. Base financial administrators (comptroller personnel) principal concern is
     ensuring basewide obligations don't exceed the annual total of the base's operating budget
     and legal or administrative limitations on the base OBA.
           Financial administrators monitor the actual expenses and obligations of each RC
            monitor versus their financial plan totals.
           They normally do not control each RC manager's obligations by EEIC. Unless
            there are mission or OBA changes, financial committees shouldn't adjust RC
            operating budget authority targets more frequently than quarterly.
     10.4.2.6. Time targets:
           Use annual targets as long-range planning guides and the total available funds for
            the fiscal year. Make sure mangers create proper plans to obligate available funds
            and don't exceed targets without prior approval from the financial analysis office.
           The quarterly obligational authority represents the funds available for cumulative
            gross commitments. Quarterly obligational authority is cumulative from the
            beginning of the fiscal year.
  10.4.3. Reprogramming Authority.           There are two significant          levels of base
  reprogramming authority or flexibility between RCs and within RCs.
     10.4.3.1. Within a BA, the commander may designate a reprogramming threshold below
     which there is no need to convene the FMB for approval if the involved RCs agree.
           Financial analysis officers may reprogram quarterly operating budget authority
            without prior FMB approval if:
               They act during the first three quarters of each fiscal year.
 44                                        AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


                  Involved RC managers approve it.
                  Reprogramming actions get reviewed at the next FWG/FMB meetings. The
                   FMB must approve such a policy during the first meeting of each fiscal year.
              Financial analysis officers may approve routine transfers of quarterly operating
               budget authority to and from higher headquarters. Review transfers at the next
               FWG/FMB meetings.
       10.4.3.2. An RC manager may have full authority to make EEIC adjustments internal to
       the budget totals, including redistribution of subordinate cost center amounts provided it
       is within the limitations stated on the operating budget authority documents. In some
       instances, major command or local management impose administrative restrictions to this
       reprogramming flexibility, but usually limit restrictions to specific funding areas. The
       RC manager:
              Must coordinate with the financial analysis office before changing the quarterly or
               annual target amounts.
              May determine the EEIC mix and CC distribution best suited to accomplish their
               mission unless FMB approves restrictions to the contrary.
10.5. Using Productivity and Related Programs. The ability to reprogram and retain
resources motivates innovative managers to save through improved management practices.
When managers save money through their own initiative (by economizing, or doing a job more
efficiently) then, if possible, make these savings available for the organization's unfunded
requirements. This gives an incentive for every manager to save funds while completing their
mission.
   10.5.1. Retaining and reprogramming funds isn't always possible because the Air Force's
   overall mission comes first. Overriding requirements may dictate using resources saved for
   purposes outside the jurisdiction of the manager, base, or command producing the savings.
   We want to create a financial and management environment that encourages and rewards
   improved efficiency.
   10.5.2. Formal and informal programs provide managers chances to get financial help for
   carrying out cost-saving ideas. Informal programs usually include items that don't fit
   established criteria and result mainly in cost avoidances or operation efficiencies.
   Established formal Air Force programs include:
          Productivity Investment Funding (PIF). See AFI 38-301.
          Fast Payback Capital Investment Program (FASCAP). See AFI 38-301.
          Value Engineering (VE). See AFI 63-801.
          Air Force Suggestion Program. See AFI 36-2857.
          Air Force Management Engineering Program (MEP). See AFPAM 38-208.
          Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP). See AFPD 23-3 and Annual
           Call Letters.
          Air Force Productivity Enhancement Program (PEP). See AFI 38-301.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                      45


  10.5.3. Air Force Audit Agency's (AFAA) Statement of Potential Monetary Benefits
  (PMB). Audit reports include potential monetary benefits data.
        Management may concur or nonconcur with the auditor's estimate of monetary
         benefits identified in each audit report. The AFAA reports this data to higher
         headquarters through the RCS: DD-IG(SA) 1574 report.
        Use PMBs identify ways to use resources more effectively. The financial analysis
         officer must be aware of these potential monetary savings because the reports often
         lead to budget adjustments. (See AFI 65-403.)

                RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RMS) TRAINING

11.1. General Information. This chapter outlines the responsibilities of persons and
organizations involved in base-level RMS training. The guidance covers training frequency,
program administration, basic content, and the target group.
      Each Air Force manager must manage his resources efficiently. To fulfill this duty, all
       managers require accurate, timely, information designed to their needs. For example,
       managers require information to develop financial plan requirements and to monitor
       actual expenses and obligations against established targets.
      A system or program must provide this information and procedures to each
       organizational level.
11.2. Initial RMS Training:
   11.2.1. Initial training must offer an overview of basic Air Force financial management
   policies and an understanding of local unique programs and procedures. Newly assigned
   responsibility center (RC) managers, cost center (CC) managers, and resource advisors (RAs)
   must be familiar with their duties and responsibilities. The initial training provides:
          A financial processes overview.
          An understanding of their responsibilities to their organization and the Comptroller.
          A knowledge of available management reports.
          An understanding of the functions and key resource managers assigned duties.
          An overview of procurement and supply procedures.
   11.2.2. Provide new RC managers with initial RMS training not later than 90 days after
   assignment of financial management responsibility.
          Start RAs initial training within 30 days after assignment and complete it within 90
           days after assignment.
          The comptroller must give initial RMS training to all RCMs and their respective RAs.
           RCMs can be either squadron commander or staff agency chiefs.
          As a minimum, all base offices for financial analysis should train the RCMs and RAs
           from the organizations comprising their local working group. RAs possessing an
           AFSC of 6F1X1 or 65F3 don't have to do initial RMS training.
   11.2.3. The Comptroller provides initial RMS training for RC managers and RAs. RAs
   train CC managers but may ask the comptroller for help.
          The Air Force doesn't have a standard RMS training package.
          MAJCOM and base-level management control the content and presentation method
           of RMS training so it can cover areas unique to the command and base.
   11.2.4. In group classes or one-on-one sessions, introduce at least the following subjects:
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                               47


         RMS functions and responsibilities of:
         Center, Wing, or Base commander.
         Responsibility center managers.
         Cost center managers.
         Resource advisors.
         Comptroller organization.
     Functions and responsibilities of the Financial Management Board (FMB).
     Functions and responsibilities of the Financial Working Group (FWG).
     Formulation of the financial plan.
     Execution of the financial plan:
         Operating budget authority (OBA).
         Annual and quarterly targets.
         Legal and administrative limitations.
         Disposition of savings.
         Yearend closeout procedures.
         Unfunded requirements.
         Flexibility within the OBA.
         Reimbursements and refunds.
     Management reports:
         Accounting system for operations.
         Supplies and equipment.
     Investment equipment procedures.
     Standard base supply system procedures.
     Procedures for local purchase of materiel items.
     Resource Management Team (RMT).

  11.2.5. No standard RMS training package exists. There are many vehicles available to
  assist in conducting RMS training. Incorporating the following material will expand and
  enhance the trainees' comprehension of the RMS.
         AFP 170-1, Resource Manager's Handbook.
         Air Force Extension Course Institute (ECI) course 6702 -- Resource Advisor.
 48                                      AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


         Base-level Supply customer course.
   11.2.6. There is no single method to do RMS training.        Use a mix of methods. The
   following is a list of proven methods:
         Financial Management Committee Presentation. Suited to establish, review, and
          discuss policies and procedures. Devote small segments of the committee meetings
          to clarify or review specialized subjects.
         Classroom and Group Presentation. Best suited for initial RMS training. Prepare
          training packages requiring little revision for slide, 35mm sound-on-slide, or video
          presentation.
         Individual One-on-One Sessions. Suits initial, continuation, or update training. Use
          this to train new financial managers and to address specific individual needs. This
          method is the most flexible.
         Written Material. Use written training aids, pamphlets, handouts, ECI courses,
          checklists, newsletters, and budget policy continuity folders for RMS, continuation,
          or update training.
11.3. Continuation and Update Training:
   11.3.1. Provide each RC manager and RA with follow-on training, after satisfactory
   completion of initial basic and specialized training. Design training for specific persons or
   small groups such as the FWG and FMB.
         Provide personnel training for maintaining proficiency in using RMS reports and
          keeping abreast of current management policies on effective use of resources.
         Frequently hold continuations and update training, tailored to local needs, to keep
          resource management personnel current on budget and accounting policies,
          procedures, and instructions.
   11.3.2. Give continuation and update training to RC managers and RAs by the organization
   assigned the RMS training program by the comptroller. RAs provide continuation and
   update training of CC managers.
         The RA may request comptroller help in the update training of CC managers.
         RAs possessing an AFSC of 6F1X1 or 65F3 don't have to take continuation and
          update training.
   11.3.3. The required training, the number of people, and training environment determines if
   the continuation and update training is formal (training sessions or FMB/FWG meetings).
   Informal training is casual (training through one-on-one contact or during visits to
   responsibility centers by the unit resource management team).
11.4. Administration of the RMS Training Program:
   11.4.1. You must properly document the RMS training program to ensure complete coverage
   of necessary information for all personnel requiring training, while preventing unnecessary
   duplication.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                  49


        The office providing the RMS training keeps training records for RC managers and
         RAs.
        The RA's organizations keep CC managers records maintenance.
        Keep training records current. Record initial and update training by person trained,
         date of training, length of training period, and subject(s) covered. Use automated or
         manual record keeping systems. (MicroBAS has a feature to document RMS
         training.)
  11.4.2. We advocate training letters and certificates to document proof of initial RMS
  training.

                                          Chapter 12

                       RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TEAMS (RMT)

12.1. Purpose of the Base-Level RMT. The aim is to train and motivate users of resources by
observing and cross-feeding innovative resource management methods and ideas. Stress
training, problem solving, and developing economical ways to accomplish the mission.
      The RMT is a problem solving team geared to provide base-wide resource management
       help and training. Don't assess blame or fix responsibility. Try to identify and solve
       problems and propose improvements.
      RMT activities don't duplicate or replace other functional reviews or evaluations. Team
       members must operate within this premise to obtain the maximum benefits.
      The RMT's role of cross-feeding information is very important. Identifying various
       resource management practices and techniques observed throughout the base,
       recommending improvements, and making this information available upgrades financial
       awareness and skills.
      The key to a successful RMT is open information exchange and the base's application of
       its own expertise in identifying and resolving resource management problems. Keep
       information general (not identified with a particular unit) when discussing necessary
       improvement of cross-feeding resource management practices.
12.2. RMT's Duties:
      The local host commander (normally the FMB chairperson) decides when to implement
       the RMT.
      The base comptroller implements and administers the RMT. This includes introducing
       the RMT idea to the host commander, offering RMT services to all on-base major RCs
       and supported tenants, and soliciting membership from non-comptroller organizations.
      The base comptroller also encourages tenants to participate, either as a team member or
       as a customer, when establishing an RMT.
12.3. RMT's Composition. The base comptroller decides the membership and selects team
members for each responsibility center (RC) visit.
      The head of team is normally the financial analysis officer from the comptroller
       organization.
      RMTs includes only members having a direct functional interest in improving the
       effectiveness and efficiency of the visited RC. Give the visited RC the chance in
       deciding the RMT make-up for their assistance visit.
   12.3.1. A typical RMT normally has personnel from the following organizations:
          Financial Analysis.
          Financial Services Office.
          Supply.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                      51


          Transportation.
          Contracting.
          Logistic Plans (Support Agreements).
          Communications.
          Personnel (Military and Civilian).
          Information Management.
          Management Engineering.
          Civil Engineering.
   12.3.2. Each base or installation determines the actual RMT composition. Sometimes just
   base budget personnel comprise the RMT. Make the team large enough to accomplish its
   mission.
12.4. Frequency of Visits. The installation comptroller offers RMT services at least annually to
all on-base major RCs and supported tenants.
   12.4.1. The RC's acceptance of RMT assistance visits is voluntary. If key personnel haven't
   changed since the previous RMT visit and the RC practices sound financial management,
   then an annual visit may not be productive. The RC manager has the option to accept or
   decline the visit.
   12.4.2. Offer RMT services in writing, at staff meetings, FMB or FWG meetings, or other
   means, as appropriate. This gives RC managers an opportunity to mutually agree with the
   RMT chief on the need for RMT services and to schedule the visit.
          The offer provides the RC manager with the date and functional area of their last
           RMT visit.
          Ask the RC manager if they want resource management update training during RMT
           visit.
12.5. RMT Operation. The RMT operates in four phases: preparation, visitation, follow-up,
and documentation.
   12.5.1. The preparation phase contributes toward the RMT's effectiveness and includes:
          The Comptroller's offer to help with the RMT.
          Scheduling an acceptable time to conduct the visit and identifying the team's
           composition. Notify the RC manager and unit resource advisor (RA) of the scheduled
           visit at least 2 weeks in advance, time permitting.
          Each visiting RMT member's reviewing the unit's programs from their functional area
           view point.
   12.5.2. The visitation phase should include:
          Inbriefing for the RC manager, RA, and cost center managers to review the RMT's
           purpose and introduce the team members. Emphasize the positive aspects of training,
           help, and cross-feed of information. Keep the inbrief short.
 52                                       AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


          Reviewing and discussing training requirements and responsibilities. Provide on-the-
           spot training or schedule later.
          Observing all aspects of resource management and providing advice and help, as
           needed.
          Gathering and exchanging innovative resource management techniques and ideas.
           Foremost is personal contact with personnel responsible for consuming and managing
           resources.
          Identifying base or higher headquarters policies and directives inhibiting effective
           resource management. Follow-up through applicable channels on items requiring
           evaluation and corrective action.
          Outbriefing the RC manager on the visit results. The RC manager decides who
           attends the outbriefing.
   12.5.3. Creating and administering a suspense system phase ensures the team members take
   appropriate action on unanswered questions, unresolved problems, and training requirements.
   12.5.4. The documentation phase is informal -- at the RC manager discretion. Typically,
   the RC manager receives a memorandum that includes:
          RMT members' names who took part in the visit and personnel contacted.
          Subjects discussed, training provided, and problems resolved.
          An open item list with action office identification and an estimated completion date.
           Coordinate with RC manager for any further RMT memorandum distribution. The
           RMT Chief should:
              Prepare and maintain a cross-feed data bank of noteworthy resource management
               practices.
              Submit resource-saving items gathered during RMT visits to the parent
               MAJCOM/FOA comptroller for possible cross-feed and application to other Air
               Force locations.
          Periodically brief the Financial Working Group and Financial Management Board on
           RMT operations, superior financial management, crossfeed items, and resource
           management trends. Keep briefing positive and general.
12.6. MAJCOM-Level RMT. MAJCOMs may establish an RMT to provide help, guidance,
and training to base-level RMTs, or they may do these tasks through other command visitation
teams.
      If the MAJCOM requires an RMT, the MAJCOM comptroller and Deputy Chief of Staff
       for Logistics implement and manage the RMT idea through the command.
      The comptroller operates and administers established MAJCOM RMTs.
   12.6.1. MAJCOMs should promote and encourage their bases to establish and operate
   RMTs. If, the base-level comptroller and commander don't want an RMT at their installation,
   they may request a waiver from their MAJCOM.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                 53


           The waiver states why the RMT isn't productive. Send the waiver to the parent
            command comptroller (or designated representative) for approval.
           The RMT requires an annual review to document its need using criteria such as
            mission changes, personnel turnovers, and tenants supported.
   12.6.2. The MAJCOM comptroller should share information. This ensures:
           Problem policies and procedures requiring MAJCOM attention go to the proper
            MAJCOM offices.
           Policies issues requiring HQ USAF attention goes to proper Air Staff offices with
            an information copy to SAF/FMBMD.
           MAJCOMs monitors the status of these queries and provides comments to the base
            RMT.

      13.2.1.2. (Added-AFOTEC) Enlisted members will complete their training on-line
      through the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training website.
      13.2.1.3. (Added-AFOTEC) Civilians will complete their training on-line through the
      FM-DLC or AETC training websites commensurate with their grade.
13.3. (Added-AFOTEC) Timeframe to Complete Training.
   13.3.1. (Added-AFOTEC) All FM military personnel will complete the applicable CCFC
   on-line training within the 90-day period prior to their AEF X-band and 365-day deployment
   window, whether the individual expects to be deployed or not.
   13.3.2. (Added-AFOTEC) CCFC training is optional for government service FM civilians
   unless they volunteer for deployment. If an FM civilian is deploying, then the same 90-day
   timeline and training requirements apply to the deploying civilian member.
13.4. (Added-AFOTEC) Training Progress Deficiency.
   13.4.1. (Added-AFOTEC) Deploying members will complete CCFC training within the
   90-day to 60-day time period prior to entering their deployment window.
      13.4.1.1. (Added-AFOTEC) If the deploying member does not complete the skill-level
      appropriate CCFC training 60 days prior to entering their deployment window, the Unit
      Training Manager (UTM) will report the deficiency to the AFOTEC FM Functional
      Manager (Comptroller) or his designee and to the deploying member’s Detachment
      Commander or Directorate (Director). The deploying member must remedy the
      deficiency by completing the skill-level appropriate CCFC training.
      13.4.1.2. (Added-AFOTEC) If the deploying member does not complete the skill-level
      appropriate CCFC training 45 days prior to deployment, the UTM will report the
      deficiency to the AFOTEC Comptroller or his designee, the deploying member’s
      Detachment Commander or Director, and then to the AFOTEC Commander. The
      deploying member must remedy the deficiency by completing the skill-level appropriate
      CCFC training.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                     55


      13.4.1.3. (Added-AFOTEC) If the deploying member has not completed their CCFC
      training during the 90-day time period prior to their deployment and the deploying
      member requests to go on any type of leave (annual, emergency or sick leave), then the
      deploying member must get approval for his or her leave request from their Detachment
      Commander or Director. The Detachment Commander or Director will notify the
      AFOTEC Comptroller or his designee of any leave during the 90-day time period to the
      member’s deployment.
13.5. (Added-AFOTEC) Processes.
   13.5.1. (Added-AFOTEC) The status of annual individual deployments and identification
   of FM-DLC and AETC website training needed to meet CCFC requirements shall be
   integrated into each quarterly Financial Working Group (FWG) meeting. CCFC training
   deficiencies for individuals scheduled to deploy within the next 90 days will be included into
   the FWG minutes.
   13.5.2. (Added-AFOTEC) Upon Permanent Change of Station (PCS) arrival.
      13.5.2.1. (Added-AFOTEC) When a new military member initially arrives PCS on
      station at AFOTEC, or to a Detachment, the new member will in-process with the Unit
      Deployment Manager (UDM) and UTM.
      13.5.2.2. (Added-AFOTEC) The UDM requests the member to select an AEF X-band
      with the consent of his Detachment Commander or Director. This deployment window
      selection takes place within 15 days of the member signing in on station.
      13.5.2.3. (Added-AFOTEC) Detachment Commander, Director or their respective
      deputy will coordinate with the AFOTEC Comptroller or his designee on the new
      military member’s X-band selection.
      13.5.2.4. (Added-AFOTEC) The AFOTEC Comptroller or his designee will notify the
      AFOTEC Resource Management Division (A-7R) Training Manager on the new military
      member’s X-band selection. The A-7R Training Manager will annotate on a list the new
      member’s X-band anticipated deployment window so projected CCFC training date
      windows can be monitored by the AFOTEC Comptroller or his designee.
   13.5.3. (Added-AFOTEC) Upon Deployment Tasking.
      13.5.3.1. (Added-AFOTEC) The UDM notifies the UTM and AFOTEC Comptroller or
      his designee of any Deployment Task Order assigning an FM member to a specific
      deployment tasking.

      UDM, UTM and the deployable FM member of the CCFC training requirement and
      applicable suspenses to complete the training prior to the individual entering their
      deployment window.
      13.5.3.3. (Added-AFOTEC) The UTM guides the deployable member to the FM-DLC
      or AETC training website and applicable link (identified below) for self-paced, on-line
      CCFC training. This is accomplished regardless whether or not a CCFC line remark is
      identified on the member’s Deployment Task Order. The applicable training links are:

Terms
(Added-AFOTEC) Financial Management Board (FMB)—The FMB is the senior financial
advisory committee within an organization. The FMB is chaired by the vice commander on
behalf of the commander and membership is comprised of designated organizational
Responsibility Center Managers (RCM’s). The FMB establishes financial priorities, reviews the
Financial Working Group’s (FWG) recommended distribution of annual funding, and ensures
 62                                        AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


consistency with programs and missions. FMB approval represents the final, approved
organizational budget submitted to higher command and the final distribution of funds received
from higher command.
(Added-AFOTEC) Financial Working Group (FWG)—A group of resource advisors lead by
the organizational comptroller who collectively and periodically review program financial plan
inputs, justifications and compare actual costs with approved obligation and expenditure goals.
The FWG submits recommended funding distributions to the FMB and commander for approval
and execution.
NOTE:—Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, March 23, 1994,
and AFMAN 11-1 contain standardized terms and definition for Department of Defense and Air
Force use.
Automated Supply and Equipment Systems—The General Support, Systems Support,
Medical-Dental, Reparable Support and Fuels divisions of the Defense Business Operations
Fund provide update data for processing periodically during the month and at month end into the
general accounting system. Periodic processing between systems provides current supply and
equipment expense data to DFAS-Defense Accounting Office and updates the status of funds for
base-level resource managers and Budget. Accounting system management reports and
automated materiel system reports provide the responsibility center and cost center managers
with the information necessary to monitor their financial plan execution.
Civilian Payroll System—Provides biweekly expense and disbursement data output from this
system to interface with the accounting system. Civilian payroll transactions affect either
accrued expense unpaid (AEU) or accrued expense paid (AEP). The ensuing pay cycle
accumulates expense data and establishes necessary accruals. Output is the RCS: DD-
COMP(AR)1092 report. (See Chapter 9 and DFAS-DE Regulation 177-370 on support system.)
DoD Functional Categories—These 16 categories are a method of arranging data in the
conventional budget structure or the FYDP. Functional category descriptions are in DFAS-DE
Regulations.
Element of Expense and Investment Code (EEIC)—These represent the final breakout in the
budget structure. The number varies with the major command (MAJCOM), depending on the
number of subelements required for local management. This part of the budget structure is quite
similar to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) object classification. Air Force EEICs
and DoD elements of expense are in the Air Force Data Dictionary.
Materiel Management System—
         Materiel Management Reports. There are many reports produced by the standard
          base supply system (SBSS) that provide budget personnel and resource managers
          detailed information on the operating budget authority set aside for purchases from the
          Defense Business Operations Fund. Most often used are the RC/CC Summary List,
          Project Fund Management Report, PFMR/ OCCR Update and Reconciliation Report,
          Consolidated Fund Management Report, and Obligated Due-Out Listing.
         Medical Material Accounting System. A variety of reports produced for the medical
          function provide valuable financial data for the budget function. The system
          accumulates and provides financial data for all base and tenant medical dental stock-
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                        63


         funded and non-stock-funded supplies and equipment. This data mainly concerns
         financial transactions within fund code 2X but, transactions occur frequently within
         other BAs and involve mainly buys with EEIC 604 and 624.
        Military Personnel Expense System. This system records the expenses of military
         personnel at standard rates by program element and element of expense. Use assigned
         strength as of the first calendar day of each month as the basis to compute military
         personnel expense for that month. (See Chapter 8 and DFAS-DE Regulation 177-370
         for information on this system.)
Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR) System—The OCCR system provides for current
day as well as fiscal year-to-date materiel obligation and expense data recorded at the cost center
level for EEICs 600, 602, 605, 609, 628, 641, 642, 644, 645, and 693. The system provides cost
center level management products showing the net value (issues less turn-ins) of materiel issued
by EEIC, value of obligated due-outs by EEIC, and fund availability targets by EEIC.
PFMR/OCCR Directory—Project Funds Management Record (PFMR)/ Organization Cost
Center Record (OCCR). This program provides a directory of PFMR and OCCR indicative data
for use by Budget, Financial Services Office, Supply, responsibility center managers, cost center
managers, and all other financial management personnel in identifying coded financial data to
the applicable organization(s).
Program Element (PE)—PEs describe all forces, activities, and support required to accomplish
the Air Force mission with associated costs. There are more than 1,600 PEs in the DoD and
more than 600 in the Air Force. The Air Force Corporate Data Dictionary identifies DoD and
Air Force program element codes.
Project Funds Management Record (PFMR) System—A system to provide for computer
monitorship and control over each responsibility center manager's financial plan programmed for
purchase of expensed materiel by cost center managers from the General Support Division,
Systems Support Division, Reparable Support and Fuels Division of the Defense Business
Operations Fund. The standard base supply system provides management products informing
each responsibility center manager and Budget of the status of operating budget authority fund
availability, as well as fiscal year-to-date data concerning expensed materiel buys and on-order
(due-outs) by current and prior year. The PFMR is a control record for one or more organization
cost center records (OCCRs). The OCCR to PFMR system is a relationship similar to the
relationship between the cost center and responsibility center.
(Added-AFOTEC) Resource Advisor (RA)—The RA participates actively in resource
management, including the planning, programming, budgeting, acquiring, consuming, storing,
and disposing of resources. The RA is directly responsible to the RCM.
(Added-AFOTEC) Responsibility Center Manager (RCM)—The RCM normally heads an
organization that plans, organizes, directs, and coordinates activities of subordinate organizations
and functions. RCMs are the principal level that manages financial resources and appoint an RA
to oversee technical details of operations relating to resource use.
Total Actual Authority (TAA)—TAA is TOA, or direct authority plus reimbursements earned
(filled plus unfilled customer orders), whichever is less.
 64                                       AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


Total Obligation Authority (TOA)—TOA is direct obligation authority plus anticipated
reimbursements.
Vehicle Interactive Management System (VIMS)—A system to improve management
effectiveness in base motor vehicle maintenance and operation and to interface with portions of
the standard accounting and finance and base supply systems. The general accounting and
finance system and VIMS exchange information daily between themselves. The accounting
system extracts vehicle maintenance and operation costs and passes these costs to VIMS by
magnetic tape to make cost distribution and identify reimbursements and refunds. See DFAS-
DE Regulation 177-370 for more detailed information on VIMS processing.
Work Information Management System (WIMS)—The general accounting and finance
system and WIMS are independent systems that exchange data. WIMS receives daily the
accounting transactions by a magnetic tape created at the end of each accounting day. WIMS, in
turn, passes data back to the general accounting and finance system at the end of each month for
reimbursement or materiel cost distribution purposes. DFAS-DE Accounting Office requires
special coding to identify obligation and expense transactions entered into the accounting system
that also apply to WIMS. See DFAS-DE Regulation 177-370 for more detailed information on
WIMS processing.

                                           Attachment 2
                BUDGETING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR OPERATIONS

A2.1. The System's Purpose and Content:
   A2.1.1. The Future Year Defense Program (FYDP). The FYDP is the official document
   summarizing the Secretary of Defense approved programs for the Department of Defense
   (DoD). The Air Force part of the FYDP is the Force and Financial Plan (F&FP). The FYDP
   lists the total resources (forces, personnel, and dollars for each appropriation) programmed
   for DoD.
               The FYDP projects all data except forces for 5 years; forces extend an additional 3
                years.
               Carefully cost out the FYDP. Link plans and programs to desired program budget
                estimate levels and to approved program levels of budget authorities.
   A2.1.2. Budgeting and Accounting Systems. The budgeting system defines the
   requirement for future consumption of resources; the accounting system records the
   resources used. The accounting system for operations covers funds made available from the
   Operation and Maintenance (O&M), Military Personnel, Other Procurement, Military
   Construction Program (MCP), and Military Family Housing appropriations. This instruction
   emphasizes O&M and Military Personnel. (See Attachment 3 for details on the O&M
   Budget Activity Structure.)
   A2.1.3. Using Information. The accounting system for operations:
               Allows analysts and managers to evaluate financial and program progress,
                determine budget requirements, and justify total resource requirements.
               Applies elements of the FYDP (BAs and PEs) to all organizations (responsibility
                centers/cost centers) (RC/CCs) that accumulate operating costs by Air Force EEICs.
               Provides obligation and expense information to formulate budgets and monitor
                actual execution against quarterly and annual budget targets. It also provides
                adequate fiscal controls and accounting techniques to properly account for
                appropriated funds.
A2.2. Support and Cost System Integration:
   A2.2.1. Transaction Data. The main transaction data comes from DFAS-Defense
   Accounting Office direct entry of information from obligation and commitment documents.
   (Examples are travel orders, purchase requests and orders for goods and services, and other
   Air Force contract and procurement documents.) Other automated support systems provide
   the remaining information.
   A2.2.2. Support Systems Interface. Three major support systems (Civilian Payroll,
   Military Personnel Expense, and Automated Supply and Equipment) interface with the
   general accounting system.
                See Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 for military personnel expense and civilian payroll
                 procedures.
 66                                        AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


             The General Support, Systems Support, Medical-Dental, Reparable Support and
              Fuels divisions of the Defense Business Operations Fund provide update data that
              are processed periodically during the month and at month-end into the general
              accounting system. The DAO updates the status of funds for base resource
              managers and budget using current supply and equipment expense data generated
              by the periodic processing. Responsibility center and cost center managers use
              the accounting system management reports and automated materiel system reports
              to monitor the execution of their financial plan.
   A2.2.3. Cost System Interface. The general accounting and finance system is the principal
   financial data source for input to the Work Information Management System (WIMS) and
   Vehicle Integrated Management System (VIMS). With minor modifications, the general
   accounting and finance system processes these systems" financial transactions. This single
   source of financial data for the cost system allows us to pass data back to the accounting
   system for reimbursement or to distribute material costs.
A2.3. Management Application of the Accounting System for Operations:
   A2.3.1. Management Controls. Other directives and instructions show how to manage
   resources and administer the budget in specific functional areas. The accounting system
   provides management control data that allows RC/CC managers and comptroller personnel to
   do financial analysis. Paragraph A2.3 covers some key procedures.
   A2.3.2. Undelivered Orders Outstanding (UOO). Usually, base services contracts are
   performed over a fairly long time period and it isn't appropriate to record them as expenses
   when you make the contract.
         Charge the contract to an "undelivered orders" account and record it as an obligation -
          - not as an expense.
         Upon completing the job, (the vendor provides the services or you get documentation
          showing incremental completion), charge the amount to expense and reduce the
          undelivered orders accounts.
         The sum of current fiscal year expense incurred (accrued expenditures paid and
          unpaid) and current fiscal year undelivered orders will always equal current year
          obligations.
   A2.3.3. Project Fund Management Records (PFMR).                  Materiel requirements and
   associated financing are a large part of the base's available O&M fund authority. These are
   some management control techniques you use for the mechanized supply system.
   A2.3.4. Establish the quarterly phased dollar programs that apply to Standard Base Supply
   System operations and the Medical Materiel Management System in the PFMRs. After the
   Financial Management Board approves the Financial Working Group recommended target
   distributions, resource advisors furnish the financial analysis office internal operating budget
   targets within each PFMR by organization code and cost center code, if applicable.
         Load targets into the Standard Base Supply System.
         Load targets by cost center code into the Medical Materiel Management System.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                          67


        The total targets for all organization cost center records (OCCRs) can't exceed the
         total amount of the responsibility center approved target for the organization PFMR.
  A2.3.5. The financial analysis officer (FAO) (on some bases called the budget officer)
  summarizes the recommended distributions based on (1) the total supply and equipment
  approvals, and (2) the receipt of recommended organization and cost center distributions
  from resource advisors. The FAO forwards them to the Financial Services Accounting
  Liaison Office for entry into the applicable supply system. The FAO should inform the
  resource advisor if changes are made to the recommended distribution before final
  processing.
  A2.3.6. Establish separate PFMRs for the host and each Air Force tenant and additional
  PFMRs as necessary. (See Accounting and Finance and Supply directives).
        Establish PFMRs by fund code, operating agency code (OAC), OBAN/allotment
         serial number (ASN), budget project (for Military Family Housing), and budget
         activity (for O&M), at the RC/CC levels specified in MAJCOM instructions.
        Use one combined PFMR for both supplies and equipment.
  A2.3.7. Reimbursable Program:
  A2.3.8. Reimbursable Authority. Reimbursable authority is available only to the extent that
  you realize actual reimbursements (collected, filled but uncollected, plus unfilled customer
  orders). The total actual authority (TAA) available for obligation is the sum of direct
  obligation authority plus the lesser of reimbursable obligation authority or reimbursements
  realized.
  A2.3.9. Automatic Apportionment for O&M Reimbursements. The Office of Management
  and Budget (OMB) approves apportionments that include anticipated appropriation
  reimbursements. For O&M, AF (57*3400), OMB automatically apportions reimbursement
  authority at departmental level.
        SAF/FMBO issues management targets to MAJCOMs/FOAs during the execution
         year.
        MAJCOMs/FOAs may exceed target amounts without prior approval, but must
         explain deviations from targets in writing to SAF/FMBO when known.
  A2.3.10. Credit appropriation reimbursements to the element of expense and investment
  code (EEIC) that most nearly identifies the nature of the materiel or service that originally
  provided it, except for transactions related to WIMS, VIMS, or any other management or
  cost system.
        Use selected EEICs only when reporting the appropriation reimbursement transaction
         through a cost or management system.
        If you can't identify the sale of services or materiel to a specific EEIC, and the sale
         isn't reported through a management or cost system, credit the reimbursement to
         EEIC 599.
  A2.3.11. Program Element Predominancy Rule. Identify military and civilian personnel
  costs to the DoD program element (PE) as authorized in the unit authorization file extract.
68                                      AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


        Identify other expenses, excluding EEIC series 2XX and 3XX, to the appropriate
         DoD PE when you can do so with reasonable effort; otherwise, identify these costs to
         the RC/CC representing a predominant PE. (See DFAS-DE Regulation 170-5.)
        Select the predominant PE based mainly on the manning authorizations assigned to a
         specific organization.
        The most common users of the predominancy rule are weapon system maintenance
         activities who use common bench stocks for work on various aircraft.
        Try to identify costs to the proper PE. Doing otherwise distorts aircraft maintenance
         cost factors developed by SAF/FMC because of inconsistencies in factors for like
         aircraft. These discrepancies make it more difficult to defend budget estimate
         submissions to OSD and the Congress, and can lead to a loss in funding to the Air
         Force.
A2.4. Summary:
  A2.4.1. FYDP Relationship. Use the accounting system for operations to identify and code
  the costs of Air Force missions, Budget Activities (BA), and PEs to meet FYDP
  requirements. Use element of expense codes to identify the cost of operating base-level
  organizations and RC/CCs. By linking these data elements, the Air Force relates all
  operating costs to a major Air Force mission programmed in the FYDP.
  A2.4.2. System Structure. The accounting system for operations is structured along
  organizational lines because organizations manage and use resources. The operating reports
  available to management show consumption by type of resource (EEIC).
  A2.4.3. System Differences. The system focuses on the basic difference between resource
  acquisition and resource consumption. The differences involve the time of purchase and
  receipt of goods and services, and the amounts of obligations and expenses:
        Appropriation accounting is concerned with resource acquisition or obligational
         authority.
        Accrual (expense) accounting reports the costs of resources used during the period.

                                      BUDGET ACTIVITIES

A3.1. Budget Activities:
A3.2. Budget Activity (BA) Structure. The BA is the major budget program in the operating
budget structure. The BA structure is:
            BUDGET ACTIVITY 01: OPERATING FORCES.
            BUDGET ACTIVITY 02: MOBILIZATION.
            BUDGET ACTIVITY 03: TRAINING AND RECRUITING.
            BUDGET ACTIVITY 04: ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICEWIDE ACTIVITIES.

   A3.2.1. BUDGET ACTIVITY 01: OPERATING FORCES.                         This budget activity
   consists of three subactivity groups: Air Operations, Combat Related Operations, and Space
   Operations.
   A3.2.2. The Air Operations subactivity group includes overall support for all fighter and
   bomber forces, intercontinental ballistic missiles, air launched strategic and tactical missiles.
             It also includes support ranges, command and base support personnel and activities.
             In addition it includes the Airborne Warning and Control Systems aircraft
              (AWACS), Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) aircraft, Strategic Command
              (STRATCOM), Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), JCS
              Exercises, Chemical and Biological Defense activities, Tactical Reconnaissance and
              Electronic Warfare, Tactical Intelligence and Special Activities, United States
              Central Command (CENTCOM), Joint Deployment Agency (JDA), counter-drug
              operations and the Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE).
   A3.2.3. The Combat Related Operations subactivity group comprises the support element for
   combat forces and employs a wide range of assets to accomplish a myriad of missions.
             The Strategic Offensive C 3I, the National Military Command Center (NMCC), the
              National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP), and the Minimum
              Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) support these forces.
             The remaining efforts are in the areas of communication links and other technical
              support.
   A3.2.4. The Space Operations Forces subactivity group consists of assets and force
   structure to provide the capability to launch payloads into various earth orbits, communicate
   with this space based platforms, and worldwide network of sites and terminals to relay data
   gathered by satellite constellations. Other programs include personnel and infrastructure
   support for the manpower and facilities used to carry out these missions.
   A3.2.5. BUDGET ACTIVITY 02: MOBILIZATION:
   A3.2.6. The Mobilization activity group consists of the following mission areas: Airlift
   Operations; Airlift Operations Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C 3I);

  Mobilization Preparedness; Payment to the Transportation Business Area; and Base Support
  elements.
  A3.2.7. The Airlift Operations mission area supports the daily mission activity of Mobility
  Operations; e.g., Tactical Airlift, Air Refueling, and Operational Support Airlift for the
  movement of personnel and cargo. It also supports Headquarters Air Mobility Command, its
  detachments, and other numbered Air Force headquarters.            This support includes
  administrative support necessary in managing the peacetime logistics mission as well as
  training and preparing airlift forces to meet wartime objectives.
  A3.2.8. The Airlift Operations C 3I mission area supports the core of Mobility Operations
  through the provision of Air Mobility Command (AMC) Command and Control systems.
  These systems provide the capability to direct and control airlift and aircrew forces for
  worldwide deployment and provide in-transit visibility of cargo and passengers; generate
  billing data; provide for deliberate planning, analysis, and modeling; and provide for
  software maintenance and personnel to operate current systems including the Global
  Decision Support System (GDSS).
  A3.2.9. The Mobilization Preparedness mission area supports Mobility Operations with the
  capability to sustain crisis situations through the provision and prepositioning of War
  Readiness Materials (WRM). It includes manpower authorizations, peculiar support
  equipment, and facilities. It also includes the associated costs specifically identified and
  measurable for the procurement and maintenance of equipment and secondary items within
  the war reserve stockpile. In addition, it supports the medical wartime mission through
  contingency hospitals located outside the continental United States.
        Payment to the Transportation Business Area represents funding to meet DBOF-T
         transportation costs not covered in the rate structure.
        Base Support provides personnel support functions and the base infrastructure and
         fulfills a broad range of essential needs to sustain mission capability, quality of life,
         workforce productivity, and physical plant structure preservation.

  A3.2.11. The Training and Recruiting Activity group consists of three broad mission areas --
  Accession Training, Basic Skill and Advanced Training, and Recruiting and Other Training
  and Education.
  A3.2.12. The Accession Training mission area produces the enlisted and officer personnel
  needed to meet total force requirements. This training provides an effective, efficient
  military indoctrination program facilitating a smooth transition from civilian life to the
  military environment. Officer accessions receive indoctrination training through the United
  States Air Force Academy (USAFA), Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC),
  Officer Training Squadron (OTS), and Airmen Education and Commissioning Program
  (AECP).
        The USAFA conducts a 4-year curriculum combining both military and academic
         education and training. AFROTC, the largest source of Air Force officers,
         supplements academic education with military education and training at colleges
         across the country.

                                         Attachment 4
                                   THE FINANCIAL PLAN

A4.1. Overview:
   A4.1.1. Purpose. The basic purpose of the FP submission is to ensure an equitable
   distribution of the President's Budget (PB) for the next fiscal year (budget year) consistent
   with accomplishing Air Force program objectives. The approximate submission schedule is:
          Submit the FP after OMB submits the President's Budget to Congress (usually, in
           January) and for the fiscal year that begins the following October 1. Submitting the
           FP approximately 4 months before the beginning of the upcoming fiscal year enables
           MAJCOMs and FOAs to use very current information to build their O&M execution
           plan.
          The FP is the main vehicle for distributing anticipated funding (both direct and
           reimbursable) for the upcoming execution year in an equitable manner. It requires all
           organizational levels to contribute their corporate knowledge and expertise.
          Budget and functional staffs participate at each management level, including financial
           and budget working groups at base, command, and air staff.
   A4.1.2. Section I-The Commander's Statement. This statement includes assumptions,
   statements on force changes, mission changes, equipment changes, conversions, and any
   other changes that will affect financial requirements. It also addresses unique problems and
   states the impact of operating at the level of effort provided in the approved baseline
   program. With MAJCOM approval, include an optional Operating Budget Highlights
   section after the Commander's statement.
   A4.1.3. Section II-Summary Exhibits of the Financial Plan.            This section includes
   various exhibits that summarize financial requirements by budget activity, program element,
   and Department of Defense elements of expense.
A4.2. Submission Levels in the Financial Plan. The FP has two levels of funding: a Part I
funded level that equals the planning number provided with the call instructions; and a Part II
unfunded level that includes all requirements exceeding the planning number. Include these
levels of funding only in the financial plan year (FPY). Use prior 30 September actual obligation
data for the prior fiscal year (PFY). For the current fiscal year, use your operating budget
authority document (the current fiscal year call shows the exact date).
   A4.2.1. Price FPY requirements in constant dollars. Use higher rates or prices only if
   supported by documented evidence. Provide supporting detail in the narrative justification.
   A4.2.2. HQ USAF provides each MAJCOM and FOA a Part I planning number for the
   O&M direct program portion, based on the approved Air Force O&M program as submitted
   in the President's Budget (PB). For Part I, MAJCOMs must balance programs within
   anticipated fund availability. Provide an equitably distributed program in Part I that meets all
   mission essential requirements of the applicable unit, base, or command.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                         73


            Commands subdivide the Part I dollar amounts they receive from HQ USAF and
             distribute the amounts to bases or units for use as their Part I anticipated program
             planning numbers.
            Similarly, installations and units distribute the Part I to their responsibility centers
             (RCs).
   A4.2.3. Part II (also called unfunded) of the FP identifies requirements, by priority, that
   exceed Part I fund availability.
            Part II includes lower priority items than those in Part I; but commands should
             strive for a balanced program that doesn't have Part II requirements that would
             result in mission degradation or failure if not funded. However, planning number
             constraints may cause you to put some of these items in Part II.
            When directed by SAF/FMB, include in Part II certain requirements that don't have
             a priority lower than Part I, but are placed in Part II to receive separate Air Staff
             consideration. Call these Air Staff Directed Unfundeds.
A4.3. Financial Plan Revisions:
   A4.3.1. Prepare a revision, like the initial FP, in two parts.
            In Part I, distribute your expense and obligation authority in a way that best
             supports the mission within the approved OBA. You may realign requirements
             between budget activities and propose adjustments in limitations. Reexamine
             requirements and expense and obligation authority for reprogramming from one
             account to another as necessary to restore balance.
            In Part II, list lower priority items not included within the funding availability.
             Don't restate requirements disapproved in the initial financial plan unless new
             evidence supports the fund request. Apply the same test used for the Part I
             distribution in the initial FP to the revised distribution.
   A4.3.2. Commanders may request reprogramming of resources in a revision, but have less
   flexibility than in the initial FP. There are three reasons for this:
            The Budget Activity level was the only limitation in the base's initial FP. The base
             hadn't established direct obligation targets for each major responsibility center. The
             purpose of the initial financial plan was to obtain obligation authority sufficient to
             accomplish essential missions. In a revision, the approved operating budget
             authority is the "take-off point."
            In the initial FP there were minimal restrictions. Management distributed Part I
             operating budget amount within the BA.
            The installation or unit is several months into the fiscal year before higher authority
             acts on the revision. Therefore, until the issuance of an approved first revision, the
             only way to finance new requirements is for HQ USAF to redistribute obligation
             authority between commands and for the commands to redistribute between bases.
             Usually, the only way a command or base can get additional authority for a Part II
             item is for some other command or base (within the same command) to lose Part I
             authority.
 74                                            AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


A4.4. MAJCOM and HQ USAF review the requested revisions. In February, the bases hear
the results of these reviews. Commands (and in turn bases) can expect to receive:
   •       A new operating budget authority.
   •       A document containing narrative guidelines.
   •       An informational mechanized report containing program element and element of expense
           data.
A4.5. The operating budget authority contains quarterly phasing necessary to remain within the
quarterly authority provided the Air Force by OSD.
       •      At base level, the base distributes the quarterly authority in turn to RC/CC (See
              Chapter 5 concerning the loading of the operating budget authority).
       •      When a MAJCOM or base prepares a revision as of the end of a quarter, they submit
              a comparison of actual obligations with the quarterly target and explain significant
              variances.

          USING THE OPERATING BUDGET AND ALLOTMENT LEDGERS

A7.1. Operating Budget Ledger Report Options:
   A7.1.1. Description and Use of the Ledgers. These ledgers summarize accounting records
   kept in the general accounting and finance data system computer and provide the fund's
   status as of the current date or as of the previous end-of-month. They are two separate
   products with several options available for each. The computer prints the:
         Operating budget ledger (OBL) for operating budget accounts (fund types L and M).
         Allotment ledger for other appropriations and other reimbursement accounts (all fund
          types except L and M).
   A7.1.2. The computer displays and does two different fund availability computations.
         Base the first computation upon total obligation authority (TOA). Use fund
          availability balances (based upon TOA for management and planning purposes) only
          to compute.
         Base the second computation upon total actual authority (TAA). TAA represents the
          actual amount available for obligation.
         The Financial Services Accounting Liaison office and Budget use fund availability
          based upon computed TAA for fund certification and fund control.
A7.2. Operating Budget Ledger Report Options:
   A7.2.1. As-of Effective Date. Normally, this is date of the request or as of the end of the
   previous month.
   A7.2.2. List Level. Two choices are available by operating budget year (OBY).
         The first is the "Detail" level providing all data element line items including
          responsibility center/cost center (RC/CC) data within EEIC.
         Use the detail level ledger to determine the status of EEICs by RC/CC and program
          element (PE), as well as total status by BA, FY, OBY, OAC, or OBAN. Also,
          because this includes the fund summary record (FSR) and program summary record
          (PSR) addresses, it is an excellent reference for reprogramming and actual loading of
          targets. Annotate this listing with new target amounts for transfer to AF Form 1269,
          Request for Load or Change in Fund Targets.
         The second list level option is the "Summary" level that includes FY, OBY, and EEIC
          on the print line with the major controls of PEC, BA, operating agency code (OAC),
          and operating budget account number (OBAN). Show only whole dollar amounts in
          the request summary level.
A7.3. List Sequence. You may select the sequence of the list as EEIC within BA or EEIC
within program element. PE totals don't print with the EEIC within BA option.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                    87


A7.4. List Selection. You may select only specific OAC and OBAN or BA data. It is not
necessary to obtain all operating budget accounts when requiring a few. FSO and Financial
Analysis should request only those accounts required that day.
   •   You may select one, two, three, four, or five OACs and OBANs for a given day. If you
       need more than five OACs and OBANS, you can get all, provided you do not restrict
       your selection criteria.
   •   If you need only one BA within an OAC and OBAN, you may select it. If you need more
       than one BA, don't use the BA selection criteria. It now shows all BAs within the OAC
       and OBAN.
A7.5. List Content of the Operating Budget Ledger:
   A7.5.1. Operating Budget Ledger "Detail Level":
   A7.5.2. The first heading line, from left to right, contains the prepared date, product title
   (Operating Budget Ledger), as-of date, and the product control number (PCN). The PCN
   assigned to the OBL is SH069-191.
   A7.5.3. The second heading line, from left to right, contains the base name and accounting
   and disbursing station number (ADSN).
   A7.5.4. The third heading line, from left to right, contains the financial services office
   identifier code, the print site for distributive print system, the OAC and OBAN, BA (the
   listing continues to show "MFP" but is the BA) and PE (if applicable), and the requested
   listing level.

  A7.5.6. Columnar headings for amounts include:
        ANNUAL AUTH. This is the total annual obligation authority for fund type L
         records or the annual anticipated reimbursement authority for fund type M records.
         (Fund type L is Operating Budget-Other and fund type M is Reimbursements-
         Operating Budget funds only.)
        QUARTERLY AUTH. This is the total quarterly obligation authority for fund type
         L records or the quarterly anticipated reimbursement authority for fund type M
         records.
        AEP/COLL. This is the Accrued Expenditures Paid amount for fund type L records
         or the Filled Customer Orders Collected amount for fund type M records.
        AEU/UNCOLL. This is the Accrued Expenditures Unpaid amount for fund type L
         records or the Filled Customer Orders Uncollected amount for fund type M records.
        UOO/UFO. This is the Undelivered Orders Outstanding amount for fund type L
         records or the Unfilled Customer Orders amount for fund type M records.
        GROSS OBLIGATIONS. This is the total obligations amount for fund type L
         records or the total reimbursements realized amount for fund type M records.
        UNOBLG BALANCE. This is the balance of quarterly total authority not obligated
         for fund type L records. This balance is for management and planning purposes only.
        Don't use for certifying fund availability, especially if the funds include a
         reimbursable program. This is because of anticipated reimbursable authority included
         in the total quarterly obligation authority is available for obligation purposes only for
         realized reimbursements (filled plus unfilled customer orders).
        For fund type M (reimbursement) record this amount as the quarterly anticipated
         unrealized reimbursements portion.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                      89


            COMMITMENTS. This is the unobligated commitment amount for fund type L
             (obligation) records. This field will be blank for fund type M (reimbursement)
             records.
            UNCOMMITTED BALANCE. This is the balance of quarterly total authority not
             committed for fund type L (obligation) records. This provides a balance for
             management and planning purposes only. This field will be blank for fund type M
             (reimbursement) records.
  A7.5.7. Intermediate columnar headings include:
            OBLIGATIONS. Print this heading on each page before the first detail line
             containing obligation (fund type L) records.
            REIMBURSEMENTS. Print this heading on each page before the first detail line
             containing reimbursement (fund type M) records.
  A7.5.8. Each detail line prints at the level requested (summary or detail). Detail print
  requires two lines of print for the accounting classification and double-spacing. Summary
  level print requires one line and single-spacing. The five-digit EEIC for detail level print
  provides the first level of totals. The three-digit EEIC for detail and summary level print also
  provides totals. Also it provides one-digit totals for EEICs 2XXXX and 3XX for both detail
  and summary level print. For reimbursement data, it provides additional sales code totals.
  Lists at summary level have all the data for PFY and POBY records shown as one line item,
  EEIC ALL.
  A7.5.9. Each FY has totals. The FY totals exclude military personnel expenses (fund code
  9A) and show only O&M obligation authority and applicable obligations.
  A7.5.10. The detail lines and totals described above provide FY control of all funds using
  total obligation authority. After printing all obligation and reimbursement data for a given
  BA, it provides two special "totals" pages. The expense status special total page displays
  information for the current operating budget year. The fund status special totals pages
  display status of fund information based on total actual authority by fiscal year.

  A7.5.14. Three different categories of funds provide total program amounts: military
  personnel expense, aviation POL expense, and operation and maintenance other. For the
  other category, totals also provide for the reimbursable and direct programs. Columnar
  headings for amounts include:
           ANNUAL AUTH. This represents the annual target authority for records with
            current FY and COBY. This amount field applies to the other category only. For
            the total program this amount is the total annual obligation authority. For the
            direct program this amount is the total annual obligation authority minus the
            annual anticipated reimbursement authority. For the reimbursement program this
            amount is the annual anticipated reimbursement authority.
           QUARTERLY AUTH. This represents the cumulative quarterly obligation
            authority for records with current FY and COBY. This amount applies to the other
            category only. For the total program this amount is the quarterly obligation
            authority. For the reimbursement program this amount is the amount of earned
            reimbursements. For the direct program this amount is the total cumulative
            quarterly obligation authority minus the quarterly cumulative earned
            reimbursement authority.
           EXPENSES. For the other category, the expense column includes AEU plus AEP
            transactions that have occurred in CFY/PFY and COBY records. For the military
            personnel and aviation POL categories, include only CFY records. For the
            reimbursable program the amounts consist of filled customer orders uncollected
            plus filled customer orders collected. For the direct program the amounts consist
            of AEU plus AEP minus filled customer orders (uncollected and collected).
           NET CHANGE UOO. This amount field applies to the other category only. For
            the total program the amounts consist of CFY UOO minus AEU plus PFY and
            COBY AEP. For the reimbursable program the amount consists of CFY UOO
            minus PFY and COBY filled customer orders uncollected and collected. For the
            direct program the amount represents the net change in UOO for the total program
            as computed above, minus the net change in UOO for the reimbursable program as
            computed above.
           UNOBLIG BAL. This is the quarterly authority minus the expenses and net
            change in UOO.

           Provide total, reimbursable, and direct program amounts for each fiscal year
           (current and first through fifth).
  A7.5.18. Columnar headings for amounts include:
           TOT ANNUAL AUTH. This figure represents the Total Annual Obligation
            Authority for the total program amounts. For the reimbursable program amounts
            this figure represents annual anticipated reimbursements. For the direct program
            amounts this figure represents the total annual obligation authority minus the
            annual anticipated reimbursements.
           TOT QUARTER AUTH. This figure represents the Total Quarterly Authority
            for the total program amounts. For the reimbursable program amounts this figure
            represents quarterly earned reimbursements. For the direct program amounts this
            figure represents the total quarterly obligation authority plus the quarterly earned
            reimbursements.
           TOT ACTUAL AUTH. For the total program, this figure is the lesser of total
            quarterly authority or direct quarterly authority plus reimbursements realized. For
            the reimbursable program this figure represents the lesser of quarterly anticipated
            reimbursements or reimbursements realized. For the total program and
            reimbursable program at OAC/OBAN level for CFY, this figure represents the
            TAA computed at BA level accumulation. At BA level, it doesn't show TAA for
            PFY. The OAC/OBAN computes this TAA. The direct program provides no
            amount.
           AEU/UNCOLL. For the total program this figure represents the Accrued
            Expenditures Unpaid. For the reimbursable program this figure represents the
            Filled Customer Orders Uncollected. The direct program provides no amount.
           AEP/COLL. For the total program this figure represents the Accrued
            Expenditures Paid. For the reimbursable program this figure represents the Filled
            Customer Orders Collected. The direct program provides no amount.
           UOO/UFO. For the total program this figure represents the Undelivered Orders
            Outstanding. For the reimbursable program this figure represents the Unfilled
            Customer Orders. For the direct program this figure represents Undelivered
            Orders Outstanding without a sales code.
           COMM/REIM UOO. For the total program this figure represents the
            Unobligated Commitments. For the reimbursable program this figure represents
            Undelivered Orders Outstanding with a sales code. The direct program produces
            no amount.
           TOT OBLIGATIONS. For the total program this figure represents Total
            Obligations. For the reimbursable program this figure represents undelivered
            orders outstanding with a sales code plus filled customer orders. For the direct

             program this figure represents the Total Obligations from the total program, as
             computed above, minus the total obligations from the reimbursable program, as
             computed above.
            TOT COMM/REALIZE. For the total program this figure represents Total
             Commitments.    For the reimbursable program this figure represents
             Reimbursements Realized. For the direct program this figure represents Total
             Commitments minus the sum of UOO with a sales code and filled customer
             orders.
            UNOBG/UNREAL BAL. For the total program this figure represents TAA
             minus total obligations. For the reimbursable program this figure represents
             quarterly anticipated reimbursements minus reimbursements realized. The direct
             program or for the PFY total program at MFP level provides no amount.
            UNCOMMITTED BAL. For the total program this figure represents the
             uncommitted balance of the total actual quarterly authority. Compute by
             subtracting total unobligated commitments from total actual quarterly authority.
             The reimbursable and direct programs or for the prior fiscal year total program at
             MFP level provide no amount.
            % OBLIG. For the total program, this figure represents the percentage of total
             actual authority obligated. Compute by dividing total obligations by total actual
             authority. The reimbursable program or direct program doesn't compute a
             percentage. For the prior fiscal year total program, the MFP level doesn't
             compute percentage.
            % COMM. For the total program this figure represents the percentage of
             committed total actual authority. Compute by dividing total commitments by
             total actual authority. For the reimbursable program this figure represents the
             percentage of the quarterly anticipated realized reimbursements. Compute by
             dividing reimbursements realized by anticipated reimbursements. The direct
             program or for prior fiscal years total program at MFP level doesn't compute a
             computed.
            REMARKS. This heading contains any messages when certain conditions exist
             requiring management attention. The messages and their meanings are as
             follows:
            Over TAA-For the total program this message indicates that total obligations
             exceed TAA. For the direct program this message indicates that direct
             obligations exceed the direct TAA.
            C Over TAA-This message indicates that total commitments exceed TAA for the
             total program.
            RR Over W-This message indicates that reimbursements realized exceed
             quarterly anticipated reimbursements.

  A7.6.1. As-of Effective Date. Use the same instructions as for the OBL. (See paragraph
  8.5.1.)
  A7.6.2. List Level. Data can be at "Detail" level that includes all the accounting
  classification with the FSR and PSR addresses on each print line. You may specify the
  "Detail" level for both current and prior fiscal years.
        The "Summary" level ledger includes FY, BPAC or project, and EEIC within the
         major controls of fund code (FC), OAC, and allotment serial number (ASN).
        If there is no request for the "Detail" level for prior fiscal years, provide the data at
         the "Summary" level only.
  A7.6.3. List Sequence. For a list sequence for FC 29 (3600 appropriation) with fund types
  A (operating funds), C (procurement funds) and D (research funds), the system produces this
  list with controls by either BPAC or PEC. For other fund types, use EEICs within BPAC for
  totals.
  A7.6.4. List and Data Selection. You may select up to four fund types, three fund codes, or
  five OAC and ASN accounts. You can select specific fund type, fund code, or OAC and
  ASN to limit the report output. If you need all fund types (other than G, L, and M), don't use
  the fund type selection criterion. Fund code selection is within fund type only if fund type is
  the selection criterion. If you required all fund types, fund codes, OACS, and ASNs, use
  none of the above selection criteria and the report will be all-inclusive.
        The system includes data selection to allow users to obtain only the data required at
         the time. The advantages are unlimited and greatly reduce the size of the lists.
         Except for effective date, lists requested, print levels, and sequence, all report
         selections are independent of each other. Therefore, you can select one fund code, or
         fund type, or fund code within fund type within OAC and ASN, etc.
        When you make report requests, limit your requests only to the product required for
         effective financial management.

         These reports cover the base operating budget authority programs and provide for
          separate fund and expense reports.
         Fund reports identify annual and quarterly financial plan programs, cumulative
          commitments, and cumulative obligations for current fiscal year funds.
         Expense reports provide resource consumption information for current and prior
          fiscal years. The base-level management reports provide information below wing or
          operating budget account number level. Extracts (directly from these reports and the
          status ledgers, or produced by locally maintained retrievals) provide financial
          information for base-level management, such as the Financial analysis office,
          Financial Working Group, and Financial Management Board.

                  CIVILIAN MANPOWER REPORTING AND FUNDING

A9.1. Civilian Pay, Type of Payments To Employees, and Compensation Computation.
A9.2. Follow-On Activities:
   A9.2.1. Civilian Pay Cost Model. The output products described in Chapter 9 provide the
   baseline data inputs to the civilian pay cost model. When combined with other data, this
   model projects civilian personnel cost requirements for the Future Year Defense Program and
   related budget reports. This model estimates the civilian payroll impacts of anticipated
   changes in manpower utilization funding, and program composition.
   A9.2.2. Operation and Maintenance by Program Element Reports (OMPEs). The
   manpower and funding reporting system provides the baseline workyear data for the OMPEs.
   SAF analysts use the OMPEs in daily operations and this serves as basic support
   documentation for budget estimate's justification submitted to OSD and OMB.
   A9.2.3. Program Analysis. Analysis of consolidated data shows management whether
   actual operations are in line with planned operations. It permits necessary future adjustment
   of operating budgets to keep approved expense authority consistent with actual and planned
   civilian personnel programs.
A9.3. Types of Employment Positions in System:
   A9.3.1. A full-time employee is one scheduled to work regularly the number of hours or
   days required by the administrative workweek for their employment group. Full-time
   employees may occupy either permanent or other-than-permanent positions.
   A9.3.2. An established full-time permanent position is without time limit, or for a limited
   period of a year or more, or occupied for a year or more. The intent of establishing the
   position is not a relevant factor. The status (permanent or temporary) of an employee
   occupying a given position does not determine whether a position is permanent or other than
   permanent.
   A9.3.3. Positions other than full-time-permanent include direct hire civilian employment
   under the following conditions:
          Full-time employment in temporary positions established and occupied for a limited
           period of less than one year.
          Employment in part-time positions requiring work on a prearranged schedule of hours
           or days that is less than the prescribed schedule for full-time employees in the same
           group.
          Employment in intermittent positions as consultants and others who work on an
           irregular or occasional basis. Don't base the intermittent employee's hours or days of
           work on a prearranged schedule. Compensation equals the time actually employed or
           for actual rendered services.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                     101


A9.4. The Civilian Manpower and Funding Report (RCS: DD-COMP(AR)1092) combines
employment in full-time permanent and other-than-full-time permanent positions into major pay
systems categories defined in paragraph 9.5.
A9.5. Direct Hire Pay Systems Categories:
   A9.5.1. US Citizens, General Schedule. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of
   1990 contains the federal employee salary schedule with grades and bases of pay for all
   employees occupying Classification Act positions. This includes full-time permanent,
   temporary, part-time, and intermittent employment.
   A9.5.2. US Citizens, Prevailing Rate. In the Air Force most positions excluded from
   coverage of the Classification Act, as amended, are subject to the pay determination
   jurisdiction of the DoD wage funding authority established under the Coordinated Federal
   Wage System. This system establishes prevailing rate schedules for specific wage localities.
   A9.5.3. Non-US Citizens, Direct Hire. Under the direct hire system, the US Forces are the
   official employer of non-US citizen personnel and assume responsibility for all
   administrative and management functions about their employment. The provisions of a
   detailed operating agreement based upon a treaty or other formal action between the U.S. and
   other nations govern basic pay rates. U.S. determines the wages and salaries, usually based
   on locally prevailing rates. Report all direct hire non-US citizen employment in this
   category.
   A9.5.4. US Citizens, Youth Employment Programs, Direct Hire. This includes persons
   between the ages of 16 and 21 hired under the President's Youth Opportunity Program,
   (program provides meaningful employment opportunities for disadvantaged youths). Hire
   eligible youths under the Summer Youth Employment or Stay-in-School portions of the
   program. Appointments may be to either prevailing rate or Classification Act type positions,
   depending on Air Force needs and individual qualifications.
   A9.5.5. US Citizens, Other Wage Authority. This includes pay rates of employees
   occupying positions determined by wage-fixing authority other than the Classification Act, as
   amended, or wage funding authorities established under the Coordinated Federal Wage
   System. Report only U.S. citizens in these categories. Report all direct hire foreign nationals
   under the non-US citizens, direct hire category.
A9.6. Indirect Hire Foreign National Personnel, Labor Contracts With Foreign
Governments. The indirect hire system provides that the host government assume the
responsibility for meeting the needs of US forces for local national personnel. Rates of pay
normally conform to rates established and paid by the host government for comparable work in
the area. Charge these costs to EEIC 511. Charge separation allowances to non-US indirect hires
to EEIC 512.
A9.7. Types of Payments to Employees:
   A9.7.1. Overtime Payments (EEIC 391). Payments for services more than the established
   work period for basic compensation purposes.
   A9.7.2. Base Pay (EEIC 392). Basic compensation for the normally scheduled work period,
   computed at authorized or approved rates of pay for each type of employee.
102                                       AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


  A9.7.3. Holiday Payments (EEIC 392). Extra compensation for services of employees who
  work on holidays. Report as overtime pay for holiday work for more than the scheduled tour
  of duty.
  A9.7.4. Sunday Premium Pay (EEIC 392). Earned premium pay for costs above the basic
  rate for regularly scheduled work on Sundays. Sunday work of more than the scheduled tour
  of duty is overtime.
  A9.7.5. Nightwork Differential (EEIC 392). Additional pay for night work done during the
  hours 1800 to 0600. In overseas areas, designate other hours to correspond with customary
  hours of business in the locality. It excludes wage employee shift differentials that are in the
  basic compensation for all pay purposes.
  A9.7.6. Hazardous Duty, Danger Pay, and Environmental Pay (EEIC 392). These are costs
  above the basic rate because of assignments involving hazardous duty or physical hardships
  in the work area.
  A9.7.7. Post Differential (EEIC 392). Base costs (above the basic rate for service at
  hardship posts abroad) on conditions of environment differing substantially from those in the
  contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia.
  A9.7.8. Staffing Differential (EEIC 392). These are costs above the basic rate to retain
  employees in selected grades and occupation groups.
  A9.7.9. Supervisor Differential (EEIC 392). Costs above the basic rates for General
  Schedule supervisors who supervise employees in other pay plans who receive a higher rate
  of total pay than does the supervisor.
  A9.7.10. Physicians Comparability Allowance (EEIC 392). Costs paid to recruit and retain
  highly qualified Government physicians.
  A9.7.11. Remote Work Site Allowance (EEIC 392). Costs paid for personnel assigned to
  duty, except temporary duty, when (1) the site is so remote from the nearest established
  communities, or when (2) suitable places of residence require an appreciable degree of
  expense, hardship, and inconvenience, beyond that normally encountered by an employee in
  metropolitan commuting to and from his residence and such worksite.

   is in addition to the foreign post allowance and isn't available to those employees occupying
   permanent quarters at a post.
   A9.7.33. Separate Maintenance Allowance (EEIC 393). This includes payments to help an
   employee forced to meet the additional expenses of maintaining the employee's spouse or

   A9.7.34. Temporary Lodging Allowance (EEIC 393). Payments for the reasonable cost of
   temporary quarters incurred by the employee in a foreign area for not more than 3 months
   after arrival or 1 month before final departure.
A9.8. Compensation Computation:
   A9.8.1. Compensable Hours. Compute employee's regular pay based on regular hours.
   Compensable hours, for a compensated employee, include periods of annual or sick leave
   and time off for legal holidays. Exclude overtime or other premium pay hours. A fiscal year
   has 2080, 2088, or 2096 compensable hours.
A9.9. Workyears. A workyear is the equivalent of one employee being in a pay status for the
number of compensable hours in a fiscal year or more than one employee being in a pay status
part of the year for which the total hours paid are equal to the number of compensable hours in
the fiscal year. Workyear equivalents represent a part of a total workyear actually used during
any fractional part of the fiscal year.

   The Civilian Manpower and Funding Report system computes workyear equivalents for each
month by dividing the number of compensable hours used during the month by the number of
compensable hours in the year.
    For example, March 1994 has 184 compensable hours (23 days times 8 hours) and FY 1994
has 2,088 compensable hours (261 days times 8 hours). Assume you used 18,400 compensable
hours during July, then the workyear equivalent is 8.81 (18,400 divided by 2,088).
A9.10. Average Costs Computation:
   A9.10.1. Compute the basic average salary by dividing the total obligations for base pay of
   each type of employment by the applicable worker equivalents or workyears for a given
   month, quarter, or year. For example, assuming July 1994 total obligations for General
   Schedule employment of $264,300 and a workyear equivalent of 8.81, the basic average
   salary would be $264,300 divided by 8.81 or $30,000.00.
   A9.10.2. Compute the overall average salary by dividing the total obligations for total
   personnel compensation for each type of employment by the applicable workyear equivalents
   or workyears for a given month or quarter of the year. Continuing with the example and
   assuming July total obligations for General Schedule employment of $217,800, then the
   overall average salary would be $272,300 divided by a workyear equivalent of 8.81, or
   $30,908.06 (rounded to $30,908).
   A9.10.3. Compute workyear cost by dividing the total obligations for total personnel
   compensation and benefits of each type of employment by the applicable workyear
   equivalents or workyears for a given month, quarter, or year. Continuing with the example,
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                   105


   and assuming fourth quarter total obligations for General Schedule employment to be
   $984,244, then the work-year cost would be $984,244 divided by a workyear equivalent of
   25.29, or $38,918.30 (rounded to $38,918).
A9.11. Manpower Utilization. Compute based on the relationship between compensable time
used and compensable time available during a given period (day, month, quarter, or fiscal year).
Table 9.1 includes the number of available workdays for each month and quarter, fiscal years
1994-1996. Express manpower utilization data with workhour, workday, workmonth, or
workyear equivalents. Table 9.2 shows examples of the various relationships.
A9.12. Manpower Conversion. When the utilization is in one of the terms, (workhours,
workdays, workmonths, workquarters, or workyears), convert it to any of the other terms by
applying the following formulas. Table 9.2 provides data used to illustrate these formulas.
Round accounts for slight variances.
   A9.12.1. Workhours Are Known:
   A9.12.2. Convert to workdays by dividing the number of compensable hours used by the
   number of compensable hours in the period and multiplying the result by the number of
   compensable days in the period. For example, July workhour use of 18,400 hours divided by
   184 hours equals 100, times 23 days, equals 2300 workdays.
   A9.12.3. Convert to workmonths by dividing the number of compensable hours used by the
   number of compensable hours in the period and multiply the result by the number of months
   in the period. For example, first quarter workhour use of 52,800 hours divided by 528 hours
   equals 100, times 3 months, equals 300 workmonths.
   A9.12.4. Convert to workquarter equivalents by dividing the number of compensable hours
   used by the number of compensable hours in the quarter. For example, July workhour use of
   18,400 hours divided by 528 hours equals 34.85 workquarter equivalents.
   A9.12.5. Convert to workyear equivalents by dividing the number of compensable hours
   used by the number of compensable hours in the year. For example, first quarter workhour
   use of 52,800 hours divided by 2,088 equals 25.28 workyear equivalents.
   A9.12.6. Workdays Are Known:
   A9.12.7. Convert to workhours by dividing the number of compensable days used by the
   number of compensable days in the period and multiplying the result by the number of
   compensable hours in the period. For example, July workday use of 2,300 days divided by
   23 days equals 100, times 184 hours, equals 18,400 workhours.
   A9.12.8. Convert to workmonths by dividing the number of compensable days used by the
   number of compensable days in the period and multiplying the result by the number of
   months in the period. For example, FY 1994 workday utilization of 26, 100 divided by 261
   days equals 100, times 12 months, equals 1,200 workmonths.
   A9.12.9. Convert to workquarter equivalents by dividing the number of compensable days
   used by the number of compensable days in the quarter. For example, July workday
   utilization of 2,300 days divided by 66 days equals 34.85 workquarter equivalents.
106                                     AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


  A9.12.10. Convert to workyear equivalents by dividing the number of compensable days
  used by the number of compensable days in the year. For example, fourth quarter workday
  utilization of 6,600 divided by 261 days equals 25.29 workyear equivalents.
  A9.12.11. Workmonths Are Known:
  A9.12.12. Convert to workhours by dividing the number of compensable workmonths used
  by the number of months in the period and multiply the result by the number of compensable
  hours in the period. For example, fourth quarter workmonth utilization of 300 divided by 3
  months equals 100, times 528 hours, equals 52,800 workhours.
  A9.12.13. Convert to workdays by dividing the number of compensable workmonths used
  by the number of months in the period and multiply the result by the number of compensable
  days in the period. For example, fourth quarter workmonths of 300 divided by 3 months
  equals 100 times 66 days, equals 6,600 workdays.
  A9.12.14. Convert to workquarter equivalents by dividing the number of compensable
  workmonths used by the number of months in the period and multiplying the result by the
  percentage relationship of the compensable hours or days in the month to the compensable
  hours or days in the quarter. For example, July workmonth utilization of 100 divided by 1
  month equals 100 times 34.85 percent (184 hours divided by 528 hours or 23 days divided by
  66 days), equals 34.85 workquarter equivalents.
  A9.12.15. Convert to workyear equivalents by dividing the number of compensable
  workmonths used by the number of months in the period and multiplying the result by the
  percentage relationship of the compensable hours or days in the month to the compensable
  hours or days in the year. For example, first quarter workmonth utilization of 300 divided by
  3 months equals 100, times 25.28 percent (528 hours divided by 2088 hours or 66 days
  divided by 261 days), equals 25.28 workyear equivalents.
  A9.12.16. Workquarters Equivalents Are Known:
  A9.12.17. Convert to workhours by multiplying the compensable workquarter equivalents
  used by the number of compensable hours in the quarter. For example, July workquarter
  utilization of 34.85 workquarter equivalents multiplied by 528 equals 18,400 workhours.
  A9.12.18. Convert to workdays by multiplying the compensable workquarter equivalents
  used by the number of compensable days in the quarter. For example, July workquarter
  utilization of 34.85 workquarter equivalents multiplied by 66 equals 2,300 workdays.
  A9.12.19. Convert to workmonths by multiplying the number of compensable workquarter
  equivalents used by the number of compensable hours in the period. For example, July
  workquarter utilization of 34.85 workquarter equivalents multiplied by 528 hours equals
  18,400 divided by 184 hours, equals 100 workmonths.
  A9.12.20. Convert to workyear equivalents by multiplying the number of compensable
  workquarter equivalents used by the number of compensable hours in the quarter and
  dividing the result by the number of compensable hours in the year. For example, July
  workquarter utilization of 34.85 workquarter equivalents multiplied by 528 hours equals
  18,400 divided by 2,088 hours, equals 8.81 workyear equivalents.
  A9.12.21. Workyear Equivalents Are Known:
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                   107


  A9.12.22. Convert to workhours by multiplying the number of compensable workyear
  equivalents used by the number of compensable hours in the year. For example, July
  workyear utilization of 8.81 workyear equivalents times 2,088 hours equals 18,395 (18,400)
  workhours (varies slightly from actual hours because of rounding of workyear equivalents to
  the nearest hundredth).
  A9.12.23. Convert to workdays by multiplying the number of compensable workyear
  equivalents used by the number of compensable days in the year. For example, July
  workyear definition of 8.81 workyear equivalents times 261 days equals 2,300 workdays.
  A9.12.24. Convert to workmonths by multiplying the number of compensable workyear
  equivalents used by the number of compensable days in the year and dividing the result by
  the number of compensable days in the period. For example, July workyear utilization of
  8.81 workyear equivalents times 261 days equals 2,300 divided by 23 days, equals 100
  workmonths.
  A9.12.25. Convert to workquarter equivalents by multiplying the number of compensable
  workyear equivalents used by the number of compensable days in the year and dividing the
  result by the number of compensable days in the quarter. For example, July workyear
  utilization of 8.81 workyear equivalents times 261 days equals 2,300, divided by 66 days,
  equals 34.85 workquarter equivalents.
  A9.12.26. Conversion Formulas Recap. The foregoing formulas illustrate that it is possible
  to compute utilization data in any terms when you know actual utilization in one of the terms.
  In addition, the formulas permit a single formula to apply equally to utilization during any
  part of a fiscal year. Recognize that:
  A9.12.27. Known hours used produces the most accurate utilization.
  A9.12.28. In most instances, you lose some minor degree of accuracy when applying the
  formulas to convert from other than actual workhours.
  A9.12.29. Simplify some of the formulas departing from data presented in the manpower
  utilization sample or when applied to the utilization data for only one month. As an
  example:
        To simplify the formula for converting workhours to workdays, as stated in paragraph
         A9.12.22 divide the workhour utilization for any period by the number of
         compensable hours in a day (8).
        For quarterly data, follow the formula for converting workhours to workmonths, as
         stated in paragraph A9.12.23. But, to simplify when applying the formula to data for a
         single month, because it produces the same result either by dividing the number of
         compensable hours used by the number of compensable hours in the period and
         multiplying the result by the number of months in the period (1) or simply by
         dividing the number of compensable hours used by the number of compensable hours
         in the period (1 month).

                 WIMS, OLIVIMS, AND OTHER MANAGEMENT REPORTS

A10.1. WIMS and OLIVIMS Management Reports. Cost Systems-Work Information
Management System (WIMS), And On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System
(OLVIMS) is a system of records and files designed to comply with data capture and reporting
requirements of DoDR 4500.36-R. The Internal Review Control process certifies that OLVIMS
properly handles financial data.     These systems form a basis for planning and preparing
operating budgets and financial plans.
A10.2. WIMS. This system provides an integrated data base supporting various civil engineer
functions including cost accounting, real property accounting, labor reporting, work control
scheduling, workload planning and programming, and military family housing (MFH)
management. It accumulates and reports costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of all
real properly facilities and equipment, regardless of funding sources. WIMS works with the
standard base-level general accounting system.
          Use the actual performance cost data to compile and justify budget estimates, to
           improve job performance techniques, and to establish standard costs to evaluate
           performance.
          Use it to track the cost of design and construction management of military construction
           projects, when the Air Force is the design or construction agent. FSO inputs update the
           WIMS records automatically.
   A10.2.1. FSO cost inputs provide for:
               Update of the work order system.
               Update direct to the civil engineering cost accounting system.
               Expense transactions used for shop rate analysis.
   A10.2.2. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) manages the cost accounting system and ensures
   proper costing within the system. The BCE:
               Ensures proper work order number and cost account information.
               Monitors limitation on minor construction and military family housing accounts.
               Does analysis of cost center shop rates.
               Manages productivity (direct productive hours versus total available hours).
               Ensures timely and accurate reporting in the RCS: HAF-CEO(SA&A) 7101 Civil
                Engineering Cost Report.
   A10.2.3. FSO enters data into the standard base-level general accounting system. A cost
   system indicator (CSI) identifies transactions pertaining to WIMS. The computer extracts
   CSI transactions and creates data entries for WIMS as part of the end-of-day processing.
   A10.2.4. Enter materiel transactions into the automated materiel management system.
   Upon receipt of the BCE materiel document, the SBSS accumulates the transactions for
   expensing to BCE organizations. The organization's record by EEICs accumulates the data.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                       109


                 FSO processes materiel and supplies bought by the BCE through local
                  procurement into the WIMS program.
                 Charge non-DBOF EEICs when FSO receives the invoice for recording in the
                  general A&F system.
                 The extract program of WIMS transactions has an edit which drops all non-DBOF
                  EEIC transactions to prevent cost duplication in WIMS.
     A10.2.5. A WIMS program produces a schedule of reimbursements and refunds report (PCN
     SH 100-45 1) monthly in three parts. This report enables FSO to bill customers for services
     done by the BCE.
        A10.2.5.1. Part One. Part one of the report is a detailed audit list of the charges incurred
        against reimbursable and refundable work orders and cost centers by control center,
        control installation, cost account, organization code, work order number, RC/CC, and
        EEIC. Prepare part one for each reimbursement and refund indicator (RRI) that incurred
        a cost.
        A10.2.5.2. Part Two. Part two contains both current month and cumulative fiscal year
        costs. The current month is for FSO use in posting reimbursements and refunds. Prepare
        this for each RRI and summarized by EEIC and Department of Defense (DoD) functional
        category (FC). The relationship between the DoD FC and RC/CC is:
DoD FC Type Service                                         RC/CC


9    Operation of Utilities                                  XX440E
10    Maintenance of Real Property                           XX440N
11 Minor Construction and Alterations                        XX440V
12 Other Engineering Support                                 XX4405


        A10.2.5.3. Part Three. Part three of the report is for BCE use only.
        A10.2.5.4. Record reimbursable and refundable transactions to EEICs and cost centers
        either as shop rate computed costs distributed to various EEICs, or as actual costs that
        retain the identity of the EEIC cited originally. The exceptions to this rule are
        summarized:
                 Medical facility charges to reimbursable section.
                 DBOF-T costs to EEIC 48X (Utilities) and EEIC 521 (Maintenance of Facilities)
                  and reimbursed to either shop rate or originally cited EEICs.
                 Air Force Reserve costs to EEIC 592 and reimbursed to either shop rate or
                  originally cited EEICs.
     A10.2.6. Identify cost centers in the BCE organization as either actual time accounting
     (ATA) or exception time accounting (ETA). No cost center can combine ATA and ETA.
     Identify services done by ATA cost centers to a job or work order. Accumulate actual time
 110                                        AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


   and materiel issues (both BCE inputs) by the job or work order number. (Total cost equals
   total time multiplied by a predetermined shop rate, plus direct materiel cost, equals total
   cost.) Work orders established in the WIMS work order master file identify services
   financed from BCE funds or on a reimbursable and refundable basis. Use an RRI and a
   unique work order number to identify service. (The RRI identifies the funding source for
   FSO to bill customers.)
   A10.2.7. Review monthly ATA computed cost center shop rates and update as necessary. A
   WIMS computer program provides a shop rate analysis report for monitoring shop rates. It
   compares shop rate computed costs to actual costs.
              Compute a separate shop rate for each ATA cost center. Use shop rates for costs
               not predetermined before expensed on a work order or job order. The shop rate is a
               dollar-per-hour value to disburse all actual cost center expenses incurred in the
               daily cost center operations.
              The factors used to develop the shop rate project actual cost center expenses for the
               fiscal year and the direct work hours used during the same period. The total
               projected actual cost center expenses divided by the total projected direct work
               hours is the shop rate. Each month WIMS automatically revises the computed shop
               rate, based on the moving average of the previous 12 months of actual cost center
               expenses. Normally, these costs are:
                   Military Pay (excluded from DoD reimbursements).
                   Civilian Pay.
                   Travel Per Diem.
                   Foreign National, Indirect Hires.
                   Productive Indirect Labor.
                   Supplies and Equipment (bench stock, personal clothing and tool items,
                    equipment, and volume deliveries).
              Mobile Equipment Rental.
   A10.2.8. The management products described below are the principal BCE reports for
   financial management. Various other management reports and detail reports are available to
   monitor applicable functional area transactions, such as facility projects, work, orders, and
   manpower. (See Attachment 10 for details) Output products from WIMS programs for
   resource management are:
              Shop Rate Analysis Report.
              CE Cost Report (RCS: HAF-CEO(SAA) 7101).
A10.3. OLVIMS. This system operates at base-level, using data originating in motor vehicle
activities, and accepts data generated by the standard base supply system (SBSS). OLVIMS
passes data to general accounting and finance A&F system, but doesn't accept any A&F data.
          The standard base supply and accounting system accepts selected elements of data
           generated by OLVIMS.
AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011                                                  111


        The main objective is to provide all levels of management complete and reliable
         monetary records and to provide accounting controls over revenues, expenses, costs,
         assets, liabilities, and financial plans applicable to motor vehicle operations and
         maintenance.
        OLVIMS flows data from the SBSS, and FSO to the motor vehicle activity and back
         through the standard base-level general accounting system. Output data provides useful
         management reports for making decisions, taking management action, and supporting
         an effective preventive vehicle maintenance program.
        Use weekly, monthly, quarterly, and as-required reports for scheduling maintenance
         services and monitoring expenses.
        Major command vehicle managers use these reports in the overall management of the
         vehicle fleet.
  A10.3.1. Transactions for OLVIMS start in Transportation or the SBSS. The Transportation
  Maintenance Control and Analysis (MC&A) section puts the following data into OLVIMS:
  AF Form 15, USAF Invoice; SF 149, US Government National Credit Card; AF Form 9,
  Request for Purchase, Contract Operated Parts Store (COPARS), SF 44, Purchase
  Order - Invoice Voucher (Storage Safeguard Form) and Internal Merchant Purchase
  Authorization Card (IMPAC).
        A10.3.1.1. AF Form 15. Transportation uses this form only for off-base purchases of
        petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL), services, and maintenance.
              Send all AF Forms 15 to DFAS-DAO to prepare an SF 1034 payment voucher.
              Charge oil and lubricants to RC/CC XX4210, EEIC 612. Charge services,
               maintenance, and other supplies to RC/CC XX4242, EEIC 569.
              Cite fuel purchases to the defense business operations fund fuels division
               appropriation.
        A10.3.1.2. SF 149. Use credit cards for off-base purchases of POL, services, and
        maintenance. Make charges to the same RC/CCs and EEICs as in above.
        A10.3.1.3. AF Form 9. Use AF Form 9 for commercial repair of vehicles and the
        recapping of tires. Charge commercial repairs to RC/CC XX4242, EEIC 569 and
        charged recapping tires to RC/CC XX4248, EEIC 569.
        A10.3.1.4. COPARS. Use a funded blanket delivery order (BDO) for a time mutually
        agreed on by FSO Transportation, Contracting, and FMA. The BDO sets up the dollar
        limitation on the parts issued by COPARS during the established time. Before the end of
        the BDO time, Transportation tells FSO the unused amount of remaining purchases to
        decommit any excess funds. At least once a month the contractor sends an invoice and
        original sales slips through Transportation and Contracting to FSO, that prepares the
        voucher and makes payment.
  A10.3.2. Accounting and Finance enters COPARS, AF Form 15, SF 149, and contractor
  maintenance invoices daily into the FSO general accounting system. FSO furnishes MCA
  with the OLVIMS extract list daily to ensure the accuracy of data entry.
 112                                      AFI65-601V2_AFOTECSUP_I 16 September 2011


   A10.3.3. The MCA work center of the base motor vehicle activity is the focal point for
   processing data, doing analysis, and distributing reports. MCA forwards to FSO all
   COPARS invoices, AF Form 15 invoices, AF Form 9, and contractor invoices. MCA:
          Enters daily the data automation entry from SF 149 invoices containing only fuel and
           oil issues.
          Personnel must be familiar with each source document and do a visual audit of each
           form for missing data elements or unreasonable entries before data entry.
   A10.3.4. Base Supply processes materiel transactions through the SBSS computer for each
   issue to or turn-in by Transportation. Supply forwards daily supply transaction ASCII files
   to MC&A for materiel cost entry into OLVIMS. For those bases supported by automatic fuel
   dispensing and recording equipment, Supply also furnishes MC&A with transaction ASCII
   files for entry of fuel costs and quantity into OLVIMS. As a check for issue accuracy,
   Supply furnishes Materiel Control an issue or turn-in detail list of those items processed for
   Transportation.
   A10.3.5. MC&A distributes for management action all reports, listings, and files produced
   by and received from Data Automation. Each major command ensures that its bases use the
   OLVIMS reports to determine efficiency and measure effectiveness of vehicle activities.
          ARAM7A and ARAM7B (Vehicle Historical File). Contains vehicle maintenance
           historical data in monthly sequence and includes 1 year of accumulated data.
          ARAQ6T (Vehicle Summary File).             Contains monthly vehicle management
           summary records.
          ARAD6T (Master File). Contains records of vehicles, employees, bench stock, open
           work orders, etc. Load this daily and run these files through OLVIMS.
          ARANIA (Automated Analysis History File).            Contains up to 24 months of
           automated analysis records for each OLVIMS site.
          AR-AN3A (Automated Analysis Summary File). Contains the mean, upper and
           lower control limits, trend points, and USAF or MAJCOM goals for each OLVIMS
           site.
   A10.3.6. Existing instructions require that Transportation provide the FSO with data
   necessary to bill and collect for reimbursable or refundable costs of direct maintenance man-
   hours, materials, and services used in repairing a vehicle.
          The transportation officer (TO) submits a list of vehicle maintenance customers or
           potential customers through the financial analysis office to FSO for required changes
           at the beginning of each fiscal year. FSO annotates the list of customers as either
           reimbursable or refundable and returns it to the TO through the financial analysis
           office.
          Processing the list through Budget helps to ensure the proper management of the
           reimbursable program. (Guidance on reimbursements and refunds is in AFI 65-601,
           volume 1 and in DFAS-DE Regulations 177-101 and 177-102.)
