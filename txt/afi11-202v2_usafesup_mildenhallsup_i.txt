                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.
       3.2.1.2. Designate OG Stan/Eval (OGV) flight examiners (see paragraph 4.2.3).
       3.2.1.3. Provide the means to procure the necessary materials for mission planning, pre-
       flight briefings, and flying supervision.
       3.2.1.3. (USAFE) Attachment 10 (Added) of this supplement contains guidance for the
       minimum materials to be maintained in squadron briefing and flight planning rooms.
          3.2.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Any material used in the planning, briefing, supervising
          (e.g. Operations Supervisor/SOF), or execution of flying operations will be current
          and correct. See paragraph A10.2 (Added).
       3.2.1.4. Provide a suitable Stan/Eval testing area.
       3.2.1.4. (USAFE) OG/CC will consider a ―suitable stan/eval testing area‖ as one that
       provides a quiet, distraction-free atmosphere and allows monitoring of examinees by
       stan/eval personnel.
          3.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) OG/CCs may allow the squadrons to set up suitable
          testing areas as long as OGV certifies the testing areas as being in compliance with
          the above guidance.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations (see Chapter 9).
       3.2.1.6. Chair the SEB.
       3.2.1.7. Establish procedures to implement MAJCOM-mandated Stan/Eval software.
          3.2.1.7.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) 100 OG procedures for the use of PEX are
          contained in this supplement.
   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
       3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
       of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
       Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
16                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


     3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
     Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
     Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
        3.2.2.2.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) CCV personnel will utilize a locally produced
        AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, checklist to review Forms 8. SELOs
        will be the first step in quality control all Forms 8. Additionally, all Forms 8 will be
        reviewed by a senior member of CCV and OGV prior to being filed in the member’s
        FEF.
     3.2.2.3. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
     (FEFs). If not maintained by the squadron Stan/Eval function, maintain unit FEFs.
        3.2.2.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) All FEFs will be maintained by the 351 ARS.
     3.2.2.4. Establish procedures for requisite Aircrew Exams (see Chapter 6).
     3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
        3.2.2.5.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
        discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
        instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.
        3.2.2.5.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
        3.2.2.5.5. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see
        Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date
        the trend was identified.
        3.2.2.5.5. (USAFE) Trend guidance in the unit supplement will include minimum
        sample size and percentages that constitute a trend. Trend information will be
        archived for 2 years.
            3.2.2.5.5.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Unit Trend Program. The purpose of
            the 100 OG trend program is to recognize positive and negative trends and
            recommend or initiate changes to training programs and directives. The goals are
            to identify and correct negative trends/weak areas among aircrew and to recognize
            positive trends in order to maximize the benefits of successful training techniques.
            3.2.2.5.5.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) Trend information will be compiled from
            all flight and cargo evaluations and written examinations. Trending information
            can be positive or negative, and negative trending information is not required to
            be associated with a checkride downgrade unless a downgrade is required. The
            SEFE will provide comments on an AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet,
            or the current notetaker coversheet for any positive or negative areas to be
            included in trend information. Trend information from written exams will be
            tracked in accordance with paragraph 6.3.3.1 of this supplement.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                          17


            3.2.2.5.5.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) The minimum sample size to constitute a
            trend is five. A positive trend is indicated when 25 percent or more of the
            individuals graded in any area received a positive comment in the trend tracking
            application. Similarly, a negative trend is indicated when 25 percent or more of
            the individuals graded in any area receive a negative comment.
            3.2.2.5.5.4. (Added-MILDENHALL) Weak Area of Interest Definition. At
            OG/CC discretion, but usually when 15-24 percent of the individuals graded in
            the area receive a negative comment on the tracking application.
            3.2.2.5.5.5. (Added-MILDENHALL) Written Examinations Trends. A negative
            trend is indicated when the pass rate for a given question on a requisite test
            averages less than 85 percent.
            3.2.2.5.5.6. (Added-MILDENHALL) Documentation and Tracking:
               3.2.2.5.5.6.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Quarterly Trends Report. CCV will
               compile and forward a quarterly trends report, to include areas of interest, to
               OGV using the statistical data and evaluator comments. This report will
               consist of data from the previous two quarters for all aircrew positions on all
               evaluations.
               3.2.2.5.5.6.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) The OGV office will brief all open
               trends (both new and previously identified) and areas of interest at the
               Stan/Eval Board (SEB). The SEB will recommend corrective action and
               assign an OPR/OCR. OPRs shall take corrective action on negative trends
               within one month.
               3.2.2.5.5.6.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) The 100 OG/CC (or CD) will
               determine the status of any previous trends (OPEN or CLOSED) with OGV
               recommendation. Normally, a trend will be closed when the item does not
               appear as a trend for two consecutive quarters. An area of interest will
               normally be closed when the item does not appear as an area of interest the
               next quarter. If circumstances require, 100 OG/CC (or CD) may extend a
               trend or an area of interest as an OPEN item pending satisfactory resolution of
               the matter.
     3.2.2.6. Conduct supplementary evaluations as directed by the OG/CC.

                                   FLIGHT EXAMINERS

4.1. General. The evaluation portion of the Aircrew Stan/Eval Program is administered by
flight examiners at the HHQ and unit levels.
4.2. Selection.
   4.2.1. Select flight examiners from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors
   (EXCEPTION: Senior flight examiners, see paragraph 4.4.).
   4.2.2. The chief of the respective MAJCOM or NAF Stan/Eval function will select and
   designate in writing HHQ flight examiners. Copies of the designation memo will be sent to
   all units where HHQ flyers are attached to fly.
   4.2.2. (USAFE) USAFE/A3T will select those aircrew in HQ USAFE who will be
   designated as HHQ SEFEs. The designation will be documented by USAFE/A3TV and
   distributed IAW paragraph 4.2.2 USAFE/A3TV will review/update the document as needed
   or annually, whichever occurs first.
       4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE SEFEs will be qualified/certified in as many
       special missions as practical in their respective MDS/crew position for which USAFE
       units are tasked.
   4.2.3. The OG/CC and SQ/CC will each select, and designate in writing, all OGV and
   Squadron flight examiners (respectively).
       4.2.3.1. The OG/CC and SQ/CC may designate additional OGV or squadron flight
       examiners (respectively) who are not assigned to OGV or the squadron when necessary
       to meet unique unit requirements.
           4.2.3.1.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) The 351 ARS Letter of Xs will serve as the ―in
           writing‖ designation of flight examiners.
       4.2.3.2. Annotate all flight examiners [to include attached and Senior flight examiners
       (see paragraph 4.4) in the squadron letter of certification and record in SEB minutes (see
       Attachment 2).
       4.2.3.2. (USAFE) See Attachment 11 (Added) for further guidance on the Squadron
       Letter of Certification (a.k.a. Letter of Xs).
       4.2.3.3. (Added-USAFE) OGV SEFEs will be qualified/certified (as appropriate) in as
       many special missions as practical.
       4.2.3.3. (MILDENHALL) Unit Standardization/Evaluation Flight Examiner (SEFE)
       Upgrade Procedures. Before performing duties as a SEFE, candidates will complete
       SEFE training and certification in accordance with Attachment 13, SEFE Training and
       Certification Letter (Added).
       4.2.3.4. (Added-USAFE) SQ/CCs will strive to qualify/certify (as appropriate)

 24                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


   4.2.4. For AFRC and ANG units:
      4.2.4.1. The USAF advisor may be designated as a flight examiner.
      4.2.4.2. Air Technician (AT)/Air Reserve Technician (ART) /Active Guard and Reserve
      (AGR) serving in a military position that does not require maintaining mission
      ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as flight examiners.
4.3. Flight Examiner Functions.
   4.3.1. Conduct aircrew evaluations IAW Chapter 5 and document IAW Chapter 7.
   4.3.2. Maintain qualification as instructors (N/A for senior flight examiners, see paragraph
   4.4.2).
   4.3.2. (USAFE) The intent of parent AFI guidance is that SEFEs maintain ―full‖ instructor
   qualification. See paragraph 5.2.4.2.3 (USAFE).
      4.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) CAF SEFE flying requirements. These requirements are
      for the purpose of SEFE “active” status only and do not supersede AFI 11-202 Vol 1
      and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1 flying requirements for MR aircrew in CMR/BMC billets.
          4.3.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) To maintain an ―active‖ status (i.e. able to evaluate AF
          Form 8/8a qualifying events), SEFEs will adhere to the following minimum flying
          requirements. See Figure 4.1 (Added) to aid in determining CMR SEFE ―active‖
          status.
              4.3.2.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) For the purpose of this guidance, the use of
              ―sortie‖ includes both flights and sims as allowed by the MDS RAP Tasking
              Memorandum (RTM).
              4.3.2.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) ―In-active‖ status does not necessarily equate to
              being decertified as a SEFE. Decertification is an OG/CC (for OGV-designated
              evaluators) or SQ/CC (for SQ-designated evaluators) action (reference
              paragraph A11.4 (Added)).
          4.3.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) All SQ-designated SEFEs, must maintain CMR status.
          SQ/CC, SQ/DO and API-6/B flight examiners under the OG/CC’s command must, at
          a minimum, maintain BMC status. As used in this guidance, CMR/BMC ―status‖ is
          based solely on sortie rate (ground training items tied to CMR/BMC status are not
          applicable).
          4.3.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) HHQ SEFEs and Senior Flight Examiners (see
          paragraph 4.4), to the maximum extent practical, will maintain BMC status based
          solely on sortie rate (lookback IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, commensurate with their
          API number [6/8/B/D]).
          4.3.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Waiver. The following guidance is based on the AFI
          11-2MDS Vol 1 understanding that the previous month’s sortie rate determines the
          current month’s CMR/BMC status.
              4.3.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) The OG/CC may waive the CMR-status
              requirement to BMC status, but for no more than two consecutive months. BMC
              ―probation‖ rules do not apply for BMC status waivers.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             25


              4.3.2.1.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Insert a copy of approved waivers into the
              individual’s training folder (or equivalent training documentation). Summarize all
              approved waivers by recording in SEB minutes (see Attachment 2).

Figure 4.1. (Added-USAFE) Determining a CMR SEFE’s ―Active‖ Status




   4.3.3. Administer evaluations only within their weapon system/aircrew specialty and only
   evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification and/or certification.
   EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI11-2MDS, Vol 2.
      4.3.3.1. Waiver authority for flight examiners to evaluate mission/skill sets in which they
      are not certified is the OG/CC. For senior flight examiners (see paragraph 4.4), waiver
      authority is the next commander in their flying chain of command
      4.3.3.2. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE: A Senior Flight Examiner (designated IAW
      paragraph 4.4) may not evaluate an instructor if they themselves are not instructor
      qualified; however, USAFE/A3 may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis IAW
      paragraph 1.3
26                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


  4.3.4. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
  requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
  MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examiner. MAJCOMs may establish procedures in
  their supplement for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside of NAFs/units within
  their own MAJCOM (see also paragraph 2.3.5).
  4.3.4. (USAFE) See paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.11 (Added) for guidance on documenting
  approval for a cross-command evaluation on the examinee’s AF Form 8/8a. See also
  paragraph 7.7.6 for documentation on the AF Form 942.
  4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
  and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
     4.3.5.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Reference Attachment 15, SEFE Flight
     Evaluation Checklist (Added), when giving evaluations. Debrief the examinee in a
     timely manner. Notify the examinee’s squadron CC/DO (or other designated squadron
     representatives) and the supervisor of the time and location of the debriefing. For Q-1
     performance, supervisory attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. For less
     than Q-1 performance, the flight examiner will debrief the examinee’s commander (and
     supervisor if applicable).
  4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
  (applies to both the examinee as well as any accompanying aircrew).
  4.3.6. (USAFE) If current and qualified/certified in the crew position and/or event being
  executed SEFEs may assume the in-flight duties of the examinee. If applicable advise the
  crew and assume full responsibility for the examinee’s crew position for the rest of the
  mission.
  4.3.7. As soon as possible, notify the examinee’s squadron commander (or available
  supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
  or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.3.3).
  4.3.8. (Added-USAFE) Use a pyramid evaluation system IAW Table 4.1 (Added) When
  unable to comply with pyramid evaluation system, obtain a waiver from HQ USAFE/A3TV
  using the waiver template found on the USAFE/A3TV ICE. The best available evaluator will
  be used to conduct waived pyramid evaluations. Annotate waiver IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2
  4.3.8. (MILDENHALL) AF Form 8.
     4.3.8.1. (Added-USAFE) The pyramid evaluation system does not apply to evaluation
     requisites (i.e. any appropriately certified SEFE may administer an EPE).
     4.3.8.1. (MILDENHALL) SEFEs will post temporary evaluation documentation that
     meets the requirements of paragraph 7.3.8 no later than COB the duty day following the
     completion of the last flight phase requisite. If a USAFE Form 135G is used for the EPE,
     it must be kept on file until a suitable temporary AF Form 8 is posted in the FEF. If the
     current notetaker coversheet is used, maintain the coversheet or 3862 (if used) in
     accordance with paragraph 3.2.2.5.5.2
     4.3.8.2. (Added-USAFE) No waiver is needed when there is no certified examiner
     above the examinee (to include none at HQ USAFE). In these cases, use the highest level
     evaluator available to conduct the evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             27


      4.3.8.2. (MILDENHALL) CCV SELOs will assist SEFEs to prepare the first draft of
      all Forms 8. SELOs will use locally produced checklists to ensure Form 8 completeness
      and minimize errors. The SEFE, however, is ultimately responsible for the content of the
      Form 8 and for ensuring the draft Form 8 is completed no later than seven days after the
      last flight phase requisite.
      4.3.8.3. (Added-USAFE) For the following individuals, the pyramid evaluation system
      applies regardless of their SEFE status: SQ/CC, OGV Chief, OG/CC/CD, WG/CC/CV.
   4.3.9. (Added-MILDENHALL) Unit Standardization/Evaluation Flight Examiner (SEFE)
   Removal Procedures. Document evaluator status removals in an MFR signed by the 351
   ARS/CC and include the circumstances leading to removal. The MFR will also include, if
   applicable, requirements to be completed prior to returning to evaluator status. File MFRs in
   the appropriate OGV and CCV continuity books and maintain them for a minimum of six
   months. Forward a copy of the downgrade MFR to OGV for review.

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
           5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
           aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
           INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
           5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
           under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
           requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                            29


  5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
        5.2.3.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Boom operators will designate cargo loading
        evaluations as ―MSN (CARGO).‖ Attempt to align cargo loading evaluation with the
        qualification/mission (QUAL/MSN) evaluation (i.e. accomplish within the same
        month). When alignment is not possible, document the evaluations on separate AF
        Forms 8 to avoid expiration date discrepancies.
        5.2.3.2.3. (MILDENHALL) Boom Operators will designate cargo loading
        evaluations as ―MSN (Cargo)‖ in an attempt to align with guidance found in the 26
        May 2010 11-2KC-135V2.
     5.2.3.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) Conduct of mission evaluations:
        5.2.3.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) FE Responsibilities. Before beginning the
        evaluation, evaluators should review what items are required for completion of the
        evaluation. Use the SEFE Flight Evaluation Checklist Attachment 15 (Added) to
        ensure all applicable items are accomplished. Evaluators will utilize AFI 11-2KC-
        135V2 and the local supplement to verify accomplishment of all checkride requisites.
        5.2.3.3.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) Examinee Responsibilities. Individual aircrew
        members are responsible for completing their requisites in accordance with paragraph
        5.5.3 of the parent regulation. The 100 OG/CC and squadron commanders will be
        informed of which individuals (if any) have not completed their testing requisites by
        the end of their third month of eligibility during weekly staff meetings.
        5.2.3.3.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) Pilot SEFEs will not normally be scheduled as
        primary crewmembers during in-flight evaluations. Evaluators may occupy one of the
        pilot seats during events requiring instructor pilot supervision (i.e., touch and go
        landings, air refueling, etc). During initial qualification and re-qualification
        evaluations, an additional qualified instructor pilot should be scheduled for the flight
30                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


        in order to occupy one of the pilot seats and supervise the examinee. CCV will
        coordinate with the 351 ARS flight scheduling office to schedule SEFE flight
        evaluations in accordance with this guidance as well as the pyramid evaluation
        system described in Table 4.1 (Added-USAFE).
        5.2.3.3.4. (Added-MILDENHALL) For scheduled cargo evaluations, Boom SEFEs
        may be scheduled as a primary crew member when manning does not permit
        sufficient crewmembers to facilitate MSN (Cargo) evaluations.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
        5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
        evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
        MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
        AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
        5.2.4.2.3. (USAFE) SEFE-certifed aircrew who expire on any periodic checkride
        will not be certified to perform SEFE duties until the expired evaluation is
        reaccomplished.
        5.2.4.2.4. (Added-USAFE) INIT and RQ INSTR evaluations may be conducted in
        conjunction with any periodic evaluation. For INIT INSTR evaluations, place
        emphasis on examinee demonstration of instructional ability. Incomplete INIT
        INSTR flight phase requirements do not preclude the update of the combined periodic
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                           31


         evaluation if, 1) all flight-phase requirements are successfully completed, and 2) all
         ground phase requirements are completed within the periods described in paragraph
         5.5.3 Conversely, not completing all periodic flight phase requirements does not
         preclude the completion of the INIT/RQ INSTR evaluation if all INSTR items have
         been evaluated. See Chapter 7 for documentation guidance.
         5.2.4.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Unless otherwise stated in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2, for
         multiple qualified aircrew members, one INIT INSTR evaluation is valid for all
         aircraft in which the aircrew member is qualified.
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
  5.2.5. (USAFE) 4 (Added) SEFE Objectivity Evaluations. See Attachment 8 (Added)
  for guidance, documentation, and grading criteria on SEFE Objectivity Evaluations.
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
         5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
            5.2.5.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) If not limited by paragraph 5.2.5.2.1.2, , the
            SEFE must advise the examinee of the option to use a SPOT evaluation to update
            his/her periodic evaluation zone prior to the beginning of the aircrew mission
            brief.
            5.2.5.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Examinees intending to use a SPOT evaluation to
            update their periodic evaluation zone must declare their intent prior to the
            beginning of the aircrew mission brief.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. (USAFE) EXAMPLE: AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
     Ground, Chapter 1, prescribes evaluation requirements for non-pilot aircrew authorized
     to conduct engine start, run-up, and test of engines. Unless incorporated as a periodic
     evaluation requisite in AFI 11-2MDSV2, a SPOT evaluation would be the appropriate
     type of evaluation for this requirement (documented IAW Chapter 7).
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
32                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
        5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
        guidance for that periodic evaluation.
        5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
        1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
        The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
        those items for which the individual is non-current.
        5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
        IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
        5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
        Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
        5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
        5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
        5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
        evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. ―Normal
        preparation‖ will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        5.2.6.3.2. (USAFE) ―Normal preparation‖ will be defined as no sooner than 24
        hours prior to schedule takeoff and no later than aircrew brief time. MAF only: For
        N/N SPOT, notification may be at any time [paragraphs 5.2.5.2.1.3 (Added) and
        5.2.5.2.1.4 (Added) still apply]. In this case evaluators will coordinate with squadron
        supervision as to when notification will occur.
            5.2.6.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) N/N checkrides will not be given in the sixth
            month of the eligibility period. Waiver authority is the OG/CC.
            5.2.6.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The OG/CC will determine quantifiable N/N
            program goals that will be included in the unit supplement along with guidance on
            program implementation. Distribute no-notice evaluations proportionately among
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                        33


          aircraft (for multi-MDS wings), crew positions, and evaluation types. At unit
          discretion, N/N evaluations conducted by HQ USAFE SEFEs may count toward
          unit N/N program goals.
       5.2.6.3.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) OGV will provide oversight of the no-notice
       evaluation program and CCV will administer the program.
          5.2.6.3.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) The following individuals are exempt
          from no-notice (N/N) events: 100 ARW/CC/CV; 100 OG/CC/CD; 100 OG/OGV
          SEFEs; 100 OSS/CC/DO; 351 ARS/CC/DO.
          5.2.6.3.3.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) The goal for the N/N program is for 10%
          of each crew position (pilot, navigator, boom operator) of all 351 ARS assigned
          and attached personnel to be evaluated in each of the following categories
          annually: flight check, publications check, closed book test, and cargo check
          (boom operators only). No-notice goals for each calendar year will be established
          by taking 10% of the total qualified aircrew members in each crew position on 1
          January and rounding down to the nearest whole number that is greater than or
          equal to 1. CCV will ensure these annual goals are met unless waived by the
          OG/CC.
             5.2.6.3.3.2.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) CCV must obtain approval from the
             351 ARS/CC prior to administering any no-notice evaluation.
             5.2.6.3.3.3. (Added-MILDENHALL) OGV may also administer no-notice
             evaluations with 351 ARS/CC coordination and 100 OG/CC approval. These
             evaluations may count toward meeting 351 ARS annual no-notice
             requirements.
          5.2.6.3.3.4. (Added-MILDENHALL) Provided paragraph 5.2.6.3.2 (USAFE)
          requirements and all go/no-go requirements are met, flight examiners designated
          on the Letter of Xs are authorized to add themselves to the crew as a write-in
          change to the flight orders for the purpose of conducting no-notice evaluations on
          100 ARW flights.
          5.2.6.3.3.5. (Added-MILDENHALL) No-Notice Flight Evaluations. Normally,
          CCV should target aircrew members who are outside their six-month eligibility
          zone. In addition, the crewmember should have at least three months on station
          and two months since their last evaluation. No-notice evaluations should not
          normally be accomplished on any individual more than once per calendar year.
          5.2.6.3.3.6. (Added-MILDENHALL) No-notice flight evaluations should
          include evaluation of designated MAJCOM and local Special Interest Items.
          5.2.6.3.3.7. (Added-MILDENHALL) No-Notice Testing and Publications
          Checks. Normally, the examiner should administer the appropriate N/N closed
          book test, boldface exam, and publications check in conjunction with a N/N flight
          evaluation. Administer the test by the end of the second duty day after the flight
          or before the examinee’s next scheduled flight, whichever occurs first.
             5.2.6.3.3.7.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) No-Notice Testing. Normally, the
             examinees will receive a N/N test in conjunction with their N/N flight
 34                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


                 evaluation. OGV/CCV may randomly administer additional N/N tests. For the
                 aforementioned random testing scenarios, individual aircrews will accomplish
                 the N/N test immediately upon notification, unless extenuating circumstances
                 preclude immediate testing (as determined by the OGV/CCV representative).
                 Failed tests will place examinee on supervised status until a successful retest
                 is accomplished.
                 5.2.6.3.3.7.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) No-Notice Publications Check.
                 While normally the examinees will receive a N/N publications check in
                 conjunction with their N/N flight evaluation, OGV/CCV may randomly
                 administer additional N/N publications checks. Failed checks will place
                 examinee on supervised status until a successful recheck is accomplished
                 unless waived by the 351 ARS/CC.
             5.2.6.3.3.8. (Added-MILDENHALL) No-Notice EPEs. If conducted, CCV
             should target aircrew members who are not in their eligibility zone and will
             consist of a ground evaluation. Examinees targeted within their eligibility zone
             will accomplish the N/N EPE in the simulator immediately upon notification,
             unless extenuating circumstances preclude immediate evaluation (as determined
             by the OGV/CCV representative). Crewmembers failing a N/N EPE will be
             placed in supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
             5.2.6.3.3.9. (Added-MILDENHALL) No-Notice Documentation. CCV will
             document all no-notice activity in the LAN-based no-notice spreadsheet and PEX.
             Results of No-Notice evaluations will be briefed during the SEB.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             35


        5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
        all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
        tolerances.
        5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
        examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
        safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
        5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
        compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
        adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
        constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
        of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
        examiner.
     5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
        5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
        the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
        discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
        proficiency.
        5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
        remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
            5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
            or flying.
            5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
            be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
            5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
            additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
            action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
            8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
            5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
            7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
36                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as ―Commendable‖
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
         5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
         assigned.
         5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
         5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
         5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
         evaluations and EPEs).
         5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
         5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
         the overall qualification level.
         5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
         requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
         consideration.
         5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
         5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
         EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
         always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             37


          5.3.3.4.5. (Added-USAFE) A requisite (flight or ground) graded Q2, does not
          automatically drive the overall grade to a Q2 (see paragraph 5.3.3.4.1). Likewise,
          the flight-phase SEFE may assign a flight phase grade that is different from the
          overall qualification level. Reference paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.4 (USAFE) for
          documentation.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
              5.4.1.2.1.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Publications Check. The requisite
              publications check will normally be completed in conjunction with the aircrew
              member’s flight evaluation.
              5.4.1.2.1.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) 100 Air Refueling Wing (ARW) flight
              publication requirements are as specified in the 100th Operations Group FCIF
              Library Volume 1, Part C (Squadron Read File).
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
 38                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
          5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
          and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
          systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
          5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
          evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
          simulator/ATD, or verbally.
              5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
              evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
              5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
              INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
              cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
              evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
              5.5.1.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) EPEs will consist of at least one boldface/CAPs (if
              applicable) and one non-boldface/CAPs EP per phase of flight (i.e., start/taxi,
              takeoff/departure, cruise/mission employment, and approach/landing) or as
              directed by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. If an aircraft does not have Boldface/CAPs,
              then only one EP per phase of flight is required.
              5.5.1.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) All EPEs will be of sufficient length to ensure
              adequate coverage of applicable material. Do not accomplish the EPE in-flight
              when the examinee is a required crewmember unless specifically allowed in AFI
              11-2MDS Vol 2.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                               39


            5.5.1.2.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Record EPE results, to include discrepancies, on a
            USAFE Form 135G, Emergency Procedures Grade Sheet, PEX EPE worksheet,
            or OGV-approved unit-produced worksheet. Keep a copy of the signed
            form/worksheet on file until a suitable temporary AF Form 8/8a (see paragraph
            7.3.8) is posted in the FEF.
         5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
         the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
         for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
         5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
         examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
         unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
         and 7.3.7.3.4.
         5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
         situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
         circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
         accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
         flight examiner)
         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
     5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
     training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
     5.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) CAF only. Include unit procedures for the conduct of MSN
     evaluations in the unit supplement. As a minimum, procedures will include
     SEFE/examinee responsibilities and what profile information (e.g. ATO) the SEFE will
     furnish to the examinee.
     5.5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) If an event is required to be completed in-flight (i.e. not
     normally in a simulator/ATD) and the evaluation would be considered incomplete if the
     event were not accomplished on an additional flight, at SQ/CC discretion a suitable
     sim/ATD may be used to fulfill the requirement (unless specifically prohibited by AFI
     11-2MDS Vol 2). Ensure documentation is IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.2.2.4 (USAFE) and
     7.3.7.3.5.5.
  5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
     5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
     current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
     case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
 40                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
   5.5.4. (Added-MILDENHALL) Testing is a prerequisite for all 100 OG evaluations with
   the exception of no-notice evaluations. All requisite testing should be accomplished no later
   than three months into the eligibility zone. The 100 OG/CC is the waiver authority if flight
   requisites must be scheduled or conducted before all required examination requisites are
   complete.
   5.5.5. (Added-MILDENHALL) The status of all evaluation requisites will be kept up-to-
   date in PEX and will be briefed at 351 ARS and 100 OG weekly staff meetings.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
       5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
       period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
       training required.
       5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
       administer the recheck.
       5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
       Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
       5.6.1.4. (USAFE) If an examinee performs to Q- criteria for each area previously
       graded U, but additional training is still required, an additional recheck must be
       accomplished after completion of the assigned additional training. In this case, the time
       limit to complete the recheck is still based on paragraph 5.6.1 and an additional recheck
       AF Form 8/8a will be completed.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             41


     5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
     recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
     evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
     5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
     remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
     5.6.1.7. (Added-USAFE) At OG/CC discretion, a flight recheck may be combined with
     other periodic evaluations to facilitate completion of evaluations that are normally
     combined based on the MDS/crew position.
         5.6.1.7.1. (Added-USAFE) The non-recheck portion of the combined evaluation
         (along with any associated requisites) must be completed within the zones described
         in paragraphs 5.5.3 and 5.8 The recheck portion (and any associated requisites)
         must be completed within the time period described above.
         5.6.1.7.2. (Added-USAFE) See Chapter 7 for AF Form 8/8a documentation with
         special emphasis on paragraphs 7.3.4.4.4.1 (Added) and 7.3.9
         5.6.1.7.3. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE: If the INSTM and QUAL evaluations are
         normally combined, but the examinee earns a Q3 due to a U on a QUAL event prior
         to completion of the evaluation, the OG/CC may approve the examinee to fly a
         combined RQ QUAL (to satisfy recheck requirements IAW guidance above) and
         INSTM evaluation.
  5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
  evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
  mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
  the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
         opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
         specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
         similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
         all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
         5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.6.3.1.3. MSN Evaluation: The examinee may perform basic qualification/
         instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on supervised
         status for mission tasks.
 42                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.2. (USAFE) Restrict instructors graded Q2 on any evaluation (to include EPEs)
      from performing instructor duties on downgraded areas until additional
      training/debriefing is complete. Likewise, SEFEs receiving a Q2 on any evaluation will
      be restricted from giving evaluations (to include EPEs) until additional training is
      completed.
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
   5.7.3. (Added-USAFE) See paragraph 7.3.7.1.2 for documentation of ―designated
   supervisor‖ on the AF Form 8/8a.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                            43


        5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s        may    extend
        evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
        IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
        supplements to this instruction.
        5.8.3.2.2. (USAFE) Units will forward extension requests not otherwise approved by the
        SQ/CC      using the ―USAFE Evaluation Extension Request‖ template located on the
        USAFE/A3TV ICE (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/default.aspx)
        under the ―Waivers‖ folder.
           5.8.3.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Coordination will originate with the CCV that
           manages the individual’s FEF then proceed as follows: SQ/CC → OGV →
           OG/CC → WG/CC → USAFE/A3T → USAFE/A3 (for final approval).
           5.8.3.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) To the maximum extent practical, units will
           coordinate requests so as to arrive at HQ USAFE at least one month prior to the
           original zone expiring. Incorporate documentation of approved extensions into the
           examinee’s FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2
        5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
        of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
        IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
        paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
        longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
        see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
        period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
           5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
           5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.

           5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
           than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
           before or during deployment.
     5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
        5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
        authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
        5.8.3.3.1. (USAFE) The intent of the non-standard approval guidance in paragraph
        5.8.3.3.1 is for approvals of the zone extension circumstances in paragraph 5.8.3.2.3
        for senior leadership (SQ/CCs and above).
           5.8.3.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) For all API-8 O-6s and above (e.g. USAFE/IG, 3
           AF/CC, COMUSAFE, etc.) approval authority for evaluation extensions needed
           for any reason will be HQ USAFE/A3 (EXCEPTION: COMUSAFE is approval
           authority for USAFE/A3 evaluation extensions). 5.8.3.3.1.2. (Added) Submit

           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.8.4.2. (USAFE) The OG/CC waiver will explain the circumstances causing the
       delinquent evaluation and the specific requisites being waived. Furnish a copy to HQ
       USAFE/A3TV.
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                              45


   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
   5.9.5. (Added-USAFE) See Attachment 11 (Added) for Commander-Directed
   decertification (e.g. downgrades on non-AF Form 8/8a qualifying events, non-punitive
   removal of certifications due to manning, etc.),
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.2. (USAFE) Squadrons will use a Letter of Xs (see Attachment 11 (Added)) in lieu of
   the AF Form 4348 unless the AF Form 4348 is specifically directed by the applicable AFI
   11-2MDSV2.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.

   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (USAFE) USAFE AECMs are universally qualified IAW AFI 11-2AEV1, Chapter
   2.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                         47


  5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
  5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
  capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
  similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
  MDS Vol 2/MOU.

                                           Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.1. (USAFE) In addition to guidance on the overall execution of the unit Aircrew Exam
   program, describe how PEX will be used for the aircrew exam program at all Stan/Eval
   functional levels.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. (USAFE) PEX will be the primary means to administer requisite open/close book,
   instrument, and semi-annual testing. Hard copy testing is permissible, but units shall strive to
   incorporate PEX as much as possible.
       6.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Units may use a locally-derived aircrew testing system once
       certified and approved by USAFE/A3TV and its implementation described in the unit
       supplement. Units desiring certification will allow USAFE/A3TV to verify that the
       desired system complies with the intent of this volume. Certification/approval
       documentation will be included in SEB minutes (see Attachment 2).
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
       6.3.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Retention of Examination Records. Testing is
       normally administered and documented via PEX. File completed paper exams in the
       checkride testing file in 351 ARS/CCV. Testing trends will be computed by PEX. These
       trends will be reported at the SEB and tracked in the SEB minutes.
   6.3.4. (Added-MILDENHALL) Local Testing Procedures. All testing (annual evaluation
   and periodic) will be accomplished in PEX. Testing is normally conducted in the CCV
   testing room, Room 1.15A, Monday through Friday from 0800-1130 local and 1300-1600
   local. Closed book exams will not normally be administered after 1530 local. OGV may
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             49


   administer aircrew paper tests at their discretion if circumstances preclude aircrew from
   using PEX.
      6.3.4.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Testing Monitors. The CCV Chief will designate
      testing monitors during testing hours. Only testing monitors may grade exams. Testing
      monitors will work with OGV to determine the validity of, and answer questions
      pertaining to, specific exam questions on a case-by-case basis. If it is necessary to
      ―discard‖ questions, notify OGV in accordance with paragraph 6.4.4.1.
      6.3.4.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) Testing Conduct. When taking a closed-book exam,
      the examinee will not leave before completing the test. If the individual must leave, the
      test becomes invalid and a different version of the test will be administered. Open-book
      tests may be taken over more than one sitting.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
      6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
      be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
      references for open book examinations.
          6.4.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Units may provide aircrew access to a completely
          electronic library in lieu of a hardcopy library for the purposes of Open Book testing.
              6.4.1.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If used, an electronic library will be accessible in a
              suitable testing environment (see paragraph 3.2.1.4) and will include all relevant
              publications in one electronic location (i.e. aircrew should not have to search
              around the internet for the individual publications).
              6.4.1.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The electronic library will ensure aircrew are
              accessing the document as it was released from the release/publishing authority
              (i.e. scanned copies of hardcopy source documents are not allowed).
      6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
      the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
      safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
      6.4.1.2. (USAFE) OGVs will develop an SQB for each crew position of each unit MDS.
      SQBs may be combined if different crew positions are responsible for the same
      information (e.g. F-15E pilots and WSOs).
          6.4.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Do not select open book questions from any closed-
          book MQF (MDS or local).
   6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
      6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
      specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
      aircrew.
50                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


         6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
         administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
         procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
         6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
         Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
         necessary.
         6.4.2.1.2. (USAFE) Forward MQF edits and suggestions for MQF changes using the
         AF Form 847 IAW local procedures to the ―USAFE/A3TV (Workflow)‖ org account.
         USAFE/A3TV will review the changes and forward to the appropriate lead
         MAJCOM Stan/Eval function.
     6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
     MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
     6.4.2.2. (USAFE) Units will develop a local procedures MQF derived from relevant
     USAFESUP guidance, local supplements, and local operating guidance.
         6.4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Closed book exams will include questions from the
         local MQF.
         6.4.2.2.1. (MILDENHALL) All aircrew closed book exams, requisite and no-
         notice, will include a boldface test requiring recall of boldface steps from memory.
         6.4.2.2.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) OGV will post a current copy of the AMC and
         local MQFs on the e-pubs program located on the OGV SharePoint website and local
         share drive.
  6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
  Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
  procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
  test.
  6.4.3. (USAFE) Unit supplements will include guidance on how the unit plans to manage
  instrument exam creation and quality control.
  6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
  review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
  and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
  source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
  procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
  6.4.4. (USAFE) Exam Question Review. Units have 60 days after any changes in source
  guidance to complete reviews of affected exams. If no changes in source guidance have
  occurred throughout the year (thus constituting an exam review), units will plan on
  completing and documenting their annual reviews before holding the first semi-annual SEB
  (reference paragraph 3.2.2.7.1 (Added)).
     6.4.4.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Examination Question Review. CCV will compile
     and forward an examinations correction recommendations report to OGV by the end of
     each quarter. Include in the report the exam name and number, exam date, question
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                              51


       number, and discrepancy. OGV will use this report to review prepared exams and master
       question files (MQFs) for accuracy.
       6.4.4.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) OGV is responsible for constructing and updating all
       requisite exams, to include instrument exam creation and quality control. Exam updates
       should be based on quarterly correction recommendations, trends, annual revisions, or as
       directed by publication changes.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
   6.6.4. (Added-USAFE) Open and closed book exams will consist of a minimum of 25
   questions.
 52                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


   6.6.4. (MILDENHALL) OGV is responsible for constructing and updating all exams. All
   exams will be randomly generated and administered in PEX.
   6.6.5. (Added-USAFE) The unit supplement will be clear about which type of exam
   management is being used (prepared v. randomly generated). Even if PEX is used to
   administer the exam, the exam may actually be a ―prepared exam‖ if PEX is not randomly
   generating the test from an exam database IAW paragraph 6.6.2.2 Whichever method is
   used, units will make every effort to capture legitimate trend information that is both
   meaningful and relevant to the unit’s mission and the commander’s overall unit vision.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
   6.7.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Tests and Test Bank Security. All evaluators and testing
   monitors are responsible for the security of testing materials, exams, and question banks.
   Restrict access to tests, answer keys, computer disks, and test banks by keeping them locked
   in a secure area. OGV computers containing the SQB will be password protected to prevent
   unauthorized access. Access to electronic test banks within PEX will be restricted as much as
   the application allows, preventing unauthorized access.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.1. (USAFE) Boldface/CAPs. Boldface/CAPs will be written from memory.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
       6.8.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Requisite and boldface/CAPS examinations will be
       graded by the CCV/OGV testing monitor immediately upon completion and the score
       logged immediately in PEX. This procedure is intended to ensure completion prior to the
       aircrew member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.1. (USAFE) Reexamination Policy. An ―adequate study period‖ will be defined in the
   unit supplement, but may be no less than 12 hours from the conclusion of the fail exam or the
   beginning of the next duty day, whichever occurs first. OG/CC is waiver authority for
   retesting with less than an "adequate study period."
       6.9.1.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Reexamination Policy. An ―adequate study‖ period
       will be no less than the beginning of the next duty from the conclusion of the failed exam.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                              53


   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.3. (USAFE) Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew failing a
   Boldface/CAPS requisite exam will retest no earlier than the beginning of the next duty day.
   OG/CC is waiver authority for same-day retesting.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
      6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
      exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
      6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
      resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
      aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
      results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
      instrument qualification is required.
   6.9.5. (Added-USAFE) Include procedures for tracking failed examination dates and how
   leadership will be informed in unit supplements.
   6.9.5. (MILDENHALL) Failed Examination Tracking. Failed examinations will be tracked
   via PEX. CCV will notify the 351 ARS flight scheduling office immediately to ensure the
   member is removed from the flying schedule or placed on supervised status in accordance
   with this AFI. In addition, CCV will send an email notification to OGV, the member’s
   supervisor and commander, and all 351 ARS flight authorization officials.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.
   6.10.4. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, OGVs or CCVs will conduct semi-annual testing
   for all flight crewmembers. Timing of the semi-annual test is at unit discretion and will be
   defined in the unit supplement.
   6.10.4. (MILDENHALL) Periodic testing will be accomplished on a quarterly basis for all
   351 ARS assigned and attached pilots, boom operators, and navigators. Aircrew members
54                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


  who fail to accomplish a periodic exam will be reported to the squadron commander and
  should not be scheduled for a sortie until successful completion.
     6.10.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Semi-annual tests will be a minimum of 20 questions and at
     least 25 percent of the questions must come from sources other than MDS and local
     MQFs or SQBs (e.g. FCIFs).
     6.10.4.1. (MILDENHALL) Quarterly testing will be accomplished in PEX and will
     consist of a minimum of 25 questions. The minimum passing grade for a periodic exam is
     85 percent. Aircrew members who fail the periodic exam may retest without restrictions.
     PEX will automatically assign a retest until a passing score is achieved. In the event of
     unforeseen circumstances that preclude aircrew from taking the periodic test in PEX,
     CCV may issue paper tests.
     6.10.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Units may use aircrew testing accomplished during
     USAFE/A3TV ASEVs as the semi-annual test, but must communicate this desire to the
     administering A3TV inspector prior to the commencement of testing (aircrew testing
     during USAFE/A3TV ASEVs shall not be used to meet requisite examination
     requirements).
     6.10.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Flight surgeons and non-CEA aircrew (e.g. CRO/PJ) are
     exempted from semi-annual testing, but may test at OG/CC’s discretion. This exemption
     does not apply to AE personnel.
  6.10.5. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, all applicable aircrew will successfully complete a
  Boldface/CAPs written exam every prior to the first flight of each calendar month.
  6.10.5. (MILDENHALL) For 100 OG crewmembers, a successful exam requires all
  boldface steps to be written as they appear in the flight manual, to include numbering and
  crew positions.
     6.10.5.1. (Added-USAFE) A Boldface/CAPs written exam will be accomplished in
     each MDS for which the aircrew is qualified.
     6.10.5.1. (MILDENHALL) If this exam is taken outside normal duty hours and a
     second AC or instructor is not available to grade an AC or instructor’s boldface exam, the
     AC or instructor may fly one time but the Boldface must be graded prior to the next
     flight.
     6.10.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Boldface/CAPs exam will be written from memory.
     Abbreviations which do not affect the correct meaning of the procedure are acceptable.
     6.10.5.2. (MILDENHALL) Monthly boldface exams, before being turned-in to CCV,
     are correctable to 100%. For additional monthly boldface exam procedures, reference
     paragraphs 9.3.3.
     6.10.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Boldface/CAPs exams will be graded by the squadron
     operations supervisor or designated representative (Fighter); Aircraft Commander (AC)
     or any available instructor (MAF and HH-60s) IAW paragraph 6.8.1. Failure of this
     written exam grounds the individual until a successful reexamination is accomplished.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                         55


     6.10.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Outline unit execution in the unit supplement under Go/No-
     Go Procedures (paragraph 9.3.3 (Added)). Unit supplements will clearly define failure
     procedures (grounding, amount of time until retesting, level of supervision required for
     retest) regarding monthly Boldface/CAPS requirements.

                                           Chapter 7

                                    DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
   7.1.2. (USAFE) Digital (i.e. use of a CAC signature) and electronic (i.e. //SIGNED//)
   signatures are authorized on all AF Forms 8/8a and FEF documentation generated by USAFE
   units. A combination of signature formats (including those on the same document) are
   allowed.
       7.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) When electronically signing a document, USAFE units will
       use the following standard (IAW AFI 33-119 and AFI 33-321): //SIGNED/initials//. The
       date will be included in the appropriate ―date‖ block of the respective form
       7.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The stan/eval function responsible for routing the AF Form
       8/8a for signature will QC the form upon receipt after a signature is added prior to
       sending it out for further signatures. The intent is to mitigate unknown content changes
       from occurring while the document is being routed.
       7.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) To the max extent possible, AF Forms 8/8a will be sent via
       encrypted email to personal NIPR accounts (i.e. no org accounts or civilian addresses--
       Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) with the appropriate ―For Official Use Only‖ (FOUO) paragraph
       (see example below) included on the email.
          7.1.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE: ―CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This
          document, including all attachments, may contain information that is For Official
          Use only (FOUO). Information may be FOUO because it includes information
          protected by the Privacy Act. If any information in this e-mail falls under the Privacy
          Act of 1974, you must safeguard the information and, if applicable, all attachments.
          Disclosure of information is IAW DOD 5400.11R.‖
       7.1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Other than through PEX, USAFE units will not use wholly
       electronic FEFs unless the desired system is certified and approved by USAFE/A3TV.
       Units desiring certification will allow A3TV to verify that the desired system complies
       with the intent of this volume. See paragraph 7.8.2 for more information on electronic
       FEFs.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                                 57


7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (USAFE)Qualifications versus Certifications. Squadrons will use a Letter of Xs [see
Attachment 11 (Added)] in lieu of the AF Form 4348 unless the AF Form 4348 is specifically
directed by the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
       7.3.1.3. (USAFE) EXCEPTION: Commander-directed downgrade AF Form 8 is
       completed by the Commander directing the downgrade and the individual being
       downgraded. See paragraph 7.4
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
       7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
       (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
       7.3.2.3. The ―Eligibility Period‖ and ―Expiration Date of Qualification‖ blocks will use a
       three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
       7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
       ―INSTR‖), use upper and lower case letters.
       7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
       data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
       desired.
       7.3.2.6. (Added-USAFE) PEX will be used as the primary system for AF Form 8/8a
       and AF Form 942 data entry. As needed, once PEX data are input the appropriate
       Stan/Eval function completing the form may finalize the form outside of PEX.
       7.3.2.6. (MILDENHALL) SEFEs will ensure all evaluation data is entered into PEX
       and a draft Form 8 is completed within seven days of the completion of the last flight
       phase requisite. At the SEFE’s discretion, for Q-1 evaluations with no discrepancies, a
       CCV SELO can input data. The SEFE will then review the Form 8 thoroughly for
58                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


     accuracy. 351 ARS CCV Chief can assist and extend this requirement when applicable.
     The evaluator is ultimately responsible for the content of all Forms 8.
     7.3.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Unit supplements will provide guidance on PEX usage
     regarding evaluation data entry (e.g. direct PEX entry by SEFEs, worksheet use by
     SEFEs that is then input into PEX by SELOs, etc.).
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.
     7.3.4.1. Name, Rank (USAF-standard abbreviated or non-abbreviated rank is acceptable)
     and last four of Social Security Number (SSN).
     7.3.4.2. Organization and Location.
         7.3.4.2.1. Enter the unit designation and location where the examinee is
         assigned/attached for flying (actual unit/office symbol will be annotated IAW
         paragraph 7.3.6.4).
         7.3.4.2.2. For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization
         and location will reflect the FTU organization/location.
     7.3.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation
         expires Sep 12, enter Apr-Sep 12).
         7.3.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for INIT, SPOT, RQ, and out-of-the-eligibility
         period evaluations (see paragraph 5.8.3.2).
         7.3.4.4.2. (USAFE) Since a flight recheck following a failed evaluation is by
         definition an ―RQ‖ evaluation, ―N/A‖ will be entered on flight recheck AF Forms
         8/8a.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                            59


            7.3.4.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If, at the discretion of the OG/CC, a flight recheck
            is combined with other periodic evaluations (i.e. RQ QUAL combined with an
            INSTM), document IAW paragraph 7.3.4.4.4
         7.3.4.4.3. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.8.3.2.3, enter the
         6-month period preceding the original expiration date (SQ/CCs extend only the
         expiration date, not the eligibility period).
         7.3.4.4.3. (USAFE) The intent of paragraph 7.4.4.3 guidance is that any extension
         approval (SQ/CC, USAFE/A3, etc.) only extends the expiration date, not the
         eligibility period.
         7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 12 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 13, enter
         ―INSTM: Jun-Nov 12/QUAL: Aug 12-Jan 13‖ for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
         7.3.4.4.4. (USAFE) This is true for INIT/RQ INSTR evaluations that are combined
         with MSN evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.4.2.4 (Added) (i.e., for an INIT
         INSTR/MSN, enter ―INSTR: N/A‖ then on the next line, ―MSN: Aug 12-Jan 13‖).
            7.3.4.4.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Flight rechecks due to failed evaluations combined
            with other, non-recheck periodic evaluations will be documented with the RQ
            portion as ―N/A‖. EXAMPLE: An RQ QUAL (due to a recheck from a failed
            evaluation) combined with an INSTM would be documented ―QUAL: N/A‖ then
            on the next line, ―INSTM Aug 12-Jan 13‖.
  7.3.5. - Qualification.
     7.3.5.1. Ground Phase.
         7.3.5.1.1. Examination/Check.
            7.3.5.1.1.1. Make a separate entry for each ground requisite exam/evaluation.
            Discrepancies will be noted in the examiner’s remarks (see paragraph 7.3.7.3.3).
            7.3.5.1.1.2. If requisites exceed available lines, make combined entries or
            document additional requisite completion in the Comments section.
            7.3.5.1.1.3. Annotate an EPE as 1, 2, or 3 regardless of whether all or a portion of
            the EPE was performed inflight.
                7.3.5.1.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Document any N/N EPE (see paragraph
                5.2.6.3) as ―N/N EPE‖.
                7.3.5.1.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Document a SPOT EPE (see paragraph
                5.2.5) as ―SPOT‖ or ―N/N SPOT‖ (as appropriate). If no other evaluation was
                accomplished, then annotate the EPE grade under both the Ground Phase and
                Overall Qualification blocks.
            7.3.5.1.1.4. Annotate ―Instrument‖ for instrument requisite exam.
            7.3.5.1.1.5. Annotate ―Boldface‖ or ―CAPs‖ as required by the applicable AFI
            11-2MDS Vol 2.
60                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


            7.3.5.1.1.6. (Form 8a) Make a separate entry for each ground requisite
            exam/evaluation by MDS IAW published guidance.
            7.3.5.1.1.7. (Form 8a) For a combined ground requisite that includes all
            applicable aircraft under Universal Qualification guidelines (example: one
            closed/open book examination which contains questions for more than one
            aircraft or one EPE which evaluates more than one aircraft) make a single line
            entry for each requisite (i.e. Open Book, Closed Book, EPE etc.).
        7.3.5.1.2. Date. In the date column, enter the date that the requisite is successfully
        completed. Enter the recheck (EPE)/reexam (test/Boldface/CAPs) date if a
        recheck/reexam was required.
        7.3.5.1.3. Grade.
            7.3.5.1.3.1. Enter failed exam score with a successfully completed reexam as
            follows: 84/98.
            7.3.5.1.3.2. Enter failed Boldface/CAPs with successful re-accomplishment as
            follows: U/Q.
            7.3.5.1.3.3. Separate Boldface/CAPs grades from other requisite examination
            grades when on the same line by enclosing them in parentheses as follows: 84/98
            (U/Q).
            7.3.5.1.3.4. Enter failed EPE grades with a successful recheck as follows: 3/1.
     7.3.5.2. Flight Phase.
        7.3.5.2.1. (Form 8a) If applicable governing instructions require non-rated aircrew
        to demonstrate in-flight proficiency in more than one MDS, MAJCOMs may use a
        separate AF Form 8a for each MDS with flight phase evaluations IAW multiple
        qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
        paragraph 5.11.
        7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.2.1. (USAFE) Evaluations may be listed in any order as long as prefixes
            (if used) are in front of the evaluation they are describing.
            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
               INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
               8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation

              7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
              instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
          7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
          complete the evaluation.
          7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
          flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
          on separate days.
          7.3.5.2.2.4. (USAFE) If executing IAW paragraph 5.5.2.4 (Added) a second
          sortie entry is required. In this case, the second sortie entry will be entered with a
          SIM prefix (see paragraph 5.2.6.4). See also paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.5.
          7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
          flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
          may be used.
              7.3.5.2.2.5.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) For AC upgrade OMEs and SEFE
              objectivity evaluations, SEFEs will document the evaluation using a single-
              line entry. For OMEs, the mission description will indicate how many sorties
              were accomplished and the length, in days, of the overall mission and will
              include a description of what was accomplished.
          7.3.5.2.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Multiple single-line entries for multiple flight

          7.3.5.2.2.6. (MILDENHALL) All INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluations should be
          documented as multiple single-line entries for each flight phase event (flight or
          SIM). If all flight phase events were accomplished in the same calendar month,
          combine all events on one Form 8.
              7.3.5.2.2.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Use a separate AF Form 8/8a for flight
              evaluations accomplished in different months even if a combined EPE was
              accomplished IAW paragraph 5.5.1.2.2.2.
              7.3.5.2.2.6.2. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE (If option is directed by the
              unit supplement): A KC-135 INSTM/QUAL evaluation is conducted on 15
              Sep with a MSN evaluation on 22 Sep, and a combined INSTM/QUAL/MSN
              EPE on 25 Sep. On one AF Form 8, document the EPE IAW paragraph
              7.3.5.1.1.3., but document the flight evaluations on separate lines.
       7.3.5.2.3. Date.
          7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
          7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
          over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
          flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
              7.3.5.2.3.2.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) For OMEs, enter the date of the last
              flight accomplished.

            7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
            spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
                7.3.5.2.3.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) For INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluations,
                enter a separate date and use a separate line for each flight event and each SIM
                event.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a ―1‖ (for Q1) or ―2‖ (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        ―3‖ (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., ―INSTM: 1‖ and
            ―QUAL: 2‖ in the qualified block or ―INSTM/MSN: 1‖ in the qualified block and
            ―QUAL: 3‖ in the unqualified block).
            7.3.5.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Reference paragraph 7.3.9 for documentation of
            flight and ground rechecks.
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.

        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter ―N/A.‖
        7.3.5.4.2. (USAFE) This is true for INIT/RQ INSTR evaluations that are combined
        with MSN evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.4.2.4 (Added) (i.e., for an INIT
        INSTR/MSN, enter ―INSTR: N/A‖ then next line, ―MSN: Aug 12‖).
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or ―N/A‖ if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            ―N/A‖ for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter ―QUAL-Jul 12‖ under Qualified and ―INSTM-N/A‖ under
            Unqualified).

         7.3.6.1.2. The flight examiner signing Section III of the AF Form 8:
            7.3.6.1.2.1. Is responsible for the content of the AF Form 8/8a, and will not sign
64                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


           Section III until verifying all required items (IAW this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS
           Vol 2) are documented.
           7.3.6.1.2.2. Will always place an ―X‖ in the remarks block and make comments
           in the comments block
               7.3.6.1.2.2.1. (Form 8a) This applies only when a flight phase is required; if
               only a ground phase is required, do not place an "X" in the remarks block and
               no Examiner Remarks are required in the Comments block in Section IV.
        7.3.6.1.3. If two or more flights are required to complete an evaluation, only the
        flight examiner completing the evaluation will sign Section III, any other evaluator(s)
        will enter remarks in the Mission Description block describing those parts of the
        flight evaluation they evaluated and sign a signature block immediately adjacent to
        their remarks (see examples in Attachment 3).
        7.3.6.1.3. (USAFE) The signature block may be electronically signed and will be
        written as follows:
     7.3.6.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers.
        7.3.6.2.1. (Form 8a) A Reviewing Officer is not required for non-rated aircrew with
        only ground phase examination requisites for qualification.
        7.3.6.2.2. The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (those officers holding these
        positions, or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not
        necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8/8a
        and the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is
        adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an ―X‖ in
        the ―Concur‖ block.
        7.3.6.2.2. (USAFE) The intent of ―acting in their stead‖ applies to acting
        CCs/CVs/DOs if the reviewing and/or approving officer is unavailable to sign within
        the time period described in paragraph 7.3.8.5.
           7.3.6.2.2.1. If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the Form
           8/8a, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting officer will place an
           ―X‖ in the ―Do Not Concur‖ block on his/her line of the AF Form 8/8a.
           7.3.6.2.2.2. If ―Do Not Concur‖ is marked, the non-concurring officer(s) will
           provide justification (e.g. reason for non-concurrence, suggested modifications to
           additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
           7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.
           7.3.6.2.2.2. (USAFE) Non-concur comments may direct additional restrictions,
           but will not add downgrades. See paragraph 7.3.6.2.5
        7.3.6.2.3. The Reviewing Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the flight
        examiner, but prior to the Final Approval Officer.
        7.3.6.2.4. The Final Approval Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the
        Reviewing Officer but prior to the examinee. As applicable, the Final Approving
        Officer may recommend or give a commander-directed downgrade IAW paragraph
        5.9 if further action is warranted.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                               65


          7.3.6.2.5. MAJCOMs will specify in the MAJCOM supplement who the reviewing
          and final approving officers will be for evaluations other than formal course
          evaluations accomplished at an FTU. The same individual will not sign as both the
          Reviewing and Final Approving Officer.
          7.3.6.2.5. (USAFE) Table 7 1. (Added) lists reviewing and final approval
          authorities for AF Forms 8/8a. In the organization block, list both the organization
          and the office symbol.
              7.3.6.2.5.1. (Added-USAFE) In no case will the SEFE also sign as the
              reviewing/approving officer for an evaluation he/she administered. If the SEFE
              would normally be the reviewing or approving officer and an exception is not
              noted in Table 7.1 (Added), the SEFE’s deputy/vice commander (e.g. OG/CD for
              the OG/CC, WG/CV fr the WG/CC) may be used. If there is no deputy/vice
              available, use the next reviewing/approving officer in the examinee’s chain of
              command (i.e. Flt/CC, SQ/CC, OG/CC, WG/CC, NAF/CC, COMUSAFE).

NOTES:
1. If the SQ/CC or DO is the SEFE, at SQ/CC discretion the examinee’s Flt/CC or a SQ/ADO
may be the reviewing officer and the SQ/DO/CC (whomever was not the SEFE) the approving
officer.
2. If the SQ/CC is the SEFE, the DO will be the reviewing officer.
3. If the immediate supervisor is not rated, then use the next rated supervisor in the examinee’s
chain of command
4. If the OG/CC is the SEFE, the WG/CC will be the approving officer
5. For HQ USAFE and HQ NAF personnel below the division chief level, the applicable
division chief is the approving officer (e.g. for A3TV SEFEs, A3T is the approving officer).
6. MAF Only: At unit discretion (as described in the unit supplement), the Chief of CCV
66                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


may sign as Reviewing Officer in instances where the DO would sign.
7. After attached SQ/CC review, route AF Form 8 to USAFE/A3T (with info to
USAFE/A3TV) for further staffing.
         7.3.6.2.6. For evaluations completed at formal course FTU locations, the reviewing
         and final approving officers will be assigned to the FTU.
     7.3.6.3. Organization Block Format. The format and content of data for the
     Organization block for the flight examiner and reviewing and final approving officers
     will be as follows:
         7.3.6.3.1. Flight examiner. Annotate unit/organization and office symbol of the
         flight examiner that completed the evaluation (e.g., 526 ARS/DOT, 12AF/OV,
         USAFE/A3TV).
         7.3.6.3.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers. Annotate unit/organization
         and office symbol as directed by MAJCOM supplement (e.g., 93 BS/DO, 388

         in paragraph 7.3.6.3.2
     7.3.6.4. Examinee. The examinee will sign and date after the Final Approving Officer
     certifying that they have been debriefed and understand the action(s) being taken.
     Annotate unit/organization and office symbol in the Typed Name and Grade block (e.g.
     HQ ACC/A3TV, 48 OG/OGV, etc.).
         7.3.6.4.1. (Added-USAFE) If the examinee chooses not to sign, the AF Form 8/8a
         is still considered valid and will be filed in the FEF without the examinee’s signature.
         A Major Discrepancy MFR (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) will then be written and signed
         by the approving officer stating the circumstances behind the examinee’s lack of
         signature. Ensure that the MFR communicates whether or not the examinee has been
         briefed on the results of their evaluation.
  7.3.7. – Comments.
     7.3.7.1. Restrictions (if required).
         7.3.7.1.1. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will

          7.3.7.3.1.1. First Sortie, Second Sortie, etc. entries on subsequent paragraphs/
          subparagraphs will be annotated only if there are discrepancies or recommended
          additional training.
          7.3.7.3.1.2. In all instances, except for the mission description, if no verbiage is
          needed annotate with ―None‖.
       7.3.7.3.2. Mission Description. The verbiage of the Mission Description will be
       IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and will verify that the required areas for the evaluation
       were accomplished. Comments addressing specific areas in which instructional ability
       was demonstrated are mandatory for all evaluations of instructors (if the instructor
       taught throughout the entire mission and there were numerous areas in which
       instructional ability was demonstrated, one general comment will suffice).
       7.3.7.3.3. Discrepancies. Document discrepancies by annotating the grading area
       number, grading area title (followed by any subarea title in parenthesis), grade (Q-
       /U), annotation if discrepancy was debriefed and synopsis of discrepancy. Associate

          are documented or additional training is needed), include both ―1. Ground.‖ and
          ―2. Flight.‖ In cases where a discrepancy or additional training is documented in
          only one phase, annotate ―None‖ as applicable in the other area.
       7.3.7.3.4. Recommended Additional Training.
          7.3.7.3.4.1. If discrepancies are documented in paragraph B and are not listed as
          Debriefed, annotate Paragraph C with recommended additional training.
          7.3.7.3.4.2. Descriptions of assigned additional training will include how
          satisfactory knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or
          an instructor.

          minimum annotate the proficiency that will be required by the examinee prior to
          the recheck.
          7.3.7.3.4.4. Flight and ground discrepancies will be listed separately. If there is
          no additional training, annotate paragraph C as, ―Recommended Additional
          Training. None.‖
          7.3.7.3.4.5. (Added-USAFE) In the event of a failed evaluation, the intent of
          documentation under the ―Additional Training‖ heading is only to annotate what
          the examinee must do PRIOR to any requalification actions. Comments detailing
          requalification events and/or how an examinee will regain qualification after
          additional training is completed will not be annotated in this section.

   7.3.9. Rechecks
      7.3.9.1. Flight Rechecks
          7.3.9.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8/8a from the Q3 AF Form 8/8a for flight phase
          rechecks.
          7.3.9.1.2. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include documentation of the flight
          phase evaluation, Requisite completion dates from the Q3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
          annotated on the recheck form unless requisites were not completed or are required to
          complete the recheck.
          7.3.9.1.3. If the flight recheck is completed prior to completion of required requisites,
          delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until requisites are complete and enter the
          requisites on the recheck AF Form 8/8a.
          7.3.9.1.3. (USAFE) EXAMPLE: An examinee takes and fails an INSTM flight
          evaluation in the third month of eligibility, but successfully completes a flight
          recheck in the fourth month; however, ground requisites are not completed until the
          fifth month. In this case, the Q3 AF Form 8 will not have the ground requisites
          annotated and may be completed and signed with just the flight phase documented
          (with associated verbiage in Section II). The flight recheck AF Form 8 will then
          annotate the results of both ground requisites and the flight phase recheck (with
          associated verbiage in Section II.
      7.3.9.2. Ground Rechecks.
          7.3.9.2.1. A ground recheck will be documented on the Q3 AF Form 8/8a that
          generated it.
          7.3.9.2.2. Except as described below, the AF Form 8/8a will be documented as
          described in paragraphs 7.3.4 through 7.3.7.
             7.3.9.2.2.1. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date (ground requisite or
             successful ground recheck) of the evaluation.
             7.3.9.2.2.2. Flight Phase. Document the date of the ground recheck on a separate
             line as ―GROUND RECHECK‖ below the flight evaluation entry under Flight
             Phase.
             7.3.9.2.2.3. Qualification Level. Annotate the overall qualification level as ―3/1‖
             in the qualified block.
             7.3.9.2.2.4. The flight examiner that completed the flight evaluation (i.e. the one
             that gave the overall Q3) will sign the front of the AF Form 8/8a. If the recheck
             examiner is different than the flight examiner that gave the Q3, the recheck
             examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement in Section IV - Comments,
             Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraph 7.3.7.3).
7.4. Commander-Directed Downgrade (see also paragraph 5. 9). Except as described below,
the AF Form 8/8a for a Commander-directed Downgrade will be IAW paragraph 7.3.

AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                              75


     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.5. (USAFE) The flying SQ/CC (or equivalent) or designated representative will be
     the certifying official.
     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―Renamed (new
         title)‖ under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.

   information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
   AF Form 4348.
   7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
   Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
   maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
   e-Publishing web site.
       7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
       section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
          7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
          generated AF Form 4348.
   7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
   certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
   certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
   are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
   Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
   signify transcription accuracy.
7.7. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8/8a accomplished by the aircrew member. See
example at Attachment 5.
7.7. (USAFE) AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. Update the AF Form 942 in the FEF as
soon as temp eval documentation is filed in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.3.8. This update may be

       ―INSTR‖), use upper and lower case letters.
       7.7.1.2. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
       data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
       desired.
       7.7.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those in which
       the qualification levels awarded on portions of a combined evaluation are not all the
       same.
       7.7.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
       any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
       awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
       level.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                                 77

   made for each change in the individual’s MAJCOM based on a Permanent Change of Station
   (PCS)/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). Do not annotate a change of MAJCOM if
   the individual is receiving an evaluation from an evaluator in a different MAJCOM unless
   the individual is enrolled in a formal training program.
   7.7.6. (USAFE) MAJCOM Change. A ―USAFE‖ entry is not needed until the individual
   completes their first checkride after being assigned to USAFE, i.e., ―USAFE‖ will be
   annotated in conjunction with logging the first completed evaluation.
   7.7.7. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
   used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942 should
   be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron.
7.8. Flight Evaluation Folders (FEF). The FEF contains the source documents that constitute
the history of flying qualifications for each aircrew member.
   7.8.1. Maintenance.
      7.8.1.1. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF that includes all
      AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and any additional MAJCOM
      and/or unit specified items. EXCEPTION: for flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-
      rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification do not require an
      FEF, documentation will be IAW paragraph 8.1.
      7.8.1.1. (USAFE) A USAFE Form 136, Flight Evaluation Folder Review/Minor
      Discrepancy Log, will be kept in the FEF. Unless specifically authorized by AFI 11-
      2MDS Vol 2 or unit supplement, other documents will not be kept in the FEF.
          7.8.1.1.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) While FEFs may not contain additional
          documents, the following items will be installed locally for organization and
          document protection purposes: (1) an AF Form 614, Charge out Record, will be the
          first (highest) item the right side of the folder, (2) a plastic transparency sheet will be

         placed above the most recent AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation, and the most
         recent Form 8 (or associated MFR), and (3) a divider sheet will be placed above of
         the last Form 8 filed before the member arrived at Mildenhall. The design of the
         transparencies and dividing sheet is at the discretion of CCV.
     7.8.1.2. The FEF must be maintained by a Stan/Eval functional office - normally in the
     organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
     7.8.1.3. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
     Stan/Eval function of the unit to which they are attached for flying.

     the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
  7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
     7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
     into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
     maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
     7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,
     Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.
     7.8.2.3. Electronic FEF systems must be able to produce hard copies of FEF products,
     when needed, consistent with the guidance in this AFI. Additionally, the electronic FEF
     must be transportable.
     7.8.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Upon conversion to an electronic FEF, units will mark the
     hardcopy FEF on the outside with conversion date and ―For Reference Use Only‖. A
     cover sheet will then be inserted on top of Section II stating that all subsequent AF Form
     8 documentation is kept in PEX (or other certified system IAW paragraph 7.1.2.4
     (Added)).
     7.8.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Unit supplement will provide guidance on electronic FEF

     evaluations listed on the AF Form 942.
        7.8.3.2.1. AF Forms 8/8a. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most
        recent on top. Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more MDSs or two or
        more crew positions in the same MDS will file AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order
        – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
        7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
                7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Send a copy of the memo to the
                ―USAFE/A3TV (Workflow)‖ org account prior to the original evaluation’s
                expiration date.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.

     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.1. (MILDENHALL) All FEFs will be maintained by 351 ARS/CCV. All
        FEFs will receive an initial review in accordance with Attachment 16, Initial FEF
        Review Coordination Sheet. OG staff reviews above the Chief of OGV are not
        required. Periodic reviews thereafter will be accomplished using locally produced
        checklists.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                            81


        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (USAFE) CCVs will conduct FEF reviews annually (defined as once
        every 12 months). A ―posting‖ review may count as an annual review if both
        paragraphs 7.8.5.2 and 7.8.5.3 are complied with at the time of review.
     7.8.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Document initial, posting, and annual reviews on the USAFE
     Form 136.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
        7.8.6.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Minor discrepancies will be recorded on the USAFE
        Form 136. Each minor discrepancy listed on the form will contain the affected AF
        Forms 8/8a/4348 (if used), completion date on form (if applicable), short description
        of discrepancy and date the discrepancy was discovered. Units are not responsible for
        documenting the minor discrepancies on any stan/eval form that was generated prior
        to the individuals arrival in USAFE.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
            7.8.6.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) SEFE initials on corrections do not need to be wet
            ink. Since electronic/digital signatures are allowed on the final form, if the SEFE
            is no longer available in person, initials may be obtained whereby the AF Form
82                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


            8/8a is emailed IAW paragraph 7.1.2.3 (Added) and the SEFE emails a scanned,
            initialed copy for filing in the FEF.
            7.8.6.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) OGV Chiefs may initial for corrections of minor
            discrepancies in the original SEFE’s absence; however, a ―Lack of SEFE
            availability‖ that would drive this requirement is limited to instances where the
            SEFE has separated/retired or otherwise is not able to receive an electronic
            document IAW paragraph 7.1.2.3 (Added).
         7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
         without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
         contents of the FEF.
         7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
         white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
         official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
         corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
         7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
         allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
         and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
         7.8.7.3.4. (Added-USAFE) A copy of the latest Letter of Xs (see Attachment 11
         (Added)) will be placed in the member’s FEF prior to an extended TDY (where the
         FEF is required to be transported by the member) or a PCS.
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.

     7.8.8.2. Outdated certification documents, ARMS products, medical recommendations
     and miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the
     aircrew member for disposal.

                                          Chapter 8

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
       8.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) If a flight phase event is required thereby generating an AF
       Form 8/8a, an FEF will be built and maintained by the applicable Stan/Eval function.
       8.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) If no flight phase event is required, the applicable Stan/Eval
       function will not include the affected specialized aircrew on the Squadron Letter of Xs
       (see Attachment 11 (Added)) until ARMs and the associated AF Form 1522 has been
       verified.
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             85


                                          Chapter 9

       ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
      9.1.1.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) OGV maintains the master FCIF library. CCV
      administers the FCIF program. The OGV FCIF monitor is the OPR for flight manual
      control and distribution and is responsible for ordering all applicable technical orders,
      including changes and interim safety and/or operational supplements.
          9.1.1.1.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) OGV will produce a single numerical index
          and maintain this index with CCV assistance.
          9.1.1.1.2. (Added-MILDENHALL) Classified entries will be cross-referenced to
          the Classified FCIF Volume I binder stored in 100 OSS/IN. This binder will only be
          maintained if classified entries exist.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
   9.1.2. (USAFE) The intent of this guidance is not to prohibit the release of waivers to
   publications via FCIF.
      9.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE/A3 will not release FCIFs to issue publications.
      Units will issue TOs (to include operational/safety supplements), USAF, Lead-MAJCOM
      (that has not associated USAFE guidance), USAFE, and local instructions required for
      flight via unit FCIFs.
      9.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) MAF. Even if unit TODOs received formal releases of TOs
      and associated checklist from their Flight Manual Managers, OGVs will not release to
      aircrew until AMC has issued a formal release message (usually via AMC FCIF).
      USAFE/A3TV SMEs will provide awareness to the OGVs of AMC’s formal release
      message; however, this is for information only and units should not withhold release of
      publications waiting for a USAFE/A3TV notification.
          9.1.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) This guidance also applies to non-TO, non-AFI
          publications managed and released by lead-MAJCOM and annotated as required by
          AFI 11-2MDS Volumes.
          9.1.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) This guidance does not apply to AFIs. Once an AFI is
          officially published on USAF E-Publishing site, it is considered official, enforceable
          guidance.
 86                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


      9.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) CAF. Upon receipt of TO (and associated checklists) release
      notification from the applicable Flight Manual Manager, OGVs may release to aircrew at
      their discretion.
      9.1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) In all instances, if units encounter difficulties (e.g. receipt of
      paper products, errors in product distribution) that cannot be resolved directly with the
      applicable Flight Manual Manager, send any questions or requests for assistance to
      USAFE/A3TV.
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:

Table 9.1. Required Volumes.

VOLUME                        TITLE

VOLUME I                      Table of Contents/Current Read File

VOLUME II                     Publications—Air Force Directives MAJCOM Supplements

VOLUME III                    Publications—MAJCOM/NAF/Local Directives

VOLUME IV                     Flight Manuals/Checklists/Aircrew Aids/Technical Orders

VOLUME V (Optional)           Flight Safety Information
   9.1.4. Current Read File. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to include an Index
   (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B and C (Note: Part C is optional)). MAJCOMs may
   add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
      9.1.4.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in FCIF Volumes I
      through V.
      9.1.4.1. (USAFE) Include squadron appointment letter for primary and alternate FCIF
      monitor (see paragraph 9.1.5.8 (Added)).
      9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
      temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
      before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to all
      using MAJCOMs.
          9.1.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Part B will be divided into two sections (with associated
          indexes): Current and Rescinded FCIF Read Files. HQ USAFE/A3 approves/rescinds
          all USAFE-directed Part B FCIF items. The OG/CC approves all unit-directed FCIF
          items. Squadron’s will not issue FCIFs, but may use a Squadron Read File or similar
          forum for release of squadron-specific FCIF-type information.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                       87


       9.1.4.2.1. (MILDENHALL) OGV will produce and maintain a separate rescinded
       FCIFs index with CCV assistance. Rescinded FCIFs will be listed in the order they
       were rescinded, with the most recently rescinded FCIF at the top. The rescinded
       FCIFs index will be formatted similarly to the Part B index.
          9.1.4.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Rescinded items will be maintained for six months
          according to T13-08 R38.00 of the Air Force RDS. Upon rescission, the date
          rescinded, 6-month removal date, and disposition will be entered in the
          appropriate index (see Table 9.3 (Added)).
          9.1.4.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Index and divide FCIF read files by MDS or
          squadron designation.
          9.1.4.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Index and file individual FCIFs in reverse
          numerical sequence with the latest item on top.
          9.1.4.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Annotate the current index with the assigned
          control number, title, OPR/USAFE item number, distribution date, and
          suspense/expiration. Annotate the rescinded index with the assigned control
          number, title, OPR/USAFE item number, date rescinded, and 6-month removal
          date (see Table 9.3 (Added)).
              9.1.4.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) A single index may be used for both current
              and rescinded FCIFs. If used annotated items IAW Table 9.3 (Added) below.
              9.1.4.2.1.4.2. (Added-USAFE) In all cases cross-reference classified entries
              to the appropriate location.
              9.1.4.2.1.4.3. (Added-USAFE) The annotated suspense will also be
              considered a review date. If the item is still determined valid and necessary
              after review, the suspense date must be changed or the item must be reissued.
       9.1.4.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB).,
          9.1.4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If an FCB is used place it in Part B of Vol I. The
          FCB may be used in lieu of the FCIFs annotated in the FCB as long as the FCB
          contains all current FCIFs (as applicable to the OG’s assigned MDSs) at the time
          the FCB is published.
          9.1.4.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) OGV is responsible for the update and
          maintenance of the FCB and will reference the HQ USAFE/A3TV ICE for an
          updated listing of current and rescinded FCIFs.
          9.1.4.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) New FCIFs will be placed on top of the FCB per
          instructions in paragraph 9.1.4.2.1 (Added) until a new FCB is published.
          9.1.4.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Annotate each FCB entry by the date (month and
          year) of original FCIF release, the releasing authority (e.g. HQ USAFE, OGV,
          etc.), and whether the item has been carried over from a previous edition of the
          FCB. See also any FCB requirements in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3.
          9.1.4.2.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Once an FCB is published, all FCIFs contained in
          the FCB may be removed from the Current section of Part B. Incorporation of an
          FCIF item into an FCB does not constitute rescission of that FCIF. The
 88                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


             incorporated FCIFs will be filed elsewhere until such time that they become
             rescinded.
             9.1.4.2.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Once an FCIF is rescinded, it will be deleted from
             the FCB and filed in the Rescinded section of Part B.

      9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
      not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
      9.1.4.3. (USAFE) Part C will be annotated as a ―Squadron Read File‖ and will include
      current operational and mission guidance that does not have a direct impact on flight-
      safety. At SQ/CC discretion items in the squadron read file may be required reading prior
      to flight. Clearly document such intention on the actual read file.
          9.1.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Part C items will not be less restrictive than any
          published guidance.
          9.1.4.3.1. (MILDENHALL) Part C, Squadron Read File. OGV will produce and
          maintain a single numerical index with CCV assistance. The Part C index will be
          formatted similarly to the Part B index.
          9.1.4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Index and file individual documents in reverse
          numerical sequence with the latest item on top.
      9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
      separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
      exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
      in the FCIF volumes.
      9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.
          9.1.4.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Within two duty days of receiving HQ USAFE FCIFs,
          affected OGVs will acknowledge receipt via email to the ―USAFE/A3TV
          (Workflow)‖ org account and post the FCIF IAW the guidance in this Chapter.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             89


        9.1.4.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Approval authority for waivers to USAFE FCIFs is
        USAFE/A3 unless otherwise stated in the USAFE FCIF. Submit waivers IAW
        paragraph 1.3
        9.1.4.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Units may use any FCIF format that suits their mission
        requirements as long as the following minimum items are annotated: unit control
        number, date distributed, post-not-later-than date (for squadrons), and
        review/rescission date. FCIFs will be approved and signed by the OG/CC or
        designated representative.
            9.1.4.5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) For the release of HQ USAFE FCIFs, units will
            either release as-is or, if needed, provide more restrictive implementation
            guidance. At no time will units issue less restrictive guidance than is
            communicated in the USAFE FCIF.
        9.1.4.5.4. (Added-USAFE) OGV is the focal point for any information released to
        aircrew via FCIF. Staff agencies at the wing-level and below that desire to release
        information via FCIF will coordinate with OGV (Volume V of the FCIF library
        excluded). Above the wing level, HQ USAFE/A3TV is the focal point for FCIF
        information.
     9.1.4.6. (Added-USAFE) OGVs may add additional components to Volume I as
     desired.
     9.1.4.6. (MILDENHALL) CCV will maintain a hardcopy of FCIF Volume I in the
     dispatch office. This binder is intended to serve as a master copy that aircrew can use as a
     reference. In the event of deployment, the deployed unit will use an electronic library as
     the primary source.
  9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
  Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
  requirements.
     9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
     authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft
     configuration.
     9.1.5.1. (USAFE) OGV and squadrons will establish a Publications Library that contain
     all USAF, MAJCOM, Technical Orders, and local publications applicable to the unit’s
     operation. If any part of the library is separated, it will be cross-referenced using a DD
     Form 2861, Cross Reference sheet for Technical Orders or identified on the publication
     library index for Air Force Instructions.
        9.1.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) OGV and squadrons will appoint a primary and
        alternate Publications Library monitor to ensure proper maintenance as directed by
        this supplement, AFI 33-360; section 2J, TO 00-5-1 AF Technical Order System, and
        local guidance. Place the appointment letter in Part A, Volume I of the FCIF Library.
        9.1.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Reference the USAFE Publication Library Index on the
        USAFE/A3TV                                                                  ICE
        (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/default.aspx) to determine
        minimum requirements for Volumes II through IV of the Publication Library. As
90                  AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


     directed in the unit supplement, units may maintain any/all of the library in electronic
     format as long as all of the following conditions are met.
     9.1.5.1.2. (MILDENHALL) The 100 OG FCIF library, all volumes, is maintained
     electronically, in accordance with the USAFE approval memo dated 27 Jun 2011.
     With paragraph 9.1.4.6.1 as the only exception, OGV and CCV will not maintain
     official hardcopies of any part of the FCIF library.
        9.1.5.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) All publications must be stored in the same format
        as they are distributed from the release/publishing authority, i.e. scanned copies of
        documents that are released/published only in hardcopy format are not allowed.
        9.1.5.1.2.1. (MILDENHALL) OGV is responsible for maintaining the e-pubs
        library.
        9.1.5.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) All relevant publications will be available from
        one electronic location (i.e., the library will not force aircrew to search for
        individual publications) and will be accessible and viewable by multiple aircrew
        simultaneously. This does not preclude the use of links to networked storage (e.g.
        USAF Epubs site), but the links will be directly to the publications and not to sub-
        folders that aircrew must look through to find the desired document.
        9.1.5.1.2.2. (MILDENHALL) 351 ARS/CCV is responsible for maintaining
        centralized mission kits in accordance with 11-2KC-135V3 and hardcopy
        publications in each flight publication kit in accordance with FCIF Library
        Volume I Part B, Current Read File.
        9.1.5.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Each location that must keep an FCIF library will
        also have at least one tier of a non-network, standalone backup capability (e.g.
        external harddrive, laptop, CD-ROM, etc.). The intent is to ensure the e-library is
        accessible and viewable when required regardless of primary e-library
        availability.
        9.1.5.1.2.3. (MILDENHALL) 351 ARS/DOP (Dispatch) is responsible for
        updating flight laptops with all FLIP, DAFIF, and e-pubs changes.
        9.1.5.1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Prior to allowing aircrew use of an e-library, units
        will gain USAFE/A3TV certification to ensure it complies with the standards in
        this supplement. E-library certification will be obtained from any A3TV evaluator
        on a formal (during a SAV/ASEV) or informal (during a regular flying visit) basis
        and will be annotated in Part A of Vol I signed by both the certifying individual
        and the OGV Chief.
        9.1.5.1.2.4. (MILDENHALL) Aircraft commanders are responsible for
        ensuring all required hardcopy and electronic publications, to include the contents
        of a mission kit when required, are current prior to flight.
        9.1.5.1.2.5. (Added-USAFE) The unit supplement will provide guidance on
        establishment of the e-library to include guidance on any unit-mandated hardcopy
        requirements. Units will maintain process descriptions with the e-library to
        facilitate program continuity. This process description may be published in the
        unit supplement or as a standalone document.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             91


         9.1.5.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Units will reference the USAF E-Pubs site and ETIMS
         to verify the currency of library publications.
         9.1.5.1.3. (MILDENHALL) OGV will review all publication changes and interim
         safety or operational supplements before distribution. Upon distribution, OGV will
         contact squadron FCIF Monitors, instructing them to collect and distribute the flight
         manual change as soon as possible.
         9.1.5.1.4. (Added-USAFE) EXCEPTION: As described in the unit supplement,
         OGVs may allow their squadrons to maintain only the TO guidance on aircraft
         configurations assigned to that squadron. In the event units must host or be
         temporarily responsible for alternately configured aircraft (e.g. -220 engines at -229-
         equipped units), OGVs will document in the unit supplement the standards and
         expectations for referencing applicable TOs.
         9.1.5.1.4. (MILDENHALL) 100 OGV will only maintain the applicable technical
         orders for Block 40 aircraft configurations.
      9.1.5.2. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the publications library
      containing, as a minimum, a listing of basic publications numbers and short titles.
      Publication dates, supplements and changes are not required.
      9.1.5.2. (USAFE) OGV will develop, maintain, and distribute a Master Publications
      Library Index to subordinate squadrons. The Master Index will identify publications
      required by OGV to be in hard copy format (if applicable).

9.2. Flight Related SII.
   9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis relating to existing procedure(s) designed to
   mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends.
       9.2.1.1. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures (reference guidance on
       issuing FCIFs in paragraph 9.1, above).
       9.2.1.2. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to
       include Safety Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related
       incidences, trend analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with
       equipment/procedures.
       9.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) HAF or COMUSAFE SIIs released under the AF Inspector
       General program as defined in AFI 90-201, paragraph 2.7. are not Stan/Eval SIIs in and
       of themselves. Unless an AFI 90-201 SII is subsequently released via FCIF as a
       Stan/Eval SII IAW the guidance in this section, a HAF or COMUSAFE SII will be
       inspected by the IG only during UCIs IAW AFI 90-201 guidance.
   9.2.2. SII(s) will be issued through the same process used to release FCIFs with the
   following elements:
       9.2.2.1. Specific MDS applicability
       9.2.2.2. References (document, SIB, etc)
       9.2.2.3. Risk factors and trend details
       9.2.2.4. Specific emphasis actions to reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that generated the
       SII.
       9.2.2.5. Effective date of rescission
          9.2.2.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Effective date of rescission will be IAW paragraph
          9.2.3.1 (Added).
       9.2.2.6. SME/POC for further information
   9.2.3. SII(s) will be of limited duration (generally not to exceed 90 days).
       9.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) All SIIs will have a review/rescission date no more than 90
       days from the date of issue. If after 90 days the SII is still valid, the issuing authority may
       reissue the SII at 90-day increments. The intent of this guidance is preclude SIIs from
       losing their effectiveness. If SII items need to become part of normal aircrew briefings,
       units will issue changes to unit standards or recommend changes to governing
       publications via the AF Form 847.
   9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
   from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
   units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
   SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
   within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
   9.2.4. (USAFE) SIIs may be issued from either the OG or SQ level.
 94                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


   9.2.5. Units will place all applicable SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part B, for
   dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.5. (USAFE) If issued from the squadron level, SIIs will be released via Squadron Read
   File (or equivalent) and stored in FCIF Volume I, Part C (see paragraph 9.1.4.3). Reference
   paragraph 9.2.3.1 (Added) for rescission guidance.
   9.2.6. All current MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed during flight
   briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission-specific SII(s) need only be briefed on those
   missions for which the SII is relevant.
   9.2.6. (USAFE) A listing of all current SII topics separated by issuing authority (e.g.
   USAFE, OG, SQ) will be posted in each briefing room or applicable aircrew flight briefing
   area for immediate reference during aircrew briefs. Additionally, post any quick-reference
   briefing aids that may accompany the release of an SII. Unless specifically prohibited by the
   FCIF releasing the SII, units may tailor briefings aids released in USAFE Stan/Eval SIIs to
   suit unit requirements.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight. Units will
provide guidance on this system in the unit supplement.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
       9.3.1.1. Form 8/8a qualification or appropriate ARMS products.
          9.3.1.1.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) Flight authorization officials (FAOs) and
          SARM will verify go/no-go status when flight authorizations are signed. If a
          discrepancy is noted in PEX at the time the flight orders are signed (i.e. an event that
          is overdue but has been waived), the flight authorization official will make written
          authorization and provide specific justification to the aircraft commander. Prior to
          flight, aircraft commanders will use the PEX Go/No-Go Report to verify the items
          listed in paragraphs 9.3.1.1 through 9.3.1.5. If a ―no-go‖ indication exists, the aircraft
          commander will not allow the affected crewmember(s) to fly unless authorization
          from the FAO is obtained. If PEX is not available, the aircraft commander will
          comply with paragraph 9.3.1.5.2.3 and use available SARM products as a sole means
          of verification. SARM will make these products available by either paper or
          electronic means. CCV will conduct a minimum of one SUPEVAL of this process
          annually using an OGV-developed checklist to ensure compliance.
       9.3.1.2. Ground and flight currency items required for flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
       AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, and AFI 11-421 Aviation Resource Management.
       9.3.1.3. Examination items required for flight from this AFI and applicable supplements
       (see Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.4. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       9.3.1.5. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B) items.
          9.3.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) All aircrew (assigned and attached) will review and sign
          off FCIFs (Vol 1, part B) using either the USAFE Form 287, Flight Crew Information
          File Certification, or an automated FCIF tracking system (e.g. PEX). If an automated
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                             95


        tracking system is used, a temporary USAFE Form 287 will be used if the automated
        tracking system cannot be accessed for any reason. The temporary USAFE Form 287
        may be disposed of when all reviews have subsequently been re-entered into the
        automated tracking system.
        9.3.1.5.1. (MILDENHALL) Initial review will be accomplished prior to an aircrew
        member’s first flight at Mildenhall. The initial review will be considered
        accomplished upon signing off all FCIFs and Read Files in PEX. Annual reviews will
        be accomplished by logging the annual FCIF review affirmation in PEX. Aircraft
        commanders will ensure all crewmembers have signed off all FCIFs in PEX before
        stepping to the aircraft.
        9.3.1.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Initial/Annual FCIF Reviews.
        9.3.1.5.2. (MILDENHALL) FCIF reviews will be documented in PEX. If PEX is
        not available to include off station sorties, the Aircraft Commander will verify that all
        crewmembers have read all current FCIFs and have completed a successful monthly
        boldface exam. After this verification, each crewmember will initial to the left of his
        or her name on the copy of the flight orders.
            9.3.1.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) All aircrew (both assigned and attached) will
            accomplish an initial and annual review of all FCIFs (vol 1, Part B). The initial
            review will be completed prior to the first flight after being assigned/attached to a
            squadron (not required for attached flyers if the initial review was accomplished
            when the attached flyer was previously assigned to the same unit regardless of
            squadron).
            9.3.1.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Assigned or attached crewmembers absence from
            flying at their home station 90 days or more will accomplish a complete review
            prior to flight (this review may be counted as the annual review).
            9.3.1.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Document reviews            IAW paragraph 9.3.1.5.1
            (Added).
     9.3.1.6. (Added-MILDENHALL) Publications/Tech Order Currency. All required hard
     copy and electronic publications and FLIP must be current and reflect the latest changes
     posted by OGV.
     9.3.1.7. (Added-MILDENHALL) Individual Readiness to Fly. All aircrew members
     must be polled regarding individual factors that could be reasons for removal from the
     flying schedule or to modify planned mission content.
     9.3.1.8. (Added-MILDENHALL) Operational Risk Management (ORM). The aircrew
     will complete an operational risk assessment using the 100 OG ORM Worksheet prior to
     flight. Inform the appropriate authority (ARS/DO or designated representative) prior to
     flight if moderate or greater risk levels are identified.
  9.3.2. (Added-USAFE) SARM personnel will be the primary verifiers of Go/No-Go status.
  The unit supplement may designate additional levels of supervision to include
  Aircraft/Mission Commanders (MAF) as able to verify Go/No-Go status prior to releasing
  aircrews for scheduled missions.
 96                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


   9.3.2. (MILDENHALL) Once the crew has completed their mission paperwork, the aircraft
   commander will file a copy of the filed/signed flight plan, flight orders, Form F, completed
   ORM worksheet, flight laptop hand receipt, and passenger manifest (if applicable) in 351
   ARS/DOP (Dispatch Office).
      9.3.2.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) If any required component of a crewmember’s
      go/no-go status cannot be verified, the crewmember will not step to the aircraft.
   9.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Monthly Boldface/CAPs. Reference paragraph 6.10.5 (Added),
   monthly Boldface/CAPs exams are a Go/No-Go item. Unit supplements will include
   guidance on implementation under this paragraph.
   9.3.3. (MILDENHALL) Aircrew members will log monthly boldface exams by signing-off
   the monthly boldface exam affirmation in the FCIF module of PEX. Aircrew members
   deployed or TDY off-station will accomplish monthly boldface exams when required and
   will sign the boldface affirmation before their first flight after returning to RAF Mildenhall.
   Any Aircraft Commander or instructor of like specialty must grade all exams. Instructor
   pilots may grade navigator or boom operator exams. Monthly boldface exams are correctable
   to 100% and must be corrected prior to flight. Once graded correct, file the exam in the bin
   labeled ―Monthly Boldface Exams‖ located in the Mission Planning Area.
      9.3.3.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) As an additional quality control measure, CCV will
      collect and review monthly boldface exams to ensure compliance. Aircrew members
      (both the grader and test taker) associated with a failed monthly boldface exam will
      accomplish an additional exam in CCV as soon as possible. CCV will send an email
      notification of the failure to OGV and each member’s commander (or supervisor if
      applicable).
   9.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Situation Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). For fighter
   aircrew, SEPTs are a Go/No-Go item. Accomplish SEPTs in accordance with AFI 11-2MDS,
   Vol 1.
9.4. Supplementary Evaluations.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander
   to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
      9.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) SUPEVALs aid the commander in determining if there is a
      problem in standardization or execution of the unit’s mission(s) as reflected in inspection
      findings or negative trends during checkrides. SUPEVALs also are the last link in the
      chain connecting known problems and the implementation of corrective actions. The
      consequences of SUPEVALs may be as small as implementing an extra step in a
      checklist to as far reaching as changing a squadron’s entire annual training program. See
      Attachment 12 (Added) for more information
      9.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) SUPEVALs should be implemented by all levels of flying
      supervision, not just by the OG/CC.
      9.4.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The USAFE SUPEVAL program consist of both operational
      and in-flight evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                          97


         9.4.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Operational SUPEVALs. Operational SUPEVALs
         cover shop duties that require compliance with published guidance.
             9.4.1.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Conduct unit operational SUPEVALs once every
             calendar year, but not to exceed 12 months. Units will use the USAFE/A3TV
             Inspection Checklists posted on the USAFE/A3TV ICE under the ―SAV/ASEV
             Info‖ folder as the baseline for constructing their own SUPEVAL checklists.
             9.4.1.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of
             required operational SUPEVALs up to 3 months. Document extensions in SEB
             minutes.
             9.4.1.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, the unit program will conduct a
             SUPEVAL on all squadron Stan/Eval programs areas as listed in the most current
             USAFE/A3TV SAV/ASEV Criteria Guide.
         9.4.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) In-flight SUPEVALs. In-flight SUPEVALs cover a
         specific topic for a finite period. Examples include (but are not limited to): SFO
         execution, flight discipline, flight leadership, noise abatement, communication
         discipline, CRM issues, etc..
  9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
  9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
  evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
  evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
  management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
     9.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Reporting. Submit a written report to the commander that
     initiated the SUPEVAL no later than 2 weeks after completion of the SUPEVAL (info
     copy to USAF/A3TV). OGV (for mandatory and OG-directed SUPEVALS) and CCV
     (for SQ/CC-directed SUPEVALs) shall retain a 2 year history of all SUPEVAL reports
     (may be electronic, hardcopy, or both at unit’s discretion). The report shall include the
     following items at a minimum:
         9.4.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Purpose and objectives of SUPEVAL (e.g. in response
         to SEB findings, trends, etc.)
         9.4.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Discrepancies
         9.4.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Recommendation(s) for corrective actions
         9.4.3.1.4. (Added-USAFE) OPR and Suspense dates for completion of corrective
         actions.
  9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
  supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
  9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
  evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
  result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.

EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED: The examinee demonstrated exceptional aircraft handling
and instrument skills during all phases of this evaluation. Rapidly changing weather and denial
of service at two planned out-bases caused the examinee to have to change his plan several
times in-flight, each time done quickly and efficiently so that all aspects of the mission could
still be accomplished.

                               Attachment 8 (Added-USAFE)
 SEFE OBJECTIVITY EVALUATION GRADING CRITERIA & DOCUMENTATION
                           GUIDANCE

A8.1. (Added) Purpose. To hold SEFEs accountable to objectively evaluating aircrew against
the standards of performance outlined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 as well as provide commanders a
way to assess the capabilities of the SEFEs under their command.
A8.2. (Added) Execution. SEFE-certified commanders at any level (to include Senior Flight
Examiners) may give or direct SEFE objectivity evaluations at any time. Additionally, a SEFE
objectivity evaluation (given either in-flight or during the administration of an EPE) will be
given to initially-certified SEFEs (SEFEs who have never been certified before) by any HQ
USAFE SEFE, OGV SEFE, the OG/CC, or the SEFE’s assigned SQ/CC within the first 12
months after becoming a SEFE (may not be accomplished on the first evaluation after becoming
a SEFE). See Table A8.1 (Added) for grading criteria.
   A8.2.1. (Added) Waiver authority for extending the 12 month window for Objectivity
   Evaluations conducted on initially certified SEFEs is the SQ/CC. Document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2
   A8.2.2. (Added) Use the area grading criteria in Table A8.1 (Added) to assign both area
   and overall grades based on the two-tier grading system Q/U.
       A8.2.2.1. (Added) An overall Q indicates that the SEFE complied with HHQ and local
       stan/eval directives, properly briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified
       discrepancies, awarded an appropriate grade for each area evaluated, awarded an
       appropriate overall grade, and, if required, assigned appropriate additional training.
       A8.2.2.2. (Added) Award an overall U when, in the SEFE’s judgment, the SEFE
       examinee failed to satisfy Q requirements or additional training is warranted. Awarding a
       U will result in loss of SEFE certification until re-certified by the SQ/CC (squadron-
       designated evaluators) or the OG/CC (OGV-designated evaluators). Recertification
       standards will be stipulated in the unit supplement.
          A8.2.2.2.1. (Added-MILDENHALL) The evaluator failing the evaluation will
          meet with the 351 ARS SQ/CC (SQ/CC-designated evaluators) or the OG/CC
          (OG/CC-designated evaluators) before additional training or recheck will occur. The
          associated commander may choose to not re-certify the evaluator. If the evaluator will
          be re-certified, the evaluator must accomplish, at a minimum, all additional training,
          if assigned, and a successful recheck before re-certification may occur.
   A8.2.3. (Added) The OG/CC and Chief of OGV may administer objectivity evaluations in
   all unit aircraft to a SEFE in any crew position.
   A8.2.4. (Added) HQ USAFE SEFEs may conduct objectivity evaluations in all command
   aircraft to a SEFE in any crew position.
   A8.2.5. (Added) SEFEs authorized by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 to administer evaluations to other
   crew positions can also administer these crewmembers an objectivity evaluation, e.g. F-15E
   Weapon System Operator (WSO) SEFEs can give F-15E pilot SEFEs objectivity evaluations.
   A8.2.6. (Added) Objectivity evaluations may be combined with any other evaluation.
 124                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


A8.3. (Added) Grading. SEFEs will use the grading criteria shown in Table A8.1 (Added)
when conducting SEFE Objectivity Evaluations.
A8.4. (Added) Documentation. Except as described below, the AF Form 8 for a SEFE
Objectivity Evaluation will be completed IAW paragraph 7.3 Use a separate AF Form 8 if the
objectivity evaluation is combined with any other evaluation.
   A8.4.1. (Added) - Examinee Identification.
       A8.4.1.1. (Added) Aircraft/Crew Position. Annotate the applicable crew position

                           BRIEFING FACILITIES GUIDANCE

A10.1. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, the following materials will be available in either the
mission planning area or flight briefing room(s) for the express purpose of facilitating the
mission planning/briefing process as described in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3. Items not applicable
based on MDS and/or host nation requirements may be omitted. Use the following definitions:
   A10.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Mission Planning: Includes the time period from the start of
   dedicated planning and any material used/produced specifically for the execution of the
   tasked mission.
   A10.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Briefing: Starts with the beginning of the official aircrew pre-
   mission brief as described in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3. Does not include pre-brief ―rallies‖ or
   informal gatherings not a part of the AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3 briefing process.
   A10.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Supervision of Flying: Includes SOF, Ops Sup/Top 3, or any
   similar duty position within the squadron involved with advising aircrew while they are on-
   mission starting from ground ops and continuing through engine shutdown.
A10.2. (Added-USAFE) All information, either hard copy or electronic, used for mission
planning, briefing, and supervision of flying must be current and correct (i.e. no ―For Reference
Use Only‖ material will be used). See also paragraph 3.2.1.3.1. (Added).
   A10.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Items listed below will be current and correct to the level of
   detail commensurate with their role in the planned mission/brief IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3
   and AFI 11-202 Vol 3 (e.g. if the local area map is also used for planning/briefing low-level
   ops then it must have current DAFIF/ECHUM).
A10.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Information need not be updated for items of a temporary nature
(i.e. released through NOTAM, FCIF, or similar guidance), but aircrew will include temporary
updates that are relevant to the mission in the briefing.

   A10.2.3. (Added-USAFE) In lieu of replacing required information each time new
   guidance is released, units may provide a summary of changes relevant to the unit’s missions
   (either individually for each applicable item listed below or combined for all items) that
   is/are available for each briefing.
A10.3. (Added-USAFE) Flight briefing rooms will be well lit and of adequate size to
comfortably seat all flight members. In squadrons where space is limited, the flight planning
room and briefing room may be collocated.
A10.4. (USAFE) A hard copy of the unit Pilot/Aircrew Aid, In-Flight Guide (IFG), and/or
electronic briefing material may be used to satisfy these requirements as long as they are
accessible and viewable by all flight members during the brief.
A10.5. (USAFE) If electronic briefing items are used to fulfill any of these requirements,
squadrons will maintain an effective backup capability. The backup products need not be to the
same resolution as the primary, but will be current/complete IAW A10.2.2. (Added).
 130                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012


A10.6. (USAFE) Regardless of the method used to display the material or the location in which
it is maintained, aircrew will ensure that items relevant to the mission are present in the flight
briefing room at the time of briefing.

                               Attachment 11 (Added-USAFE)
                       LETTER OF CERTIFICATION GUIDANCE

A11.1. (Added-USAFE) Purpose. The purpose of this attachment is to further define USAFE
requirements for units to maintain a Letter of Xs. The requirement to maintain a Letter of Xs is
IAW paragraphs 4.2.3.2., 5.10.2., 7.1., and 7.2.
A11.2. (USAFE) Intent. The intent of the Letter of Xs is to provide the SQ/CC a summary
document annotating the certifications/qualifications of all aircrew in the squadron.
   A11.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Being a summary document, the Letter of Xs will be used in
   concert with source training/certification/qualification documentation (e.g. gradebooks, AF
   Forms 8/8a, etc.) to verify the validity of certification/qualification claims.
   A11.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Specifically for certifications, in any instance where the source
   document cannot be located, the Master Letter of Xs, with a valid SQ/CC (or designated
   representative) signature, may be used as the source document for that certification.
A11.3. (Added-USAFE) Management and Publication.
   A11.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Unit supplements will describe the overall management of the
   Letter of Xs, which may be assumed by the unit training function if desired.
       A11.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If units choose to have the squadron training function
       manage the Letter of Xs, the Stan/Eval function will still verify the correctness of the
       final Letter of X prior to SQ/CC (or designated representative as annotated in the unit
       supplement) signature.
   A11.3.2. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, a Master Letter of Xs will be published by the
   7th of each month IAW the following guidance.
       A11.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Signature and Posting. The Master Letter of Xs will be
       signed by the SQ/CC (or designated representative). Electronic/digital signatures are
       authorized and will conform to the guidance in paragraph 7.1.2.
           A11.3.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) After the SQ/CC (or designated representative as
           annotated in the unit supplement) signs the Master Letter of Xs and prior to any
           distribution of the document, the managing office will ―finalize‖ the document so that
           no further changes may be made.
           A11.3.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Units will define in their supplements how the Letter
           of Xs will be finalized (e.g. saved as a PDF file, using the "Mark as Final" function in
           MS Office, etc.)
           A11.3.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) After being finalized, the Letter of Xs will be posted
           in a central location as stipulated in unit supplement, but will be readily available to
           squadron supervision. All other distributed copies will be taken as ―For Reference
           Use Only‖.
       A11.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Items. Annotate a Master Letter of Xs with the
       following minimum information as applicable to the MDS/crew position and specific
       mission taskings.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                         137


          A11.3.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) A listing of all assigned and attached flying
          personnel.
          A11.3.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Instructor qualifications
          A11.3.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Evaluator certifications
          A11.3.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Pilot Weather Category (PWC) certifications
          A11.3.2.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Flight Lead certifications (at unit discretion, this may
          be broken out into two and four-ship flight lead listings)
          A11.3.2.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Functional Check Flight (FCF) aircrew certifications
          A11.3.2.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Aircraft in which AE crewmembers, CSOs, and FAs
          are qualified.
   A11.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Annotating changes on the Master Letter of Xs. When changes
   to the Letter of Xs are needed, units have two options: 1) create a new Master Letter of Xs
   IAW paragraph A11.3.2., or 2) make pen and ink changes to the posted Master Letter of Xs
   IAW the following guidance.
       A11.3.3.1. (Added-USAFE) The SQ/CC (or designated representative) are the only
       individuals authorized may make pen and ink changes to the Master Letter of Xs.
       A11.3.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The Master Letter of Xs will only be updated after the
       individual’s training is complete and the appropriate qualification/certification
       documentation has been signed/verified by the approving authority for that event.
       A11.3.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Using red ink, update the Master Letter of Xs and initial
       next to the change.
A11.4. (Added-USAFE) Commander-directed decertification. Units will provide guidance in
the unit supplement on the use of the Squadron Letter of X for documenting Commander-
Directed decertifications.
A11.5. (USAFE) Disposition. Managing offices will archive superseded letters for at least 12
months from the date of signature on a new master Letter of Xs.

                               Attachment 11 (MILDENHALL)
                        LETTER OF CERTIFICATION GUIDANCE

A11.3.1. (MILDENHALL) 351 ARS/CCV will provide overall management of the Letter of
X program.
           A11.3.2.1.2. (MILDENHALL) The final Letter of Xs will be saved as a PDF file. If
           the squadron commander is not available to sign, the DO may sign ―for‖ the
           commander.
           A11.3.2.1.3. (MILDENHALL) The final Letter of Xs will be posted in three places:
           (1) in the Go/No-Go binder in dispatch, (2) in the 351 ARS/CCV Letter of Xs
           continuity book, and (3) the counter or desktop where flight orders are typically
           signed (master copy).
           A11.3.2.2.6. (MILDENHALL) Unless otherwise annotated, the 100 OG Chief of
           Stan/Eval is the OIC of the FCF program.
   A11.3.3. (MILDENHALL) CCV will create a new Letter of Xs for all changes, but the
   delay in producing a new Letter of Xs will not delay the go/no-go process for certifications or
   qualifications accomplished after the current Letter of Xs was published. Source
   documentation for certifications and qualifications dated after the current Letter of Xs will
   provide valid go/no-go justification.
A11.4. (MILDENHALL) For commander-directed decertifications, place a line through the
certification text using the strikethrough function of the spreadsheet application (i.e., ―FPQ‖) and
state ―Commander decertified‖ in the notes/comments column along with an additional
explanation as needed.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_MILDENHALLSUP_I 20 JUNE 2012                                     139


                            Attachment 12 (Added-USAFE)
                USAFE SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUTION GUIDANCE

A12.1. (Added-USAFE) Purpose. The purpose of this attachment is provide units with more
education on how SUPEVALs may be used to maximize aircrew training and ensure the
commander has awareness of how best to vector the unit's daily mission accomplishment.
A12.2. (USAFE) To determine which SUPEVAL flow is appropriate, the unit must begin
with awareness of two types of problems within the unit: 1) a suspected problem [reference
Figure A12.1. (Added).], or 2) a known problem [reference Figure A12.2. (Added).].
