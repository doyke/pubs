1. Pre-ISO Engine Runs. Each C-130E/H entering the ISO inspection process requires a
performance run to operationally check engines, propellers, and gearboxes.
     1.1. The owning AMU will ensure the following:
        1.1.1. Coordination with 19 EMS ISO Section to correct any discrepancies which may
        delay or prevent pre-ISO engine runs from being completed.
        1.1.2. The aircraft is on a maximum power run spot with a fuel load per tech data to
        accomplish pre-ISO engine runs.
        1.1.3. 19 EMS ISO will accomplish engine pre-ISO performance runs to establish a pre-
        dock baseline with results documented on LRAFB Form 152, Propulsion System
        Operational Worksheet.
        1.1.4. In the event a low power condition is identified, owning AMU completes the low
        power checklist, IAW LRAFBI 21-123 (Attachment 2).
        1.1.5. The owning AMU will correct all discrepancies found during pre-ISO runs and
        perform necessary operational checks, to include the man-on-the-stand portion of the low
        power check sheet.
        1.1.6. The owning AMU will complete the engine and/or propeller changes resulting
        from defects identified prior to the aircraft entering the look phase portion of ISO. Items
        that cannot be accomplished prior to ISO will be coordinated between Maintenance
        Flight Supervision and AMU.
        1.1.7. The following preparations are expedited after completion of pre-ISO runs and
        prior to aircraft being towed into wash rack (as applicable): An ISO prep sheet will be
        put into the forms binder after pre ISO engine runs and AMU is notified, lower HF
        antenna wires (if required), coordinate removal of Dash 21 equipment, coordinate
        removal of life support equipment, chain boxes, remove left wing root access panel,
        remove bellyband and appropriate engine heat shields (left wing heat shields for #1 and
        #3 minor ISOs, right wing heat shields for #2 minor and #4 major ISOs). The AMU is
        responsible for ensuring items such as armor, dual rails, technical data, supplies, troop
        seats, etc are not left in the wash rack and the inspection and reinstallation of removed
        components prior to completion of the fix phase.
        1.1.8. The aircraft is available to 19 EMS NLT 0600 on day 2 of the ISO inspection
        cycle.
        1.1.9. All main and external tanks are defueled to zero (after jettison checks if
        applicable). After completion of defuel, notify the 19 EMS Production Superintendent
        (Mike 1) for coordination with 19 CMS Production Superintendent (Razor 1) for
        completion of water screen inspections. A maximum of 10,000 lbs may remain in the
        auxiliary tanks unless a lesser amount is required due to other maintenance.
        1.1.10. One crew chief is provided on day shift, preferably the DCC or assistant.
        Additional support will be addressed at the predock meeting depending on workload
        requirements. The crew chief will report to the coordinator at the beginning of each shift
        until aircraft is post docked.
