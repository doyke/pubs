       1.3.6.2. Provides RSTN equipment access to maintenance technicians in Formal RSTN
       CRA training courses. Operations are primary when the site is the only RSTN site on
       patrol, especially when the manned space operations are in orbit, special data collection is
       in progress, or event-level activity is very likely. Routine operations, especially when
       another RSTN site is on patrol, are secondary to the unit's training mission for CRA
       technicians.

                                            Chapter 2

                               COMMON ACTIVITIES/TASKS

2.1. Patrol Coverage.
   2.1.1. Make every effort to both maximize patrol coverage and allow time for analyst and
   maintenance training or repair activities (including urgent preventative maintenance). A
   special effort should be made to accommodate temporary duty personnel from CRA or
   Mobile Depot Maintenance (MDM) teams. Whenever possible, provide continuous patrol
   when:
       2.1.1.1. Manned space flight is in orbit or a spacewalk is planned or in progress.
       2.1.1.2. No other observatory of the same type (i.e., SOON or RSTN) will be on patrol
       during the period.
       2.1.1.3. Special data collection (requested by the SPACEWOC or SWPC) is in progress.
       2.1.1.4. Event-level activity is very likely.
   2.1.2. Notify the SPACEWOC as soon as possible by telephone before sending coded patrol
   (STATS) message when the following situations occur, or normal service is restored:
       2.1.2.1. A SOON or RSTN sensor outage results, or is expected to result in, a data loss of
       30 minutes or more. NOTE: The type of outage reporting or coordination required here
       is different from the requirement to report patrol breaks exceeding 5 minutes by a STATS
       message. Report outage times of 30 minutes or more on the End of Day Summary
       (NWXX60). Use language understandable by non-analyst personnel (avoid jargon).
       2.1.2.2. A communications outage that causes send or receive capability to be
       completely lost or has lasted, or is expected to last, 30 minutes or more. Ensure the
       SPACEWOC is aware of the problem and ask them to inform the other SEON
       observatories and the SWPC.
       2.1.2.3. A geophysical sensor outage results, or is expected to result in a data loss of 90
       minutes or more.
   2.1.3. Request scheduled downtimes for maintenance activities or training from the 2
   WS/DO before releasing equipment. Provide an estimate of the duration of the outage or
   training. Give advance notice in Section 3 of the End of Day Summary (NWXX60) message
   and the 3-hour plain language code (PLAIN) messages for SOON sites. The 2 WS/DO will
   make every effort to approve requests from the Holloman and Sagamore Hill Observatories
   to provide hands-on training for students in formal courses, subject to the criteria in
   paragraph 2.1.1.
   2.1.4. If postponement of maintenance work could result in equipment damage, the
   detachment commander has final responsibility to decide on the downtime after considering
   all operational and equipment impacts.
2.2. Intersite Data Discrepancies.
 10                                                          AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


   2.2.1. Once intersite data discrepancy thresholds are observed or when “bad” or erroneous
   data collection is identified by either SPACEWOC or the observatory currently situated on
   the sun, initiate an intersite data discrepancy review for the following:
      2.2.1.1. Flares that differ by one or more categories in either importance or brightness.
      2.2.1.2. Event-level radio bursts that differ by more than 20 percent in peak intensity.
      2.2.1.3. Significant Disappearing Solar Filaments (DSF’s) that differ by more than 5
      degrees in length.
      2.2.1.4. Non-confirmation from another observatory (on-patrol) of a Type II or IV
      sweep, Loop Prominence System (LPS), an Eruptive Prominence on the Limb (EPL),
      Bright Surge on Limb (BSL) or a DSF. NOTE: A significant DSF is defined as 10
      heliographic degrees.
   2.2.2. Upon determination or suspected occurrence, the SPACEWOC will report intersite
   data discrepancies immediately to the applicable observatories in an attempt to resolve the
   differences. Analysts at the observatories will respond quickly and thoroughly to appropriate
   requests for data reviews.
   2.2.3. Analysts will be aware of phenomena being reported by other observatories since
   analysts may be the first to detect an intersite discrepancy. Upon determination or suspected
   occurrence, analysts will initiate an intersite data discrepancy review themselves by notifying
   the           SPACEWOC to notify other observatories involved.
   2.2.4. Analysts should not adjust their data messages just to achieve agreement with another
   site's reports. Discrepancies should be resolved near real-time, so the SPACEWOC can
   transmit the proper products/data to their supported units.
   2.2.5. Respond to notification of an intersite data discrepancy from the SPACEWOC by
   investigating the items listed below, as well as any other factors an analyst believes might be
   relevant to the discrepancy. Call the SPACEWOC and indicate the results of the
   investigation. Use the following procedure to check for intersite discrepancies with
   SPACEWOC acting as the final arbitrator:
      2.2.5.1. Check site's messages and forms for accuracy.
      2.2.5.2. Check to see if all equipment is configured and operating properly then check
      calibrations.
      2.2.5.3. Check to see if the relevant software is operating properly.
      2.2.5.4. Check recent equipment, computer, and communications performance outage
      logs to see if there is a reason to doubt the data.
      2.2.5.5. Evaluate the analysis techniques used.
      2.2.5.6. Consider solar elevation effects (e.g., close to sunrise, sunset).
      2.2.5.7. Consider possible weather influences (e.g., high winds, clouds, etc).
      2.2.5.8. Consult local maintenance technicians when appropriate.
2.3. Quality Assurance and Metrics.
AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     11


  2.3.1. General. The main objective of the Quality Assurance (QA) and Metrics programs are
  to ensure supported units consistently receive the highest quality products and services
  possible and to promote improvement of processes used to support operations.
     2.3.1.1. Implement Quality Assurance principles and metrics IAW AFI 15-114,
     Functional Resource and Weather Technical Performance Evaluation.
     2.3.1.2. Units may use AF Form 3811, Quality Control Register, or an automated
     program with similar utility to help manage a local quality assurance program.
     2.3.1.3. Include Error-Free Rates (EFRs) for all event code (EVENT) (SXXX60 and
     SXXX61) header coded messages and all non-event level flares, bursts, and sweeps into
     the units QA program. QA will be conducted on 100 percent of all event messages.
     2.3.1.4. QA program will be broken down into two categories: technical and
     administrative. Count technical errors (including timeliness errors) in the EFR, but omit
     administrative errors in end of month totals. For example, no initials on the data circuit
     hardcopy is an administrative error. Technical errors occur when the supported unit does
     not receive an accurate message within the required timeframe.
     2.3.1.5. Count no more than one error for each message, no matter how many encoding
     errors are noted within the message. Therefore, no message will ever have more than one
     error, and thus, internal error total may differ from that reported.
  2.3.2. Methods of Quality Assurance.
     2.3.2.1. On-the-Spot (OTS) QA. OTS QA is the most important tool for detachment
     leaders to ensure supported units receive accurate and timely support. Detachment
     leaders will implement OTS QA processes for all support provided to units. Ideally, OTS
     QA should be performed on all products before they are issued. A successful OTS QA
     program will identify and correct support deficiencies before delivery to the user.
     Detachment leaders should place the most emphasis of the QA program on OTS QA.
     2.3.2.2. After-the Fact (ATF) QA. Detachment leaders will use ATF QA to evaluate the
     quality of support provided to units to identify areas that might require additional training
     or better procedures. This may be done on a smaller scale than OTS QA. Detachment
     leaders will focus most ATF QA on the end products and support received by users, with
     less focus on the internal processes and tools used to develop the support.
     2.3.2.3. Horizontal QA. Detachment leaders will use this method to check all products
     on a given day for basic horizontal consistency. Horizontal QA is the process of ensuring
     multiple products/information produced within the same operations center, valid for the
     same time period, are consistent when they are disseminated to the supported unit.
     Product consistency prevents supported units from receiving conflicting information.
     Consider developing checklists that evaluate the horizontal consistency of all support
     received by supported unit.
  2.3.3. Metrics. Detachments will track specific metrics as assigned and forward to 2 WS
  electronically.

                                          Chapter 3

                                 DATA DISSEMINATION

3.1. Service Messages.
   3.1.1. Transmit service messages only for the following purposes:
      3.1.1.1. To resolve data receipt or other communications problems affecting current
      support operations and requiring immediate attention (e.g., interference verification,
      discrepancies, etc).
      3.1.1.2. To provide notification of actual or anticipated changes in operating hours (e.g.,
      to report or coordinate equipment or circuit outages).
      3.1.1.3. To transmit mission related products or information to a small number of
      supported units or agencies.
   3.1.2. Keep service messages brief and professional.
   3.1.3. Manual Operations (MANOP) Headings. These alphanumeric designators identify
   message types based on their data content, source of origin, and transmission or file time
   (e.g., "AXXX61 APLM DDGGgg").
      3.1.3.1. Use SXXX60 headers for all EVENT code reports. SXXX61 headers flag
      urgent, event-level data reports, also for all preliminary event-level coded data reports
      (e.g., solar flare code (FLARE), solar disk and limb activity summary code (DALAS),
      discrete solar radio burst (BURST), and spectral solar radio burst code (SWEEP)
      transmitted in 15 minutes or less after meeting event criteria or event maximum.
      3.1.3.2. Use routine reporting headers (AXXX61 – optical and AXXX71 - radio) for all
      non-event activity reports, final event level reports, and for event-level activity reports
      transmitted more than 15 minutes after meeting event criteria or event.
      3.1.3.3. The Amendment (AMD) modifier is appended to MANOP headers to flag
      reports which may require special attention. This modifier ensures the messages won't be
      rejected as duplicate messages by weather communication computers.
   3.1.4. Corrected Messages.
      3.1.4.1. Add the modifier "AMD" to the MANOP heading (along with the original
      transmission time or fixed file time) to flag a corrected message. EXAMPLE:
      AXXX61 APLM DDGGgg AMD. Add a remark at the end of the message listing the
      corrected time (i.e. Correction to a Previously Disseminated Report (COR) 1445). For
      successive corrections of the same message do not number the AMD modifier (i.e.
      AMD02, AMD03, etc.). Use the "AMD" modifier to flag messages containing the
      following erroneous data:
          3.1.4.1.1. A message retransmitted because the comeback copy was either garbled or
          not received by the transmitting site.
          3.1.4.1.2. A final or previously corrected message retransmitted to change or correct
          data in the message.
AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                        13


           3.1.4.1.3. If information in the first two lines of a message (i.e., MANOP header and
           code type) is to be corrected, the analyst need only retransmit the message with the
           correct information and a "COR" modifier. If data in the body of the message (Line
           3, 4, etc.) is to be corrected, the analyst should also use the report status code (S = 3)
           for corrected data, unless the code type in question doesn't have this option (e.g.,
           PLAIN and EVENT).

LEGEND: IIiii = World Meteorological Organization (WMO) block and station number
        YMMDD = Year/Month/Day
        JJ/JJJ = Local sunspot group number (for SPOTS), or local activity serial (or
        sequence) number (for other codes)
        FF/FFFFF = Frequency (FF for BURST, FFFFF for IFLUX)
        GGgg = Time (hours and minutes)
        EE = Type of DALAS activity
        NNNN = SWPC region number
        TT = STATS type of sensor system (optical, radio, or geophysical)
        EE/FF/HH = STATS system, frequency, or equipment indicator

NOTES:
1. Since the PLAIN code doesn't contain an IIiii group, the decoders use the station identifier
(e.g., APLM, KHMN, etc.) in the MANOP header as a key field.

2. Since the PLAIN and EVENT codes don't contain either the YMMDD or GGgg groups in the
body of the message, the decoders use the date/time groups (DDGGgg) in the MANOP header as
key fields.

3. A change in the SWPC region number, to include a change from //// to a number (or vice
versa), requires a deletion of the old data line.

4. To change EE, FF, or HH, the analyst adjusts the item’s status/frequency effective at the same
time it was originally mistakenly reported.
3.2. Data Archival.

   3.2.1. Dispose of SOON, RSTN, and geophysical data records IAW the AFWA/National
   Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)/National Geophysical
   Data Center (NGDC) Support Agreement and AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records.
   3.2.2. Use Standard Form 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt when physical products are
   shipped to NGDC. If data normally archived is not available detail on the records transmittal
   form what data is missing or lost and explain the reasons.
   3.2.3. Forward the following products and worksheets to the NGDC not later than 30 days
   following the last day of the record month. EXCEPTION: Through an agreement with the
   Australian IPS Space and Radio Services, the Learmonth Solar Observatory will provide all
   observatory data to Australian Radio and Space Services first. Following archival at Sydney,
   Australia, Australian Radio and Space Services will then provide the data to NGDC. NGDC
   prefers transmittal of archive data via ftp directly to their server. Each unit will develop local
   procedures to transmit this data to NGDC.
      3.2.3.1. AFWA Form 17, Solar Optical Worksheet; AFWA Form 18, RSTN Daily
      Activity Log; and AFWA Form 21, Sunspot Analysis Worksheet. The logs are used in
      conjunction with archived data to help identify periods of significant activity.
      3.2.3.2. RIMS archive data. Archive RIMS data monthly from each RSTN site which
      will be sent to NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC.
      3.2.3.3. SRS archive data. Archive SRS data monthly from each RSTN site. Data will
      be sent to NOAA/NESDIS/NGDC monthly utilizing either read only compact discs, or
      via ftp.
   3.2.4. Use the following address for NGDC:
Electronic: ftp://incoming.ngdc.noaa.gov/pub/incoming/site-specific_location

Mail: NOAA/NGDC/STP
(E/GC2) Attn: Solar Group
325 Broadway
Boulder, CO 80305-3328
   3.2.5. Save event-level Type II and Type IV hard or electronic copies for in-house training.
   3.2.6. Contractor operated sites will forward the following items monthly to the contract
   COR, who will forward selected items to NGDC.
      3.2.6.1. Complete AFWA Forms 17, 18, 20, and 21 for all periods of operations.
      3.2.6.2. Time vs. flux hardcopy plots for any period of discrete frequency burst activity.
      These plots should not exceed 120 minutes, should include all burst peaks, and cover all
      eight discrete frequencies.
AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    15


                                          Chapter 4

                             CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS

4.1. General. Each unit must develop local procedures for documenting and reporting SEON
observing/support equipment outages, and communications equipment/circuit outages. Also
consult AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting, for more guidance.
Report all outages and mission impacts to the appropriate servicing maintenance agency and
Fielded System Support Center IAW locally developed guidance. Notify the above maintenance
agency again when equipment is restored to service.
4.2. Outage Procedures.
   4.2.1. Mission Impact Statements. A mission impact statement reports the impact an outage
   has on mission capability of either an AFWA unit or an agency supported by AFWA.
   Determine mission impacts for SEON equipment using Attachment 4. Contact the
   Detachment Commander when in doubt as to an outage's impact.
       4.2.1.1. A Minimum (MIN) outage is a reduction or limitation of equipment or circuit
       capability, but not to the degree that the equipment or circuit is operationally unusable.
       4.2.1.2. A Significant (SIG) outage is a reduction or limitation of equipment or circuit
       capability to the point where the equipment or circuit is operationally unusable.
   4.2.2. Outage Logs. Log SEON, Automated Data Process Equipment (ADPE) and
   communications equipment or circuit outages on AFWA Form 20 using the instructions
   below.
       4.2.2.1. A unit may either use a separate AFWA Form 20 for each piece of equipment or
       communications circuit, or may combine items on a single form. Copies of AFWA Form
       20 for SEON equipment and circuit outages must be sent monthly to the 2 WS/DOZ. At
       contractor-operated sites, all AFWA Form 20s must be sent monthly to Contracting
       Officer’s Representative (COR).
       4.2.2.2. The AFWA Form 20 will be cut off at the end of the Greenwich Mean Time
       (GMT) month. If an item is still out-of-service, close the outage on the old AFWA Form
       20, and indicate in the Remarks column that the outage was carried forward to a new
       month's AFWA Form 20. At the same time, reopen the outage on the new month's
       AFWA Form 20, and record in the remarks column the original Month/Date Time Group
       (DTG) that the problem occurred.
       4.2.2.3. All times on the AFWA Form 20 are to be GMT (GMT or Universal Time
       Coordinated (UTC). For any AFWA Form 20 that includes ADPE outages, indicate the
       GMT to Local time conversion, and whether it changed during the month. NOTE: Use
       local times only on AF Form 597 ADPE Maintenance.
       4.2.2.4. Use the remarks column of the AFWA Form 20 to describe the reason for the
       outage, if known. It can also be used to log Job Control Numbers (JCN), follow-up
       actions, or other clarifying remarks.
       4.2.2.5. If the mission impact statement changes, record the date/time of the change in
       the remarks column.
16                                                       AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


     4.2.2.6. Compute the "TOTAL OUTAGE TIME" by subtracting the "DTG PROBLEM
     OCCURRED" from the "DTG REPAIR COMPLETED." However, do not count as
     outage time any period when the observatory was closed (except for geophysical sensors,
     which operate 24 hours per day). In other words, total outage time is the time the
     equipment or system was out-of-service, but could have been used if it were functional.
     NOTE: To compute the total outage date/time for AF Form 597, subtract the time from
     when maintenance is called from the date/time the repair was completed.
        4.2.2.6.1. For SEON and communications equipment/circuits, these times are
        normally from sunrise to sunset.
        4.2.2.6.2. For geophysical sensors (ionosondes, etc.), and (if applicable) their
        communications equipment/circuits, these times are normally based on a 24-hour
        observing day.
     4.2.2.7. For Preventative Maintenance Inspections (PMI), the "DTG PROBLEM
     OCCURRED" and "DTG MAINTENANCE NOTIFIED" may not apply. For such cases,
     use the "DTG MAINTENANCE ARRIVED" to compute "TOTAL OUTAGE TIME.”
     4.2.2.8. Actual out-of-service time ("DTG PROBLEM OCCURRED") is relevant to
     operations. Use the actual out-of-service time when preparing STATS messages and the
     End of Day Summary (NWXX60) message. Use the "TOTAL OUTAGE TIME" when
     preparing the Monthly Outage Report.
     4.2.2.9. If equipment is repaired, but it is being monitored to ensure the repair corrected
     the problem, the item should normally be logged back in service or, at most, continued as
     a minimum outage.
     4.2.2.10. Use of an AFWA Form 20 is not limited to equipment/circuit malfunctions. It
     may also be used to document downtime for any reason (e.g., weather, power outage, or
     Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).
     4.2.2.11. Archive AFWA Forms 20 IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records.
  4.2.3. STATS Messages.
     4.2.3.1. Detailed guidance on optical and radio patrol-related STATS messages is
     contained in AFWAMAN 15-1, AFWAMAN 15-2, and AFMAN 15-124.
     4.2.3.2. Once an item is reported as being in or out of service, it is not necessary to
     repeat the item in subsequent STATS messages if its status remains unchanged.
     4.2.3.3. Only STATS messages that affect on/off patrol, and type of patrol (automatic vs.
     semi-automatic), need to be logged on the AFWA Forms 17 and 18. If desired, a site
     may locally decide to log all STATS messages, including dedicated communication line,
     phones, etc.
     4.2.3.4. The GGggM group contains the actual time the item became inoperative (or
     operable), not the time the change was discovered or reported to maintenance, nor the
     time the STATS message was transmitted.
     4.2.3.5. Going on/off patrol due to clouds, high winds, or other types of weather will not
     normally affect a site's computer (except for thunderstorms), dedicated communication
     line, Defense Switched Network (DSN), commercial, or VOIP phones. Also, high winds
AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    17


     don't affect SRS low band antenna patrol.            As a result, the "//" option ("all
     systems/equipment") has limited usefulness.
     4.2.3.6. A STATS reportable commercial phone, DSN, VOIP, or dedicated
     communication line outage is intended to reflect a site-wide outage in send, receive, or
     both. The fact that a single phone instrument, phone line, or data circuit printer is out of
     service is not reportable by STATS. The SPACEWOC and SWPC are only interested
     when the ability to communicate with the site, in one or both directions, is lost. (For
     example: At a dual site, if RSTN has no dedicated communication line capability, but
     SOON does, do not report the outage via a STATS message.)
     4.2.3.7. At a dual SOON/RSTN site, the SOON and RSTN analysts should not both
     report a site-wide commercial phone, DSN, or dedicated communication line outage.
     The same isn't true for computers: treat the SOON and RSTN computers separately. For
     this reason, a computer outage that affects both SOON and RSTN must be reported in
     both a SOON and a RSTN STATS message. NOTE: Although commercial phone,
     DSN, VOIP, and dedicated communication line outages must be reported in a SOON
     STATS message at dual sites, the RSTN analyst can send that message if the site prefers
     to assign this duty to the RSTN analyst.
  4.2.4. SEON Communications Outage.
     4.2.4.1. The SPACEWOC requires rapid reporting of event level solar activity. When
     normal communications methods are inoperative, use the following procedures to report
     the outage:
        4.2.4.1.1. The solar analyst will call SPACEWOC DSN 312-271-4317(analyst) /
        312-272-8087 (forecaster) or Commercial 402-294-4317 / 402-232-8087 to inform
        them of the communications outage and expected duration. The SPACEWOC will
        provide guidance on special support requirements, either in the form of telephone
        support or special message support.
        4.2.4.1.2. The solar analyst will call the AFWA Operations Center (DSN 312-271-
        2586 or Commercial (402-294-2586) and open a ticket.
     4.2.4.2. During the outage:
        4.2.4.2.1. SPACEWOC requests all significant events be called in as soon as
        possible. Significant radio events are any radio burst greater than 5,000 solar flux
        units (SFUs), Type II or Type IV sweeps. Significant optical events are any flare, or
        any DALAS.
        4.2.4.2.2. If possible, use Air Force Weather WEB Services (AFW - WEBS) or
        Weather Subscription Service (WSS) to transmit all messages.
        4.2.4.2.3. If unable to transmit the messages via AFW - WEBS, send finals,
        NWXX60, and closing STATS message via e-mail or fax to the SPACEWOC at close
        of business. The e-mail address is spaceweather@offutt.af.mil, and the fax number
        is DSN 312-272-7770, Comm (402) 232-7770.
     4.2.4.3. After the outage:
 18                                                        AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


          4.2.4.3.1. Notify the SPACEWOC and AFWA Operations Center when the outage is
          over.
          4.2.4.3.2. Transmit all significant messages. Attach a PLAIN message at the end of
          the bulletin stating “TRANSMITTING TO UPDATE DATABASE ONLY.”
          Messages are stored in AFW - WEBS database for reference.
      4.2.4.4. Procedures for Requesting Support During Extended Communications Outages.
          4.2.4.4.1. An extended total communications outage could degrade SEON
          operations. If fax line or e-mail is available, ask the SPACEWOC to send pertinent
          bulletins as they become available. Suggested bulletins are:
  AXXX01 KWNP (JOINT USAF/NOAA SOLAR & GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY
  SUMMARY) AXXX02 KWNP (JOINT USAF/ NOAA SOLAR REGION SUMMARY)
  AXXX05 KWNP (JOINT USAF/NOAA DATA ACQUISITION REPORT OR SVC MSG)
  NWXX52 KGWC (6HR SOLAR FLARE SUMMARY)
  SXXX56 KGWC (FIXED-FREQUENCY SOLAR RADIO BURST SUMMARY)
  SXXX55 KGWC (SOLAR RADIO FLUX SUMMARY)
  SXXX57 KGWC (SWEEP-FREQUENCY SOLAR RADIO BURST SUMMARY)
  SXXX51 KGWC (SOLAR DISK & LIMB ACTIVITY SUMMARY)
  FXXX01 KWNP (REPORT OF SOLAR AND GEOPHYSICAL ACTIVITY)
  TXXX51 KGWC (GOES X-RAY EVENT SUMMARY)
  Other observatory bulletins, as required (e.g. BOXOUT, SPOTS)
4.3. End of Day Summary Messages.
   4.3.1. Send a plain language End of Day Summary (NWXX60) message, using the format in
   Attachment 5, at the end of each observing day no earlier than 30 minutes before sunset.
   Whenever practical, first coordinate the message with maintenance to verify its accuracy.
   Avoid site-specific jargon and remember to plainly outline impacts to patrol. Use NWXX60
   for optical sites and radio sites. Multisensor sites (SOON, RSTN, ionosonde, etc.) will
   combine all Space Environment Sensor Suite (SESS) sensors into one NWXX60 message.
   4.3.2. Section 1. Include all SEON, geophysical, and communication (both equipment and
   circuit) outages with a cumulative daily outage time of 30 minutes or more, or still out at the
   end of the day. EXAMPLE: Include the data circuit if it was logged out three times during
   the observing day for 10 minutes each time.
      4.3.2.1. Specify inoperative equipment or circuits.    Use the SEON Equipment
      Breakdown table in Attachment 6, or consult local maintenance personnel, to identify
      equipment items. Include outages due to PMIs, power or air conditioning, high winds,
      etc.
      4.3.2.2. Mission impact. Use Attachment 4 for guidance.
      4.3.2.3. Date/time of equipment outage in GMT. Use actual out-of service time, which
      may differ from the time that maintenance was notified.
      4.3.2.4. Estimated Time In Commission (ETIC), if not operational by the end of the
      observing day. Only an ETIC date (not time) is required. Avoid, when possible, the use
      of "UNKNOWN" for an ETIC, instead give best estimate. Continually review and
      update this estimate until the equipment is back in service.
AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    19


      4.3.2.5. Date/time equipment was back in operation, in GMT.
   4.3.3. Section 2. Include:
      4.3.3.1. A detailed account of each outage.
          4.3.3.1.1. The cause of the outage.
          4.3.3.1.2. Its impact on patrol. EXAMPLES: Caused semiautomatic patrol, no
          effect on patrol, frequency usable, but data qualified.
          4.3.3.1.3. Repairs or efforts taken to correct the problem.
      4.3.3.2. Any noise tube value change; include the new value, date changed, and reason
      for the change.
      4.3.3.3. Use of "No Change in Status" to describe an outage is only acceptable when a
      communications problem makes it difficult to transmit a long message. Due to long-term
      outages or lost messages, recipients can lose track of what status this phrase is referring
      to.
      4.3.3.4. Section 3. Include a 3-day patrol outlook based on weather, equipment, or other
      circumstances, which might significantly, impact patrol. SPACEWOC will use this
      information to evaluate the networks status. EXAMPLES: Planned major equipment
      downtime, scheduled communications outages, or anticipated periods of extended
      semiautomatic operations. All maintenance must be forecast three days in advance and
      noted on the NWXX60 message. When maintenance forecasts a change or requirements
      arise less than three days from implementation, plainly describe the reasons in the
      message or call the SPACEWOC directly to explain the change. It is necessary to
      include date/time of these anticipated impacts on operations. However, it is not
      necessary to include a weather outlook if no significant weather (e.g., wind storm,
      thunderstorms, hurricane, etc) is expected.
4.4. Monthly Outage Report.
   4.4.1. Transmit the Monthly Outage or Effectiveness/Outage Report using applicable format
   in Attachment 7 to 2 WS/DOZ for non-contract and contract sites via e-mail no later than 5
   working days after the end of the month. Include a courtesy copy to 2 WS/DO. Use the
   Equipment Breakdown table in Attachment 6 as an aid in preparing the report. Base outages
   reported on the GMT month. Name the file with the detachment number, month, year and
   out.doc (i.e. Det4Mar12out.doc).
   4.4.2. Report.
      4.4.2.1. Total monthly patrol hours possible for both SOON and RSTN operations (as
      applicable). SUGGESTION: Use local sunrise/sunset tables, or ephemeris program
      data. NOTE: The difference in definitions for optical and radio sunrise/sunset will
      typically cause RSTN patrol to be about 20 minutes shorter per day than potential SOON
      patrol, or about 10 hours less per month.
      4.4.2.2. Monthly uptime percentage for all SEON, geophysical, and communications
      equipment outages that occurred during the month.
 20                                                     AFWAI15-2 13 NOVEMBER 2013


      4.4.2.3. Monthly operational effectiveness       percentages   for   all   sensor   and
      communications systems at the site.
      4.4.2.4. Explain all percentages (Total FRR-95 or FMQ-7) that are less than 100%.
      4.4.2.5. Changes to noise tube values required during the month, to include the new
      value, date changed, and reason for the change.
4.5. Operational Reports (OPREP). Refer to AFWAI 10-3, Operational Reporting, (and
applicable supplements) for guidance on Operational Reports. When in doubt an incident may
be OPREP reportable, call the AFWA Operations Center IAW AFWAI 10-3.

                           EQUIPMENT OUTAGE IMPACTS

EQUIPMENT                   MISSION IMPACT

Radio (RIMS):               An outage is SIG if data cannot be gathered or analyzed on:

                            - 245 MHz
                            - 410 MHz
                            - 2695 MHz
                            - 8800 MHz
                            - Two or More Adjacent Frequencies
                            - Three or More Frequencies

Radio (SRS):                An outage is SIG if the sweep type cannot be determined.

Optical (SOON):             An outage is SIG if you cannot accurately locate and analyze a
                            flare.

SOON Rehost                 An outage is SIG if SOON client cannot perform DSF or FLARE
                            analysis.

SEON Computer System:       An outage is SIG if SOON or RSTN operations cannot be done in
                            automatic mode.

Communications:             A data circuit outage is SIG if both send and receive capability are
                            down.

                            A DSN or commercial outage is SIG if these circuits are down
                            while the data circuit is also down, leaving no functioning means
                            of communications.

NOTES:
1. All other outages not specified above are MIN, unless declared SIG by the Detachment
Commander, AFWA/CC/CV, or their designated representative.

  b. PMI’s (PERCENT DOWN):                                      0.09%
  c. WEATHER (PERCENT DOWN):                                    0.72%
  d. EQUIPMENT (PERCENT DOWN):                                  9.65%
  e. REMARKS: As necessary. Explain reason for outages less than 100% from paragraph (d)
  above. i.e. extended PMI, significant weather, equipment outages. Also, changes to noise tube
  values required during the month.

4. SOON Operational Effectiveness:

  a. TOTAL FMQ-7 (PERCENT UP):                            82.30%
  b. PMI’s (PERCENT DOWN):                                  0.22%
  c. WEATHER (PERCENT DOWN):                               12.16%
  d. EQUIPMENT (PERCENT DOWN):                              5.32%
  e. REMARKS: As necessary. Explain reason for outages less than 100% from paragraph (d)
  above. i.e. extended PMI, equipment outages.

5. Communication Outages:

  a. REMARKS: As necessary. Explain reason for outages to data circuit, DSN phone, VOIP,
  and commercial phones.

NOTE:
To calculate the percent up for "RSTN Operational Effectiveness or SOON Operational Effectiveness,"
find the total time available for each system and subtract all Equipment downtime (e.g. outages, RFI),
Weather downtime (e.g., storm-stow, clouds), and PMIs.
"Total Percent Up" plus all down-percentages must equal exactly “100.0” percent. Do not include daily
system calibration downtimes, or minimum outages during which data could be collected and analyzed,
even if data may be degraded.
