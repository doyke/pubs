                                            Chapter 1

              NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT PROGRAM.

1.1. Scope of the Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visit (NSSAV) Program. The Secretary of
the Air Force established the NSSAV program to assist nuclear tasked units, on a non-attribution
basis, in maintaining effective nuclear surety programs. The NSSAV is an opportunity to receive
assistance from experienced headquarters personnel who write nuclear surety policy and
guidance. It is not an inspection nor is it intended to prepare units to pass Nuclear Surety
Inspections (NSI). NSSAV will not give a rating, score, grade, or assessment statements about
units, however if the NSSAV team identifies critical systemic deficiencies, they can recommend
that the wing conduct root cause analysis of each critical deficiency and provide results to the
NSSAV Lead Division or Team Chief. Assessment statements will be limited to processes and
procedures.Attachment 2outlines typical areas observed during an NSSAV. Wing commanders
may use the NSSAV results to strengthen the unit Nuclear Surety Program. MAJCOMs will
designate a division (lead division) as Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the NSSAV
program. This division will coordinate with other HQ divisions on nuclear surety staff assistance
visit policy issues and guidance. Applicable HQ staff agencies act as offices of collateral
responsibility (OCR). The NSSAV also provides an opportunity for resolution and clarification
of issues between the unit and headquarters functional managers. The objective is threefold:
1.1. (ACC)HQ ACC Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration Directorate (ACC/A10)
manages the NSSAV program and coordinates with other HQ ACC directorates on nuclear
surety policy issues and guidance. Applicable HQ ACC staff agencies act as offices of
collateral responsibility.
     1.1.1. Determine if higher headquarters guidance is adequate and clear.
     1.1.2. Provide feedback to the wing commander on whether the unit is properly applying
     sound procedures to implement Nuclear Surety guidance.
     1.1.3. Provide situational awareness on command nuclear surety to senior leadership in the
     form of an NSSAV executive summary and annual crossfeed report.
1.2. Assistance Areas. NSSAV team assesses all areas included in CJCSI 3263.05, Nuclear
Weapons Technical Inspection, and AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities as supplemented.
Additional areas may be assessed by MAJCOM staffs as time permits or when requested by
MAJCOM/CC or wing leadership.
     1.2.1. (Added-ACC) Random nuclear surety testing will be administered to a minimum of
     15% of available PRP personnel in the wing (i.e. not on TDY/leave). A passing score is
     80%.
     1.2.2. (Added-ACC) Between 5-20% of personnel and medical PRP records will be audited
     (if applicable) for compliance with governing DoD and AF guidance.
     1.2.3. (Added-ACC) Command Post Controller closed book testing will be administered to
     100% of available certified controllers (i.e. not on TDY/leave or just ending a 12-hour CP
     shift). A passing score is 90%.
AFI91-121_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012                                                              5


   1.2.4. (Added-ACC) One Single Channel Anti-Jam Man-Portable (SCAMP) set-up crew
   will be observed during the NSSAV.
1.3. Method of Assessment.
   1.3.1. For Weapons Maintenance Technical Operations, NSSAV team member(s) will select
   team composition for each specific technical operation. Selections will be completely
   unbiased. To the maximum extent possible, the NSSAV member will ensure equitable
   observation across all maintenance shifts and avoid observation of the same person on
   multiple tasks. Assessments will emphasize performance against approved safety, security,
   and reliability standards.
   1.3.2. Team integrity for the weapons load crews will be maintained IAW AFI 21-101,
   Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-202, Missile and Space
   Systems Maintenance Management, requirements. To demonstrate their knowledge and
   proficiency, they will normally be tasked to perform at least one evaluation of a maintenance
   operation within their area of responsibility. Unit quality assurance and weapons
   standardization evaluators may be observed by the NSSAV team.
   1.3.3. For Weapon Security, NSSAV functional area experts will use performance based
   methodology to determine whether a unit meets the Nuclear Weapons Security Standard
   (NWSS). They will observe the integrated execution of security actions and response
   (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable. They will observe
   execution of applicable plans and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). They will
   assess the effectiveness of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems, and other
   technology. Did the unit use available options to prevent the loss of/deny access to nuclear
   weapons to the adversary to include destruction of the weapon? To the maximum extent
   possible, the NSSAV functional area members will develop realistic nuclear security exercise
   scenarios to determine a unit’s ability to meet NWSS. NSSAV team will assess the adequacy
   of and compliance with approved compensatory measures for MAJCOM approved security
   deviations.
   1.3.4. Random nuclear surety testing will be administered, as per AFI 91-101, to a minimum
   of 25 percent of available Personnel Reliability Program personnel in the wing (i.e. not on
   TDY/leave).
   1.3.5. A minimum of 5 percent of personnel and medical PRP records will be reviewed for
   compliance with governing DoD and AF guidance. NSSAV team will review the
   administrative qualifications, certification, continuing evaluation, removal from PRP duties,
   return to duty, training and management processes, using record reviews to substantiate
   above processes employed by the unit. PRP processes, not records reviews will be the
   primary focus.
   1.3.6. Command Post Controller closed book testing will be administered at bases with a
   strategic (USAFE: Non-Strategic Nuclear Forces Command Post) tasking to 100 percent of
   available certified controllers (i.e. not on TDY/leave or just ending a 12-hour CP shift).
   1.3.7. MAJCOMs will determine additional items to be observed during the NSSAV based
   upon wing commander input, NAF input and on unique mission requirements.
 6                                                   AFI91-121_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012


     1.3.8. For associate/Total Force Integration (TFI) units, the active duty unit will have
     responsibility for the associate/TFI unit outlined in this instruction.
1.4. NSSAV Trip and Event Scheduling.
     1.4.1. The lead division schedules all unit NSSAVs and coordinates with appropriate
     MAJCOM agencies. These visits should occur 6 to 8 months after each unit’s last NSI. This
     interval provides a mid-course assessment point between no-notice NSIs while minimizing
     the probability of an NSI occurring prior to a scheduled NSSAV. For example, if an NSI
     occurs in Jul 08, the next NSSAV should be scheduled between Jan-Mar 09. The only
     exception to this scheduling guidance is when a wing commander requests an out-of-cycle
     NSSAV. Exception: USAFE may deviate from this schedule as required to accommodate
     host nation requirements and the Functional Expert Visit Program.
     1.4.1. (ACC) HQ ACC/A10 schedules all unit NSSAVs. For units that do not receive an
     NSI, NSSAVs should be scheduled 12-18 months apart. HQ ACC/A10 coordinates visits
     with appropriate major command (MAJCOM) agencies.
     1.4.2. MAJCOMs will provide a notification message to the NAF/Center and unit 60 days
     prior to the planned visit confirming NSSAV date, lead division point of contact (POC),
     billeting, transportation and team work center requirements (provide an info copy to the
     installation-owning MAJCOM if NSSAV is for a tenant unit). Units will appoint a NSSAV
     POC and forward the name to the MAJCOM within one week of receiving the notification
     message.
     1.4.2. (ACC) HQ ACC/A10 will provide a notification message to the NAF and unit 60
     days prior to the planned visit confirming NSSAV date, HQ ACC/A10 point of contact
     (POC), billeting, transportation and team work center requirements. Units will forward their
     NSSAV POC name and point of contact to HQ ACC/A10 within one week of receiving the
     notification message.
     1.4.3. Units will locally coordinate and provide inputs on a proposed NSSAV Schedule of
     Events. They are encouraged to identify special emphasis areas affecting nuclear surety.
     Units will send a draft schedule to the MAJCOM NLT 40 days prior to the scheduled visit.
     MAJCOMs will ensure the proposed schedule fulfills NSSAV requirements and coordinate
     the proposed schedule of events within the staff. NSSAV team members will coordinate
     functional area specific scheduling requirements with their unit POCs. A confirmed schedule
     of events should be completed NLT 14 days prior to NSSAV team arrival. After the visit and
     events schedule is confirmed, any scheduling conflicts must be immediately brought to the
     attention of the MAJCOM NSSAV POC for resolution.
     1.4.3. (ACC) Units will send a draft schedule to HQ ACC/A10 NLT 40 days prior to the
     scheduled visit. HQ ACC/A10 will ensure the proposed schedule fulfills NSSAV
     requirements and coordinate the proposed schedule of events within ACC. After the visit
     and events schedule is confirmed, any scheduling conflicts must be immediately brought to
     the attention of the HQ ACC/A10 NSSAV POC for resolution.
     1.4.4. For installations that have Weapons Storage Area (WSA) production capability
     managed by AFMC, the supported operational wing and supporting AFMC Munitions
     squadron should receive a joint NSSAV. ACC, AFSPC, and AFGSC will make every effort
     to coordinate with AFMC to ensure that their units receive an NSSAV at the same time. The
AFI91-121_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012                                                              7


   teams should coordinate the timing of exercises and other events to maximize synergy. This
   reduces the footprint on the installation receiving the NSSAV, and associated activities that
   will be observed require cooperation between the supported wing and the WSA. AFMC may
   conduct limited NSSAVs focused on WSA activities and will limit their scope to only those
   areas for which AFMC is responsible. In doing so, AFMC should try to minimize impact to
   supported wings as much as possible.
       1.4.4.1. For Multi-MAJCOM NSSAVs, fully coordinate a joint schedule of events
       between the installation, and each participating MAJCOM/NAF/Center.                Close
       communications between respective team chiefs is essential to ensure exercises are
       appropriately scheduled and evaluated and do not interfere with other events, and events
       are properly synchronized such that access and exposure are minimized (e.g. conduct
       safety, facility/LPS, alarm system and sensor assessments in conjunction with stockpile
       assessments as much as possible where appropriate).
       1.4.4.2. The host installation should (when possible) receive a joint NSSAV report from
       ACC, AFSPC, or AFGSC on installations supporting a WSA.
       1.4.4.3. The outbrief will be combined for both the host wing and the supporting WSA,
       with team chiefs from ACC/AFSPC/AFGSC and AFMC briefing the NSSAV results.
       1.4.4.4. Critical deficiencies will be resolved as described in paragraph 2.2 within the
       same MAJCOM. The host wing will resolve its critical deficiencies with AFGSC, and
       the supporting WSA will resolve its critical deficiencie(s) with AFMC.
1.5. NSSAV Funding. MAJCOMs will ensure that an adequate annual budget and manpower
exists to fund all TDY costs associated with providing NSSAV visits to all nuclear wings within
6-8 months after a full NSI (approximately every 12-18 months). The NSSAV budget should be
managed by the lead division. MAJCOMs will determine guidance for compensation of civilian
NSSAV team members working overtime during the visit.
   1.5.1. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC/A10 submits an annual budget estimate to ensure funding of
   the NSSAV program. HQ ACC/A10 provides funding for NSSAV augmentees; however,
   compensation for any civilian NSSAV team member(s) working overtime during the visit
   will be the responsibility of the member’s assigned office.
1.6. NSSAV Team Composition and Requirements.
   1.6.1. MAJCOMs will determine the required size of NSSAV teams. NSSAV team
   members are drawn from applicable MAJCOM staff agencies. When necessary or desired,
   other units and/or organizations may augment the team. MAJCOMS will determine the
   priority for units from which to draw augmentees. Actual NSSAV team size, composition,
   and requirements will vary according to base and assigned nuclear mission. The team should
   consist of a cross-functional group of specialists representing the functional areas that
   contribute to nuclear surety at the wing receiving the NSSAV. MAJCOMs will determine
   team composition for each base that receives an NSSAV.

             NUCLEAR SURETY STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT SUMMARY.

2.1. NSSAV Report.
   2.1.1. NSSAV reports assist the units in identifying strengths and areas for improvement in
   order to enhance overall nuclear surety effectiveness. Identified deficiencies will reference
   governing instructions and guidance (i.e. AFI, MAJCOM Instructions, T.O., USSTRATCOM
   Publications, etc.) NSSAV reports will be classified IAW CJCSI 3263-05 Enclosure F, para
   2.
   2.1.2. The NSSAV team project officer uses inputs provided by each functional team
   member to build the report in accordance with the contents listed at Attachment 2. The
   NSSAV team chief will provide a draft copy of the NSSAV report to the wing commander
   prior to the team’s departure and provide a copy to the lead division upon return to the staff
   location. The authority for further distribution resides with the wing and/or MAJCOM/CC.
   The Air Force Safety Center, AF/A10, MAJCOM Directorates and Special Staff,
   Associate/TFI MAJCOM, NAF/Center CCs will receive the report’s Executive Summary
   within 20 days. The lead division retains an office record copy on file, and has the option to
   distribute detailed reports outside of the division with the approval of the MAJCOM/CC.
   The report will not be distributed to the Inspector General (IG) nor will NSSAV results be
   discussed with the IG to preserve NSSAV program integrity. Additionally, to preserve
   program integrity, NSSAV team members will not be used as IG augmentees at a wing where
   they have performed an NSSAV in the past 12 months.
   2.1.2. (ACC) The NSSAV team chief will provide a copy of the NSSAV report to the wing
   commander prior to the team’s departure and provide a copy to HQ ACC/A10 upon return to
   Langley AFB. HQ ACC/A10 retains an office record copy on file, but will not distribute
   detailed reports outside of HQ ACC/A10.
   2.1.3. Team members include all nuclear surety-related deficiencies (positive/benchmark
   comments and deficiencies) in the detailed report. Deficiencies will be referenced by
   instruction and paragraph number to the maximum extent possible. Overall and sub-area
   ratings are not assigned. Criticality of deficiencies will be determined IAW AFI 90-201 and
   CJCSI 3263.05. Observations are classified in the following categories:
      2.1.3.1. STRENGTH - An observation that highlights strong processes, knowledge, or
      performance.
      2.1.3.2. CRITICAL DEFICIENCY- Any deficiency that would result in an
      unsatisfactory rating as defined in CJCSI 3263.05 and AFI 90-201 if left uncorrected.
      2.1.3.3. SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY- Any deficiency that would result in one or more
      sub areas being rated as unsatisfactory in CJCSI 3263.05 and AFI 90-201 if left
      uncorrected.
      2.1.3.4. MINOR DEFICIENCY - A deviation from published procedure, local or
      otherwise, that does not result in an unreliable weapon or an unsafe or unsecure
      environment.
AFI91-121_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012                                                                 11


       2.1.3.5. RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENT AREA - A suggestion to improve a
       process. (Does not require referencing governing instructions or guidance).
   2.1.4. MAJCOMs will determine the guidance for recognizing Superior Performers.
   2.1.4. (ACC) Outstanding performers will be selected by NSSAV team members based on
   observations made during the visit and will be listed at the end of the report.
2.2. Resolving Critical Deficiencies. Immediately after the NSSAV, the wing commander will
provide the lead division with the wing’s designated POC who will formally track resolution of
critical deficiencies. The wing in cooperation with MAJCOM functional experts should apply 8-
step problem solving methodology to deficiencies in order to correct systemic issues. A process
change, if required, may be more critical to providing a sustainable solution than correcting an
individual deficiency.
2.2. (ACC)Resolving Critical Deficiencies. Immediately after the NSSAV, the wing
commander will provide HQ ACC/A10 with the wing’s designated POC who will formally track
resolution of critical deficiencies.
   2.2.1. NLT 60 days after the completion of the NSSAV, the wing will send a follow-up
   report to the lead division describing corrective actions taken to resolve critical deficiencies.
   2.2.1. (ACC) HQ ACC/A10 is designated final authority on closing out any
   critical/significant deficiencies.
   2.2.2. Lead division will forward the resolution to the appropriate OPR within the MAJCOM
   HQ to determine the effectiveness of the corrective action. The OPR will then recommend
   either closing out the deficiency or further corrective actions.
   2.2.3. Lead division will compile the comments from the OPRs and create a consolidated
   response to the wing.
   2.2.4. The wing must start an immediate collaborative process with the wing and MAJCOM
   Functional experts to fix the problem, and provide an update to all open critical deficiencies
   (at a minimum) every 30 days thereafter until closed. Lead division will continue to track
   observations until resolved. The MAJCOM/CC will designate a final authority on closing
   out any critical/significant deficiencies.
2.3. Crossfeed Report. Lead division will publish an annual Nuclear Surety Crossfeed Trends
and Analysis Report. The report will identify deficiencies and their associated root cause(s) and
corrective action(s), but will not attribute the deficiency to a particular wing. NSSAV crossfeed
reports will be classified IAW CJCSI 3263.05, Enclosure F, para 2.
   2.3.1. Annual Crossfeed reports will be distributed to MAJCOM/CC, MAJCOM NSSAV
   Division Leads, NAF/Center CCs, AFSC/SEW, and all subordinate units at which NSSAVs
   occur.
   2.3.2. MAJCOMs will determine an appropriate forum for discussing NSSAV-highlighted
   trends on an annual basis.
   2.3.3. Lead division will provide an annual (CY) Crossfeed report NLT 31 Jan each year to
   other MAJCOMs having a nuclear surety mission, MAJCOM A10 and HAF A10 and
   MAJCOM A9 for posting in a nuclear surety lessons learned database.
