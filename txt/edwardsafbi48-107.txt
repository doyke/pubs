        measures. This training will be documented on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
        Health Record. Ensure training is documented in an appropriate manner for individual
        organizations (i.e., CAMS for maintenance personnel). Supervisors must ensure the AF
        55 is marked FOUO IAW DoD 5200.1-R if it has a SSN on it. Further, if the forms with
        a SSN are maintained in a binder, they need to be properly safeguarded IAW DoD
        5200.1-R.
        1.5.4. Where applicable, ensure flying personnel are annually informed on how heat
        stress affects aircrew performance, the Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS)
        temperature and zones, and appropriate preventive measures.
        1.5.5. During training exercises when personnel wear the ground crew chemical defense
        ensemble, ensure supervisors and workers are counseled concerning the early signs of
        heat stress and methods to be used to minimize the effects of heat stress.
        1.5.6. Plan work/rest cycles for personnel exposed to hot environments.
        1.5.7. Disseminate the WBGT index to workers and trainees.
        1.5.8. Ensure exposed workers and trainees increase their fluid intake as stated in Table
        7.1. Be aware that feelings of weakness and/or fatigue may be symptoms of
        hyponatremia (low blood sodium level, which may be caused by overconsumption of
        water).
2. Acclimatization:
     2.1. Acclimatization is a series of physiological adjustments that occur when an individual is
     exposed to a hot climate. A period of acclimatization is required for all personnel regardless
     of physical condition. Generally, fitter individuals acclimatize quicker. Acclimatization is
     achieved by exposing individuals progressively to increasing levels of heat and physical
     exertion. Acclimatization to heat begins with the first exposure. Typically, 50 percent is
     reached by the end of the first week. Substantial acclimatization (about 80 percent) can be
     expected by the end of the second week.
     2.2. The following personnel require acclimatization:
        2.2.1. Individuals who are routinely and occupationally exposed to strenuous work in hot
        environments. This may occur as outside temperatures increase during the spring and
        summer.
        2.2.2. Newly assigned personnel arriving from a cooler climate should follow the
        acclimatization guidelines described in paragraph 2.3.
        2.2.3. Personnel returning to work after four or more days of illness should undergo an
        abbreviated acclimatization work schedule.
     2.3. Initially, perform the most strenuous tasks early in the morning or late in the evening to
     conform to ambient temperature. As workers become acclimatized, work schedules can be
     shifted back to normal routines. When non-acclimatized workers are exposed to heat, they
     may experience some discomfort and signs of heat strain; such as high body temperatures,
     increased heart rates, and fatigue. As acclimatization progresses, the ability to perform at the
     same level of heat stress improves and symptoms of discomfort and strain diminish. During
     the two-week acclimatization period, ensure workers are aware of the signs and symptoms of
EDWARDSAFBI48-107 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                   5


   heat stress disorders and drink sufficient water (see Table 7.1 for guidelines). When
   discomfort and heat stress symptoms occur, workers should self-pace their activities to
   perform below their maximum physical capacity by adjusting their work speed and taking
   brief, unscheduled, in-place breaks. After a period of one to two weeks, a worker should be
   able to perform all tasks without difficulty (dependent on the temperature and workload).
3. Procedures:
   3.1. Heat Stress:
      3.1.1. 412 AMDS/SGPB will monitor the heat stress index daily during the summer
      months. The summer monitoring period will begin around Memorial Day and end around
      Labor Day. (The summer monitoring period may be increased or decreased based on
      seasonal variations.)
      3.1.2. When the ambient temperature reaches 95oF, 412 AMDS/SGPB will perform heat
      stress monitoring every 2 hours during normal duty hours from 0800 until 1600, except
      as noted in Paragraphs 3.1.3 and 3.1.8. See Attachment 4 for additional information.
      3.1.3. When the WBGT Index reaches 85oF, 412 AMDS/SGPB will initiate heat stress
      monitoring hourly during normal duty hours, except as noted in Paragraph 3.1.8.
      3.1.4. Heat Stress Advisories will be disseminated every time the WBGT Index changes
      IAW with Table 3.1.
      3.1.5. 412 AMDS/SGPB will notify the 412 TW/CP by phone at 527-3040 to issue a
      Heat Stress Advisory.
      3.1.6. 412 TW/CP will phone 412 MOS/MXOO and 412 TW/CE to inform them of
      thermal stress advisories upon notification by 412 AMDS/SGPB of Stage 2, 3, 4 and 5
      Heat Stress Condition categories changes and send pop-up alert notifications to the entire
      base when the Heat Stress Condition categories change to Stage 3, 4 and 5.
      3.1.7. 412 AMDS/SGPB will update the heat stress condition listed on the EAFB
      SharePoint           Thermal           Stress      Update        link       at
      (https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/95mdg/amds/Heat%20Index%20Documents/WBG
      TDescription.aspx).
      3.1.8. If Stage 2 heat stress conditions exist at the end of the duty day (1600L), shop
      supervisors will be required to monitor ambient temperature levels, either through
      thermometers located in the shop, by contacting the base weather station at 661-277-
      4472, or through the estimated WBGT index located at the Edwards AFB Automated
      Heat Stress Forecast link, (https://bsx.edwards.af.mil/weather/index.html). When the
      ambient temperature drops below 95 F, the supervisor will eliminate any work/rest cycles
      currently in effect. If Stage 3 heat stress conditions or higher exists at the end of the duty
      day, 412 AMDS/SGPB will continue hourly monitoring until Stage 2 heat stress
      conditions are reached; at that time, 412 AMDS/SGPB will follow procedures as noted in
      Paragraphs 3.1.4-3.1.8.
      3.1.9. Guidelines for Occupational Heat Exposures
 6                                                   EDWARDSAFBI48-107 5 AUGUST 2014


            3.1.9.1. Personnel who routinely perform their jobs in hot environments (such as
            aircraft maintenance, grounds maintenance, and repair work in steam pits and
            tunnels) are considered occupationally exposed.
            3.1.9.2. Supervisors of occupationally exposed personnel should use Tables 1 and 3
            to plan work/rest cycles for individuals under their control. When the WBGT index
            reaches the temperatures shown in the table, supervisors will initiate the appropriate
            work/rest cycle.
            3.1.9.3. Exposures above 90F WBGT should be allowed only when performing
            mission essential duties, and then only with caution.
            3.1.9.4. When necessary to accomplish the task, two or more details should be
            arranged to work in sequence to ensure each crew adheres to the proper work/rest
            cycle.
            3.1.9.5. Heat Stress Conditions provide guidance to workplace supervisors in order to
            reduce heat stress injuries. The WBGT Index should not be used directly for
            operations requiring heavy personal protective equipment (PPE) or hot indoor
            operations. Use correction factors for PPE from Table 7.1.

Table 1. WBGT Stages, Temperature Ranges and Flag Colors
 Stage                Temperature Range (WBGT)                      Flag Color

 5                    90 F and above                               Black
4. Guidelines for Flying Personnel: All aircrew must understand and comply with the
following guidance:
     4.1. General. The FITS Table (see Attachment 2) will be used to determine Normal,
     Caution, and Danger Zones. Forecasted FITS values can be found on the Edwards AFB
     weather homepage (https://bsx.edwards.af.mil/weather/index.html) under the Range
     Forecast and/or Edwards Automated Heat Stress Forecast links. 412 OSS/OSW will forecast
     the FITS values for the day and include it in the Range Mission Execution Forecast. The 412
     OSS/OSW will determine the current FITS Zone on an hourly basis during normal duty
     hours Monday through Friday. If the Caution or Danger Zones are entered, they will
     disseminate a FITS Weather Advisory over the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) and notify
     the Supervisors of Flying (SOF), who will ensure it is included on the Automated Terminal
     Information System. Unit Operations Desks will clearly post the FITS Zone. 412 OG/CC is
     the waiver authority for this guidance.
     4.2. Hot Weather Precautions for all Aircrew
        4.2.1. All aircrew will allow time for acclimatization to hot weather and should avoid
        extreme efforts on the first several days of exposure.
EDWARDSAFBI48-107 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                  7


      4.2.2. When exposed to hot weather, aircrew will drink more water than thirst dictates; at
      a minimum the amounts recommended in Table 7.1. This will ensure proper hydration as
      the body increases sweat secretion to defend against heat. Aircrew should either carry
      water or have it readily available in the aircraft.
      4.2.3. Flying squadron commanders will ensure their pilots understand the FITS
      measurement system and the appropriate preventive measures. 412 AMDS/SGPB can
      assist.
   4.3. Fighter/Trainer Aircrew Procedures. This section applies to aircrew flying high-G
   aircraft (i.e., capable of G-loading in excess of 4.0 G).
      4.3.1. Caution Zone (CZ) Procedures: Limit ground operations outside of an air-
      conditioned environment to 90 minutes maximum. If ground operations exceed 90
      minutes (i.e. no flight), the aircrew must spend 60 minutes in an air-conditioned
      environment and re-hydrate before re-attempting flight. Once a flight is completed, the
      aircrew must spend at least 60 minutes in an air-conditioned environment and re-hydrate
      before flying again.
      4.3.2. Danger Zone (DZ) Procedures: Cancel all flights planned to remain below 3,000
      feet AGL (low-level/pattern-only sorties). Limit ground operations outside of an air-
      conditioned environment to 45 minutes maximum. T-38s are considered non-air-
      conditioned aircraft while on the ground and must take off within the 45-minute limit. If
      ground operations exceed 45 minutes (i.e., no flight), the aircrew must spend 60 minutes
      in an air-conditioned environment and re-hydrate before attempting to fly. Once a flight
      is completed, the aircrew must spend at least 60 minutes in an air-conditioned
      environment and re-hydrate before flying again. Do not fly with chemical defense,
      immersion, or arctic flight equipment while in the DZ.
      4.3.3. Cancellation: Cancel all non-essential flights when the FITS value exceeds 115
      °F.
   4.4. Multiengine Jet, Reciprocating, Turboprop, and Helicopter Aircrew Procedures.
   Aircrew flying non-fighter/trainer aircraft will observe the following precautions when
   Edwards AFB is in the FITS Caution or Danger Zones.
      4.4.1. If available, use cooling air during ground operations.
      4.4.2. Limit ground operations outside of an air-conditioned environment to no more
      than three hours. If the 3-hr limit is exceeded, aircrew must spend 30 minutes in an air-
      conditioned environment and re-hydrate before flying. The aircraft commander may
      waive the 3-hr limit based on mission requirements.
5. Guidelines for Personnel Wearing the Ground Crew Chemical Defense Ensemble:
   5.1. Personnel performing ground crew operations and training while wearing the charcoal-
   impregnated over-garment and associated protective equipment of the chemical defense
   ensemble are at increased risk of injury from heat stress. Maximum work times tolerated by
   personnel while they are wearing the protective ensemble are affected by multiple individual
   factors, such as an individual’s physical condition, state of thermal acclimatization, degree of
   hydration, the workload associated with a given task, and environmental factors, including

     air velocity, radiant heat (sunlight), air temperature, and humidity. WBGT criteria include
     many of these variables.
     5.2. AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions, contains measures to
     minimize heat casualties in personnel while they are accomplishing their mission. Estimates
     of increases in task performance times and maximum and safe work times while personnel
     are wearing MOPP 3 and 4 equipment are shown in Table 5.1. Commanders and supervisors
     should use this information when planning and conducting exercises to avoid heat injuries in
     their personnel.

                 Heavy Aircraft Repair
To estimate how much time it will take to perform a task or operation while in MOPPs 3 and 4:
   1. Determine the appropriate column for the outside temperature.
   2. Find the work rate using the activity examples as a guide (e.g. light, moderate, and heavy).
   3. Find the task time multiplier: read across the work rate line and down the temperature
column.
Example: A rapid runway repair team is working while the outside temperature is 60 F. The
task normally takes 2.5 hours to complete. By using the chart, rapid runway repair is listed as a
heavy work rate under the activity examples. Also, by using the outside temperature (60 F) for
that work rate (heavy), find the task time multiplier. In this case, the task time multiplier is 2.1.
Take the task time multiplier and multiply it by the time it normally takes to do the job (2.1 x 2.5
hours = 5.25 hours). Therefore, the time it takes to do the job in MOPP 3 or 4 is 5.25 hours.
     5.3. During exercises where MOPP gear is worn, 412 AMDS/SGPB will notify the
     Deployment Control Center and Command Post (CP) of the current work/rest ratios and the
     CP will then relay that information to the Installation Control Center. 412 AMDS/SGPB
     personnel will monitor the heat stress until two consecutive WBGT Index readings fall below
     74.9 °F.
6. Guidelines for Personnel Working Under Aircraft Shelters: See Attachment 3 for
considerations applied to personnel working on the flight line under the shade of aircraft shelters.
7. Prevention of Heat Stress Disorders: The following subjects discuss actions to help prevent
heat stress disorders.
EDWARDSAFBI48-107 5 AUGUST 2014                                                              9


  7.1. Education. Personnel working and/or training in hot environments must be educated on
  the causes, symptoms, first-aid treatment, and prevention of heat disorders. The 412 AMDS
  Aerospace and Operational Physiology Team (AOPT) can assist unit commanders with heat
  stress education. Shop supervisors will also include heat-stress awareness in annual safety
  training, where applicable.
  7.2. Water. Drink large quantities of cool water to make up for water lost through sweating.
  It is better to drink small amounts of water frequently to replace water than to drink large
  amounts less frequently.
     7.2.1. Milk and coffee do not effectively replace water loss.      Consumption of these
     fluids should be kept to a minimum.
     7.2.2. Carbonated beverages, while containing water, are not as effective as water in
     keeping the body hydrated because of the tendency to delay gastric emptying.
  7.3. Salt. Some salt is lost in sweat. Because the typical North American diet contains so
  much salt, an individual should season food to taste but should not make any additional
  attempts to add excessive salt to the diet. Salt tablets will not be used except when ordered
  by a competent medical authority.
  7.4. Acclimatization. Personnel must be acclimated to heat exposures. See paragraph 2.1.
  7.5. Work Schedules. Modify work schedules to perform the heaviest work during the
  coolest parts of the day. When working in hot environments, establish work and rest cycles
  as outlined in Table 7.1. Take rest breaks in cool, shaded areas.

Notes:
1. If wearing any MOPP gear, add 10 °F to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing
personal body armor in humid climates; add 5 °F to WBGT.
2. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade, if possible.
3. Caution: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not
exceed 1 quart. The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and
hydration for at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water needs will
vary = 1/4 quart hour.
4. NL = no limit to work time per hour.

   7.6. Food. Avoid eating greasy, fatty, or heavy foods if possible.
   7.7. Medical Treatment.     Seek medical treatment for any heat stress-related problems,
   including rashes.
   7.8. Medications. Any individual who works outdoors or in hot environments should inform
   their doctor when receiving medications. Many prescription drugs have diuretic effects or
   may reduce the body’s ability to sweat. These reactions can have severe effects when
   working outdoors and may speed the heat-stress process significantly.
   7.9. Heat syncope is a heat-stress condition caused by pooling of the blood in dilated vessels
   and lower extremities brought on by prolonged periods of immobile activity or standing.
   Selecting acclimated personnel to participate in parades and ceremonies, having them drink
   copious amounts of water prior to ceremony, and directing them to discreetly move arms and
   legs to assist the return of blood to the heart may prevent heat syncope.
8. Recognition and First-Aid Treatment for Heat Stress Disorders: Use Table 8.1. as a
guide in recognizing the common heat stress disorders and as a quick reference for first aid.

Terms
Acclimatization—A period of adjustment an individual's body requires to become accustomed
to working in hot environments. Full acclimatization occurs through progressive degrees of heat
exposure and physical exertion. Personnel may need two weeks of increasing exposures to
become substantially acclimated and may retain most of their adaptation for about one week after
leaving a hot climate. Workers in good physical condition acclimatize more quickly.
Air-Conditioned Environment—1) Any air-conditioned building or vehicle; 2) The air-
conditioned cockpit or cabin area of an aircraft, with cooling air supplied either externally or
internally.
EDWARDSAFBI48-107 5 AUGUST 2014                                                                13


Curtailment vs. Suspension of Activities—Curtailment means reducing the level of exertion,
reducing the pace of the activity and increasing the number and length of the rest periods.
Suspension means to stop all strenuous activities temporarily until favorable environmental
conditions return.
Diuretic—Diuretic compounds cause your body to lose excess water through saliva, urination,
or excessive sweating. Examples of diuretics are caffeine-containing drinks such as coffee and
sodas, alcohol, and water loss pills. Some prescription medications contain diuretic compounds.
Heat Stress—Heat stress is the combination of environmental and physical work factors that
constitute the total heat load imposed on the body. The environmental heat stress factors are air
temperature, radiant heat exchange (example, sunlight), air movement, and relative humidity.
Physical work contributes to total heat stress through the body's production of heat (metabolic
heat) as it burns energy to sustain the work. This production of metabolic heat depends on the
intensity of the physical effort that is affected, in turn, by body size, muscular development,
physical fitness, and age.
Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS)—A guideline to predict cockpit environmental
conditions during low-level missions which may jeopardize aircrew performance. FITS is based
on the dry air and the dew point temperatures.
Heat Stress Disorders—Heat stress disorders are general terms used to indicate any type of
adverse health problem related to heat. Heat syncope, cramps, exhaustion, and strokes are all
forms of heat stress disorders. Heat stress disorders may be recognized by one or more of the
following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fever, dizziness, headache, faintness, abdominal or leg
cramps, abnormal sweating, lack of coordination, mental confusion, and convulsions. The
personnel most likely to be affected by the heat are those who have just arrived from cooler
regions of the country, are obese, or are in poor condition.
Heat Syncope—Fainting while standing erect and immobile in heat, caused by pooling of the
blood in dilated vessels and the lower parts of the body.
Heat Cramps—Painful intermittent spasms of the muscles used during work (arms, legs, or
abdominal) which may occur during or after work hours. Cramps may result from exposure to
high temperature for a relatively long time, particularly if accompanied by hard physical work.
Cramps usually occur in unacclimated personnel after heavy sweating and are the result of
excessive loss of salt from the body. Even if the moisture is replaced by drinking water, the loss
of salt by sweating may provoke heat cramps.
Heat Exhaustion—The signs of heat exhaustion are profuse sweating, weakness, rapid pulse,
dizziness, nausea, and headache. The skin is cool and sometimes pale and clammy with sweat;
however, the body temperature rises rapidly.
Heat Stroke—Increased body temperature, if uncontrolled, may lead to delirium, convulsions,
coma, and even death. Heat stroke is a much more serious condition than either heat cramps or
heat exhaustion.
Hyponatremia—Low sodium level in the blood, a condition caused by the over consumption of
water. Symptoms include feeling weak and fatigued, which may progressively get worse as the
sodium level declines. In severe cases, patients may experience seizures and loss of
consciousness.

Rest—Minimal physical activity, and should be accomplished in the shade, if possible. Any
activity requiring only minimal physical activity can be performed during “rest.” Examples are
classroom type training, paperwork, minor maintenance on vehicles or weapons, and personal
hygiene activities.
Sortie—One sortie equates to stepping from Ops, going to the jet, flying, and returning to Ops
(Ops-jet-fly-Ops).
Timing—Begins when exiting air-conditioned environment (ops, life support, step van with air-
conditioning). Time is cumulative on the flight line while outside air-conditioned aircraft.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index—The WBGT index is a combination of
temperature measurements which considers dry air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant
heating. The equation for the WBGT index uses dry bulb, natural wet bulb, and black globe
temperatures.
Mandatory, Preferred, and Acceptable Requirements
May - Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method of accomplishment.
Should— Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
Will— Indicates a mandatory requirement and is also used to express a declaration of intent,
probability, or determination.
