SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision aligns
the supplement to the basic instruction. All chapters have been updated and streamlined.
Therefore, it is recommended that users read contents in its entirety. Any questions regarding
this supplement should be directed to the Quality Assurance flight.
1.6.1.3. (DAVIS MONTHAN) Unit TODA custodians will ensure delivery of TOs and
supplements to deployed locations.
1.24. (Added) 355 LRS Vehicle Maintenance (VM) coordinates with 355 MXG unit Vehicle
Control Officer (VCO)/Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Officer (VCNCO) directly for
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. MOC calls VM when disabled vehicles need to be
immediately removed from the flight line areas, in front of hangar doors or aircraft wash racks.
2.14.1. (Added) Units establish procedures for amplification of these minimum requirements.
2.14.1.1. (Added) Use warning tags to ensure the safety of maintainers and prevent damage to
aircraft. Base requirements do not override job guide or technical order requirements for use of
warning tags.
2.14.1.2. (Added) Warning tags will be filled out and entered into the aircraft forms: Both tag
parts shall be considered controlled items and their whereabouts and status should be monitored
and controlled as such. Tags will be replaced on a one-for-one basis. If a tag is found to be
missing, a lost tool report must be initiated.
2.14.1.3. (Added) Tags will be identified with the different "Do Not Apply" and "Do Not
Operate/Open" comments on the top and bottom portion of the tags. The top and bottom parts of
the tags will be disconnected and hung from the boards or placed in the binder. When the
discrepancy is written in the AFTO Form/IMT 781As, the maintainer will enter the date, time,
and his/her employee number on the appropriate tag and place the tag's top section on the
aircraft. The corresponding bottom section will also have the same information and placed in the
forms on the appropriate page and block.
2.14.2.4. (Added) This warning tag system is not a substitute for reviewing forms or
performing safe for maintenance actions, or checking-in with the expediter or inspection dock
chief.
3.4.1.2. (DAVIS MONTHAN) 355 MOS Safety representative is the focal point/coordinator
for all environmental, safety, occupational health requirements, compliance, and worker
protection issues.
3.4.1.6. (DAVIS MONTHAN) Refer to DMAFBI 15-101, Base Weather Support Plan.
3.4.1.73. (DAVIS MONTHAN) MOC will establish and utilize emergency action checklists to
include adverse weather procedures as detailed in DMAFBI 15-101.
4.7.1.1. (DAVIS MONTHAN) A-10 debrief sections will use the flight control debriefing
guides, DMAFB Form 24 Aircrew Debriefing Guide Checklist, and ensure they are completed
prior to concluding the flight debriefing and file a copy keeping it for 90 days. Tenant units
should develop airframe specific checklist(s) for their MDS. Contact the MOC to ensure an
R&R technician is present for debrief of reported primary flight control discrepancies
(exemptions: A-10 pitch or yaw SAS kicks off line discrepancies). The AMU debrief section
AFI21-101_CAFSUP_DAVIS-MONTHANAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                                 3


will use the DMAFB Form 25, DMAFB A-10 Engine Stall Checklist (Pilot Debrief) for reported
A-10 engine stalls/anomalies and DMAFB Form 26, GAU-8/A Gun System Malfunction Report,
for reported gun system discrepancies.
4.7.1.2. (Added) 355 MXG QA will maintain a copy of standardized debrief guide(s) on file.
4.8.3.1. (DAVIS MONTHAN) The DCC/ADCC (if designated) will assist the 355 EMS Phase
Section/ISO Section dock chief and be jointly responsible for managing the aircraft forms and
monitoring MIS to ensure timely clearing of work center events. If the DCC/ADCC is not
designated/available the owning AMU should appoint a 5-level (minimum) crew chief to assist
the 355 EMS Phase/ISO section to fulfill the above stated requirements.
4.9.1.1. (DAVIS MONTHAN) When LRUs are removed for bench check, the discrepancy
block of the AFTO Form 350 for the suspect LRU will contain the name, rank, organization, and
duty phone number of the lead technician working the discrepancy and marked in red “Repeat”
or “Recur.”
4.10.3.5. (Added) When loading 30mm ammunition into A-10 aircraft, perform full
uploads/downloads, there are no top-off loads permitted. Ammunition loads during summer and
winter months, will be negotiated between applicable OG and MXG/CC. Except for
replenishment loads, a red X shall be placed in the AFTO FORM/IMT 781A stating “BALLAST
ADJUSTMENT REQUIRED” and add the reason, i.e. ammunition removed, ammunition
installed, partial load ammunition installed, partial load ammunition removed, or partial load
ammunition removed and full ammunition load installed.
4.10.3.5.1. (Added) A gun system stoppage/jam during A-10 aircraft loading or unloading
operations will be treated as an unsafe gun until the exact condition can be determined. A
qualified 2W171 maintenance technician will positively identify any live rounds remaining in the
gun. If the gun is determined unsafe and cannot be cleared using normal procedures in TO 1A-
10C-33-1-2, the AMU will notify MOC.
4.10.3.5.1.1. (Added) MOC will initiate the emergency action checklist and will make

delivery personnel will position ammo by towing trailer to aircraft and positioning themselves
toward the 4th and 5th posts (counting from the front of the aircraft). Weapons personnel will
verify a safe distance between aircraft and trucks/trailers. A spotter will position the ammo
driver when approaching the aircraft at the beginning of the load. At the end of the load two
spotters are required, one will spot between the ALA and trailer and the other one will spot
between the 4th and 5th posts of the sunshade. The ammo driver will drive between the posts
and clear the sunshade area.
4.10.5.3. (Added) Notify MOC NLT 45 minutes prior to loading or unloading live munitions.
4.10.5.7.1. (Added) Weapons Supervisory Inspections (WSI) will be performed on 100% of all
scheduled flyers prior to each sortie except those sorties that do not require an exception release,
i.e. hot pit turns.

WS superintendent will monitor LSC proficiency loads. Post-load inspections do not meet these
proficiency requirements. The following criteria apply to initial certification, MPRLs and SAEs:
12.15.1.1. (Added) Exceeded time standard results in a failed rating for the load crew chief. A
safety or reliability error results in a failed rating for the individual.
12.15.1.1.1. (Added) Safety Error: A violation of safety publications, TO warnings, etc., or an
unsafe act that could reasonably lead to personal injury or death.
12.15.1.1.2. (Added) Reliability Error: A violation of TO requirements that could reasonably
lead to damage/premature failure of equipment or prevent safe reliable operation of a weapons
system or release of a weapon.
12.15.1.2. (Added) A demonstrated lack of technical proficiency by an individual load crew
member can result in a failed rating. If the time standard is exceeded for this reason, the load
crew chief does not need to be decertified.
12.15.1.3. (Added) For integrated loads, the evaluator may elect decertification on any one or
all munitions loaded. When the same rating is not applied to all munitions loaded during an
integrated load, the load crew records will be annotated accordingly. Crews failing an integrated
load for overtime will recertify/re-qualify on the same load.
12.15.1.4. (Added) Intervention by an evaluator during loading to prevent injury to personnel
or damage to equipment will result in a failed rating.
12.15.1.5. (Added) More than three errors per crew member results in a failed rating for the
individual.
12.15.1.6. (Added) MPRL credit may be given to load crews or personnel performing DLOs or
other loading operations on the flightline during exercises, extended deployments or daily
operations provided complete loads that satisfy MPRL requirements are performed and evaluated
from start to finish. The required number of evaluators, equipment and all other requirements
must be met to receive credit for these type evaluations. MPRL credit during flightline
evaluations is only authorized when loading lives, dummy air training missiles (DATM), or D-2
type inert munitions.

impulse cartridges, chaff/flare modules, and/or other munitions within EMS munitions storage
facilities.
12.19.3.3. (DAVIS MONTHAN) To determine if a 2.75-inch rocket is unsafe or
unserviceable; if the outer aluminum seal has been punctured, the inner aluminum seal and the
grounding wire must be checked to ensure they are undamaged. A load crew member will
remove the outer aluminum seal to perform a visual inspection to ensure the grounding wire and
inner aluminum seal are undamaged. If the grounding wire and inner aluminum seal are
undamaged, the rocket is serviceable and can be loaded into the LAU-131 launcher or
downloaded to the rocket trailer.
12.19.3.3.1. (Added) If the grounding wire or inner aluminum seal is damaged, a Ground
Emergency will be declared and EOD will be called. Once EOD has declared the rocket safe, it
can be downloaded, tagged unserviceable, and placed into the rocket trailer, and the loading
procedure can continue. The rocket trailer can remain on the flight line. If EOD declares the
rocket to be unsafe, EOD will remove the rocket from the flight line.
12.19.3.3.2. (Added) The use of any item other than the metal rocket tool to load or unload
rockets from the LAU-131 launcher will result in the immediate decertification of the weapons
load crew chief or member.

will be 5-level, with a minimum grade of E-4, and 6 months practical experience on the A-10C
from any Air Force base.
12.19.5.3. (Added) CLQ training may be conducted on the same day the load crew is
scheduled for WLT and scheduled through the load scheduling process, or they may be
scheduled during a separate load pad time.
12.20.1.1. (Added) See Table 12.1 for A-10 local load training time standards.
12.20.1.2. (Added) Integrated loads will be compatible with TO 1A-10C-1. Compute
integrated load times as follows: add all munitions load times and subtract 30 percent of the
additive times. An example would be: AIM-9 and 3 x prefuzed MK-82 = (20 minutes + 39
minutes = 59 minutes - 17.7 minutes = 41.3 minutes).

 26                      AFI21-101_CAFSUP_DAVIS-MONTHANAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012


14.46.1. (Added) The Trim Pad Pre-Run checklist will be kept with the aircraft as long as the
aircraft is on the trim pad. If a shift change occurs involving run personnel, a new checklist will
be completed prior to engine start.
14.46.2. (Added) Night Operations: Refer to DMAFBI 11-250, Airfield Operations Flying
Instruction, for DM quiet hours.
14.46.2.1. (Added) Unrestricted engine runs are authorized on A-10, C-130 and H-60 aircraft
for a period not to exceed two hours from the last scheduled land time for the unit performing
night flying operations. Aircraft landing late due to maintenance or operations problems will not
extend the authorized run time.
14.46.2.2. (Added) Idle runs for A-10s and H-60s are authorized anytime (including during
designated quiet hours). Any engine run for C-130 or above 70% for A-10 and H-60 aircraft
after designated quiet hours and/or exceeding 2 hours after scheduled night landing will require
extended engine run clearance. Extended run clearance will be considered on a case-by-case
basis only by the 355 MXG/CC or designated representative (example; to fill a hard line on the
following day’s flying schedule) as specified in DMAFBI 11-250.
14.47. (Added) A-10 Chock Walking. IAW AFI 11-218, ACC Sup 1, Aircraft Operations and
Movement on the Ground the applicable MXG/CC or designated representative approves all
towing without brake pressure when there is no specific MDS technical data guidance. The 355
MXG/CC has pre-authorized A-10 chock walks within the aircraft parking ramps, to/from the
355 MXG wash rack, fuel barns, phase, or ISO at all times. Any other chock walks require case-
by-case approval from applicable MXG/CC or designated representative.
14.48. (Added) Aircraft Hangaring.
14.48.1. (Added) For A-10 aircraft use DMAFB Form 43, A-10C Hangar Entry Checklist.
Once aircraft is hangared, perform emergency tow bar pre-use inspection if used and document
DMAFB Form 43A, Emergency Tow Bar Inspection Checklist. The DMAFB Form 43 and 43A
(if emergency tow bar is used) will be completed and verified by the aircraft tow supervisor of
all hangar requirements and will be prominently displayed.
14.48.2. (Added) For C-130 aircraft use DMAFB Form 44, C-130 Hangar Entry Checklist.
The DMAFB Form 44 will be completed and verified by the aircraft tow supervisor of all hangar
requirements and will be prominently displayed.
14.48.3. (Added) For H-60 aircraft use DMAFB Form 46, H-60 Hangar Entry Checklist. The
DMAFB Form 46 will be completed and verified by the aircraft tow supervisor of all hangar
requirements and will be prominently displayed.
14.48.4. (Added) Aircraft Emergency Evacuation From Hangar.
14.48.4.1. (Added) The on-scene supervisor or maintenance personnel will ensure that the
following are accomplished: activate the building fire alarms, notify the fire department, MOC,
and ensure tow teams are standing by for towing. If an aircraft evacuation is considered feasible
by the fire chief or on-scene supervisor, commence towing procedures as expeditiously as
possible. NOTE: In an emergency, use the most expeditious manner available to evacuate the
aircraft from the hangar. Using a towbar, cables, or personnel to push the aircraft are all
acceptable means of removal. When the aircraft is evacuated to a safe distance from the
AFI21-101_CAFSUP_DAVIS-MONTHANAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                           27


hazardous area, all further towing will be accomplished IAW applicable technical order and
safety precautions. The fire chief or on-scene supervisor will determine minimum safe distance.
14.48.4.2. (Added) If locally manufactured towbar is used for an emergency tow, the towbar
will require a major inspection (refer to DMAFB Form 43A) prior to next usage.
16.3.4. (Added) All explosives operations will stop that are outdoors or at an indoor location
that has no lightning protection system when lightning is observed within 5 miles. The
continuation of explosives operations within a lightning protected facility is not prohibited.
Assess the need or urgency of the task at hand prior to continuing operations in lightning
protected facilities.
18.5. (DAVIS MONTHAN) For maintenance contracts in 355 MXG, the squadron
commander having overall responsibility for the maintenance function is the FD/FC and is the
focal point for all matters pertaining to the contracted function.

                                    Attachment 23 (Added)
                                         HOT BRAKES

A23.1. (Added)       When hot brakes are known or suspected the following precautions must be
strictly followed:
A23.1.1. (Added) C-130 Only: Do not set parking brakes while overheated brake conditions
exist.
A23.1.2. (Added) Do not approach the wheel brake from either side; approach only from front
or rear.
A23.1.3. (Added) Do not taxi aircraft after excessive use of brakes unless necessary to ensure
the safety of personnel and equipment.
A23.1.4. (Added) Do not tow aircraft unless it is to remove it from a crowded parking area
after engine shutdowns. Once cleared, the tow vehicle will be chocked and the area evacuated.
A23.1.5. (Added) Do not move aircraft until the brakes have cooled and it has been
determined by the crash recovery team chief whether or not the aircraft requires chock walking.
A23.1.6. (Added) Do not attempt to determine brake temperature using items such as melt
sticks or chemical pencils. The way to determine a suspected hot brake is by placing a hand a
few inches from the brake, unless it can be determined by other means. (e.g., heat radiation, fire,
etc.).
A23.1.7. (Added) If a brake is hot, let the fuse plugs in the wheels do their job by deflating the
tires.
A23.2. (Added) Hot Brake Procedures.
A23.2.1. (Added) The 355 EMS crash recovery crew will respond to all hot brake conditions
declared on all assigned and transient aircraft during normal scheduled flying. Transient Alert
will respond at all other times.
A23.2.2. (Added) C-130 only: AMU personnel will respond with a designated team to all hot
brake conditions declared on their assigned aircraft accordance with this instruction.
A23.2.3. (Added) ATC personnel provides communication and direction for assigned and
transient aircraft and provides primary coordination for the fire department and control agencies.
The fire department responds to all hot brake notifications and establishes command and control
at the scene.
A23.2.4. (Added) If a hot brake condition is verified by the EOR crew, the senior maintenance
EOR team member will direct the removal of aircraft and personnel from the area and notify the
MOC. All EOR crews will be thoroughly familiar with responsibilities and procedures outlined
in this attachment.
A23.2.5. (Added) If a hot brake condition is verified by the crew chief at the parking spot, the
senior maintenance representative on scene will direct the removal of the aircraft from the area.
A23.2.6. (Added) Crash recovery personnel will position chocks forward of the main landing
gear wheels and immediately withdraw to a safe distance of 300 feet. The individual marshaling
aircraft to the chocks will remain in the area. Once aircraft is in position against the chocks, the
AFI21-101_CAFSUP_DAVIS-MONTHANAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                              55


marshaller will evacuate the area. At no time will the individual marshaling the aircraft place
himself directly in front of an aircraft having forward firing ordnance aboard.
A23.2.7. (Added) C-130 only: Aircrew will ensure the nose gear is chocked and tower
notified; shut down the engines, evacuate the aircraft, and turn it over to maintenance and fire
department personnel.
A23.2.8. (Added) No one will reenter the area for a period of 30 minutes from the time hot
brakes were declared unless determined safe by the on scene commander or an explosion or fire
has actually occurred.
A23.2.9. (Added) Crash recovery personnel will inspect the brakes after 30 minutes to
determine status. If additional time is required, the brakes will be re-inspected at 15-minute
intervals.
A23.2.10. (Added) Once brake conditions are determined to be acceptable by on scene
commander chocks will be removed for taxi if required. Crash recovery will notify the MOC
that a tow team and vehicle will be required to move the aircraft to the parking ramp as
necessary. MOC will notify the appropriate AMU or T/A to arrange tow.
A23.2.11. (Added) Aircraft with Engines Running on Taxiways, Parking Areas, and Refueling
Pits: The pilot is directed to a designated hot brake area (See Figure A23.1) or an area that
affords a minimum of 300 feet of clearance around the aircraft. The pilot holds short of the hot
brake area until crash recovery or maintenance crews arrive and direct the aircraft into position.
A23.2.12. (Added) Aircraft after Engine Shutdown on Taxiways, Parking Areas, and
Refueling Pits: All personnel will evacuate and maintain a 300-foot clearance from the aircraft
while notifying the tower, via MOC, to alert crash recovery and fire department.

                                   Attachment 24 (Added)
                       FUNCTIONAL CHECK FLIGHT PROGRAM

A24.1. (Added) Functional Check Flight Program. A-10, C-130, H-60 FCF’s will be flown
when required by -6 technical order or directed by the applicable OG/CC, MXG/CC, ECG/CC,
or flying squadron commander.
A24.2. (Added) The FCF OIC will:
A24.2.1. (Added) Be an A-10 FCF-qualified pilot. Tenant agencies will designate and monitor
their own FCF pilots and aircrews.
A24.2.2. (Added) Instruct upgrading FCF pilots whenever possible. The FCF OIC may
designate other highly qualified FCF pilot(s) to act as checkout monitor if necessary.
A24.2.3. (Added) Should establish and maintain a file of special interest items (SII) to
emphasize recent problem areas, new procedures, and/or techniques for FCF aircrew.
A24.2.4. (Added) Ensure aircrew FCF certification, training, and currency.
A24.2.5. (Added) A-10 pilots will review the FCF SIIs annually. For EC-130 FCFs, AMT and
navigators need only be current and qualified in their assigned aircraft to perform FCF duties.
A24.3. (Added) QA will conduct the following:
A24.3.1. (Added) Conduct initial Preflight QVI on all FCF aircraft prior to first flight. Review
all discrepancies that generated the FCF, in the aircraft AFTO FORM/IMT 781s (pulled and
active) and MIS to ensure that the appropriate maintenance has been accomplished and all entries
are correct and complete.        Fill out a FCF pilot briefing sheet detailing the major
components/maintenance that generated the FCF. After the review, Log forms review into the
quality assurance tracking and analysis database.
A24.3.2. (Added) Coordinate FCF airspace and file an appropriate flight plan. A-10s will use
Ruby/Fuzzy, Tombstone, Sells, Jackal, or Outlaw MOAs. Use Ruby/Fuzzy, Sells, Outlaw/Jackal
and all Tombstone MOAs for engine shutdowns/restarts. FCF engine shutdown checks will be
accomplished as dictated by FCF profile and IAW TO 1A-10C-6CL-1, Acceptance and
Functional Check Flight Checklist, TO 1A-10C-6CL-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight
Manual, USAF Series 1A-10C Aircraft. EC-130s will use Deming orbit primarily. Secondary
MOAs are Ruby/Fuzzy, Tombstone, and Jackal/Outlaw if available.
A24.3.3. (Added) Prepare a -6CL for the pilot.
A24.3.4. (Added) Brief the FCF pilot/aircrew on aircraft status, maintenance history, reason
for FCF, results of previous FCF attempt(s), and potential winds at take-off.
A24.3.5. (Added) Notify MOC, SOF, and Command Post of the pilot’s (or aircraft
commander’s) name and call sign, squadron of FCF aircraft, tail number, type of aircraft (for
Command Post), profile type (for Command Post), estimated take-off time, approximate land
time, and planned airspace.
A24.3.6. (Added) Contact the owning squadron OIC and brief the FCF information: tail
number, pilot (or aircraft commander) name, call sign, take-off/land time, MOA, and the planned
departure. Brief squadron top three of the profile required and what the FCF pilot is going to be
 58                      AFI21-101_CAFSUP_DAVIS-MONTHANAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012


checking out on the aircraft. Contact the 355 OG/CC (or designated representative), or tenant
CC for launch approval.
A24.2.7. (Added-A) Pick up the pilot from their home unit and brief any updated information
for the FCF. Have the pilot review and sign the automated DD Form 365-4 (from AWBS) and
review the aircraft forms. Ensure the pilot is given the -6CL card. Take the pilot to the Ops desk
of the FCF squadron for the Top Three step brief, and sign out. QA FCF manager will conduct a
thorough walk around of the aircraft to include but not limited to: hydraulic leaks, obvious
loose/hanging hardware, damage to flight control surfaces, and security of landing gear doors.
A24.2.8. (Added) After landing, take the pilot to the respective AMU debrief and ensure a
clear understanding of all discrepancies and proper completion of all documents. Ensure
maintenance specialists are present if required.
A24.2.9. (Added) Review corrective actions for all FCF discrepancies and sign off the QA
corrective actions review on the FCF JST in the forms prior to subsequent attempts.
A24.3. (Added) FCF pilots will fly A-10 FCFs clean with no external stores, pave penny pod,
30mm ammunition or empty casings. Install the necessary ballast plates IAW weight and
balance requirements. Configure tenant aircraft IAW applicable directives.
A24.4. (Added-A) FCF pilots will ensure a minimum of at least three liters of liquid oxygen
for each FCF attempt.
A24.5. (Added) MOC will ensure the appropriate AMU has an AF IMT 2407 on file for the
day’s FCF attempts.
A24.6. (Added) A-10 FCFs will normally fly with full internal fuel. FCFs with less than a full
internal fuel load must be coordinated with the FCF pilot and requires 355 OG/CC approval. For
C-130 FCFs, the fuel load will normally be 28,000 pounds or as requested by the aircraft
commander. For a HH-60, FCF fuel weight is 2,400 pounds or as requested by the aircraft
commander.
A24.7. (Added) 355 MXG AMUs will utilize the DMAFB Form 32, A-10 Functional Check
Flight Record, when preparing aircraft for FCFs. The A-10 FCF Record will be annotated and
kept in the front of the AFTO FORM/IMT 781s until FCF release. Upon completion form
should be returned to MOF P&S.
A24.8. (Added) FCF partial profiles require mandatory coordination with FCF OIC. This
coordination will include the translation of the maintenance driver(s) and/or testing requirements
into the published checks for FCF pilot to accomplish IAW TO 1A-10C-6CF-1, Acceptance and
Functional Check Flight Manual, TO 1A-10C-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight
Manual, USAF Series 1A 10C Aircraft. The FCF pilot may check any item in the -6CL that is
deemed to be necessary for safe and thorough accomplishment of the FCF. QA will brief the
pilot on which items will be included in the planned profile.
A24.9. (Added) An air abort or code 3 may, or may not, result in a non-release. The FCF pilot
is the final authority in determining whether or not the aircraft is released.
A24.10. (Added) AMU will initiate an AF IMT 2407 prior to a FCF attempt. AF IMT 2407
will normally be accomplished, in writing, prior to the FCF pilot stepping to the aircraft. Verbal
AF IMTs 2407 will be coordinated by exception only, and must be completed in writing at
earliest possible opportunity to reflect FCF attempts as approved and accomplished.
AFI21-101_CAFSUP_DAVIS-MONTHANAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012                                              59


A24.11. (Added) The AMU supervision will review the AFTO FORM/IMT 781 series forms
and MIS to ensure appropriate maintenance has been accomplished and entries are correct and
complete prior to delivering the forms to QA for review. FCF JST or a prepared red-bordered
AFTO 781A will be inserted in the active forms as the last page.
A24.12. (Added) Deliver A-10 active aircraft forms to QA FCF prior to the proposed take-off
time. The active forms will include a signed Exceptional Release from the AMU.
A24.13. (Added) If a C-130 FCF is required upon completion of an ISO due to -6
requirements, deliver C-130 ISO forms to QA FCF prior and deliver back line forms to QA/FCF
NLT 1400 the day prior.
A24.14. (Added) The AMU will coordinate for appropriate manning and ensure they have all
appropriate personnel available for launch and recovery (including EOR, and Crash Recovery) if
the FCF is to be conducted outside the wing’s flying window.
A24.15. (Added) Deliver C-130 active aircraft forms to QA FCF prior to crew brief for
review.
A24.16. (Added) After a non-released FCF, the squadron operations officer, maintenance
superintendent, or pro super will review all corrective actions for the non-release, sign off the
corrective actions review in the FCF JST and forward the aircraft forms to QA FCF section for
review. QA personnel must sign off the forms review prior to subsequent flights.
A24.17. (Added) Manual Reversion Adjustments.
A24.17.1. (Added) The 355 EMS Repair and Reclamation section will adhere to this guidance
to ensure proper forms documentation, two-man concept utilization during elevator trim tab
adjustments, and final measurement method for AFTO Form 95 historical data.
A24.17.2. (Added) Included in the AFTO FORM/IMT 781A will be a red dash entry stating
“Verification of flight control settings and update to AFTO IMT 95 due after FCF release.” This
entry will be included in the MIS JST for all FCFs. The purpose of this entry is to ensure all
historical records are current as of the latest FCF and subsequent flight control adjustments will
have the most current data to be used as a baseline.
A24.18. (Added) TA will notify QA FCF section of the need for a FCF on Transient Aircraft.
The FCF section and QA will then coordinate as necessary with the owning organization to
support the action. The support can include, but is not limited to: reviewing aircraft forms,
scheduling and briefing an FCF pilot/aircrew, scheduling airspace, and debriefing the FCF.
A24.19. (Added) FCF Requirements at off-Station Locations: Temporary certification requires
the OG/CC’s written approval if the necessity arises for an FCF while TDY. TDY FCFs will be
coordinated with the home station FCF OIC to ensure all local and AFI directed rules are
followed. This does not apply during a contingency deployment, where an FCF-certified pilot is
conducting the FCF.
A24.20. (Added) The flying squadron will:
A24.20.1. (Added) Approve the FCF (commander, or top three if the commander is not
available). The top three will be on duty for the duration of the flight.
A24.20.2. (Added) Add the FCF to the bottom of the local flight clearance flight order and (C-
130 and HH-60 only) file the appropriate flight plan.
 60                     AFI21-101_CAFSUP_DAVIS-MONTHANAFBSUP 14 JUNE 2012


A24.20.3. (Added-A) Have an FCF pilot available during the day from 0730 until 1930 (or
sunset, whichever is earlier). If an earlier FCF is desired/required, AMU must coordinate with
QA the day prior to ensure all requirements are complied with. FCF standby calendars are
published by the FCF OIC on a quarterly basis and distributed to affected flying squadrons. If
the designated flying squadron does not have an FCF pilot available, they will either take an FCF
pilot off the regular schedule or make arrangements with another squadron to cover the FCF
requirement for that day. Flying squadrons must notify QA of any changes to the published FCF
standby coverage.
A24.20.4. (Added-A) Provide a SOF in the Air Traffic Control tower for the entire FCF period
when an FCF is flown outside the normal flying window. This requirement may be waived on a
case-by-case basis by the 355 OG/CC and IAW AFI 11-418, Operation Supervision. The flying
squadron will also provide appropriate manning of operations personnel for the flight (ICO and
life support).
A24.21. (Added) Flight Requirements; FCF pilots/aircrews will:
A24.21.1. (Added) Sign out on the local flight clearance order in the flying squadron that owns
the aircraft.
A24.21.2. (Added) Follow all current guidance/procedures in the FCF SIIs.
A24.21.3. (Added) On initial A-10 FCFs, accomplish all FCF ground checks (TO TO 1A-10C-
6CF-1, sections I through VI) up to but not including TAXI. On subsequent FCF attempts,
ground checks only need to check the systems that will be tested in flight, along with any other
systems that failed the ground checks on the previous attempt. FCFs will not launch unless they
have successfully completed all ground checks required for that flight. First attempt FCFs,
regardless of planned profile, will plan to take-off on runway 12. Runway 30 departures may be
accomplished, but must be coordinated with 355 OG/CC for authorization.
A24.21.4. (Added) For A-10 FCFs the maximum allowable crosswind component is 25 knots,
or 15 knots if checking manual reversion. If TO 1-1-300 paragraph 6a waiver is required,
coordinate through OG/CC to acquire FW/CC approval.
