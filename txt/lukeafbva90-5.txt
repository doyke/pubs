                  FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE (FWA) PROGRAM
                        DEFINITIONS OF FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE

The Air Force Policy of FWA is outlined in AFPD 90-3, Inspector General--The Complaints Program.
It states that the Air Force uses all available means to prevent, detect, and correct instances of FWA. It
disciplines members involved in FWA activities as warranted and attempts to recoup FWA losses.

AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints defines all elements of FWA as follows:

FRAUD: Any intentional deception designed to unlawfully deprive the Air Force of something of
value or to secure from the Air Force for an individual a benefit, privilege, allowance, or consideration
to which he or she is not entitled. Such practices include, but are not limited to:

 The offer, payment, acceptance of bribes or gratuities or evading or corrupting inspectors or other
officials
 Making false statements, submitting false claims or using false weights of measures
 Deceit, either by suppressing the truth or misrepresenting material facts, or to deprive the Air Force
of something of value
 Adulterating or substituting materials, falsifying records and books of accounts
 Conspiring to carry out any of the above actions

Fraud also includes conflict of interest cases, criminal irregularities, and the unauthorized disclosure of
official information relating to procurement and disposal matters. This definition can include any theft
or diversion of resources for personal or commercial gain.

WASTE: The extravagant, careless, or needless expenditure of Air Force funds or the consumption of
Air Force property that results from deficient practices, systems, controls, or decisions. The term also
includes improper practices not involving prosecutable fraud. NOTE: Consider wartime and
emergency operations when explaining possible waste. For example, legitimate stockpiles and
reserves for wartime needs which may appear redundant and costly, are not waste.

ABUSE: Intentional, wrongful, or improper use of Air Force resources. Examples include misuse of
rank, position, or authority that causes the loss or misuse of resources such as tools, vehicles,
computers, or copy machines.

                           REPORTING FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE

AF members and civilian employees have a duty to promptly report FWA or gross mismanagement to
a supervisor, commander, an IG or other appropriate inspector.

Complainants should attempt to resolve the issues at the lowest possible level using command channels
before addressing them to a higher level or the IG.
