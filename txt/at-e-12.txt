                                            INTRODUCTION

This publication is designed to be used in conjunction with hands on training and classroom instruction to
train air traffic controllers on the operation of the AN/GPN- 22 (HI PAR). It may contain modifications
not applicable at your location. It does not replace TO 31P5-2GPN 24-11 (Operators Handbook) or
applicable maintenance technical orders which are the official directives for this equipment.


                                                GENERAL

The AN/GPN -22 detects and tracks aircraft approaching a runway for landing. The antenna is mounted on
a pedestal, permitting it to be rotated, up to 270 degrees. It is capable of providing service to any of four
pre-selected runways. Full precision coverage may be viewed continuously by final controllers. This
single radar system is actually two radars in one. It is a search radar which constantly scans the entire area
of coverage and a tracking radar capable of tracking as many as six targets simultaneously.

The HI PAR system generates data that displays the position of aircraft relative to the course and glide path
of a selected runway. The data displayed includes: normal video of aircraft in the antenna scan;
synthetically generated symbols designating the locations of up to six aircraft that can be tracked during
final approach; history of tracked aircraft over a 3 minute interval; and the glidepath, decision height and
safety zone markers specified for the selected runway. This handbook is divided into four chapters:

                                              OPERATION


                             SECTION A -RADAR SET CONTROL (RSC)

1. All controls located in the operations room are for use by controllers. They are designed so you can use
the system for maximum performance. There are three main components you need to be thoroughly
familiar with; the radar set control; display console; and trackball assembly. Each control or indicator will
be described briefly followed by a description of each particular lamp indication. The GPN -22 has several
unique control symbols which are described in this section. Get together with your trainer and go over the
equipment from top to bottom. Adjust the controls and see how they affect your presentation. Ask
questions and get to know your equipment.

2. The RSC is normally located above the PAR assistant position, between PAR #1 and #2. Since there is
only one RSC panel in the operations room, any adjustment or activation of the controls will affect both
PAR displays.

5. RUNWAY SELECT control is a four-position dial used to select one of four preset runways.

6. CCW-OFF-CW control is a three-position toggle switch used to rotate the HI-PAR antenna either
counter clockwise or clockwise to the selected runway. This control is spring loaded to the center position.

7. ANTENNA POSITION meter is used to determine when the HI-PAR antenna is roughly aligned to the
selected runway.

8. ANTENNA FINE POSITION meter is used to determine when the HI-PAR antenna is fine aligned to
the selected runway.

                           9. RDR CONT PAR/OPS indicator is a two-position lamp used

51. ACQUIRE TARGET control is a pushbutton lamp used to begin close control tracking of the target
over which the designate has been placed.

52. ELEV AZIMUTH control is a two position pushbutton lamp used to acquire in either elevation or
azimuth. By pressing the desired function, the designate symbol will appear on either elevation or azimuth.

CAUTION: When selecting the Azimuth designated acquisition mode, you will not be able to acquire the
reference reflector. The computer software supporting this mode will not allow the radar to search below
an elevation of one (1) degree. The reference reflector is located at 0.8 or 0.9 degrees.

53. PAR DES CENTER control is a pushbutton lamp used to return the designate symbol to the left edge
of the display. The left edge is considered the "idling" or centered position of the designate symbol.

54. BREAK TRACK control is a Pushbutton lamp used to terminate close control tracking of the selected
target. When the BREAK TRACK control is depressed, the close control target symbol and the history
trails will be canceled and the target will resume the status of an unselected target. The BREAK TRACK
control is used when the aircraft has landed.

55. TRACKBALL moves in all directions and is used to position the DESIGNATE SYMBOL on the
target selected for close control tracking.

                 57. Close Control Target Symbol. This symbol indicates the one tracked
                 target under final approach control by the final controller. Upon receipt of a track status
                 coast signal (loss of radar contact), this symbol begins to blink on and off.

                58. Tracked Target Symbol. This symbol indicates the position (range,
                elevation, and azimuth) of a tracked target not under close control.
                Upon receipt of a track status coast signal, this symbol begins to blink
                on and off.

               NOTE: This symbol indicates verified glide slope, decision height, Track Quality,
               Elevation Gusting Correction, Site Parameters and TDC-ABPC Data Bus faults. The
               tracked target symbol is as accurate as the close control target symbol.

          59. Reference Reflector Symbol. This symbol indicates the position of the reference
          reflector and is displayed in azimuth only.

          60. Designate Symbol. This symbol is used by the operator to select a target for tracking.
          The operator positions this symbol to correspond with the position of the desired target by
          rotating the trackball.



          61. Reference Symbol. This represents an elevation angle corresponding to touchdown. It is
          positioned at touchdown on the elevation display.

                                           CHAPTER 2

                                         PROCEDURES

1. PREOPERATION CHECKS. The following checks should be completed before controlling aircraft
on the HI-PAR. Check local directives for specific requirements.

       a. RADAR SET CONTROL

               (1) Depress LAMP TEST and check for burned out lamp bulbs.

               (2) Check TRANSMITTER indicator lamps for proper settings.

               (3) Check correct runway alignment on ANT FINE meter.

                       (a) Needle should be in green area or no more than + or - .5 degrees off, or

                       (b) Null indicator should read zero degrees (center position).

               (4) PAR Performance Check: Ensure your system is aligned and the radar
               track circuits are operating properly by performing a PAR Performance
               test as follows:

               NOTE: Ensure HISTORY INT is turned down to prevent burning the CRT.

                       (a) Ensure transmitter is in low power radiate.

                       (b) Select normal video.

                       (c) Press PAR PERF/TEST.

                       (d) Move the trackball designate symbol to the elevation and range
                       location of the fixed reference reflector and press ACQUIRE TARGET.
                       If the reference reflector is not acquired perform step e.

                       (e) Press MARG PERF TEST. This causes the test conditions (power
                       output) to be modified. If the reference reflector still cannot be
                       tracked, the PAR is unusable. After completing this check, be
                       certain to break track and press marginal PERF/TEST and PAR
                       PERF/TEST to cause the lower half of the lamp to go out; otherwise,
                       normal operations will not resume.

                       NOTE: A PAR performance check should be accomplished as soon as
                       possible after assuming responsibility of the position, and
                       periodically throughout your watch. Additionally, a check should
                       be made after a runway change and any time the equipment is
                       returned from maintenance.

               (5) Check TRACK MODE and verify both modes (NORM and BACKUP) are
               operational.

               (6) Ensure CLUTTER REJECT is set according to local requirements.

               (7) Adjust the RAIN REJ, RNG ADJ, VIDEO SELECT, and RNG GATE control
               for optimum presentation.




                                                                                                      25

        b. HI - PAR DISPLAY.

                 (1) Depress LAMP TEST and check for burned out lamp bulbs.

                 (2) Adjust RCVR GAIN to obtain optimum target strength.

                 (3) Adjust VIDEO GAIN by turning fully clockwise.

                 NOTE: RCVR and VIDEO GAIN must be used to prevent loss of primary target
                 returns. This is necessary to detect a shift in coincidence between the
                 primary target and control symbol and to detect traffic transitioning the PAR
                 coverage area not under your control.

                 (4) Select desired range on RANGE SELECT control.

                 (5) Verify/center display on CRT.

                 (6) Verify decision height.

                 (7) Verify glide slope.

2. RECEIVER ADJUSTMENTS. To obtain an optimum radar presentation, you should make use of all of
the various video signals available. Your selection should be based on the aircraft's Range and the fixed
and environmental conditions. Coherent MTI is normally gored out from touchdown to the limits of the
ground clutter. The noncoherent MTI video is selected for ranges where rain squalls are present. These
selections are made by adjusting the RAIN REJ, RNG ADJ, VIDEO SELECT AND RNG GATE controls
on the RSC.

3. SETTING AND VERIFYING THE GLIDE SLOPE. To set the glide slope for the runway in
use, the following steps are required:

       a. Set the desired glide slope in the GLIDE SLOPE COMMAND window. A 3-degree glide slope
       will appear in elevation and a blinking fault symbol will appear at the location given in Table 2-1.

       b. Depress the PAR DES CTR to place the designate symbol to the left edge of the display.

       c. To verify the glide slope setting, ensure the AZ -EL button is in the elevation position, and then
       depress the ACQUIRE TARGET button.

       (1) The new glide slope will appear in elevation.


       (2) Verification of the new setting will be displayed in elevation using the range marks as units of
       measure. The following will occur simultaneously:

       (a) The first digit (2-5) of the glide slope will appear on the corresponding range mark (IAW Table
       2-2). This will be a steady signal lasting 2.5 seconds.

       (b) The tenth portion of the glide slope (.0-.9) will also appear on its corresponding range mark
       (IAW Table 2-2). This will be a blinking track signal starting immediately after the steady signal
       and lasting 2.5 seconds. (The system will now automatically verify decision height).

       NOTE:
       1. This lets you know the new glide slope setting has been accepted into the system. If the
       blinking track fault symbol appears (IAW Table 2-1) on your display, the equipment is not set
       properly.

       2. If the glide slope setting is changed and not verified, it will automatically go to a 3-degree glide
       slope and indicate a fault. Each indicator must be verified separately.

       d. To verify the glide slope, repeat steps b. and c. of SETTING AND VERIFYING THE GLIDE
       SLOPE. Figure 2-6 shows an example of glide slope verification, you must observe that the
       symbols are on the range marks which correspond with the number of the desired glide path.

4. SETTING THE DECISION HEIGHT MARKER. To set the decision height marker for the runway in
use, the following steps are required:

      a. Set the desired decision height in the DECISION HEIGHT MARKER window. The decision
      height marker will change to the new setting and a blinking track fault symbol will appear at
      the location given in Table 2-1.

      b. Depress the PAR DES CTR switch to place the designate symbol to the left edge of the display.

      C. Depress the ACQUIRE TARGET Switch. The following will occur simu1taneously:

             (1) Verification of the new setting will be displayed.

              (2) The first 5 seconds wi1l verify the glide slope and then the decision height altitude will be
                   verified. The new decision height setting is verified in the same manner as the glide
slope.                       The hundreds digit, 0-800, will be a steady signal for 2.5 seconds. The tens
portion, 0-90,                       will be represented as a blinking signal lasting 2.5 seconds (see Table
2-2). This will verify                         that the decision height information has been properly set into
the system.

      d. To verify the decision height, repeat steps (2) and (3) of SETTING THE DECISION HEIGHT
      MARKER. Figure 2-l shows an example of decision height verification; you must observe that the
      symbols are on the range marks which correspond with the numbers of the desired decision height.

      NOTE: If the decision height setting is changed and not verified, it may automatically go to 100 feet
      and indicate a fault. Each indicator must be verified separately.

5. RUNWAY CHANGE PROCEDURES. To reposition the HI-PAR antenna to another pre-selected
runway, follow these steps:

       a. Set the RUNWAY SELECT dial to the desired runway (1, 2, 3, of 4).

       b. Place the transmitter in STBY or select PAR PERF/TEST.

       c. Use the CCW/OFF/CW toggle switch to rotate the antenna to the selected runway. Watch the
       ANTENNA POSITION meter until it indicates the correct antenna position.

       d. Continue holding the CCW/OFF/CW toggle switch until the antenna is centered. This is
       indicated when the ANTENNA FINE POSITION meter is centered.

       e. Perform a PAR performance check.

       NOTE: If the antenna position meters are inoperative, maintenance personnel must manually align
       the antenna through the bore sight. Maintenance must place the antenna movement switch in the
       local position to prevent accidental rotation from the remote position.

       f. Verify the glide path and decision height.

        NOTE: Ensure you select PAR PERFORMANCE TEST before antenna rotation. This will
        reduce the sidelobes and decrease the possibility of a sidelobe locking on the reflector.




WARNING: Failure to select PAR PERFORMANCE TEST before antenna rotation may cause
misalignment.

6. APPROACH LIGHTS/LANDING THRESHOLD IDENTIFICATION. Determine the position of
the approach lights and landing threshold by the following means:

      a. For management:

            (1) Have your unit TERPS specialist determine the position of the approach lights and
            landing threshold, then compute the altitude of an aircraft on glide path at both points and
            enter these altitudes in the Decision Height Marker.

            (2) Verify these points by flight check.

      b. For others:

            (1) Complete a facility indoctrination concerning the relation of these points in reference to
            your cursor and Decision Height Marker. Watch several runs and have your trainer point out
            these points on the indicator.

            (2) Refer to the photographs/diagrams contained in your position ready reference file.

NOTE: Do not mark on your indicator with grease pencil.

7. HI-PAR CONTROL TRANSFER. Use the following procedures to transfer control of the HI-PAR
radar between the OPS and HI-PAR segments:

      a. Transfer from HI-PAR to OPS segment:

            (1) Communicate by intercom with maintenance personnel in the HI-PAR segment.

            (2) Activate LOCKOUT REMOTE ENABLE.

            (3) Instruct the maintenance technician to activate the RDR CONT PAR/OPS pushbutton.
            The OPS section of the RDR CONT PAR/OPS will be lighted.

            (4) Activate the LOCKOUT REMOTE ENABLE pushbutton. The lamp should change from
            green to white indicating control of the radar is at the OPS segment.

      b. Transfer from OPS to HI -PAR segment:

            (1) Communicate by intercom with maintenance personnel in the HI-PAR segment.

            (2) Ensure transmitter status is the same at both PAR and OPS Radar Set Control (RCSs)
            before control is transferred.

            (3) Activate the LOCK OUT REMOTE ENABLE pushbutton.

            (4) Instruct the maintenance technician in the HI-PAR segment to activate the RDR CONT
            PAR/OPS pushbutton. The light should change from the OPS segment to the PAR segment
            on the RDR CONT PAR/OPS indicator. Control of the radar is now at the HI-PAR segment.

8. HOW TO ACQUIRE AND USE CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING.

     a. Determine which targets are to be selected for close control tracking.

     b. Observe upper (CHAN AVAIL) position of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ ACTIVE indicator. When
     upper portion of indicator is lighted attempting to acquire a target.

     CAUTION: If all channels are in use, you will be unable to verify the system. If a fault indication
     occurs, the sixth target acquired will lose all symbology and return to target scan video.

     c. Use the trackball to position the designate symbol in the path and slightly ahead of the selected
     target.

     d. When the position of the designate symbol is slightly ahead of the selected target, press the
     ACQUIRE TARGET button. The following will occur simultaneously:

            (1) ACQUIRE TARGET lamp will light green while depressed.

            (2) Lower (ACE ACTIVE) section of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ ACTIVE indicator will light
            green for approximately 4 seconds indicating the computer is responding to acquire target
            command.

            (3) Close control target symbol will be displayed on the leading edge of the target indicating
            the target is under close control tracking. NOTE: Coincidence of the close control target
            symbol and target can be adjusted by maintenance.

            (4) Target now under close control tracking will display history trail.

            (5) Any history trails previously on the display will be canceled.

            (6) If you used the last of the six channels available, both sections of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ
            ACTIVE indicator will extinguish.

     e. Adjust HISTORY INT control for desired intensity of the history trail.

     f. Determine whether FTC is needed.

     NOTE: Where problems exist because of high ground clutter, both MTI and FTC should be used.

     g. If close control target is within 15 NM, display range may be reduced to 15 or 8 NM range.

     h. If close control of target is self-terminated shortly after acquisition, attempt to reacquire the
     target; if unable, activate the BACKUP on the TRK MODE NORM/BACKUP CONTROL.
     Whether to continue without close control tracking symbology depends upon local policy.

     i. Select PAR PERFORMANCE 1, 2, or 3, for optimum target tracking:

            (1) The system will automatically start tracking on PAR PERFORMANCE 2. This provides
            a medium bandwidth for tracking targets under normal approach conditions. For optimum
            target strength you can select one of the other two available settings.

            (2) PAR PERFORMANCE 1 provides the maximum bandwidth for tracking maneuvering
            aircraft.




                                                                                                            37
AT-E-12                                                                                       1 January 2003

             (3) PAR PERFORMANCE 3 will provide a minimum bandwidth, which increases the track
             receiver signal to noise level on targets making low approaches in areas of clutter.

                 NOTE: The PAR PERFORMANCE setting selected for a particular target is retained,
                 even if CLOSE CONTROL is changed to another tracked target.

9. HI-PAR TARGET TRACKING PROCEDURE. The HI-PAR radar uses a target data computer to
track aircraft under close control. There are different procedures for disengaging close control tracking.
The first method, BREAK TRACK, is used to disengage close control tracking without transferring to
another target. The second method is the TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TO A
PREVIOUSLY UNSELECTED TARGET procedure. The term "unselected" refers to a target not under
tracked target status. The third method is the TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TARGET
procedure using the TRACK SEL button. Use of either of the two "transfer" procedures will cause the
target previously under close control to remain under track control. Use the following procedures to
acquire, control and disengage close control tracking:

      a. BREAK TRACK (CLOSE CONTROL SYMBOL). To break track of a target under close
      control, activate BREAK TRACK. The following will occur simultaneously:

             (1) BREAK TRACK lamp will light red while depressed.

             (2) Close control target symbol will not appear on display. Target formerly under close
             control will resume status of an unselected target. (Normal Radar Target).

             (3) History trails will be canceled.

             (4) Upper (CHAN AVAIL) section of CHAN AVAIL/ACQ ACTIVE will light, if
             previously extinguished.

      b. TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TO A PREVIOUSLY UNSELECTED
      TARGET:

             (1) Using trackball, position designate symbol in the path of the aircraft selected for close
             control tracking.

             (2) The close control target symbol will indicate the target is under close control tracking.

             (3) Target not previously under close control will assume status of a tracked target and will
             display as such.

             (4) Target now under close control tracking will display history trail.

             (5) To return close control tracking to a previously selected target, use the Track Select
             Control.

      c. TRANSFER OF CLOSE CONTROL TRACKING TO A TRACKED TARGET. Press TRACK
      SELECT pushbutton once. Target under close control may be one of up to five targets previously
      under track control. If target now under close control is not the target desired for close control,
      press track select until the selected tracked target is under close control.

10. FORMATION APPROACHES. The GPN-22 is a leading edge tracking system, which allows the
close control track symbol to be assigned to the aircraft closest to the radar antenna regardless of its
position within the flight (lead, #2, etc). During formation approaches, be prepared for one of the
situations illustrated in figure 2-9 or 2-10. Your actions in either case should normally be limited to one of
the following:

      a. Time permitting, acquire the remaining aircraft on final.

      b. Terminate the approach when advised of a "go around" or "missed approach."

                                                 CHAPTER 3

                                     EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS

1. The following HI-PAR failure and malfunction procedures are in addition to those in Chapter I.

       a. Erratic tracking due to suspected computer program errors.

       SOLUTION: Press TDC-INIT. This will cause all tracked targets to revert to an untracked status.
       If program errors are not eliminated notify maintenance. Verify indicator alignment/status.

       b. Erratic or loss of radar on one display.

       SOLUTION: Turn MODE-OFF/PAR FCTN off. Transfer aircraft responsibility to another
       controller if possible. Notify maintenance.

2. FAULT DETECTION: The operational program for the radar set includes a fault detection capability
to warn of either a change or error in certain critical reference data or a data bus fault. The position of the
symbol on the display specifies which condition has been detected (See Table 3-1).

       a. SITE PARAMETER FAULT: A site parameter (s) received by TDC is different from that
       entered in site parameter panel when system was initialized.

       b. GLIDE SLOPE/DECISION HEIGHT CHANGE: Indicates a change in glide slope angle or
       decision height. You should determine what glide slope and decision height are actually now
       present to make certain that the change is valid. If there has been a glide slope data failure, an
       automatic fault symbol and a 3 degree glide slope is displayed.

       c. ELEVATION GUSTING CORRECTION FAULT: If a difference of 0.2 degree or more of
       elevation angle data is detected between reflector elevation angle as derived from vertical sensor and
       track reference reflector data, a fault exists. If the error is 0.2 to 0.3 degree the flashing symbol is
       shown. If the error exceeds 0.3 degree the glide slope cursor is automatically switched to 0 degree
       elevation angle and precision approach activities must be terminated immediately since elevation
       angle information is no longer available.

       d. REFERENCE TRACK QUALITY: A fault exists if there is a low alarm rate (low track
       reflector detection rate), or a large error exists in range, azimuth, or elevation of track reference
       reflector.

       e. DATA BUS FAULT: A failure in data transfer between the TDC and ABPC on the data
       interface bus in the radar set. This is checked automatically by a periodically repeated echo test
       which determines if data entered into the ABPC can be retrieved by the TDC unchanged.




                                                                                                               41
