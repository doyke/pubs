1. SCOPE.
  1.1. Operating from Base Operations, building 1220, the 452 OSS/OSAW provides weather
  services to the 452d Air Mobility Wing (AMW), the 163d Reconnaissance Wing (RW), U.S.
  Customs, Detachment 1, 144th Fighter Wing (FW), transients, federal agencies and U.S.
  government contractors assigned to, working on, or operating from, March Air Reserve Base
  (MARB). The Base Weather Station (EU) provides surface weather observations; mission
  execution forecasts; observed weather watches, warnings and advisories; pilot-to-metro-
  service; climatic and environmental services; meteorological assessments for plans and
  operations; and staff weather support and terminal aerodrome forecasts (issued by 25 OWS,
  Davis-Monthan AFB AZ); flight weather briefings and weather forecasts (25 OWS).
     1.1.1. Agencies requiring special weather support should contact the EU to coordinate
     support requirements and provide any pertinent details as early as possible (72 hours
     notice is preferred). Agencies requiring recurring support should contact the weather
     supervisor (DSN 447-5114). Users should pick up special products that cannot be
     disseminated via JET, email or fax at the weather station in building 1220.
     1.1.2. Adequate notice and close coordination are essential for optimal support. The EU
     must be kept informed of all changes to the weather sensitivities of assigned aircraft,
     weapons and guidance systems, as well as any other weather criterion affecting
     operations.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES.
  2.1. Duty Priorities. Weather personnel can become task saturated at times; e.g., sudden
  onset of severe weather, tropical storms, etc. To assist unit personnel in prioritization of
  customer support during such situations, principal duty priorities are defined below and
  posted in the workplace. Forecasters and observers will adhere to, and supported agencies
  should have an understanding of, these priorities.
     2.1.1. Perform Emergency War Order (EWO) taskings.
     2.1.2. Execute EU Evacuation.
     2.1.3. Respond to aircraft and ground emergencies.
     2.1.4. Provide products and services in support of combat operations, contingency
     operations and military operations other than war (MOOTW).
     2.1.5. Respond to Pilot to Metro Service Airborne Aircrew Support (PMSV/phone
     patch).
     2.1.6. Augment AN/FMQ-19 observations for mandatory elements.
     2.1.7. Provide “Eyes Forward” support to OWS.

       (climatology, plain language requests).
       2.1.14. Accomplish weather training as required.
       2.1.15. Accomplish other routine weather support/administrative tasks.
    2.2. Capabilities and Limitations.
       2.2.1. The 25 OWS, Davis-Monthan AFB AZ, issues operational forecasts valid for 30
       hours. Beyond 30 hours, forecasts are intended for planning purposes only. Forecasts or
       outlooks beyond 2 days are largely based on medium and long-range forecast models,
       which decrease in accuracy with time.
       2.2.2. Surface Weather Observing Limitations:
           2.2.2.1. Observations taken from building 1220 do not allow the observer to see the
           entire aerodrome. The 14-end (northwest) of the runway is limited due to aircraft and
           aircraft hangars. Visibility on the 32-end (southeast) of the runway is limited due to
           blast fences and aircraft.
           2.2.2.2. High intensity night security lights on the flight line reflect from heavy haze
           and/or fog, further limiting nighttime visual observing. There are no limitations of
           airfield weather sensors.
           2.2.2.3. In the event that a plane is parked over the observation point (during manual
           observing operations), the airfield services personnel will move to the safest location
           possible without interfering with aircraft operations or endangering themselves while
           taking an observation.
       2.2.3. Weather Station Evacuation (Alternate Observing Location (AOL))
           2.2.3.1. Building 385 is designated as the alternate observing location.
           2.2.3.2. Weather personnel can be contacted via landline at 655-2428/Fax 655-7683
           2.2.3.3. Observations taken from building 385 do not allow the observer to see the
           entire aerodrome. The 14-end (northwest) of the runway is limited due to aircraft and
           aircraft hangars. Visibility on the 32-end (southeast) of the runway is limited due to
           blast fences and aircraft.

                    and Warnings Only)
3. AIRFIELD SUPPORT FUNCTION.
   3.1. General. The weather station is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, including
   federal holidays. The AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Station is the primary source
   of weather data. The AN/FMQ-19 then takes the data and transmits it to the JET Weather
   System. Weather observations are automatically derived using complex algorithms and,
   during favorable weather conditions, transmitted locally and longline automatically. During
   inclement weather, the weather technician may augment the observation to ensure accuracy
   (See Cooperative Weather Watch and Summary of Mandatory Weather Conditions). The
   weather technician will augment the AN/FMQ-19 by implementing supplementation (when
   weather is beyond the capabilities of the system to detect or report) or back-up procedures
   (when the equipment is not functioning).
   3.2. Measurement of Observed Elements.        The following elements are measured and
   disseminated for use by various equipment/personnel:
      3.2.1. Sky Condition. The sky condition is an assessment of clouds and atmospheric
      phenomena aloft consisting of an amount, in eighths, and height of the cloud layer base
      above ground level. Heights of layers up to 12,000 feet can be measured using the Laser
      Beam Ceilometer. When a measurement cannot be obtained, heights will be estimated.
      Local pilot reports (PIREPs), radar data, ground-based structures and other surface
      weather observations in the area will be used as aids in estimating cloud layer bases.
      3.2.2. Prevailing Visibility and Obstructions to Vision.         Prevailing visibility is the
      greatest visibility equaled or exceeded in at least half of the horizon circle and is reported
      in statute miles (SM). Prevailing visibility is determined by evaluating the clarity of line
      of sight visibility to landmarks (i.e., buildings, unfocused lights, markers, etc.) of known
      distances. Obstructions to vision will be reported only when the prevailing visibility is
      less than 7 miles. Precipitation of any type is reported whenever it occurs at the station
      (within 5SM), or in the vicinity (5-10SM) of the center of the runway complex.
      3.2.3. Tower Visibility. Air Traffic Control (ATC) regulations require task certified
      control tower personnel to make tower prevailing visibility observations when the
      prevailing visibility at the usual point of observation, or at the tower level, is less than 4
      miles. Control tower personnel task certified to take visibility observations are instructed
      by their agency to notify the EU technician when the observed tower prevailing visibility
      decreases to less than, or increases to equal or exceed 4 Statute miles (SM).
      3.2.4. All elements of the surface weather observation (cloud heights, sky condition,
      visibility, RVR, weather, obstruction to visibility, temperature, dewpoint and pressure
      readings) are evaluated by the AN/FMQ-19 sensors. During periods when the AN/FMQ-
 8                                                 MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013


        19 is not functioning and observations are being taken manually, all elements will be
        visually observed by the duty technician and readings from the Kestrel 4500 or other
        approved backup equipment will be used. Runway Visual Range will not be available.
     3.3. Types of Observations. There are two types of observations taken and disseminated via
     JET.
        3.3.1. METAR is a routine scheduled observation as well as the primary observation
        code used by the United States to satisfy requirements for reporting surface
        meteorological data. Complete observations are taken every hour between 55 and 59
        minutes past the hour. METAR observations are recorded on AF FORM 3813 and
        disseminated both longline and locally.

   3.5. Summary of Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions. Supplementing is a
   method of manually adding meteorological information to an automated observation that is
   beyond the capabilities of the AN/FMQ-19 to detect and/or report. The following are
   mandatory weather conditions that must be supplemented:
      3.5.1. Tornadic Activity (to include Tornadoes, Funnel Clouds and Waterspouts).
      Weather personnel will supplement the observation anytime this weather phenomenon is
      observed to begin (first seen), is in progress or disappears (ends).
      3.5.2. Hail is observed to begin (and is ¼ inch or greater in size), is in progress or ends.
      3.5.3. Volcanic ash will be reported whenever it is observed, regardless of the visibility.
      3.5.4. Sand storms and/or dust storms will be reported whenever the phenomenon is
      observed and meets the requirement for a weather warning to be issued.
      3.5.5. When snow of any accumulation is observed, and the Warning is issued, snow
      depth will be reported IAW AFMAN 15-111.
   3.6. Summary of Backup of the AN/FMQ-19. Backup is manually providing weather data
   and/or disseminating a JET generated observation when the primary automated method is not
   operational or unavailable due to individual sensor(s), system or communications failure.
4. MISSION SERVICES.
   4.1. General. The EU provides forecasting support 24/7 (only as backup to the 25 OWS as
   part of the COOP program). Forecast services consist of TAFs (25 OWS), flight weather
 12                                               MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013


   briefings, PMSV and forecast (25 OWS) and observed (EU) weather watches, warnings and
   advisories.
   4.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF).
      4.2.1. TAFs will be issued for a 30 hour period at 1200, 2000 and 0400 hours locally by
      the 25OWS, Davis-Monthan AFB AZ. TAFs will be disseminated locally and longline
      via JET. The EU will serve as the primary backup and assume the TAF responsibilities
      whenever the OWS is unable to perform its function. Forecasts focus on the area within
      five nautical miles of the center of the runway complex.
      4.2.2. TAF Format. The following is a labeled example of the forecast format as seen on
      local disseminations. Questions regarding specific forecast elements can be directed to
      EU.

     4.3.1. Flight weather briefings should be requested at least 2 hours in advance and are
     posted to the “Info” Drive or provided at the weather counter by phone, fax or email or
     by Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) for TACC controlled missions. Unscheduled
     flight weather briefings may experience delays of 15 minutes to an hour just to prepare,
     depending on location and complexity of the mission and may also be delayed by higher
     priority duties. Out-of-station mass briefings for special missions require 24 hours
     advance notice, are subject to staffing availability and must be coordinated with the
     weather station supervisor (655-5114).
     4.3.2. Mission Weather Products (MWPs). The MWP will be issued twice daily as part
     of the Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP), based on the daily flight schedule
     valid at 12Z and 20Z. An MWP will also be produced should 24-hour operations be
     necessary at 04Z.
     4.3.3. MWPs will be posted to the Wing INFO drive three hours prior to departure.
     Aircrew Commanders may also have the MWPs sent to email or faxed as necessary.
     4.3.4. Route and flight MISSIONWATCH is provided by the forecaster continuously
     monitoring weather conditions affecting, or having the potential to affect, base resources,
     flight operations, special missions and/or VIP arrivals/departures at March ARB. If a
     significant change to en route, range or landing weather is observed or forecast, the duty
     forecaster will make every effort to relay the changes to the appropriate individuals. This
     will be done via the most expeditious means (i.e., Control Tower, 452d Ops, Command
     Post, etc.).
  4.4. PMSV. The EU provides PMSV support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on assigned
  frequency 239.8 MHz. The EU will provide current weather and flight weather briefing
  updates over the PMSV, but will not provide initial flight weather briefings over the PMSV.
  Aircrews are encouraged to relay pilot reports during PMSV contacts.
  4.5. PIREPs. PIREPs are an important source of weather information provided by aircrews
  operating throughout the local area. PIREPs which have operational significance are
  disseminated. All pilots are encouraged to provide PIREPs. The following is a labeled
  example of the pilot report format as seen locally. Note that a solidus separates each data
  field. Questions regarding specific PIREP data fields can be directed to the EU.

Figure 3. Chart 3.




   4.6. Climatology. The EU provides a wide assortment of climatology data. Climatology
   requests are usually filled by using station-specific operational climatic data summaries.
   Unit-specific requests for actual past weather and tailor-made graphic climatology are
   available upon request; however, it may take 7 to 10 duty days to acquire the information
   from the Strategic Climatic Information Service (14 WS), in Ashville, NC. EU personnel will
   request specialized data from the 25 OWS, AFWA, or 14 WS, etc.
      4.6.1. Copies of each day’s local weather observations are retained in the EU for three
      months, or as required by Air Force instruction. The data may be used to provide specific
      support upon request of a customer.
   4.7. Out-of-Station Briefings. The EU provides briefings for customers at various locations
   around the base. Some briefings are a regular occurrence and others are arranged to fulfill
   needs for special events. If customers require a non-scheduled out-of-station weather brief,
   coordination is required with the weather supervisor with at least 24 hours advance
   notification.
      4.7.1. Instrument Refresher Course. A review of weather codes, products and hazards
      for pilots is briefed in this course as requested. The course content is requested and
      coordinated through the weather supervisor.
      4.7.2. Deployment Concept Brief. The EU provides forecasts for staging bases and
      climatology for final destinations in support of contingency operations or exercises upon
      request.
      4.7.3. Crisis Action Team (CAT). The CAT recall is determined by the wing
      commander. The EU is a stand-by member of the CAT. The EU representative reports to
      the CAT only when requested to attend. The EU briefer will brief current weather
      conditions, a forecast for March ARB and coordinate any other special weather support
      or weather data, such as hurricane forecasts, to the wing leadership.

     4.7.4. Coordinated Weather Operations. Coordinated weather operations ensure all
     technicians, war fighters, and decision makers receive the weather information they need
     at the right time. It also ensures a coherent set of weather data is used at all command
     levels. The weather supervisor, or his designated representative, will act as the Lead
     Weather Unit (LWU) point of contact for the EU to coordinate on how to provide
     weather services to missions involving more than one unit or service and when March
     flying customers operate away from home base.
        4.7.4.1. Aircrew and weather personnel should use the guidance provided below to
        determine the primary weather information provider for those missions that are not
        multi-unit tasked. Aircrew and weather personnel should use Figure 4. Chart 4. to
        determine the primary weather information provider of the multi-unit portion of a
        particular mission.
            4.7.4.1.1. March Crews Departing Home Station. These are crews assigned to the
            452d Air Mobility Wing.
            4.7.4.1.2. March Crews Not Departing Home Station. While off-station (in-
            transit), March aircrews should contact the Operation Weather Squadron (OWS)
            assigned with the geographic responsibility covering the departure location IAW
            Flight Information Handbook Part C. An OWS desires two-hour notice prior to
            briefing delivery.
            4.7.4.1.3. Non-March Crews Departing March ARB (Transient). These crews
            (USAF, USA, USN, USMC, USCG, Guard, Reserve, Civil and International) will
            utilize the Weather Flight assets, duty priorities permitting. In the event the EU
            cannot provide required services, the 25 OWS should be contacted for flight
            weather services. The 25 OWS desires a two-hour notice prior to briefing
            delivery. The March ARB EU will maintain instructions near the Flight Planning
            Room.
            4.7.4.1.4. AMC Flight Managed Sorties. All Integrated Flight Management
            sorties receive flight information from the 618 AOC (TACC). Flight managed
            aircrews should work through their assigned flight manager to resolve weather
            issues/concerns. A team of experienced forecasters work directly with flight
            managers in the TACC AOC. The March EU updates takeoff weather and
            provides access to weather products upon request. All Coronet tanker support
            missions are under 618 AOC (TACC). Note: Details regarding mission limiting
            weather must be worked in concert with the TACC (DSN 779-0308).
            4.7.4.1.5. Air Refueling (AR) Sorties. The Mission Weather unit servicing the
            lead receiving aircraft unit is the LWU for, and provider of, the AR portion of a
            mission forecast. In some cases, such as ANG and AFR units, an OWS is the
            assigned weather unit. In other cases, command and control (C2) mission
            visibility is limited and the receiver’s weather unit cannot be readily determined.
            In these cases, and others similar, the March EU should ensure departing March
            crews have the information they need to complete AR missions.

      4.8. Forecast Process.
         4.8.1. Shift Change and Meteorological Discussion. This discussion provides continuity
         between shifts. Weather technicians relate their assessment of forecast products and
         thoughts on the current forecast as well as brief how they have used the 8-step MEFP to
         create the MWP. Current observation, weather situation and trends and equipment status
         will be discussed.
         4.8.2. Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP). This program will lead weather
         technicians through a logical thought process to generate the March MWP. It
         encompasses weather regime, climatology, support units’ sensitivities and mission of day
         and utilizes the MWP Worksheet and 25 OWS Worksheet to organize data interpretation.
         4.8.3. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH)/Mission-Scale Meteorological Watch
         (MISSION WATCH (Figure 5. Chart 5.)). Weather technicians monitor weather
         conditions at the base, in flying training areas and at other locations to ensure weather
         conditions are occurring as expected. Weather technicians will METWATCH for
         situational awareness and update the MWP at a minimum of every two hours, or as
         weather impacts dictate, and issue Watches, Warnings and Advisories, as necessary, to
         inform supported units of hazards. 452 OSS/OSAW technicians provide an “eyes
         forward” role for the 25 OWS.

Figure 5. Chart 5 ORM MISSIONWATCH Procedures.
1) Determine the mission(s) placed at risk due to terrestrial or space weather conditions.
2) Continuously monitor at risk mission routes, areas, installations, etc., for significant changes.
   Spot-check low risk missions.
3) Focus on mission-limiting weather thresholds for specific missions.
MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 19


4) Evaluate for change in risk category and reprioritize MISSIONWATCH as appropriate. Notify
   operational users of weather conditions crossing mission-limiting thresholds.
5) Integrate weather impacts into operational alternatives decision process.
6) Update MWPs as necessary
7) Continue to monitor missions based on MISSIONWATCH threat.
5. WEATHER WARNINGS, WATCHES AND ADVISORIES.
   5.1. General. 25 OWS and 452 OSS/OSAW weather personnel generate and relay all
   official hazardous weather bulletins for March ARB. Customer requirements and Air Force
   instructions drive the criteria for these notices. Customers execute actions outlined in their
   response checklists to prepare for, survive and recover from severe weather events. Once
   issued, a weather notice is valid until it is canceled or the specified valid period expires.
       5.1.1. Weather Watch. A special notice to supported agencies alerting them of the
       potential for weather conditions of intensity to pose a hazard to life or property. Watches
       apply to an area within 5 NM from the center of the airfield.
       5.1.2. Weather Warning. A special notice to supported agencies giving them advance
       notification of weather conditions of such intensity to pose a hazard to life or property for
       which the agencies must take protective action. Warnings apply to an area within 5 NM
       of the center of the airfield.
       5.1.3. Observed Weather Warning. A special notice to supported agencies giving them
       notification that weather conditions of intensity to pose a hazard to property or life are
       occurring within 5 NM from the center of the airfield.
       5.1.4. Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA). A special notice to supported agencies giving
       them advance notification (with sufficient time to allow protective actions to be taken) of
       mission limiting, non-severe conditions expected to directly affect an area within 5 NM
       from the center of the airfield.
       5.1.5. Observed Weather Advisory. A special notice provided to supported agencies
       which notifies them of non-severe weather conditions occurring within 5NM from the
       center of the airfield that could affect their operations.
   5.2. Weather Warnings, Watches and Advisories. Forecasted (25 OWS) and observed (EU)
   weather watches, warnings and advisories are issued 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The EU
   will serve as the primary backup and assume weather watch, warning and forecast advisory
   responsibilities whenever the 25 OWS is unable to perform its function.
   5.3. Issuance, Amendments, Extensions. Weather personnel issue, amend, extend, upgrade
   and downgrade weather watches, warnings and advisories for March ARB, encompassing an
   area not greater than 5 nautical miles, except as noted, from the center of the runway
   complex.
       5.3.1. All forecasted (25 OWS) and observed (EU) weather watches, warnings and
       advisories will be disseminated over JET to the Command Post (verbal backup), and
       ATC/GCA (through AFAS with verbal backup).
       5.3.2. Except for an observed lightning warning, only one warning will be in effect at a
       time and it will include all elements which meet warning criteria.

     5.3.3. In the case of a warning for strong winds, the text will include the peak wind
     expected during the valid period.
     5.3.4. In the case of observed lightning warnings and all the observed advisories, the
     valid period may be transmitted as “UFN’ meaning “until further notice.”
     5.3.5. More than one advisory may be in effect at any given time.
     5.3.6. All newly issued watches, warnings and advisories will state, in the text, their
     effect on any previously issued watches, warnings and advisories.
     5.3.7. Extensions will be issued prior to the original product’s expiration and can only
     change the ending valid time.

   5.10. Dissemination and Notification.
22                                            MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013


     5.10.1. All weather watches, warnings and advisories will be disseminated locally and
     longline over JET.
     5.10.2. After dissemination over JET, weather personnel will initiate follow-up calls to
     ensure product receipt by the followings agencies:
         5.10.2.1. Command Post and Base Operations.
         5.10.2.2. The above agencies will relay watches, warnings and advisories to other
         agencies, in accordance with their unit specific notification requirements (QRC).
  5.11. Smog Episodes. The term “smog” was originally coined to describe a combination of
  smoke and fog in the atmosphere. More recently, it has been applied to a mixture of
  pollutants from automobiles and industrial wastes and their reaction to products having
  accumulated in the atmosphere to the point of being noticed visually. The South Coast Air
  Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is responsible for air pollution control, forecast
  and enforcement of air pollution control laws for the Los Angeles Basin.
     5.11.1. Notification. When a Stage 1 Episode or higher is issued, the weather station
     will notify the 452 AMW and 163 RW Command Posts, who will notify their appropriate
     personnel.
     5.11.2. The following explains Stage 1 or higher episodes and Air Quality Index (AQI):
         5.11.2.1. Stage 1- Unhealthy (AQI 151-200). Everyone may begin to experience
         health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health
         effects.
         5.11.2.2. Stage 2 - Very Unhealthy (AQI 201-300). Health alert: everyone may
         experience more serious health effects.
         5.11.2.3. Stage 3 - Hazardous (AQI 301-500). Health warnings of emergency
         conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.
  5.12. Hurricane Conditions.
     5.12.1. Hurricane Conditions (HURCON). Special forecasts for high winds associated
     with hurricanes or tropical storms. When storms threaten Southern California, the 452
     AMW/CC declares HURCON levels based on information provided by EU personnel.
         5.12.1.1. HURCON IV - Declared 72 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot or greater
         winds.
         5.12.1.2. HURCON III - Declared 48 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot or greater
         winds.
         5.12.1.3. HURCON II - Declared 24 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot or greater
         winds.
         5.12.1.4. HURCON I - Declared 12 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot or greater
         winds.

     will be disseminated as outlined in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
     6.1.9. MISSIONWATCH. The EU will maintain a MISSIONWATCH tailored to the
     mission(s) of the day. The weather technician will monitor each mission to ensure the
     most accurate weather information is provided. Upon detecting a significant un-forecast
     change based on a mission-limiting weather threshold (see Figure 7, Chart 7) affecting
     the operation, the technician will amend the forecast, contact the customer and then
     inform the OWS (if an OWS product contributed to the un-forecast conditions).

28                                               MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013


  10.1. The purpose of the SWAP is to ensure weather station management is notified and
  responds to potential and/or actual severe weather events within the March ARB area of
  responsibility. 452 OSS/OSAW weather technicians will recall the March ARB Severe
  Weather Action Team (SWAT) when the 25OWS issues a watch or warning for severe
  weather, but not sooner than 4 hours prior to the anticipated start of the severe weather event.
  For the purposes of this document, severe weather is defined as the occurrence or expected
  occurrence of the criterion listed below. The SWAT Leader is the final authority on decisions
  regarding the time and extent of the SWAT’s involvement in managing the severe weather
  event. The SWAT Leader will coordinate the team during the severe weather event. The
  SWAT Leader will keep wing leadership and the 25 OWS informed of current and forecast
  weather conditions, ensure that all weather products are horizontally consistent, contact the
  452d Command Post to provide timely OPREP-3 information and provide forecasting
  assistance as required.
11. SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT.
  11.1. General. Space environmental conditions affecting the mission at March ARB will
  become more apparent as older aircraft are modernized or replaced by more sophisticated
  systems. Today, the most significant impact is interference with ultra-high frequency (UHF)
  communications. All MWP products will incorporate any space effects expected on
  scheduled missions.
12. SEVERE WEATHER READINESS.
  12.1. General. AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather Events, outlines actions that will
  be taken to prepare for and recover from severe weather. The wing commander will chair
  meetings as required, but not less than annually, to review installation severe weather
  preparedness, capabilities, requirements and procedures. These meetings will be attended by
  representatives of base agencies responsible for developing protective action plans, EU,
  Guard and Reserve components, tenant organizations, local off-base units and other
  organizations with severe weather notification requirements (e.g., Safety, CE Readiness and
  Emergency Management). Other attendees will include agencies responsible for information
  dissemination (e.g., Communications Squadron, Base Operations, MOC and Command
  Post). Meetings will address, at a minimum, the following:
     12.1.1. Severe weather observing and forecasting capabilities and corresponding user
     requirements to identify the weather phenomena for which notification is required, to
     include threshold values and desired lead-times.
     12.1.2. Adequacy of dissemination procedures, both primary and backup.
     12.1.3. Adequacy of protective action procedures and resources.
     12.1.4. Adequacy of severe weather awareness training and exercise procedures.
  12.2. Information Dissemination. The installation commander will ensure EUs are required
  to telephonically contact as few agencies as possible to relay severe weather information. The
  use of a pyramid-type reporting system should be employed whenever possible and
  maximum use of technology is encouraged (i.e., use of local notification systems, email) to
  facilitate the relay of information.
MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                           29


  12.3. Exercises. Exercises, tailored to upcoming seasonal severe weather concerns, will be
  conducted semiannually. This semiannual exercise will be conducted with the 25 OWS as
  well as base EET personnel. The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate the timeliness of
  notification of personnel and response capability to severe weather events for base agencies
  to ensure validity of planned responses to severe weather. These exercises may be integrated
  with base Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan exercises. Real world severe
  weather events meet this requirement, if properly evaluated and documented, to include
  lessons learned.
  12.4. OPREP-3 Reporting. The EU will submit OPREP-3 reports to the 452 CP in
  accordance with AFI 10-229; AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting; AFMAN 15-129; and unit
  SOPs.
     12.4.1. When the following significant weather occurs and results in damage:
         12.4.1.1. Winds 50 knots or greater (to include gusts).
         12.4.1.2. Hail ¾ inch or larger.
         12.4.1.3. Tornadoes.
         12.4.1.4. Lightning strikes.
     12.4.2. An earthquake, flood, volcanic eruption or any other natural phenomenon that
     may impair the operational capability of an official Air Force activity.
     12.4.3. The EU is responsible for notification of the reported weather event OPREP-3 to
     the 25 OWS and parent MAJCOM Functional Manager as soon as is practical.
13. KEY RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE 452D AIR MOBILITY WING.
  13.1. Weather Radar (WSR-88D) Customers.
     13.1.1. The Unit Control Position (UCP) for the WSR-88D is operated by the NWS at
     San Diego, California.
     13.1.2. Maintenance. The NWS attempts all possible resets of NEXRAD equipment
     from the UCP. All maintenance will be conducted by the National Weather Service.
  13.2. The 25th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) will provide support as outlined in the
  current Installation Data Sheet between the 452 OSS/OSAW and the 25 OWS.

Terms
Aircraft Mishap— Used to denote the occurrence of an aircraft accident or incident. It does not
include in-flight emergencies.
Joint Environmental Tool Kit (JET)— The new weather dissemination system.
Basic Weather Watch (BWW).—Forecasters will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not
to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI
observation when any of the following conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to
occur within 1 hour: ceiling forms below, decreases to less than, dissipates or increases to equal
or exceed 1,500 feet: visibility decreases to less than, increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4,800
meters); precipitation (any form); thunderstorms; or fog or mist.
Ceiling— The height above ground level of the lowest broken (5/8ths coverage or more) or
overcast (8/8ths coverage) cloud layer or the vertical visibility into an indefinite ceiling.
Continuous Weather Watch (CWW)— At automated Weather Flights, the observing system
performs an automatic CWW, but if in augmentation, the EU will continuously monitor weather
conditions under a CWW.
MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                33


Cooperative Weather Watch— The name given to the cooperative effort between weather and
control tower personnel, in identifying significant weather changes. Due to the forecaster’s
limited view of the horizon and the need to perform other duties, tower personnel notify the
forecaster of the occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions which could affect
flight safety or could be critical to the safety of other local operations and resources.
Desired Lead Time— The amount of advance notice an agency requires prior to the onset of a
particular weather phenomenon.
Indefinite Ceiling— The vertical visibility, reported in feet, into a surface based total
obscuration which hides the celestial dome (8/8ths coverage).
METWATCH— The process of monitoring the weather and informing designated agencies
when certain weather conditions could impact operations or pose a hazard to life or property.
Mission Execution Forecast— A forecast used for the execution of a specific military mission
or activity.
MISSIONWATCH— Is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space
environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors.
Planning Forecast— A forecast usually provided well in advance, for the planning of a military
mission or activity. This forecast is intended solely for mission planning only and should never
be used for operational purposes.
Prevailing Visibility— The greatest visibility equaled or exceeded throughout at least one-half
the horizon circle. The visibility does not have to be continuous throughout 180 consecutive
degrees; i.e., it may be composed of sectors distributed anywhere around the horizon circle.
Runway Visual Range (RVR)— The maximum distance at which the runway, or specified
lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a specified point on its center
line at a height corresponding to the average eye level of pilots at touch-down.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) – The TAF is the summation of the 30-hour projected
forecast. Pertinent data and meteorological reasoning are combined into a concise text
depiction of what the atmosphere is expected to do for a 30-hour period. The TAF is used
primarily to support flight operations and general base activities.
Weather Advisory (WA)— A special notice provided to supported customers that alerts them to
weather conditions that could affect their operation.
Weather Warning (WW)— A special notice provided to supported customers that alerts them
to weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property.
Weather Watch (WATCH)— A special notice issued to advise affected agencies of the
potential for warning level weather conditions before actually issuing the warning.

     receipt of a differing control tower value and upon receipt of subsequent reportable
     changes at the control tower level.
  A2.4.2. Weather Personnel shall:
     A2.4.2.1. Notify the control tower, as soon as possible, via the hotline or commercial
     telephone, whenever the AN/FMQ-19, or the duty METECH determine that the
     prevailing or sector visibility at the sensors, or point of observation, decreases to less than
     or increases to equal or exceeds 4 statute miles (6,000 meters).
     A2.4.2.2. Monitor the AN/FMQ-19 readings and perform Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) based augmentation procedures and clearly defined duty priorities that include
     augmentation. In all cases, the highest priority will be flight safety. If required, manually
     reevaluate surface prevailing or sector visibility, as soon as practical, upon receipt of a
     differing tower visibility value and upon receipt of subsequent reportable tower visibility
     value changes.
A2.5. LOCAL WEATHER FAMILIARIZATION TRAINING.
  A2.5.1. The Weather Station Supervisor shall:
     A2.5.1.1. Ensure there is a viable local weather familiarization program available to all
     ATC personnel upon initial hire to include both a written evaluation (minimum passing
     score of 80%) and hands- on practical evaluation. Results of the evaluations shall be
     forwarded to the ATC Training and Standardization Manager (ATM/TSM) for entry on
     the AF FORM 1098.
A2.6. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR WEATHER TEAM
OPERATIONS.
  A2.6.1. Control Tower Personnel shall:
     A2.6.1.1. Assist March Weather Team in soliciting Pilot Reports (PIREPs) that affect
     local operations. PIREP information shall be forwarded to the Weather Team in a timely
     manner for their use and any required further dissemination.

     A2.6.1.2. Notify the Weather Team via hotline or commercial telephone whenever any
     of the following weather conditions exists:
        A2.6.1.2.1. Tornadoes or funnel clouds are seen.
        A2.6.1.2.2. Lightning is seen or thunder is heard.
        A2.6.1.2.3. Precipitation begins or ends.
        A2.6.1.2.4. Cloud ceiling appears, or is reported by aircraft, to be different from the
        latest weather observation.
        A2.6.1.2.5. Hazardous weather conditions are encountered by aircraft approaching or
        departing March ARB; i.e., turbulence, slant range visibility, icing, etc.
        A2.6.1.2.6. An obstruction to vision is first observed; i.e., fog, mist, smoke, etc.
        A2.6.1.2.7. A weather condition exists that could jeopardize or enhance flying safety.
     A2.6.1.3. Notify the Weather Team, via hotline or commercial telephone, whenever any
     of the following conditions is met:
        A2.6.1.3.1. An active runway change.
        A2.6.1.3.2. A change is made to the runway lighting setting.
        A2.6.1.3.3. During radio outages, or building evacuations, provide backup
        monitoring of the Pilot to Metro Service 239.8 (PMSV), as priorities permit. If the
        aircraft needs only the current observation, control tower personnel can relay the
        observation. If they require weather technician assistance, advise them to contact
        March Command Post and request a phone patch to weather. If the radio is out, use
        655-3602; or, if the building is evacuated, use 655-2428.
        A2.6.1.3.4. Provide a Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) radio check daily by 0900L.
A2.7. WEATHER TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES FOR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
OPERATIONS.
  A2.7.1. Weather Team Personnel shall:
     A2.7.1.1. Reevaluate surface prevailing visibility, as soon as practicable, upon initial
     receipt of a differing control tower value and upon receipt of subsequent reportable
     changes at the control tower level when requested by control tower personnel, as duty
     priorities permit.
     A2.7.1.2. Locally disseminate PIREPs considered significant to flight operations.
     A2.7.1.3. Take a SPECI observation when notified of an aircraft mishap at or near
     March ARB.
     A2.7.1.4. When notified of weather conditions as outlined in Chapter 3 above, monitor
     AN/FMQ-19 readings, and or manually reevaluate current weather conditions and
     generate a SPECI observation if the conditions meet SPECI criteria. Include the
     conditions in the next required METAR or SPECI observation if the conditions do not
     meet SPECI criteria.
MARCHARBI15-101 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              37


     A2.7.1.5. Use control tower values of prevailing or sector visibility as a guide in
     determining the surface visibility when the view of portions of the horizon is obstructed
     by buildings, aircraft, etc. The presence of a surface based obscuration, uniformly
     distributed to heights above the level of the tower, is sufficient reason to consider the
     weather unit’s prevailing visibility to be the same as the control tower level.
     A2.7.1.6. Notify control tower via hotline or commercial telephone whenever the
     AN/FMQ-19 becomes inoperative.
     A2.7.1.7. Notify control tower via hotline or commercial telephone whenever the Joint
     Environmental Tools (JET) becomes inoperative.
     A2.7.1.8. Notify control tower via hotline or commercial telephone whenever the winds
     are estimated.
A2.8. BACKUP OF AN AUTOMATED OBSERVATION SYSTEM (AMOS).
  A2.8.1. Except for some automated remarks, backup refers to weather technicians providing
  the same reporting capability as that provided by the AMOS. Weather technicians will
  backup the AMOS equipment, if the system/sensor(s) is/are not operational or unavailable
  due to sensor and/or communication failure. Weather technicians will make every attempt to
  immediately log out broken equipment, except when immediate flight safety (i.e., in-flight
  emergency) warrants otherwise. Weather technicians are not required to log a system/sensor
  out if a deficiency report is currently published by AFWA, or backup is required due to
  system restart. Weather flight leadership will use sound ORM practices to develop/document
  those operationally significant weather thresholds (normally provided by a fully operational
  AMOS) to report while operating in backup mode. There is no requirement to back up the
  system/sensor when the airfield is closed, unless tornadic activity is occurring or is forecast
  to occur, (then backup and supplement as necessary). Weather technicians will provide
  backup information in accordance with AFMAN 15-111, Table 3.2, Summary of Backup
  encoding, and AFMAN 15-111, Table 3.3, Summary of Backup Remarks. Backup
  information is required for longline dissemination, for OWS terminal aerodrome forecast
  (TAF) production and for local ground-to-air dissemination to sustain air operations at the
  airfield (e.g., ATC functions and/or the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS)).
  Use manual observing procedures when performing backup operations.
  A2.8.2. In coordination with the 452 OSS/OSAT, the weather station has outlined variables
  in weather observing that are crucial to flight safety. VFR is defined as those conditions that
  are roughly greater than 1,000 foot ceilings and 3 statute miles visibility. For March airfield
  operations, however, should the AMOS not report conditions below 3,000FT/3SM due to a
  system error or spatial averaging time sequencing being too slow, the weather technician will
  log into and, as necessary, augment a surface weather observation for those elements deemed
  unrepresentative of current conditions. This may also include the onset or ending of
  precipitation that the equipment fails to detect.
