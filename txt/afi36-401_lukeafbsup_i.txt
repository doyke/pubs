      input for approval at the appropriate level.
      1.8.19.4. Serve as the resource manager for element 88751 funds, and administrator with
      84753 funds.
1.9. Documenting Education and Training in Employee Records.
   1.9.1. Education. Education level is determined from “an employee’s educational attainment
   from an accredited institution”, according to guidance from the Office of Personnel
   Management (Guide to Personnel Data Standards). In addition, guidance from the Office of
   Personnel Management establishes that only accredited education gained by employees is
   credited in employee records (Qualification Handbook). Degrees awarded by Air University
   upon completion of in-residence Air Command and Staff College and Air War College will
   be coded in employee records as education.
   1.9.2. Training. The following guidance is provided for consistency in crediting training:
      1.9.2.1. General Information. Training is not strictly limited to specific courses, types of
      training or methods of completion. Good judgment must be used in all cases to meet the
      changing needs of personnel programs and employee development goals. Coordination
      between Employee Development and Staffing functional experts is essential to credit
      training. A training course completion certificate or appropriate documentation must
      include the student’s name, course name, total course hours, and course start and
      completion dates. Regardless of funding source, training paid for by the government must
      be credited in employee records.
      1.9.2.2. Continuing Education Unit (CEU). Many colleges, universities, and professional
      organizations sponsor a variety of professional development courses that award
      Continuing Education Units (CEUs) instead of semester or quarter hour credits. These
      courses are typically short-term in nature and may not be a part of an undergraduate-or
      graduate-level curriculum. When professional development courses are not creditable for
      undergraduate-or graduate-level credits, CEUs should be coded as training. If the course
      provider indicates the number of hours of actual class instruction, code that amount. If
      not provided, the Air Force will apply the “Louis Phillips’ Continuing Education Guide”
      for consistency. Code CEUs at the rate of 10 hours for each CEU. For example, an
      employee awarded three CEU credits should be coded with 30 hours of training. In some
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                        11


       cases, an employee will request that the course be reflected in the personnel history as
       college credit. In order for that to occur, the employee must have his or her college or
       university convert the CEUs to semester or quarter hours on a transcript.
       1.9.2.3. Mandatory Training. All training completions required by law, the Office of
       Personnel Management, the Department of Defense, or Air Force policy will be credited
       in employee records.
       1.9.2.4. Other Training. Other non-mandatory training may be credited in employee
       records.
   1.9.3. Self-Development Courses Applicable to Employee’s Current Position or Career
   Progression. This includes, but is not limited to, such courses as professional military
   education (PME) which are valuable for Air Force career progression. Other self-
   development activities may also qualify for credit for similar reasons. Coordination between
   Employee Development and Staffing functional experts is essential when crediting self-
   development courses in employee records.
1.10. Managers and Supervisors. Managers and supervisors have the following responsibility:
   1.10.1. Use performance appraisals for determining training needs for their assigned
   employees. Individual Development Plans (IDPs) are used as an additional source as
   appropriate.
   1.10.2. Review technology shifts. Anticipate and identify actual mission, program, weapon,
   or system changes. Review career program master development plans and Career
   Enhancement Plans (CEPs) to determine training and developmental needs (further
   information regarding career plans can be found on the Air Force Personnel Center web site,
   http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/cp). Review the DAU catelog to determine acquisition
   training required by DAWIA for the acquisition workforce. Prioritize needs and the methods
   used in evaluating training (See Attachment 4). Develop impact statements if training is not
   funded (See Attachment 5).
   1.10.3. Consult with the EDM/S on identifying needs and the most economical and efficient
   sources of training.
   1.10.4. Ensure affirmative employment initiatives are considered in identifying training and
   development needs.
   1.10.5. Evaluate subordinates’ job performance following formal training, on-the-job
   training (OJT), and developmental assignments for effectiveness, and provide written
   evaluations to the EDM/S as required.
   1.10.6. Prepare required documentation on the DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization,
   Agreement, Certification of Training and Reimbursement, or through electronic means
   approved by HQ USAF/DPDE when requesting training. Approve DAU training requests
   that an employee submits via electronic means, ACQ Now.
   1.10.7. Ensure employees are released to attend training as scheduled.
   1.10.8. Set-up and implement formal training requirements for such programs as worker-
   trainee, apprenticeship, DOP, and intern programs.
 12                                           AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


   1.10.9. Follow merit procedures in selecting employees for training or developmental
   assignments that may serve to enhance promotional opportunities.
   1.10.10. Mentor and inform subordinates on self-development opportunities. Encourage
   career development activities. For further information on mentoring see AFI 36-3401.
   1.10.11. Coordinate with the base civilian training program office, the CPF, and the
   installation safety office when procuring training activities with physical requirements which
   may adversely affect the safety and health of federal employees.
1.11. Employees. Employees will do the following:
   1.11.1. Maintain the necessary competence to do the job and help the organization meet its
   mission.
   1.11.2. Participate in directed training and developmental activities.
   1.11.3. Share knowledge gained from such training activities with co-workers.
   1.11.4. Assist in training other employees.
   1.11.5. Discuss training needs with supervisors and obtain approval before applying for
   training.
   1.11.6. Assume responsibility for self-development activities and assure their personnel
   records reflect current training and development accomplishments.
1.12. Waivers for Competitive Sourcing and/or Privatization. When organizations are
undergoing studies for competitive sourcing and/or privatizing of civilian education and training
functions, it is not necessary to obtain waivers for responsibilities stipulated within this
instruction which make specific reference to training/education of civilian personnel. It is
understood that the contractor will assume responsibilities for civilian education and training in
accordance with this instruction and the statement of work. All waiver for competitive sourcing
and/or privatization studies granted to the 1 August 1994 edition of this publication remain in
effect. All follow-on statements of work will be developed IAW this instruction.
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                         13


                                          Chapter 2

   IMPLEMENTING AND CONTROLLING PROGRAMS AND FUNDING LEVELS

2.1. Applying the Installation Training Guide (ITG). This guide contains specific guidance
with local training program operations. For information on developing an ITG see Attachment
12.
   2.1.1. Identification of Training Needs. Annually, supervisors and managers identify
   employee training requirements and assign priorities. (See Attachment 4.)
   2.1.2. Documentation. The supervisor documents identified training requirements using the
   procedures developed and provided by the civilian training function. (see Attachment 4.)
   2.1.3. Training Source Determination. Management, with the assistance from the EDM/S,
   will determine the best training source needed to satisfy the training requirement. (See
   Attachment 9.)
   2.1.4. Validation. Key management officials document and validate all training needs to
   ensure the requirements and priorities support mission needs. Validated training requirements
   are submitted to the EDM/S who:
       2.1.4.1. Reviews documents for legal and regulatory compliance.
       2.1.4.2. Ensures the effectiveness of the training source and method for meeting
       identified needs.
       2.1.4.3. Monitors duplication of organizational training requirements for possible
       grouping and cost effectiveness and efficiency.
       2.1.4.4. Oversees applicability of the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A-76,
       Performance of Commercial Activities.
   2.1.5. Recording Training Needs. The supervisor records all training requirements in the
   employee work folder. Supervisors should ensure that training requirements are linked to the
   mission of the Air Force. The EDM/S can provide guidance and instructions on developing
   the Individual Development Plan (IDP), if required. Source documents (i.e., DD Forms 1556,
   course descriptions, approval rationale, evaluations, AFMAN 36-606, etc.) are maintained on
   file by the EDM/S.
2.2. Preparation and Use of The Annual Installation Training Plan (AITP). The EDM/S
identifies the projected fiscal year training requirements for use by the CECMC or MTC to
accomplish the final installation-wide validation of the AITP. Committee action ensures that:
   2.2.1. Requirements represent training needs as indicated by past training activities and
   anticipated future needs.
   2.2.2. Priority groupings are proper and any unmet needs resulting from funding restrictions
   are analyzed.
   2.2.3. Impact statements are prepared and submitted to the EDM/S for any unmet training
   needs.
 14                                           AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


   2.2.4. Projected training cost estimates are reasonable and sufficient to accommodate
   predicted expenses.
   2.2.5. Additions, deletions, and adjustments to training requirements and estimated costs
   reflect optimum use of resources.
   2.2.6. After the committee validation process is complete, the AITP is sent to the approving
   official at the appropriate level.
2.3. Budget and Financial Resource Management. The EDM/S manages and administers
funds required to meet training needs (see Attachment 5). These responsibilities also include the
management of the Government Purchase Card (GPC) used as a method of payment for training
and education (see Chapter 10). To accomplish this, the EDM/S will:
   2.3.1. Ensure no appropriated funds are used to support the training of Non-Appropriated
   Fund (NAF) personnel when the training is required for the performance of the employees’
   NAF duties (i.e., education and training to advance job knowledge, develop skills, and
   improve abilities of NAF employees). The exception to this requirement is the education and
   training of child care providers, which is authorized from appropriated funds by the Military
   Child Care Act of 1989. Additionally, appropriated funds are authorized for training all
   employees for command or base required training (EEO, fire safety, HIV awareness, etc.).
   Appropriated funds may be authorized for training of NAF employees performing the duties
   of an authorized appropriated fund position as long as this training is not also required for the
   performance of the employees’ NAF duties. For further guidance on the use of appropriated
   funds to support the training of NAF personnel see AFI 65-106.
   2.3.2. Ensure funds will not be used to support the direct attainment of licenses or
   certifications. An employee is not prohibited from attending a training course and receiving a
   license or certification as an incidental by-product of the training.
   2.3.3. Determine and assign proper budget categories [appropriations, program element code
   (PEC), RC/CC, element of expense and investment codes (EEIC), etc.] for obligating,
   expending, and tracking training expenses, to include coding of such in an automated data
   system.
   2.3.4. Coordinate with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), organizational
   units, and other applicable finance offices on financial matters involving distribution,
   adjustments, and expenditures of funds; and contracting offices on contract training, i.e., AF
   Form 9, Request for Purchase. When using an AF Form 9, the DFAS officer designee
   certifies the availability of funds. When the GPC is the method of payment, use appropriate
   form(s) i.e., AF Form 4009, Government Purchase Card Fund Cite Authorization, to commit
   funds against the correct PEC and EEIC. For further guidance on training and education
   program manager responsibilities for the GPC, see Chapter 10.
   2.3.5. Implement internal procedures to monitor training fund expenditures, regardless of
   funding source, to include purchases through the GPC, contracting offices on AF Form 9,
   and with temporary duty orders.
   2.3.6. Control obligations to remain within the projected quarterly/annual level of authority.
   2.3.7. Coordinate on availability of funds.
   2.3.8. Validate fund citations.
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                      15


  2.3.9. Monitor the quarterly/annual financial portion of the AITP by reconciling accounting
  reports, corresponding data products, DD Forms 1556, Request, Authorization, Agreement,
  Certification of Training and Reimbursement, monthly reconciliation of the credit card
  report, and the accounting and finance system, etc.

                                         Chapter 3

                    EVALUATING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

3.1. Training Purpose. The evaluation process completes the training and development cycle.
It provides supervisors, employees, and the EDM/S with information to determine how well a
specific training course or program has met its objectives. This determination is essential in
justifying the expenditure of training funds to improve work quality, quantity, timeliness,
productivity or management operations.
3.2. Evaluating Completed Training and Development:
   3.2.1. Employees, supervisors, managers, and EDM/Ss evaluate training continually. As a
   minimum, a formal evaluation is completed annually. The ITG includes an outline of how to
   complete the formal evaluation. The annual evaluation may be completed and documented as
   part of the AITP review and must include a variety of evaluation techniques (see
   Attachment 4).
   3.2.2. The EDM/S provides assistance to supervisors and employees in the evaluation
   process.
   3.2.3. The EDM/S makes use of individual course evaluations as a technique in the
   evaluation process and takes positive action in response to all course evaluations which are
   rated less than satisfactory. Written documentation of the action taken is maintained for
   future reference and planning purposes with the annual evaluation of training.
   3.2.4. Overall program evaluation and required EDM/S follow-up actions are review items
   for Air Force headquarters and MAJCOM evaluation teams.
3.3. Evaluating Training Program Administration.           As a minimum, the EDM/S is
responsible for evaluating program requirements.
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                               17


                                            Chapter 4

                PROGRAM AND SPECIAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Continued Service Agreements (CSA).
   4.1.1. A CSA includes an agreement by the employee to continue in service upon training
   completion. As a minimum, all training over 80 hours requires a CSA. The period of service
   obligation begins the first workday after the training ends, and is equal to at least three times
   the length of the training. Longer periods of required service are set if justified by the costs of
   training or other factors, such as situations when employee enters into a period of non-pay
   status. The EDM/S evaluates each instance of training to justify an agency’s substantial
   investment of resources. When some or all of the additional training expenses are paid, but
   the employee receives no pay, (i.e. training occurs after duty hours) the period of service is
   equal to the length of the training, with a minimum one-month obligation.
   4.1.2. Computed costs of training for reimbursement purposes should include tuition, travel,
   per diem, books and materials, fees, other related costs, and administrative overhead costs
   (such as the costs for planning, conducting, and administering the training; advertising the
   training; conducting employee screening and selection processes; monitoring completion;
   evaluating effectiveness of the training; etc.) as appropriate. The trainee’s salary will not be
   included.
   4.1.3. Employees sign a CSA before commencement of training. (See Attachment 11.)
   Once an employee has signed a CSA, the EDM/S ensures a system is in place to monitor the
   date the obligation service commitment expires, preventing any separation personnel action
   from being processed without consideration of this obligation.
   4.1.4. An employees who fails to complete training covered by a CSA is still obligated for
   costs incurred. The CSA stays in effect to protect government interests even though the
   employee withdraws from, or otherwise fails to complete, training. It should be adjusted to
   reflect actual costs incurred.
   4.1.5. For CCDP (see Chapter 8), service commitments are as follows, unless otherwise
   specified for a particular course: Short-term Executive Development: 1 year; Long-term
   programs less than $40,000: 3 years; Long-term programs $40,000 to $59,999: 4 years; and
   Long-term programs $60,000 or more: 5 years.
   4.1.6. Recovery of expenses for failure to complete CSA is prorated against the remaining
   portion of the employee’s obligated service commitment. For example, if the cost of training
   is $3,000 and the employee has completed two-thirds of the obligated service, the employee
   will reimburse the Air Force $1,000 instead of the original $3,000.
4.2. Waiver of CSA.
   4.2.1. Employees are required to provide at least a 10 work-day advance notice to their
   servicing CPF of their intent to transfer to another agency or resign while under the
   obligation period.
   4.2.2. Authority to waive CSA obligations is established at MAJCOM, AFPC/DPK,
   AFATO, or by the EDM/S depending on the training involved. A waiver is granted in whole
 18                                           AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


   or in part based on employee justification. Approval of any waiver is fully documented and
   based on full consideration of equity, good conscience, and the public interest in the decision
   process. Requests for waiver are processed through the servicing civilian training office and
   command training functions for review and recommendation prior to forwarding to the
   approval authority.
   4.2.3. A waiver may be granted if the employee has completed most, but not all, of the
   required period of service; resigned because of personal illness or serious illness of a member
   of his or her immediate family; or is unable to make the required payment because of severe
   financial hardship.
   4.2.4. Employees are not required to repay funds when moving to another government
   agency position within the Department of Defense. The remaining period of obligated
   service, however, is transferred to the gaining DoD Component.
   4.2.5. Air Force employees may process grievances on decisions not to grant waivers
   through the Air Force grievance system described in AFI 36-1203. Bargaining unit
   employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement resolve disagreements
   through negotiated procedures.
4.3. Attendance at Meetings. Employees can take part in activities and meetings of non-
government associations, to include technical, scientific, and professional societies. Funding and
approval authorities differ depending on the purpose of the meeting. When the purpose for
attendance clearly meets a training objective, as determined by the EDM/S, the use of training
funds is appropriate. When the purpose for attendance is not primarily for training, base support
funds will be used.

                                    TRAINING SOURCES

5.1. Use of Interagency Training Programs and Facilities. Interagency training refers to
training programs and facilities that are set up for the use of more than one agency. When
courses require a single-agency point of contact, such as the Federal Executive Institute,
Management Development Center, etc., AFSLMO/DP and HQ AFPC/DPK, respectively,
centrally fund attendance. For acquisition training provided by DAU under DAWIA, AFATO
centrally manages the funds. Other interagency courses are normally developed, administered,
and funded at the installation level.
5.2. Use of Non-Government Training Facilities. When Federal government facilities cannot
meet a training need, the EDM/S may arrange training through the local contracting office or
non-government facilities. There are constraints and prohibitions on use of non-government
training facilities. These include training:
   5.2.1. Which teaches or advocates the overthrow of the United States government by force
   or violence. This prohibition also applies to training provided by a person about whom a
   proper determination has been made that there is reasonable doubt concerning his or her
   loyalty to the United States.
   5.2.2. Which carries on subversive propaganda, attempting to influence legislation, or
   participating or interfering in political campaigns on behalf of any candidate for public
   office.
   5.2.3. Which illegally discriminates in the admission or in subsequent treatment of students.
5.3. Establishing Local Training Courses and Programs. Local training programs, including
on-the-job-training, should be used to fill identified training needs whenever this approach has
been validated as the most efficient and economical method of training. The Instructional
Systems Development (ISD) process is used when developing a local training course or program
to ensure that they are job-related and cost effective. See AFI 36-2201 for additional information.
5.4. On-The-Job-Training (OJT). Methods used to satisfy a training requirement should be
efficient and economical. OJT should not only be considered for the employees within a
particular work unit, but should also be considered for any displaced employees affected by
downsizing, reassignment, or base closure. OJT is planned, organized, and conducted at the work
site. For further guidance concerning on the job training, see Attachment 9.
5.5. Air Force Mentoring. The goal of mentoring is to help each person reach his/her full
potential, thereby enhancing the overall professionalism of the Air Force. A mentor is defined as
“a trusted counselor or guide”. Various levels of Leadership--officers, enlisted and civilians--
play a vital role in the mentoring program through an ongoing processing of fostering principles,
traditions, shared values and the lessons of our profession. Supervisors are key to the
professional development of their personnel by providing training and guidance through
mentoring. (For further guidance on the Air Force Mentoring Program refer to AFI 36-3401, Air
Force Mentoring).
5.6. Suggested Reading List : A list of suggested reading material has been devised by the Air
Force Historian for the Chief of Staff to promote professional and self-development of Air Force
 20                                             AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


people by enhancing the knowledge of the civilian work force on the history of air and space
power. Designed for civilians and divided into grade range categories, the reading list was
created to mirror the reading list of officers and enlisted. A complete reading list for all grades is
available on the Air Force web site, “Air Force Link”, under “library”. The books are also
available for commercial purchase or through the base library. The suggested reading list is a
part of the Air Force Chief of Staff Reading Program.
5.7. Continuous Learning (CL) for Acquisition Professionals. Civilian and military
acquisition professionals are expected to participate in continuous learning activities throughout
their acquisition careers. Continuous learning activities augment the education, training, and
experience standards established for APDP certification purposes. Opportunities for professional
development, education and training shall be made available as appropriate. The OSD CL policy,
Air Force CL Implementation Policy, suggested sources for CL training, and additional
information can be found at the Acquisition Career Management homepage:
http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/acq_workf/career_training/cl.html.

                   FORMS, REPORTS, AND RECORDS DISPOSITION

6.1. Forms Used in Training and Development. The Air Force civilian training program uses
a wide variety of forms in processing, validating, planning, financing, and accomplishing
employee development. See Table A3.1 in Attachment 3 for the use of each form prescribed in
this instruction.
6.2. Formal Training Plans (FTP). Supervisors prepare the FTP within the first 30 days of
the assignment for employees participating in formal training programs, i.e. Developmental
Opportunity Program (DOP), intern programs, etc. The EDM/S maintains the approved training
plan. Copies are provided to the supervisor and employee. Supervisors will use the FTP for
periodic employee counseling in conjunction with the annual performance appraisal. Each FTP
will include:
   6.2.1. Knowledge, Skill, and Ability (KSAs) required
   6.2.2. Expected level of proficiency for each KSA and how that proficiency is to be
   measured
   6.2.3. Specific methods and sources of training and development for each KSA to be
   acquired including the hours required for each developmental activity
   6.2.4. Anticipated completion date for each training and development activity
   6.2.5. Signature by supervisor and employee
6.3. Individual Development Plan (IDP). An IDP is a written plan outlining the training and
progress of an employee new to an organization work-site or for which the documentation of an
employee’s training and progress is desired. They also serve as an important mentoring tool used
for outlining desired career path progression. IDPs are for employees not covered by a formal
training program for which a formal training plan would be required. The IDP is tailored to
individual employee needs and is based on the employee’s job description. The EDM/S can
provide guidance and instruction on developing the IDP. IDPs are required for the acquisition
workforce throughout their careers.
6.4. Records Disposition. The EDM/S will maintain and dispose of all training documentation
created by this instruction according to AFMAN 37-139 and AFI 36-114. Training documents
and materials should be retained in the training files. Continued Service Agreements (CSA)
should be retained in accordance with OM 293-31 as temporary documents in the Official
Personnel Folder (OPF) until the agreement has been satisfied.

AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                           27


   8.4.2. Managers will use the AF Civilian Career Development Path to recommend eligible
   candidates for the most appropriate development activity in partnership with MAJCOMs and
   Career Programs for respective registrants. Employee eligibility for particular programs is
   normally based upon permanent grade. On an exception basis, individuals who were
   competitively selected for temporary promotion may compete for programs where Air Force
   has discretion based upon the temporary grade. In such cases, endorsing officials must ensure
   follow-on assignments are identified at the permanent grade. Although candidates may
   request preference for a specific course or program, they must be willing to attend programs
   other than those for which nominated in the best interests of the AF. Attendance at non-PME
   long-term academic training, whether the employee attends through CCDP or some other
   means, is limited to once in a career. Candidates and endorsing officials will complete the
   prescribed nomination form (AF Form 4059) and submit it to the servicing training office.
   Before nominating an employee for a developmental activity, management and the employee
   must determine how the employee will utilize the acquired knowledge and skills upon
   completion of the training activity. This post-utilization plan may involve increased or
   expanded responsibilities in the current position, a new assignment within or outside the
   organization, or a permanent change of station (PCS) to another duty location. Servicing
   training offices will review nomination packages for eligibility, suitability, legal, and
   regulatory criteria, obtain chain of command approval as required by MAJCOM and/or local
   procedures, and send completed packages to respective nominating organization.
   8.4.3. Nominating organizations will select candidates for AF-wide competition based on
   AF-wide nomination and selection criteria and send nomination packages to AFPC/DPK.
   8.4.4. AFPC/DPK will provide selection board results to USAF/DP and the ERBDP.
8.5. Post-Selection Procedures:
   8.5.1. AFPC/DPK will notify nominating organizations of employees selected for respective
   development activities in conjunction with the announcement of military PME selections.
   AFPC/DPK will send information copies to MAJCOM/DPs and installation/CCs. Selections
   will also be available for review on the USAF/DP web-site.
   8.5.2. Endorsement level approval for management withdrawal of employees selected for the
   AF CCDP is required. There is no deferral option. Employees who, after selection,
   arbitrarily decline will be restricted from consideration for the AF CCDP for a two-
   year period. For additional information on declinations see Attachment 13.
   8.5.3. AFSLMO will work with nominating organizations and selected GS-15 employees to
   identify placement and developmental assignments appropriate to their needs.
   8.5.4. AFPC/DPK will provide servicing CPFs the applicable documents (SF 52 and AF
   3821) to place participants on a Central Salary Account manpower authorization for the
   duration of their development activity. This will allow the backfill of the position vacated by
   the participant.
   8.5.5. With the exception of developmental assignment participants, Central Salary Account
   participants in a temporary duty (TDY) status will remain against the same position
   description/core document, continue to report to the same supervisor, and be serviced by the
   same CPF for the duration of the development activity. The performance rating of record will
   be extended unless the employee has performed work under supervision for at least 90 days
 28                                           AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


   during the rating cycle. Any monetary performance award granted to Central Salary Account
   participants will be paid from the installation’s awards budget.
   8.5.6. Potential follow-on assignments should be considered for positions that provide
   progressive breadth, depth, or broadening experience. Senior functional points of contacts, in
   partnership with Career Programs (if applicable), will begin working with nominating
   organizations and selected LTT participants to identify follow-on assignments appropriate to
   the development activity prior to class start date.
   8.5.7. Management will notify respective CPF(s) of the LTT participant’s follow-on
   assignment, proposed effective date, and will initiate applicable paperwork to be submitted to
   the servicing CPF. Unless advised otherwise, a participant may not be carried against the
   Central Salary Account manpower authorization beyond completion of the development
   activity. The servicing CPF will process follow-on placement actions. Unless otherwise
   authorized, the effective date of the follow-on assignment will be the beginning of the pay
   period immediately following the completion of the development activity.
   8.5.8. Reassignments and changes-to-lower grade of an employee who has completed a
   centrally funded and managed formal development and training, as provided by 5 CFR Part
   410, are exempt from the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) provided a follow-on
   position is "pre-identified" (DODM 1400.20-1-M, Chapter 4, C.2.b). This identification will
   include the potential occupational series and grade level(s) of the follow-on position and the
   functional community within the Air Force where placement will be made. The specific title,
   series, grade, and location of the follow-on position will normally be identified within the last
   six months of the career broadening assignment. To be exempt from PPP, the follow-on
   placement can only be made at the employee’s permanent grade level through reassignment,
   or through a change to lower grade at the employee’s request.
   8.5.9. AFPC/DPK will provide servicing training offices a fund cite to cover applicable
   participants’ temporary duty travel and per diem expenses. Normally tuition for the executive
   development courses covers most or all lodging and meal expenses and the participant’s
   organization funds travel and travel-related per diem.
   8.5.10. AFPC/DPK will ensure DD Forms 1556 (cut sheets) and Continued Service
   Agreements (CSA) are completed and signed. Servicing training functions will ensure the
   participant’s personnel record is flagged to reflect the CSA ending date.
   8.5.11. The CSA includes a repayment provision should the participant fail to satisfactorily
   complete the development activity or the required service commitment. (For information on

                  CIVILIAN TUITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (CTAP)

9.1. The Civilian Tuition Assistance Policy. This policy applies to all educational assistance
using Air Force funds to pay tuition, laboratory and other instructional fees. Unlike training that
is identified by management, this policy applies to courses that employees desire to attend for
their self development at accredited institutions of their choice on a voluntary basis, regardless of
funding source.
9.2. Eligibility. Tuition assistance (TA) is available to all appropriated fund employees. This
policy does not apply to employees covered by AFI 36-602, Civilian Intern Programs. This
policy does not apply to training and education mandated by law, regulation or agency
requirements.
   9.2.1. Tuition Assistance for the Acquisition Workforce. Funding assistance for
   education under DAWIA is provided up to 100 percent based on PEC 84753 funds
   availability. Refer to the availability of funds to support the acquisition community
   pertaining to education and training described in paragraph 1.4. Funding does not cover
   examination fees, optional fees, parking, charges for personal services or the costs of vicinity
   travel.
9.3. Requirements.
   9.3.1. TA is designed to benefit the Air Force mission by providing tuition assistance for
   mission-related courses.
   9.3.2. TA is not provided, in whole or in part, for courses for which the employee is
   receiving other federal or state tuition subsidies such as Veterans Administration educational
   benefits, scholarships or grants, etc.
   9.3.3. Courses are taken on a voluntary, off-duty basis. Courses taken during duty hours are
   subject to applicable regulations, local governing provisions, and approval by the employee’s
   supervisor.
   9.3.4. TA may not exceed the rate of 75% of tuition costs not to exceed $187.50 per
   semester hour or $124.50 per quarter hour and will be limited to $3,500 per fiscal year. TA
   will not be provided for non-instructional costs to include, but not limited to, books,
   materials, examination fees, optional fees, parking, charges for personal services or the costs
   of vicinity travel.
   9.3.5. TA will not be provided for courses at the post-master’s level or at a level lower or
   equal to a degree already attained, unless directly job-related.
   9.3.6. Employees who fail to successfully complete each course will reimburse the Air Force
   for all TA costs (excluding salary) associated with each course. Successful completion
   requires a grade of “C” or better for undergraduate courses, a grade of “B” or better for
   graduate and above courses, and “satisfactory” for courses which have no letter grade. The
   final training approval authority may waive this requirement in whole, or in part, based on
   acceptable justification.

   9.3.7. TA requests must be documented on a DD Form 1556 or DOD Civilian Employee Air
   Force Tuition Assistance Form or other approved authorization form and approved by the
   respective funds approval authority and the EDM/S prior to course start date. Employee TA
   agreements should be documented. The attached sample agreement may be reproduced by
   the EDM/S for this purpose. Records will be maintained in accordance with administrative
   filing guidance. Data will be maintained by AFPC/DPK and servicing Training Offices for
   respective employees for program assessment and reporting purposes.
   9.3.8. Servicing Training Offices will ensure documentation of course completions in
   employee records.
   9.3.9. If sufficient funds are not allocated to cover TA requirements identified in respective
   PEC 88751 financial plans or available from other supplemental sources, AFPC/DPK and
   servicing Training Offices may limit the number of courses per employee or establish a lower
   standard annual rate based on the total number of employees who have identified TA
   requirements and funds available.
9.4. Definitions.
   9.4.1. Tuition assistance (TA). Financial assistance for tuition, laboratory and other
   instructional fees for academic mission-related courses at accredited post-secondary
   academic institutions.
   9.4.2. Tuition. The stated cost per academic unit of instruction as specified in the course
   catalog at an accredited institution.
   9.4.3. Academic mission-related courses. Courses in academic institutions which meet
   current and projected performance requirements essential to the achievement of the Air Force
   mission to include accredited correspondence and distance education programs.
   9.4.4. Training Office. The office in which the civilian education and training function is
   located (i.e., civilian personnel flight, education and training flight, Most Efficient
   Organization (MEO), or contracted training function).
9.5. CTAP Administration. AFPC/DPK will administer the CTAP for respective qualified
career program registrants. CTAP for all other employees will be administered by servicing
Training Offices. AFPC/DPK and servicing Training Offices will identify CTAP requirements
by priority in their 88751 financial plan submissions.
9.6. Payment of TA. Approved TA may be paid directly to the academic institution if a billing
procedure is established or to the employee on a reimbursable basis.
9.7. Taxation of TA. Employees should be advised that employer-provided TA for courses not
related to an employee’s current job or occupation may be considered taxable income. The
following tax provisions may be subject to change. Check with servicing Defense Finance and
Accounting Offices for current tax provisions.
   9.7.1. TA for undergraduate courses not related to the employee’s current job is excluded
   from taxable income up to $5,250 per calendar year.
   9.7.2. TA for graduate courses not related to the employee’s current job is treated as taxable
   income.
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                            31


9.8. Waiver of TA Cap. Requests for waivers of the fiscal year cap on individual TA will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis. There must be a compelling need to justify the waiver (i.e., a
pending assignment to a remote location not serviced by the current academic institution will
cause undue hardship/delay in degree completion). High cost or acceleration of a program of
study are not “stand alone” reasons to request a waiver. Requests from MAJCOMs and
AFPC/DPK seeking waivers on behalf of academic institutions for accelerated programs of study
will not be considered.
   9.8.1. All requests for waivers will be submitted to the servicing Training Office or the
   applicable AFPC/DPK PALACE Team (for career program administered TA) for initial
   review. There must be a compelling need to justify the waiver. It is incumbent upon the
   employee to provide full justification in support of the waiver request.
   9.8.2. The chief of the servicing training office will review the waiver request, render an
   opinion, and forward to the respective MAJCOM for review and action. For career program
   TA, the applicable AFPC/DPK PALACE Team Chief will review and render an opinion, and
   forward to AFPC/DPKD.
   9.8.3. MAJCOMs (or AFPC/DPKD) are the final approval authority unless a clarification of
   policy is required of HQ USAF/DPDE.
9.9. Civilian Tuition Assistance Program Agreement.
This agreement is administered by the EDM/S and applies to all educational assistance for
which the Air Force approves payment of tuition, laboratory and other instructional fees prior
to the course start date. Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as limiting the
authority of the training approval authority to waive, in whole or in part, an obligation of an
employee to pay expenses incurred by the Air Force.

1. I am not receiving any other federal or state tuition subsidies such as Veterans Administration
education benefits, scholarships or grants, etc., in whole or in part, where the payment would
constitute a duplication of benefits for the course(s) described in the attached request.

2. I agree that no changes will be made in the course(s) or dollar amount(s) described in the
attached request without the approval of AFPC/DPK (for career program registrants) or servicing
Training Office; otherwise, I will pay the difference to the Air Force and/or the academic
institution.

3. I understand that, funds permitting, the Air Force will provide up to 75% tuition, laboratory
and/or other instructional fees required as a condition of enrollment not to exceed $187.50 per
semester hour or $124.50 per quarter hour and will be limited to $3,500 per fiscal year. I agree to
pay the remaining amount and any other costs and fees.

4. I understand that I must successfully complete the course(s) for which tuition assistance is
approved. Successful completion requires a grade of “C” or better for undergraduate courses, a
grade of “B” or better for graduate courses, and “satisfactory” for courses which have no letter
grade. I hereby authorize the release of academic information (course grades, completion status)
by the academic institution to the Air Force. I agree to provide a copy of the grade report to
AFPC/DPK or servicing Training Office within 30 days of completing each course.

5. I understand that there are two ways approved tuition assistance may be paid.

        a. The Air Force may provide payment directly to the academic institution if a billing
procedure is established. I agree to reimburse the Air Force for all costs (excluding salary)
associated with each course, and hereby voluntarily authorize the amount to be withdrawn from
my pay, if I fail to successfully complete the course. The training approval authority may waive
this requirement in whole or in part based on acceptable justification.

         b. I will pay the academic institution and upon successful completion of the course(s),
submit a completed SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business,
to the respective Career Program or servicing Training Office for reimbursement of the approved
tuition.

6. I understand that employer-provided tuition assistance for courses not related to my current
job or occupation may be considered taxable income.

                                          Chapter 10

GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF THE GOVERNMENT PURCHASE CARD TO PAY FOR
                    EDUCATION AND TRAINING

10.1. Purpose: To provide Air Force guidance on the use of the government purchase card to
pay for education and training regardless of funding source. For additional guidance see AFI 64-
117.
10.2. Program Description:
   10.2.1. The government purchase card will be used as the payment method for non-
   government and/or government off-the-shelf training and education up to $25,000 for an
   individual event or planned series of the same training event, activity, service, or course
   material regardless of funding source.
   10.2.2. Off-the-shelf training is defined as training products and services regularly available
   to the general public and/or government personnel. The term includes training offered in
   catalogs or other printed material by a college, university, professional association,
   consultant firm or organization. It does not include training specifically developed, designed,
   or produced to meet a requirement unique to an organization and/or program. AF Form 9,
   Request for Purchase, not the government purchase card, is the proper document to purchase
   training designed specifically to meet a requirement unique to an organization. The
   government purchase card does not take the place of formal acquisition procedures.
10.3. Responsibilities:
   10.3.1. Issues related to the use of the card that cannot be resolved at the local level should
   be elevated through the appropriate chain of command to HQ USAF/DPDE. Training and
   education program managers are responsible for:
       10.3.1.1. Complying with appropriate purchase card directives.
       10.3.1.2. Monitoring the execution of applicable program element codes (PECs).
       10.3.1.3. Implementing internal procedures to track the execution of training funds using
       the government purchase card.
       10.3.1.4. Reviewing and approving requests for training according to statutory and
       administrative requirements, regardless of funding source. Training and education
       purchased through other funding sources, using a DD Form 1556, Request,
       Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Training and Reimbursement, will comply
       with these procedures.
       10.3.1.5. Documenting all purchases and complying with the requirements in United
       States Air Force Internal Procedures for Using the GPC (formerly IMPAC), 26 Apr 97.
       10.3.1.6. Reconciling the monthly billing statement and obligations against the credit
       card report and the accounting and finance system.
       10.3.1.7. Ensuring that funds are obligated to cover outstanding charges, particularly
       those from prior year.
34                                         AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


     10.3.1.8. Using appropriate form(s), i.e., AF Form 4009, to commit funds against the
     correct PEC and element of expense investment code (EEIC). If entered correctly, DFAS
     reports should identify the obligation of funds against PECs (i.e., PEC 88751, PEC
     84753, etc., and EEIC 553). Each purchase card has only one line of accounting
     associated with it. Card holders using acquisition (PEC 84753) and non-acquisition (PEC
     88751) funds must have a separate card for each PEC. To accurately account for funds at
     locations with multiple command IDs, training and education program managers will be
     given the option of doing journal vouchers or having a separate card for each RC/CC
     within the Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN). Training and education program
     managers will work with their local Financial Services Office (FSO) to establish the most
     appropriate procedure.
     10.3.1.9. Advising vendors who are reluctant to accept the card due to the interchange
     rate (card fee) that they are eligible for the VISA “big ticket” interchange rate. These
     vendors should request their bank or financial institution provide them with the “big
     ticket” interchange rate. By having this rate, the “fee” they have to pay on credit card
     transactions can be as low as 1%. Questions should be directed to the
     Agency/Organization Program Coordinator (A/OPC).
     10.3.1.10. Prepaying training expenses according to common commercial practice.
     Training and education program managers can only dispute charges within a 30-day
     period from date of payment. After 30 days, program managers must resolve disputes
     with the vendor. The window of opportunity for prepayment of training is 60 days prior
     to the course start date.
     10.3.1.11. Working with servicing contracting office to ensure appropriate procedures
     are used when training is specifically designed, developed, or produced to meet a
     requirement unique to an organization.
  10.3.2. The A/OPC will issue cards, provide information and guidance on the use of the
  card, and train card holders. A/OPC will establish cardholder accounts as requested by
  training and education program managers with a single purchase limit of $25,000. All
  merchant category codes (MCCs) will be blocked except the following sources of training:

            1. 8220 - Colleges, universities, junior colleges, and professional schools
            2. 8241 - Correspondence schools
            3. 8244 - All business/secondary schools
            4. 8249 - Vocational/trade schools

            9. 8699 - Membership Organization (Not classified elsewhere)
            10. 9399 - Government Services (Not classified elsewhere)
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                             35


10.4. Unauthorized Usage. The government purchase card WILL NOT be used for the
following purposes:
   10.4.1. Cash advances: Cash advances are prohibited under the commercial credit card
   program.
   10.4.2. Travel related purchases, including: Rental/lease of motor vehicles associated with
   travel or temporary duty supported by travel orders (purchase of airline, bus, or train tickets);
   purchase of meals, drinks, lodging, or other travel or subsistence costs associated with
   Government official travel.
10.5. Authorization Document :
   10.5.1. The government gurchase card does not replace DD Form 1556 or other appropriate
   training forms as either a procurement and/or authorization document.
   10.5.2. Prior to attending a training or education course or program, approval must be
   obtained via the use of the appropriate training form (i.e., DD Form 1556).

Student Temporary Employment Program (STEP) does not have to relate to students’ area of
study, and no formal training plan is required by OPM but is recommended for purposes of
evaluation. These programs are established at the professional, graduate, baccalaureate,
associate, and high school levels.
Defense Leadership and Management Program (DLAMP)—An integrated six-year
developmental program designed to get selected employees prepared for and assigned to
designated leadership positions. The DLAMP includes graduate course work, rotational
assignment (s), in-residence senior-level professional military education, and formal mentoring.
Developmental Opportunity Program (DOP)—Formal restructure of identified positions to
provide employees with opportunities to compete for bridge or career positions at an entry or
intermediate grade with an identified target grade. A combination of on-the-job and formal
training is provided to develop employees along education and training requirements.
Worker Trainee Program (WTA)—Similar to DOP, this program is primarily used to fill
positions restructured at a very low entry level in an effort to hire and develop low-skilled and
disadvantaged persons.
Government Purchase Card (GPC)—A variable use government purchase card which
provides a method of payment for goods and services to include authorized training and
education.
Installation Training Guide (ITG)—Specific guidance on local training program operations
prepared by the EDM/S for serviced organizations.

                          SUPERVISORY TRAINING PROGRAM

A2.1. Training Needs of Supervisors. Initial training for all newly assigned supervisors helps
to bridge the gap between the skills required at the working level and those required at the
supervisory level. Various training technologies are available to accomplish supervisory training
(i.e., Computer Based Instruction (CBI), web-based training, etc…). Before they assume their
new duties or within 6 months after assignment to a supervisory position, first-level supervisors
will be provided initial training consisting of:
A2.2. USAF Supervisor ‘s Course. This course is primarily designed to provide first-level
supervisors, regardless of organizational component, with leadership and management skills
required in supervisory positions. In addition to contacting your Employee Development
Manager/Specialist, further information is available about CBI on the web at
http://www.au.af.mil/au/cpd/, then clicking on the Human Resources Division (HRD).
   A2.2.1. Equivalent Courses. The following courses may be accepted as equivalent training
   for the Air Force Supervisor’s Course:
       A2.2.1.1. Management Course I, Part I
       A2.2.1.2. Air Command and Staff College
       A2.2.1.3. NCO Academy or NCO Leadership Course
A2.3. USAF Civilian Personnel Management Course (CPMC). This course is primarily
designed to provide military and civilian first-level supervisors with background information and
an understanding of applicable personnel laws and regulations needed to effectively carry out
their civilian personnel management responsibilities. NOTE: This training is not required for
those supervisors who gained substantial experience through an assignment in a professional
civilian personnel specialist position or have completed Management Course I, Part II, or the
Civilian Personnel Policies, Practices, and Procedures (4-Ps) course. In addition to contacting
your Employee Development Manager/Specialist, further information is available about CBI on
the web at http://www.au.af.mil/au/cpd/, then clicking on the Civilian Personnel Division
(CPD).
A2.4. USAF Military Personnel Management Course (MPMC). This 16-hour course is
designed to provide first-level civilian supervisors the basic skills, knowledge, and abilities
required to supervise military personnel. First-level civilian supervisors who supervise military
members must attend this course. This training is not required for those supervisors who have
gained substantial experience through assignment in a professional position at a base or staff-
level military personnel office or function. In addition to contacting your Employee
Development Manager/Specialist, further information is available about CBI on the web at
http://www.au.af.mil/au/cpd/, then clicking on the Human Resources Division (HRD).
A2.5. Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Civilian Personnel Management Course
(NPMC). First-level military and civilian supervisors of NAF employees must receive training
in NAF policies, practices, and procedures as required by AFMAN 34-310. The NAF Human
Resource Office offers the NPMC course.

A2.6. Overseas. MAJCOMs and servicing civilian personnel flights (CPF) in overseas areas
develop and present training courses for military and civilian supervisors of local national (LN)
employees to meet local needs. No standard Air Force course will be developed due to the wide
diversity in LN personnel programs.

  GUIDE FOR IDENTIFYING NEEDS, PRIORITIZING NEEDS, AND EVALUATING
     COMMAND PROGRAM OPERATIONS USED IN PREPARING THE AITP

A4.1. Part 1--Identification of Training Needs.
   A4.1.1. Training Needs. A wide range of influences may mask a valid training need unless
   handled as a performance objective. The objective is based on job specifications, future
   changes to work methods, or to meet individual employee job-related development or
   manner of performance either in the current or future tense.
   A4.1.2. Training Need Indicators. Positive responses to the following series of indicators
   may reveal a training need.
A4.2. General Indicators.
   A4.2.1. Are you installing or planning to install new equipment, systems, or procedures for
   application in the near future?
   A4.2.2. Are you significantly changing programs or projected staffing level (e.g. major
   reorganizations)?
   A4.2.3. Are you considering any military-to-civilian conversions?
   A4.2.4. Have your inspection, evaluation, or audit reports highlighted conditions indicating
   the need for training?
   A4.2.5. Are you contemplating contracting-out initiatives?
   A4.2.6. Have you experienced Reductions-in-Force (RIF) within your work site, or do you
   anticipate such actions in the future?
   A4.2.7. Are you considering affirmative action goals when identifying training?
   A4.2.8. Is training required for APDP certification at the appropriate level for the position?
   A4.2.9. Have you considered how automation will change the occupation or skill mix of
   your worksite?
   A4.2.10. Are you experiencing significant changes in the state-of-the-art for certain
   scientific and engineering disciplines?
   A4.2.11. Are you experiencing critical recruitment and retention problems?
   A4.2.12. Have you reviewed regulations and are data system inquiries completed to ensure
   directed training is planned and coordinated (e.g. labor contract negotiations and drug and
   alcohol abuse)?
A4.3. Specific Indicators.
   A4.3.1. Have you reviewed what types and how many previously identified valid training
   needs were not met? Does the need still exist? (Use last fiscal year’s AITP.)
   A4.3.2. Have you identified individual employee performance problems that were not
   caused by attitudinal or motivational factors?
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                          49


   A4.3.3. Do you recognize and understand formal training and development activities
   required by career management programs?
   A4.3.4. Have you reviewed staffing plans, program documents, unit manning documents,
   and mission requirements to identify training needs?
   A4.3.5. Have you screened career enhancement plans to identify formal training
   requirements?
   A4.3.6. Does the training fall under DAWIA, and are specific DAU courses required?
   A4.3.7. Have you identified specific training needs in IDPs, as appropriate?
   A4.3.8. Have you identified positions for Developmental Opportunity Program (DOP)
   participants?
   A4.3.9. Have you considered establishing intern positions for intake of new personnel?
   A4.3.10. Have you gained new personnel through Reduction In Force (RIF)?
   A4.3.11. Do you anticipate implementing the Student Educational Employment Program
   (SEEP)?
   A4.3.12. Have you considered using Worker-Trainee Program (WTP) when setting up your
   positions?
   A4.3.13. Are you aware of, or contemplating using Veterans" Readjustment Act
   placements?
A4.4. Selecting the Method of Training. The decision to select a formal training course or
developmental experience requires careful consideration. Positive responses to any one or all of
the following questions may indicate that formal training is not needed:
   A4.4.1. Will a change in the method of doing the work result in the desired objective?
   A4.4.2. Can a review of the work tasks for performance compliance eliminate the need for
   training?
   A4.4.3. Would improved communications solve the performance problem?
   A4.4.4. Can OJT satisfy the need?
   A4.4.5. Could self-development provide the KSAs needed to improve performance, and has
   the employee been encouraged to participate?
   A4.4.6. Would a detail or informal developmental experience, rather than formal training,
   satisfy the training need?
   A4.4.7. Will formal training be directly transferable to the work situation?
A4.5. Part 2--Prioritizing Training Needs. Once training needs have been properly
determined they need to be assigned a priority or rank. Determination of training priorities is a
critical judgment process accomplished by managers and supervisors.
   A4.5.1. Variables and Needs. The process should involve comparison of the predominant
   variables listed below to the training need that has been identified:
 50                                           AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


       A4.5.1.1. Timing. When must the training be accomplished? Is the timing critical to
       successful accomplishment of work functions, tasks, responsibilities, and ultimately,
       mission activities? Would delays be adverse to effective work completion?
       A4.5.1.2. Cost and Benefit Ratio. In terms of money and time expenditures, are the
       results of training expected to outweigh those costs? Can the benefits be readily
       quantified and tied to valid methods for measuring results?
   A4.5.2. Situation and Environment. What are the driving forces behind the training need?
   Are these forces readily apparent, translatable to individual employee needs, and recognized
   by reviewing officials? Some of the more critical and recognizable forces are:
       A4.5.2.1. Acquisition of new systems or machines (weapons, computers, programs, etc.)
       that need highly specialized skills to maintain and operate.
       A4.5.2.2. Radical technology shifts or new directions in the state-of-the-art.
       A4.5.2.3. Civilian work force dynamics involving work force expansion, losses,
       resignations, retirements, promotions, and reassignments. (Analysis done by the staffing
       function in preparing the staffing plan provides the data necessary to assess this
       influence.)
       A4.5.2.4. Programs slated for implementation at a specified future date where additional
       skills will be needed.
       A4.5.2.5. Military-to-civilian manpower space conversions where labor market
       conditions are known to be limited in supplying the associated skills.
       A4.5.2.6. Employee performance can be used to determine whether training is necessary
       to enhance already high levels of performance or to improve substandard performance. If
       employee performance is deficient, determine whether the poor performance is based on
       definite formal training need rather than unwillingness to perform the duties of the job.
NOTE: Assigning priorities for Continuous Learning (CL) with the Acquisition Workforce. CL
augments APDP training as indicated in paragarph 1.4.1 The CL requirement only begins to be a
factor once an individual has met the APDP certification requirements of his or her current
position. Further information can be found at web site
http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/acq_workf/career_training/cl.html.
   A4.5.3. Impact Estimation. Can a "bad case" situation be depicted and rationalized to show
   tangible effects of an unmet training need? Can lack of training be tied directly to a
   production, program, or mission problem? Can impact estimates be demonstrated by cost
   saving or avoidance analysis? Such estimates must be documented to higher headquarters.
   A4.5.4. Assigning Priorities. Each variable must be carefully assessed. Based on this
   analysis, a priority must be assisgned according to the following definitions:
       A4.5.4.1. Priority 1 --Training that must be accomplished in the immediate training
       cycle to avoid an adverse mission effect. At the most urgent level, these requirements
       take priority over all other command and/or career program requirements. In using this
       rating, command and career programs are saying the training is critical for the day-to-day
       mission.
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                         51


      A4.5.4.2. Priority 2 --Training required for systematic replacement of skilled
      employees through career management or other work force development programs in
      order to maintain the Air Force’s readiness posture. The training is needed to maximize
      the skill erosion factor. Deferment would have an adverse mission effect over an
      intermediate term.
      A4.5.4.3. Priority 3 --Training designed to increase the efficiency and productivity of
      adequately performing employees. Training fosters the effective use of resources to
      improve the Air Force’s mission capability. Deferment beyond the immediate training
      cycle would have little immediate adverse mission effect, but would preclude or delay
      improving present mission accomplishment.
   A4.5.5. MTC Review. MTC review actions should follow similar analyses in validating
   installation and command level training and financial management plans. When appropriate,
   committees may alter priority codes.
   A4.5.6. Advisory Role. EDMs and CEDMs should provide individual supervisors,
   managers, and respective committee technical advice and assistance in the overall priority
   determination process.
A4.6. Part 3-Evaluating Courses and Developmental Experiences.
   A4.6.1. Measurement Techniques. Follow-on job performance is the most reliable method
   for evaluating effectiveness of any training course. Before accomplishing training,
   supervisors should select an evaluation method that can best measure the performance or
   productivity objective that the training is expected to enhance. Objective may be to improve
   work quality, quantity, timeliness, or any combination of these elements. Table A4.1
   provides examples of evaluating methods that may be used to measure attainment of specific
   training objectives.
   A4.6.2. Critiques. Another important evaluation tool is the course critique. Employees
   attending formal training or participating in a developmental experience must periodically be
   solicited for their assessment of the training.
   A4.6.3. Uses of Evaluation. The major purpose in evaluating training is to determine if
   training objectives have been achieved. The real value of course evaluation data, however, is
   its use in the following:
      A4.6.3.1. Determining performance and productivity improvements.
      A4.6.3.2. Making program changes or modifications, e.g., eliminating training of little
      value, changing content or method of training, reassessing or revising course objectives,
      and redirecting emphasis into more important or critical areas.
      A4.6.3.3. Keeping management informed of training results and activities.
      A4.6.3.4. Formulating future plans for training and development.
      A4.6.3.5. Providing information to higher headquarters for the purpose of improving
      management decisions and budget and program support.
      A4.6.3.6. Compiling quality reports that include narrative statements as to the value of
      training to the installation.
 52                                          AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


A4.7. Part 4--Evaluating the Overall Training Program.
   A4.7.1. Program Evaluation. Program Evaluation of education and training functions include
   a systematic review of operations in each function or organizational unit, on a continuing
   basis. The primary uses of reviewing education and training evaluation data is to keep
   management informed of the effectiveness of ongoing programs, the return-on-investment
   realized from these activities, and the need to improve services. The EDM/S must be able to
   look beyond the evaluation of individual training courses and integrate them into an
   evaluation of the total training program. Evaluation should attempt to estimate the extent to
   which economies and improved operations have resulted from training.
   A4.7.2. Evaluation Data. Sources of program evaluation data include assessment of the
   organization and administration of training, the training itself, and the results of training.
   EDM should ensure a system is in place to manage and monitor an effective training program
   so that a quality assessment can be made of adequacy of planning and the value of employee
   training and development.

                                         Attachment 5
      GUIDE FOR FINANCIAL RESOURCE PLANNING AND BUDGET EXECUTION

A5.1. Part 1--Financial Resource Planning.
   A5.1.1. Forecasting. Reliable forecasting of training is critical in meeting mission essential
   training needs. Supervisors, managers, EDM/Ss, and appropriate committees should ensure
   that forecasting takes into account all known requirements and that program and operations
   officials provide the best estimates. Proper management of the needs identification and
   prioritization process increases accuracy in predicting requirements and assures adequate
   funding levels in future years.
   A5.1.2. Budget Formulation. This action involves fine-tuning the next year’s projected
   budget based on bogies issued by HQ USAF/DPDE during the third quarter of each fiscal
   year and the AITP. The following steps should be taken to execute this phase of financial
   planning:
        A5.1.2.1. Obtain total funding requirement and determine the percentage of actual
        funding, e.g. a $10,000 bogey and a $20,000 requirement equals a 50-percent funding
        level.
        A5.1.2.2. Cover as much of the highest priority training requirements as the funding
        level permits. This should establish a training priority funding level cutoff.
        A5.1.2.3. Designate training requirements below the line as deferred requirements for
        possible programming into the second out year.
        A5.1.2.4. Prepare preliminary budget for presentation to and review by the MTC or the
        CECMC.
        A5.1.2.5. Adjust, as necessary, within bogey limit and committee determinations.
        A5.1.2.6. Request impact statements from functional managers for those priority one
        training requirements that remain unfunded.
        A5.1.2.7. Advise key managers of the funding level for their training requirements. (Use
        data products).
A5.2. Part 2--Budget Execution.
   A5.2.1. Executing. An executing the current fiscal year budget, training resource managers
   should closely monitor funding levels to ensure each quarter’s commitments and obligations
   are in line with their authorized funding authority. Should difficulties in meeting funding
   limitations arise, the appropriate committees and key managers should be advised.
   A5.2.2. Justifying. Before moving funding between quarters, the following justification
   should be documented:
        A5.2.2.1. Explanation of the dollar amounts and time frames needed for the movement.
        A5.2.2.2. Identification of the OBAN to be affected.
        A5.2.2.3. Identification of MAJCOM or comparable organization requiring additional
        funding.
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                           57


     A5.2.2.4. Reconciliation of quarterly obligations based on the proposed movement.
  A5.2.3. Additional Funding. When a need for additional funding has been identified, the
  EDM/S should assist functional management in preparing a written request to the parent
  MAJCOM which includes the following information:
     A5.2.3.1. Why funds are needed .
     A5.2.3.2. Why requirement was not included in the AITP.
     A5.2.3.3. Impact statement describing mission impact if funding is not made available.
  A5.2.4. Reporting Excess Funds. When excess funds have been identified, the condition
  must be reported to the parent MAJCOM. The parent MAJCOM will then readjust base
  funding levels and report any excess to HQ USAF/DPDE.
  A5.2.5. Processing and Documenting. Throughout the fiscal year, specific financial
  obligations and expenditures occur. Several processing and documentation variations are
  encountered, depending on the training source selected.
     A5.2.5.1. Identification of the OBAN to be affected.
     A5.2.5.2. A revised quarterly obligation rate based on approval of the additional funding.
     A5.2.5.3. Table A5.1 reflects the processes and documentation involved with respective
     training source selections.
     A5.2.5.4. Training expense accounting is done by fund citation. Therefore, construction
     of the fund citation must be accurate. Components of a fund citation are in Table A5.2
     Additionally, Table A5.3 is provided for when overseas travel is performed. For
     additional information regarding fund citations see the following web site:
     http://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/saffmra/dataeles/components.htm .
  A5.2.6. Resource Management. The linkage between training forms, training records, and
  the accounting system is designed to accomplish sound fiscal management and
  accountability. Training documentation needs to be timely and accurate for reconciliation
  with the accounting system. The relationship between the two is displayed in Table A5.4
  Close attention to the regular review of financial status during the current fiscal year ensures
  sound budget execution. To accomplish this, several tools are available for use. Table A5.5
  provides a listing of some of these tools that can assist in managing training resources.
  A5.2.7. Closing Out the Fiscal Year. The final step in the budget execution process
  involves "balancing the books". It requires a more concentrated review of fund status and
  end-of-year obligations. Closeout deadlines must be met to ensure an acceptable obligation
  rate. The following steps should be taken to ensure a smooth transition between fiscal years:
     A5.2.7.1. Post all commitments by 31 August.
     A5.2.7.2. Assign appropriate fund citations to track training costs extending into the next
     fiscal year.
     A5.2.7.3. Deliver final obligation documents to DAO/AFO by 15 September (or nearest
     working day) each year.
 58                                           AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012


       A5.2.7.4. Reconcile all obligations and accounts by 24 September (or the nearest
       working day) of each year.
   A5.2.8. Managing Training Costs For Delivery in Subsequent Fiscal Years
       A5.2.8.1. Flexibility in the management of civilian training funds is established by
       comptroller decision (CG B238940, 25 Feb 91) with regards to situations when costs for
       training are paid in one fiscal year and require delivery of training in a subsequent fiscal
       year. Training offices may wish to use this decision with the following guidance:
          A5.2.8.1.1. Document the training need during the financial planning process, or
          earlier, then ensure the fund requirement is documented with approval in the budget
          process that supports the requirement.
          A5.2.8.1.2. Complete appropriate training forms, i.e., DD For 1556 or AF Form 9,
          reserve a training space with the provider, and obligate current year funds as required
          by                      DFAS-DE                         7000.4-R                      (

          year-end obligations of funds for training.
          A5.2.8.1.3. Ensure that the time between contracting and delivery is not excessive.
          An example is when the training is not available until early in the next fiscal year and
          the obligation of current year funds is necessary to acquire the training. The time
          between contracting and delivery would be excessive if there is sufficient time to
          contract and deliver training during a fiscal year.
          A5.2.8.1.4. The training has to be unique and not a standard course available from
          another source.

      GUIDE FOR ADMINISTERING NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION PROGRAM

A6.1. Objective and Program Features.
   A6.1.1. Program. New employee orientation programs are designed to assist new
   employees in adjusting readily to their jobs and work environments. Local procedures may
   require attendance by employees at a variety of orientation programs. Supervisors must
   release employees for attendance at appropriate orientations.
   A6.1.2. Objective. The main objective is to provide information that will help employees
   understand the Air Force mission, Core Values, owning command mission, functions of their
   units, conditions and requirements for employment, and to acquire positive motivation at the
   outset.
A6.2. Basic Program Components.
   A6.2.1. Orientation Interview. Initial interview conducted by a CPF representative during
   personnel processing of all new employees. Information furnished covers such subjects as
   housing, transportation, installation facilities, duty hours, pay and pay periods, and insurance
   benefits.
   A6.2.2. Job Induction. Accomplished by the immediate supervisor on arrival of an
   employee newly assigned to a unit. When a new employee reports to a unit, job induction
   should include these activities:
        A6.2.2.1. Welcoming and introducing the employee to coworkers and higher-level
        supervisors.
        A6.2.2.2. Reviewing and discussing the employee’s position description.
        A6.2.2.3. Explaining the work of the unit and the relationship between the employee’s
        work and that of her or his coworkers.
        A6.2.2.4. Reviewing the employee’s performance plan, including requirements and
        standards and FTP, if applicable.
        A6.2.2.5. Reviewing all materials, manuals, etc., that may be needed on the job and an
        explanation of any relevant safety practices.
        A6.2.2.6. Explaining the chain of command and points of contact for information and
        assistance. If union stewards are assigned, appropriate introductions should be made.
        A6.2.2.7. Explaining any unit customs or practices that may not be standard throughout
        the installation, such as hours of duty, lunch and authorized break periods, approving
        officers for leave, and similar matters.
        A6.2.2.8. Touring the work area and available facilities.
        A6.2.2.9. Identifying and discussing any areas of work with which the employee may not
        be familiar and for which she or he may require special attention or training.
        A6.2.2.10. Establishing a definite schedule of assistance for the first few weeks or
        months of the employee’s service.
AFI36-401_LUKEAFBSUP_I 15 MARCH 2012                                                           65


       A6.2.2.11. Assigning initial duties and encouraging the employee to ask questions.
   A6.2.3. Group or Desk Orientation. These are orientations given by a representative of
   the CPF to all employees new to the Air Force. Portions of this orientation may also be
   locally required for employees newly assigned from other Air Force activities and former Air
   Force employees following a break in service. Group orientations should be conducted at
   regular intervals, but, if employment volume is low, desk orientations may be used for one to
   four employees at a time. In either case, the orientation should be furnished within 90 days of
   the employee’s arrival on the installation. Topics to be covered should include:
       A6.2.3.1. Mission of and orientation to the Air Force, the command, and the installation
       A6.2.3.2. Air Force Core Values
       A6.2.3.3. Availability of the Air Force Chief of Staff’s civilian reading list
       (http://www.af.mil/lib/csafbook/csaf_read_civilian.shtml) and the on-line Aerospace
       Power Course (http://www.apc.maxwell.af.mil/)
       A6.2.3.4. Employee’s rights, opportunities, and privileges
       A6.2.3.5. Responsibilities and obligations of Air Force employees, including restrictions
       with regard to gratuities and outside activities
       A6.2.3.6. Leave, pay, health benefits, insurance, retirement, and compensation for injury,
       and, if applicable, special entitlements such as living quarters allowance
       A6.2.3.7. Health, safety, and drug and alcohol abuse (see AFI 35-810)
       A6.2.3.8. Merit promotion policy, equal employment opportunity policy, and incentive
       awards programs
       A6.2.3.9. Employee training and development policy and opportunities
       A6.2.3.10. Security of and safeguarding military information
       A6.2.3.11. Employee and labor relations
       A6.2.3.12. Performance management program.
A6.3. Continuing Orientation. Periodically, and as circumstances warrant, selected subjects
should be presented in a group environment to provide current information. Commander’s call
and awards ceremonies provide an excellent opportunity for addressing matters of interest to the
work force.
A6.4. Overseas. In overseas areas, CPFs should ensure that, in addition to the topics listed
above, orientation is available on various subjects peculiar to the host country for all new
employees. This may include, but need not be limited to, the following:
   A6.4.1. History, culture, and political conditions of the host country
   A6.4.2. Administrative and other agreements governing the status of US citizen employees
   A6.4.3. Suggested standards of conduct for employees, including personal relationships with
   citizens of the host country
   A6.4.4. Where applicable, the use of local currency, military payments certificates, and
   currency conversion

                          CAREER ENHANCEMENT PLAN (CEP)

A7.1. General. The CEP is primarily designed to document required training and development
needs for registrants in Air Force career programs. The CEP replaces the individual development
plan (IDP) and provides an in-system interface between individual training requirements and the
career program training budget process. The CEP is generated from a data system. A CEP is
required for all career program registrants and may be used at major command (MAJCOM) or
local discretion for other employees.
A7.2. Parts to the CEP Document.
   A7.2.1. Required Training--Part 1.
       A7.2.1.1. Contains information on employee training requirements and needs as
       identified by the first-level supervisor and approving official.
       A7.2.1.2. Training requirements are revalidated, annually, in conjunction with the annual
       training survey.
       A7.2.1.3. Indicates course title or course number to help identify courses.
       A7.2.1.4. Must contain required courses (identified by career programs) available
       through central funding. Information on courses and seminars approved for local funding
       by base-level training and development committees may be included at local discretion.
       A7.2.1.5. Supervisors should review required training carefully during the annual
       training survey and, after consultation with the EDM/S, determine which courses will not
       be provided by the end of the fiscal year and determine whether to delete a course or
       request it for the following year. If a course is retained, place a new start date on the CEP.
       New requirements may be added to the form in pen or pencil. This information may be
       used when building the annual training plan.
   A7.2.2. Training History--Part II.
       A7.2.2.1. Contains information on training courses and seminars previously completed
       by the employee.
       A7.2.2.2. Allows supervisors to quickly identify which employees have not completed
       required or mandatory training.
       A7.2.2.3. Provides information on courses completed in residence, by correspondence,
       or through an equivalent course.
A7.3. Approvals.
   A7.3.1. Signature of the supervisor reflects agreement with the required training and
   willingness to release the employee.
   A7.3.2. The approving official has final authority to ensure the employee will be released to
   attend training as scheduled. The approving authority may be the next level supervisor or
   other official as designated by the career program.

A7.4. Linkage with the Annual Training Survey. Each career program registrant, in
conjunction with the annual training survey must have a CEP that links training to maintaining or
improving performance. In preparing the CEP, the supervisor and employee tailor enhancement
activities to individual needs. The supervisor may also use the CEP to help evaluate achievement
or enhancement objectives during the annual performance appraisal process.
A7.5. CEP Process.
   A7.5.1. CEPs are generated by the CPF for all career program registrants during the annual
   training survey and may be used as a survey document. Copies are provided to each
   organizational supervisor to assist them in determining centrally funded training
   requirements for the forthcoming fiscal year.
   A7.5.2. Supervisors review and discuss the CEP with employee and revise the plan based on
   individualized needs assessment, career goals, and centralized training and development
   activities offered by career programs. Information contained in Parts I-III of the CEP is sent
   to the CPF.
A7.6. Data Products. CPF may wish to develop data products to be used in analysis of, and
advice to management on, the career program registrant population, i.e. provide data products to
each organization that lists career program registrants who do not have required training
identified.

   INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND COMPLETION OF DD FORM 1556, REQUEST,
     AUTHORIZATION AGREEMENT, CERTIFICATION OF TRAINING AND
                         REIMBURSEMENT

A8.1. Part 1--Use of DD Form 1556. This form must be used to authorize training of civilian
employees, including direct and indirect costs, for both government and non-government
providers, and for attendance at meetings. It must be used for all formal training of 8 hours or
more and all other training, regardless of length, if costs are involved. Approval of such training
is required before enrolling in or making any commitments for training. Procedures for defense
management education and training (DMET) courses are in the DMET Catalog, DoD Manual
5010.16-C, issued annually. DD Form 1556 is a multipurpose form designed to document a
variety of training transactions such as a:
   A8.1.1. Continued service agreement (CSA)
   A8.1.2. Certification of authorized expenditures and availability of funds
   A8.1.3. Document to authorize advance or reimbursement
   A8.1.4. Certification and record of completion of training
   A8.1.5. Record of equivalency credit
   A8.1.6. Evaluation of training
   A8.1.7. Employee certification regarding receipt of contributions, awards, or payments in
   connection with the training
NOTE:
 For DAWIA/DAU acquisition training, electronic form ACQ Now meets the intent of DD 1556
to ensure that training is properly authorized and documented.
A8.2. Part 2--Ten-Part and Single Cut-Sheet Form Applications.
   A8.2.1. The DD Form 1556 is available as a 10-part set and as a single cut sheet in
   electronic         versions      at   the      following        web        address:
   http://www.dior.whs.mil/icdhome/formsrpt/WWWDDAllbyNumber_1Page11.htm. The
   10-part set is appropriate when:
       A8.2.1.1. Direct training costs will be incurred. (One ten-part set may cover more than
       one attendee. It is a local option to use a continuation sheet (paragraph A8.2.2) or attach a
       cut-sheet for each trainee.)
       A8.2.1.2. A continued service or reimbursement agreement is needed.
       A8.2.1.3. It is required for vendor notification and confirmation.
   A8.2.2. Single Cut-Sheet. Training that does not meet the above criteria is generally
   covered by the single cut-sheet version of the DD Form 1556, as long as sufficient copies are
   submitted to the CPF for evaluation and documentation purposes.

   A8.2.3. Continuation Sheet. As a local option, the CPF may authorize use of a bond paper
   continuation sheet when two or more employees who fall under the authority of the
   approving authorizing official (block 34) are nominated to attend the same course at the same
   time and place. For each employee scheduled to attend, a tabular format is used providing the
   name, organization to which assigned, approving supervisor, and, when appropriate, direct
   cost, indirect cost, and total cost. Aggregated costs of all employees scheduled to attend must
   be entered on DD Form 1556.
      A8.2.3.1. If training requirements are identified by program, subject, training area,
      weapon system, subsystem, new facility, or equipment, rather than by name nomination,
      the continuation sheet must give as much basic information as known, including the
      number of employees to be trained.
      A8.2.3.2. Purposes for which the continuation sheet (attached to appropriately signed
      DD Form 1556) may be used include:
          A8.2.3.2.1. Requesting, approving, and authorizing training.
          A8.2.3.2.2. Establishing monthly and quarterly funds obligation authority with the
          DAO/AFO. (Use with single cut sheet version of DD Form 1556).

                      GUIDE FOR SELECTING TRAINING SOURCES

Part 1--Local Installation-Level Training
A9.1. Self Development. Self-development is that education, training, or other developmental
activity which is self-initiated, funded by the employee (either totally or partially), and taken on
the employee’s own time to better qualify the employee for his or her work or profession, or to
contribute to his or her career opportunities.
A9.2. Proficiency Training. Training designed to improve performance, maintain currency or
develop new KSAs required for successful job performance.
A9.3. Developmental Training. Training designed to enhance or develop KSAs which may be
necessary to progress and perform successfully in higher level positions.
A9.4. On-the-Job-Training (OJT) . Methods used to satisfy a training requirement should be
efficient and economical. OJT should not only be considered for the employees within a
particular work unit, but should also be considered for any displaced employees affected by
downsizing, reassignment, or base closure.
   A9.4.1. OJT is planned, organized, and conducted at the work site. OJT may be provided by
   the supervisor, or another qualified employee who may serve as an instructor.
   A9.4.2. OJT may be classified informal or formal training. OJT may be part of a larger
   program involving classroom instruction or the training program may be solely OJT.
       A9.4.2.1. Informal OJT is training of short duration on a few job elements.
       A9.4.2.2. Formal OJT may require more time and involve more job elements. Formal
       OJT is preplanned and evaluated.
           A9.4.2.2.1. Check sheets are developed which list tasks, knowledge, and
           proficiencies.
           A9.4.2.2.2. Training should be designed to insure the trainee acquires the specific
           proficiency, rather than a specified number of hours.
   A9.4.3. For guidance on conducting OJT, see AFI 36-2201. The basic information may be
   summarized:
       A9.4.3.1. Prepare the training activity.
       A9.4.3.2. Notify and prepare the trainee.
       A9.4.3.3. Show the trainee.
       A9.4.3.4. Let the trainee try.
       A9.4.3.5. Redirect if necessary, and follow-up.

A9.5. Retraining Surplus, Displaced and Dislocated Workers. Restructuring and downsizing
initiatives may result in surplus, displaced or dislocated workers and thereby prompt the need for
retraining, to enhance or sustain marketability, employability and quality of life. Attachment 16
is an excerpt from the Office of Personnel Management Restructuring Information Handbook,
Module 1--Unit B (Guidance), paragraph 10, Training and Retraining, and provides useful

                       GUIDE FOR APPRENTICE PROGRAM PLAN

A10.1. Regular Apprentice Program. Air Force regular apprentice programs are registered
with the US Department of Labor’s Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT) before
activation. The CPF, in coordination with the Training Office, advises managers regarding
preparation of supporting documentation required for BAT approval and certification. Requests
to establish, change, or cancel programs are sent by the servicing CPF, in coordination with the
Training Office, to the parent command for review and transmittal to HQ USAF/DPDE. To
obtain approval, the training, work experience, and schedule, must be described in a written plan
stating terms and conditions of employment, training, and supervision. This plan must:
   A10.1.1. Ensure that each apprentice is under a written apprenticeship agreement, which is
   accomplished by completing AF Form 6, Apprenticeship Agreement.
   A10.1.2. Contain an outline of major job elements in which the apprentice will receive
   supervised work experience, OJT and formal classroom training showing the approximate
   amount of time to be spent in each. Provide for at least 144 hours per year of related formal
   classroom-type instruction. Include at least 2,000 hours of work experience covering a two to
   four year period.
   A10.1.3. Show a progressively increasing schedule of wages, based on successful
   performance of appropriate progress records. Provide for periodic review and evaluation of
   the apprentice’s progress in job performance and related instruction and the maintenance of
   appropriate progress records.
   A10.1.4. Ensure adequate safety training is provided which includes the necessary
   equipment and facilities are available to conduct the training.
   A10.1.5. Document advanced standing or credit before program entry for previously
   acquired experience, training, or skills with commensurate wages for any advanced
   progression step so granted. Show the minimum qualifications required for persons entering
   the apprenticeship program. Include a probationary period as required for new employees,
   when appropriate.
   A10.1.6. Ensure that qualified training personnel and adequate supervision are provided.
   A10.1.7. Provide for recognition of successful completion by preparing a Certificate of
   Completion of Apprenticeship before graduation ceremonies for each apprentice completing
   all program requirements.
   A10.1.8. Provide for the prompt submission of any modification or amendment to the plan.
A10.2. Special Apprentice Program Special apprentice programs are formal training
programs normally less than 2 years. Formal classroom training, OJT, and performance
requirements are established using instructional systems development (ISD) methodology. From
this methodology, a formal written training plan which specifies in 6-month increments all
experience, OJT, formal classroom training, and performance requirements. Wages to be paid are
determined in advance for each 6-month period consistent with successful performance, program
completion, and skill to be acquired. Each trainee is provided a copy of the written training plan.
Trainees completing the program are provided appropriate recognition.

    AIR FORCE CONTINUED SERVICE AGREEMENT (CSA) FOR CIVILIAN
                          EMPLOYEES

 1. I agree that upon completion of the Air Force sponsored training described below, I will
    work for the US Air Force (see AFI 36-401, Chapter 4, for CSA requirements), in
    accordance with the US Air Force CSA policy. (The length of full-time training is 8 hours
    for each day of training, up to a maximum of 40 hours a week.) I understand that if I
    voluntarily enter a period of non-pay status during the period of service obligation (i.e.,
    LWOP to accompany a spouse moving to a new duty location), the period of obligated
    service may be extended by length of time in a non-pay status.
 2. If I voluntarily leave the Air Force before completing the period of service shown in item 7
    below, I AGREE to reimburse the Air Force for the tuition, travel, per diem, books and
    materials, fees, administrative overhead costs, and other related expenses (EXCLUDING
    SALARY) paid in connection with my training as shown in item 8 below. However, the
    amount of the reimbursement will be reduced on a pro-rated basis for the percentage of
    completion of the obligated service. (For example, if the cost of training is $3,000 and I
    complete two-thirds of the obligated service, I will reimburse the Air Force $1,000 instead
    of the original $3,000.)
 3. I FURTHER AGREE that if I voluntarily leave the Air Force to enter the service of another
     federal agency or other organization in any branch of the government before completing
     the period of service agreed to in item 7 below, I will give my servicing civilian personnel
     office written notice of at least 10 workdays, during which time a determination
     concerning reimbursement will be made. If I fail to give this advance notice, I AGREE to
     pay the amount of additional expenses (Title 5 U.S.C. 4109(a)(2)) incurred by the
     government in this training.
 4. I understand that any amounts which may be due the Air Force as a result of any failure on
    my part to meet the terms of this agreement may be withheld from any monies owed me by
    the government, or may be recovered by such other methods as are approved by law.
 5. I FURTHER AGREE to obtain approval from the employee development manager
    responsible for authorizing training requests of any proposed change in my approved
    training program involving course and schedule changes, withdrawals or incompletions,
    and increased costs. If I fail to complete Air Force sponsored training I AGREE to
    reimburse the Air Force training and related costs as in item 8 below.
 6. I acknowledge that this agreement does not in any way commit the government to continue
    my employment. I understand that if there is a transfer of my service obligation to another
    federal agency or other organization in any branch of the government, the agreements in
    items 1, 2, and 3 of this section will remain in effect until I have completed my obligated
    service with that other agency or organization.
 7. Period of obligation service is from _____________ to _____________ beginning on or
    about _____________.
 8. Projected costs are:

      GUIDE FOR DECLINING SELECTION UNDER CIVILIAN COMPETITIVE
                    DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (CCDP)

A13.1. Declination, withdrawal and removal are used synonymously in this attachment and are
all deemed to mean "exit" from a specific program under CCDP, for which an employee was
selected to attend.
A13.2. Declining selection for any program covered under CCDP must be approved by the
nominating organization [MAJCOM/CVs and Secretariat (SAF)/AF two-letter offices].
Employees who decline school attendance after selection, without approval of the nominating
agency, will be restricted from consideration for the CCDP for a two-year period.
A13.3. Management and/or individual declinations for mission essential or humanitarian
removal from a program must be supported with reasonable justification.
   A13.3.1. Mission Essential : The approval authority will normally approve a mission
   essential removal if the employee’s program participation would have an adverse mission
   impact. Removal, if granted, will be without prejudice.
   A13.3.2. Humanitarian : The approval authority will normally approve a humanitarian
   withdrawal under the conditions below. Withdrawal, if granted, will be without prejudice.
       A13.3.2.1. The recent death (within 6 months of course start date) of your spouse or your
       child or stepchild under the age of 18 who is living in your home at the time of death.
       A13.3.2.2. The terminal illness of a family member when death is imminent within the

                              PROGRAMS WITH INDUSTRY

     The Education with Industry (EWI) program is a 10-12 month, non-degree management
development program sponsored jointly by AFIT and leading industries and government
agencies throughout the country. EWI programs are designed to develop qualities and abilities in
selected officers and civilians necessary for effective acquisition management and professional
or technical leadership. Since an individualized program is the intent of EWI, each company is
encouraged to establish a program unique to itself and to the needs of the student. Application
for this program is made through AFPC/DPK. (For further instructions for EWI see AFIT
Instruction 36-103.)
The STREAMLINE program is a short-term program which is designed to improve acquisition
relationships between the government and major contractors. The program places highly
experienced contracting officers and civilians with various civilian contractors for five to six
months. Upon completion of the program, all students are required to write a report summarizing
their ideas for improving government and/or industry processes, based on their work with
industry.

                          GUIDE FOR RETRAINING WORKERS

A16.1. Differences Between Training and Retraining Retraining programs are designed to
prepare individuals for different careers, or to perform differently. The term "training" as we
know it, is generally designed to help us perform our current jobs better. OPM defines
retraining as (1) training and other development administered to an individual to close skills
gaps resulting from obsolescence; and (2) training and development designed to equip an
individual with knowledge and skills leading to another occupation. Retraining focuses on the
basic competencies needed in a new or redesigned job and rarely addresses advanced level
technical skills.
A16.2. Purposes of Retraining.         Retraining assists agencies in redirecting their human
resources to address skill imbalances or projected skill shortages resulting from internal and
external factors. Agencies can use retraining programs to expand the knowledge and skills of
workers through multi-skilling and cross-training; and to help stabilize the work environment
and build morale, particularly when used as an alternative to downsizing.
A16.3. Current Laws Affecting Retraining.            Several valuable programs are available for
retraining employees, as described below:
   A16.3.1. Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance Act assists workers who
   have been laid off and are unlikely to return to their previous occupation.
       A16.3.1.1. Administered by the Department of Labor, this program allows a wide range
       of services to help individuals such as skills assessments, job development, counseling,
       and job search assistance.
   A16.3.2. Section 5 CFR 410.301(c), which is derived from Chapter 41 of title 5 U.S.C.,
   permits agencies to retrain employees for other occupations based on organizational needs
   and when vacancies exist. If new jobs offer more promotion potential to employees, the
   employees must also compete to enter retraining programs. These competitive processes
   must be consistent with merit principles and EEO considerations.
       A16.3.2.1. The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 amended Chapter 41,
       section 4101(4) of title 5, U.S.C. to define "training" as the process of providing for and
       making available to an employee, and placing or enrolling the employee in, a planned,
       prepared, and coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or routine of
       instruction or education, in scientific, professional, technical, mechanical, trade, clerical,
       fiscal, administrative, or other fields which will improve individual and organizational
       performance and assist in achieving the agency’s mission and performance goals.
       A16.3.2.2. The Act also amended section 4103(b) by allowing the agencies to train any
       employee of the agency to prepare that employee for placement in another agency, if the
       head of the agency determines that such training would be in the best interests of the
       Government. The amendment relaxed the requirement that the employee be faced with
       separation before he or she could be trained for placement in another agency.

   A16.3.3. In January 1995, the U. S. Office of Personnel Management issued final regulations
   that authorize an agency to issue a Certification of Expected Separation (CES) to an
   employee who the agency expects will be separated within 6 months by a reduction in force.
   The CES notice allows employees to register early for outplacement and retraining services
   provided by the agency, OPM, and through programs under the Job Training Partnership Act
   administered by the Department of Labor.
A16.4. Elements of A Successful Retraining Program.           A good agency retraining program
should have the following elements:
   A16.4.1. Top management support;
   A16.4.2. Program goals linked to the strategic goals of the organization;
   A16.4.3. Good communication and information sharing;
   A16.4.4. Retrainees are assured of placement;
   A16.4.5. Management ensures that employees who enter retraining programs have the basic
   skills required for entry;
   A16.4.6. Employee selection for the programs is designed so retrainees have the greatest
   opportunity for success;
   A16.4.7. A retraining team should be formed for large organizations;
   A16.4.8. Needs assessment is conducted to determine what competencies are needed for new
   occupations;
   A16.4.9. A retraining curriculum is developed;
   A16.4.10. Managers and Human Resource professionals of the new organization help
   develop and deliver components of the program;
   A16.4.11. The program incorporates counseling to help employees cope with the
   psychological consequences of changing or losing jobs;
   A16.4.12. The program includes technical, interpersonal, and analytical skills training as
   well as activities that help individuals adjust to other work cultures or environments; and,
   A16.4.13. The program includes classroom and structured on-the-job training.
A16.5. Department Of Labor and State Employment Services Activities.                     The State
Employment Offices offer many services for employees facing the possibility of job loss. For
those facing unemployment, the local state employment office serves not only to make referrals
but is usually the office where employees get unemployment compensation. If planned in
advance, many such offices will provide personnel who will come on-site to register employees
and explain their rights and benefits. Employment counselors may also be available to be on-site
for lunchtime presentations to job clubs. Early contact with the state employment office is often
beneficial to allow the local office to prepare for registration of displaced employees.
