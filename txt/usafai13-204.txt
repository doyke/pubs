                                    AIRFIELD OPERATIONS

1.1. Location and Hours of Operation for USAFA Airfields. 306 FTG flying operations
occur in three locations: USAFA Airfield (KAFF) (Attachment 3), Bullseye Auxiliary Airfield
(ICAO ID CO90) (Attachment 6), and Aardvark for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)/Unmanned
Aerial System (UAS). Bullseye can be used for flying activity as published in the Visual Flight
Rules (VFR) Supplement unless a notice to airmen (NOTAM) states otherwise. All runways
located at KAFF are established landing surfaces and are continually inspected and maintained.
The primary landing area for gliders at KAFF is the 4,500 foot by 500 foot grass strip
immediately west of Runway 34L/16R, including the Alternate Sailplane Landing Areas A, B, C,
and D (Attachment 5).
     1.1.1. Academy Tower and Class D airspace (Attachment 7) shall be opened as published in
     the VFR Supplement unless a NOTAM states otherwise. KAFF Class D airspace is normally
     divided into two sectors, on the east to support Academy Powered Flight Programs (PFP) and
     on the west to support glider and parachute operations. The dividing line is a north to south
     line established by the tower midfield access road.
     1.1.2. Locally assigned aircraft are authorized to use Bullseye Auxiliary Airfield
     (Attachment 6). Other organizations requesting the use of Bullseye Airfield must submit
     their request through Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) and must be approved by
     the 306 FTG/CC. 306 FTG units will schedule use of Bullseye Airfield via the weekly
     airfield schedule. 306 FTG units shall ensure fire support is in place prior to using Bullseye
     and will notify them when flying is complete.
     1.1.3. AMOPS, with the concurrence of the 306 FTG Supervisor of Flying (SOF), will
     coordinate on airfield opening and closing in accordance with local operating instructions
     and checklists. AMOPS shall coordinate airfield openings and closures with Academy
     Tower and advise other support facilities (Weather, etc.) when the airfield opens and closes.
     Airfield support facilities personnel will not be released until all flight activities have ceased
     for the day (exception: USAFA Aero Club).
     1.1.4. All rocket launches, RPA/UAS and radio-controlled aircraft within USAFA
     boundaries shall be coordinated through Airspace Management (333-4617/333-0595)
     regardless of the altitude.
1.2. Airfield Supervision. Primary command and supervision of airfield operations are the
responsibility of the 306th Flying Training Group Available (FTGA) as outlined in Chapter 7 of
this instruction. AMOPS is the staff point of contact for the FTGA. The 306 FTG SOF, 94th
Flying Training Squadron (FTS) Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup), 98 FTS Ops Sup, 557 FTS
Ops Sup, and the Aero Club/Academy Flight Training Center (AFTC) SOF are the operational
points of contact for resolving conflicts between the flying organizations and airfield support
agencies.
1.3. Airfield Security. The following procedures establish security measures to be followed by
personnel working within USAFA Airfield.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                       7


  1.3.1. The USAFA Airfield is a Controlled Area. Visitors to the USAFA Airfield must
  report directly to the agency they are visiting or to AMOPS.                         Visitors to
  Soaring/Parachuting/Powered Flight Operations must report to the 94 FTS Operations Center
  in the South end of Building 9211, the 98 FTS Operations Center located in the North end of
  Building 9201, or the 557 FTS Operations Desk located in the west side of Building 9207
  respectively. Visitors shall be escorted at all times by the host unit and personnel familiar
  with airfield operations while they are within controlled areas. The controlled area is marked
  by ―Controlled Area‖ signs placed around the airfield. Personnel authorized in the controlled
  area will have a blue ―AF‖ on their proximity card. An ―AF‖ on the proximity cards does not
  authorize the individual to drive on the airfield. To drive on the airfield requires an AF Form
  483, Certificate of Competency, issued by USAFA AMOPS in addition to the ―AF.‖
  1.3.2. Keys to buildings and combinations to gate locks will be issued only to people with an
  operational requirement. Keys will be issued using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt,
  or similar control logs monitored by the building custodians.
  1.3.3. AMOPS personnel will inform 10th Security Forces Squadron (10 SFS), at 333-2000,
  when the airfield is closed for the day. Only Security Forces (SF) personnel with a valid AF
  Form 483 will provide patrol coverage of USAFA Airfield when the airfield is closed. All
  agencies on the airfield shall ensure their buildings and areas are secured at the end of each
  duty day. AMOPS will ensure all gates are secure at the end of flying activities.
  1.3.4. Personnel working within the confines of the airfield are required to have a
  government identification card in their possession and a proximity card with an ―AF‖
  designation.
  1.3.5. Unauthorized Personnel on Airfield.
     1.3.5.1. All unauthorized personnel on the premises are subject to apprehension or
     detention. If suspected unauthorized personnel are seen on the airfield, advise AMOPS
     who will investigate and notify SF if required. Privately Owned Vehicles (POV) are not
     allowed on the airfield without a POV pass (exception: personnel may drive their POVs
     to and from the parking lots adjacent to the control tower via the midfield access road).
     Any POV observed on the airfield will be considered unauthorized until it is verified that
     the vehicle has a POV pass (see the Airfield Driving Instruction for additional
     information on POV passes).
     1.3.5.2. Monitor suspected unauthorized persons until AMOPS or SF personnel arrive
     and, if needed, verbally challenge and escort the suspected individuals away from
     aircraft, vehicles and Controlled Movement Areas (CMA). If necessary, initiate
     appropriate antitheft and antihijack procedures. (See paragraph 4.10.)
  1.3.6. Building 9231, the control tower, is designated a controlled area.
     1.3.6.1. Commanders, tower, radio maintenance SOF, and Soaring Control Officer
     (SCO) personnel may have cipher lock codes. Cadets must use established entry
     procedures each time to ensure the SCO is ready for cadet position changes. Tours and
     impromptu visits by unit members must be coordinated with Air Traffic Control (ATC)
     to ensure noninterference with tower operations.

        1.3.6.2. The ATC supervisor on duty is responsible for overall building security
        decisions. The 94 FTS Ops Sup is responsible for securing the simulator room and
        external doors used by cadets on the north and west side of the building.
1.4. Noise Complaint Referrals. Noise complaints will be referred to the USAFA Public
Affairs Community Relations Office (333-7746).
1.5. Refueling Restrictions. Aircraft refueling restrictions will, as a minimum, be conducted
IAW Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standard (AFOSHSTD) 91-38, Hydrocarbon
Fuels - General, and TO 00-25-172.
     1.5.1. At USAFA Airfield:
        1.5.1.1. All aircraft parking spots and the isolation pad are considered aircraft refueling
        pits. In addition, a location on the 94 FTS midfield apron (at the north end), is painted
        with white boxes to identify aircraft and refueling vehicle parking spots. This location is
        also designated as a refueling pit. Aero Club aircraft utilize the refueling tank adjacent to
        the transient ramp. Aircraft being refueled shall be chocked at all times.
        1.5.1.2. When the wind reaches 25 knots observed (gusts or steady state), aircraft shall
        be tied down while refueling. Aero Club aircraft are exempt, as there are no tie-down
        anchors located at the USAFA Aero Club refueling tank. When high winds are
        considered dangerous (30 knots or higher) or thunderstorms/lightning are within a five
        nautical-mile radius, refueling operations shall be suspended on aircraft not fully
        enclosed within a hangar.
        1.5.1.3. If a controller or SOF observes refueling in progress with winds out of limits,
        they shall notify AMOPS.
        1.5.1.4. When lightning is within 10 nautical miles (NM) of the airport, AMOPS will
        notify refuelers.
        1.5.1.5. When lightning is within 5 NM of the airport, AMOPS will direct refuelers to
        cease operations and alert workers to seek cover.
        1.5.1.6. All refueling operations will stop when pedestrians, vehicles or taxiing aircraft
        penetrate the 50-foot clear radius of the aircraft being refueled.
1.6. Fire and Rescue Support. The 10th Civil Engineer Squadron Fire Protection Flight
(10 CES/CEF) is responsible for the fire fighting and rescue coverage of the KAFF and Bullseye
during normal operations. If 10 CES/CEF fire-fighting/rescue capabilities are reduced to the
point where adequate coverage of these airfields is no longer possible, the following procedures
will apply:
     1.6.1. 10 CES/CEF will notify AMOPS (or Aero Club when the airfield is closed) that fire-
     fighting/rescue capability is reduced at KAFF or Bullseye. AMOPS shall notify the 306 FTG
     SOF. Additionally:
        1.6.1.1. Departures will not be authorized.
        1.6.1.2. Landings will be limited to full stops only.
        1.6.1.3. Emergency aircraft should be advised of reduced fire-fighting/rescue support.
     1.6.2. The 306 FTGA has waiver authority for paragraph 1.6.1. restrictions.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                       9


1.7. Dropped Objects. Items dropped onto the airfield, including cut-away parachutes and
helmets, will require an AETC Form 435, Mishap Data Worksheet, from the organization
responsible for the item. Wind Drift Indicators (WDI), Soaring Drop Competition Packages, and
Cadet Competition Flying Team (CCFT) Practice Message Drop Packages are exempt from this
requirement unless they create a hazard. To the maximum extent possible, units that drop WDI,
CCFT, etc., should remove these items from the airfield, as they are a foreign object damage
(FOD) hazard. The following procedures will apply:
   1.7.1. WDIs in CMA - Pilot/Jump Master informs the Drop Zone Control Officer (DZCO) of
   location. DZCO passes location to AMOPS. AMOPS will remove WDI from airfield.
   1.7.2. WDIs in DZ - Pilot/Jump Master informs DZCO of location. DZCO sends 98 FTS
   representative to retrieve WDI.
   1.7.3. WDIs on non-CMA/Other locations - Pilot Jump Master informs DZCO of location.
   DZCO sends 98 FTS representative to retrieve WDI.
1.8. 10 CES Support Procedures. All work on the airfield will be coordinated through
AMOPS. AMOPS shall be informed of all work orders and projects submitted by flying
squadrons/support facilities within the airfield environment.
   1.8.1. 10 CES work order support, service calls, and equipment maintenance responsibilities
   are done IAW AFI 32-1001, Operations Management.
   1.8.2. Scheduled power and other utility interruptions must be coordinated through AMOPS.
   AMOPS will disseminate this information to affected airfield agencies.
   1.8.3. 10 CES personnel will be familiar with the following procedures prior to performing
   routine or emergency maintenance within the boundaries of the airfield:
       1.8.3.1. 10 CES personnel shall coordinate with AMOPS prior to starting maintenance
       on the airfield. Vehicle traffic to the midfield area shall use the access road between the
       runways.
       1.8.3.2. Maintenance personnel that need to work within the CMA shall maintain radio
       contact with Academy Ground/Skytrain. If maintenance personnel do not have a valid
       USAFA Airfield Driver's License or do not speak English, the agency responsible for the
       maintenance shall provide an English-speaking escort. The escort must possess a current
       USAFA Airfield Driver's License. AMOPS will escort maintenance personnel as a last
       resort or when safety dictates.
       1.8.3.3. When the airfield is closed, maintenance personnel shall contact the Fire Dept at
       333-2051 before crossing any runways. AMOPS will issue a NOTAM for all
       maintenance activity conducted while the airfield is closed.
1.9. Snow Removal Operations. The USAFA Snow Removal and Ice Control Plan govern
snow removal operations for KAFF.
   1.9.1. No aircraft are to be positioned on any ramp, taxiway, or runway while snow removal
   operations are in progress unless approved by/coordinated with AMOPS.
   1.9.2. Based on the flying schedule, the 306 FTG SOF will advise AMOPS which side of the
   airfield (east or west) should be cleared first. AMOPS will, in-turn, coordinate with the snow
   removal supervisor.
10                                                             USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


  1.9.3. Road conditions permitting, AMOPS personnel will make every effort to be at their
  duty stations NLT one hour prior to published airfield opening. This includes periods when
  conditions on the airfield will not support VFR flying operations. In addition, all deviations
  from scheduled airfield hours shall be published via NOTAM in a timely manner.
  1.9.4. If the forecasted weather condition materializes, AMOPS will coordinate a plan of
  action through the 306 OSS chain of command. AMOPS personnel are considered ―mission
  essential,‖ and will make every effort to report for duty. However, there may be times when
  it is unsafe for them to travel to the Airfield Management Operations Center. In this case,
  they will immediately contact the Airfield Manager, who will determine the appropriate
  course of action.
  1.9.5. If the forecasted weather condition does not materialize, operations will commence as
  scheduled.
  1.9.6. All requested changes to the snow removal priorities must be through the 306 FTG
  SOF. Do not contact snow removal personnel directly with requests for changes to the snow
  removal priorities. AMOPS will only consider priority changes from the 306 FTG SOF.
  Flying units should not make information and/or change requests to AMOPS, but utilize the
  306 FTG SOF as their POC.
  1.9.7. AMOPS determines the need for and directs snow removal operations and will:
     1.9.7.1. Coordinate with 10 CES on any changes to the USAFA Snow Removal and Ice
     Control Plan.
     1.9.7.2. Make contact with the snow removal supervisor prior to opening the airfield,
     providing him/her with a radio to allow for two-way radio communication between ATC,
     AMOPS, and the supervisor.
     1.9.7.3. Brief the snow removal supervisor that snow removal crews needing to work on
     any portion of an open CMA must have a valid USAFA Airfield Driver’s License and in
     possession of radio capable of direct two-way communication with the tower or be
     escorted by AMOPS. Ensure snow removal crews work within the confines of closed
     movement areas if these requirements are not met or they are unescorted. Ensure the
     supervisor is aware of areas that are closed/open and snow removal priorities that may
     have changed based on the day’s flying schedule.
     1.9.7.4. Notify ATC and the 306 FTG SOF of portions of the airfield that will be closed
     for snow removal and any airfield hazards due to snow or ice.
     1.9.7.5. Restrict other vehicles, personnel, and aircraft from entering areas where snow
     removal operations are being conducted. Aircraft must remain in hangars until snow
     removal on their respective ramps is complete and AMOPS has conducted an inspection
     of the ramp. Squadrons should contact 306 FTG SOF prior to towing aircraft onto ramps
     where snow removal appears complete. In accordance with (IAW) the contract for the
     Base Support Contractor, aircraft must not be on the ramp during snow removal
     operations.
     1.9.7.6. Conduct a runway condition reading (RCR) IAW paragraph 2.12.
     1.9.7.7. Coordinate with the 306 FTG SOF to determine if additional snow removal is
     required to meet the units’ operational requirements.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                    11


       1.9.7.8. Train snow removal personnel to sign out a radio and contact AMOPS before
       removal efforts begin.
       1.9.7.9. Interact directly with the FTGA, 306 FTG SOF and 306 OSS leadership
       concerning snow removal operations. All questions regarding the snow removal effort
       will be directed to the 306 FTG SOF. Squadron schedulers and leadership are
       encouraged to obtain the latest airfield information from the FTGA or the 306 FTG SOF
       and not contact AMOPS directly.
       1.9.7.10. Coordinate with the 306 FTG SOF and record subsequent SOF tour
       changeover(s).
       1.9.7.11. Coordinate with the 306 FTG SOF to determine the units’ ability to conduct
       flight and ground operations based on published RCR reading. Provide an airfield tour as
       requested by the 306 FTG SOF to determine if additional snow removal is required to
       meet the group’s operational requirements prior to conducting flight operations.
       1.9.7.12. Notify the 306 FTG SOF of updated RCR conditions.
   1.9.8. ATC shall provide RCR information to aircraft and include it in Automatic Terminal
   Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts as updates are received. ATC will advise AMOPS of
   any potential problems relating to snow removal and assist AMOPS by restricting other
   vehicles and personnel from areas where snow removal operations are in progress.
1.10. Lightning Procedures. If lightning is reported, the following applies:
   1.10.1. Cumulonimbus observed within 15 miles (Potential for Lightning). The tower
   supervisor shall coordinate with the 306 FTG SOF to determine an appropriate course of
   action (continued operations, divert, weather recall, etc.).
   1.10.2. Lightning within 10 miles. Landings and takeoffs from the airport shall be
   terminated unless operations are allowed to continue by the FTGA. Flight/Parachuting
   operations with lightning within 10 miles of the airfield require FTGA approval.
   1.10.3. Lightning within 5 miles. All personnel will seek cover and flight line operations,
   landings, and takeoffs shall cease unless otherwise directed by the FTGA. AMOPS will
   advise contractors working on the airfield, but the decision for contractors to seek cover or
   depart the airfield rests solely with on-site contractor supervisor.
   1.10.4. The tower supervisor will coordinate with the 306 FTG SOF for actions to be taken
   when lightning is within 15 miles of the airport. Regardless, ATC service or clearances will
   not be denied if pilots elect to land. The 306 FTG SOF/Pilot-in-command will determine
   ground-handling requirements after landing and advise ATC.
1.11. Airfield Operations Board (AOB) and Controlled Movement Area Violation
Working Group (CMAVWG). The AOB will convene at least once per quarter. The
CMAVWG will be coordinated by 306 FTG/SE and convene annually or as directed by the
306 FTG/CC. IAW AFI 13-204, the AOB is comprised of the members listed below.
CMAVWG members are listed with an ―>.‖ UADPMs are invited and encouraged to attend the
CMAVWG meetings in order to provide cross flow information concerning CMAVs. The
CMAVWG and UADPMs will work together to provide lessons learned and recommended
corrective action. CMAVWG meeting minutes will be incorporated in the AOB minutes.

                            USAFA AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT

2.1. Airfield Operational Status. The USAFA Airfield Management is the focal point for
dissemination of all NOTAM information. Base agencies shall coordinate requests for runway
and taxiway closures (i.e., construction, snow removal, etc.) with AMOPS prior to conducting
any activity. Activities approved by 306 FTG/CC/CD will be disseminated to affected airfield
units. The 306 FTG/CC/CD or designated representative is the approval authority for airfield
operations during other than published hours. AMOPS will be staffed one hour prior to sunrise
unless otherwise approved by the AOF/CC.
2.2. Forwarding Flight Data.
   2.2.1. AMOPS and ATC will exchange flight plan information on any 306 FTG or Aero
   Club crosscountry sorties and transient aircraft. The following flight plan information will be
   relayed:
       2.2.1.1. AMOPS will pass departure/arrival information concerning transient and
       crosscountry aircraft to Denver Flight Service Station (FSS) as necessary.
       2.2.1.2. ATC shall relay arrival/departure information on crosscountry, medical
       evacuation, and transient aircraft to AMOPS. ATC shall also relay initial arrival and
       final departure for the day information for UV-18s.
   2.2.2. Pilots filing IFR flight plans should plan to depart VFR and obtain an IFR clearance
   from Colorado Springs Approach Control once airborne. ATC may relay IFR clearances to
   aircraft.
2.3. Flight Plans. All aircraft departing a USAF Installation must file a DD Form 175, Military
Flight Plan, for domestic flights and ICAO 1801, International Flight Plan, for International
flights outside the continental United States. Those flights destined to Honolulu, Alaska, San
Juan Domestic Control Areas and Canada may use a DD Form 175 IAW General Planning.
Note: The FAA Form 7233-1, Flight Plan, is not used at the USAFA airfield.
   2.3.1. For local area flights that depart and terminate at the home or auxiliary field, aircrews
   may also use AF Form 4290, Unplanned Supersonic Flight Activity Log; or an overprinted
   DD Form 175 IAW the AETC Supplement to AFI 11-202V3. Aircrews may also use a
   locally approved form or procedure that meets the minimum flight plan information
   requirements for the type of flight being planned and has been coordinated with AMOPS.
   2.3.2. 306 FTG units use local flight plan forms and are responsible for control/flight
   following of their aircraft.
   2.3.3. Aero Club flight plans will be filed in accordance with the procedures outlined in
   Attachment 13.
   2.3.4. 94 FTS sailplanes/glider aircraft that depart the Academy airfield under tow
   operations will be flight followed by the SCO from takeoff to landing. The SCO is solely
   responsible for tracking all sailplane/glider tow aircraft operations to ensure safe/timely
   arrival at off-USAFA locations. Sailplane/glider tow aircraft operation flight plans and/or
   tracking forms will be maintained by the 94 FTS.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                     15


       2.3.4.1. The USAFA Fire Department (FD) personnel performing Bullseye
       emergency/crash     response     duties   are    authorized    to   conduct    periodic
       tours/examinations/familiarization of the Bullseye airfield by personnel not trained to
       conduct airfield inspections/checks. The purpose is to ensure FD emergency/crash
       response can be accomplished safely and without delay. FD personnel may disperse any
       antelope found on the airfield and to reduce airfield hazards (i.e., no sinkhole has
       appeared in the runway, no dead animals on the runway, no obvious FOD hazard, etc.)
       that they deem necessary to accomplish their duties. FD personnel will call AMOPS
       daily when these have been completed, AMOPS will annotate all FD findings in the
       AMOPS events log (including FD arrival/departure from Bullseye).
       2.3.4.2. Only FD personnel who have completed specified (see AFI 13-204V3,
       paragraph 17.2.1.) AMOPS training (documented in their individual training record) are
       allowed to accomplish an airfield check prior to flying at Bullseye.
2.4. Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) Procedures. Procedures for initiating and relaying NOTAM
information are in AFI 11-208(I). Responsibilities for local initiation and relay of NOTAM
information are provided in AFI 11-208(I) and this instruction.
   2.4.1. Academy Tower is designated as the NOTAM monitor facility.
   2.4.2. AMOPS will advise Academy Tower, Denver FSS, FTGA, 306 FTG SOF, and any
   additional organization applicable of all published NOTAMS.
   2.4.3. AMOPS will coordinate with Academy Tower prior to issuing a NOTAM that closes a
   runway, taxiway, the Sailplane Landing Area (SPLA), or the parachute drop zone (DZ).
   2.4.4. Aircraft with an approved/valid uncontrolled operations waiver can fly uncontrolled at
   USAFA or Bullseye. Uncontrolled periods are when the ATC and AMOPS are not present
   because it is outside published operating hours or a NOTAM has been submitted closing the
   airfield. A NOTAM closing the airfield does not prohibit uncontrolled operations. However,
   uncontrolled operations will adhere to/comply with all other published NOTAM restrictions.
2.5. Performing Airfield Inspections. This section prescribes procedures for the performance
of daily airfield inspections at the USAFA primary airfield and monthly inspections of the
auxiliary airfields.
   2.5.1. Airfield Inspections/Checks: All airfield inspections and checks will be entered in the
   AF Form 3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation, and locally developed Bird/Wildlife
   Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) form.
   2.5.2. Airfield Inspections: The USAFA main airfield inspection will be accomplished
   daily, starting no earlier than 15 minutes before sunrise and no later than 15 minutes after
   sunset. The inspector will accomplish all areas on the daily airfield inspection/check
   checklist. Additional airfield inspections will be conducted and documented with
   representatives from 10 CES and Safety before and after completion of any major
   runway/taxiway/apron construction, changes or additions to the flying mission, or changes
   affecting existing aircraft parking/taxi procedures with an emphasis on ―waiver impact‖ of
   affected areas. A joint airfield inspection is performed monthly at the main airfield and
   quarterly at the auxiliary airfield. The inspection team will be given reasonable priority to
   complete this inspection.
 16                                                              USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


   2.5.3. USAFA Main Airfield Checks: An airfield check shall be accomplished before the
   start of flying (the daily airfield inspection may be done in lieu of this check) and additional
   checks will be accomplished as required to support emergencies, runway surface condition
   (RSC)/ runway condition reading (RCR) determination, FOD checks, BASH determination,
   construction areas, and for hazards to flying operations. When rapidly changing conditions
   exist, the RSC/RCR checks will be conducted more frequently. The person conducting the
   check will annotate the areas checked on the inspection form. Personnel other than AMOPS
   authorized to examine the airfield are:
      2.5.3.1. 306 FTG Flight Safety Personnel.
      2.5.3.2. Aero Club SOF during uncontrolled operations.
      2.5.3.3. Agencies as declared in a letter of procedure.
   2.5.4. Bullseye Auxiliary Airfield Inspections/Checks. At a minimum, USAF Academy
   Auxiliary Airfield (Bullseye) will be inspected monthly. AMOPS personnel performing
   these inspections will utilize the Bullseye Airfield Inspection Checklist when performing the
   inspection. Personnel performing inspections must be trained and certified to perform
   inspections. As a minimum, an airfield check of active landing surfaces will be conducted
   prior to the start of flying operations. Personnel performing airfield checks must be certified
   in their training record.
      2.5.4.1. Responsibilities for conducting prior to flying airfield checks at Bullseye may be
      delegated to non-airfield operations personnel (FD and SOF) after completing specified
      (see AFI 13-204V3, paragraph 17.2.1.) AMOPS training.
   2.5.5. AMOPS shall note discrepancies during the airfield inspection; report the
   discrepancies to the appropriate agency responsible for repairs; notify airfield users of the
   discrepancy; and/or submit a work order request on the appropriate discrepancy log.
   2.5.6. Airfield Checks during Construction. Airfield Management must inspect construction
   areas to ensure that a high level of safety is maintained. Airfield Management is required to
   check sitting barricades, construction lights, equipment parking, stockpiled materials, debris,
   and foreign objects. Airfield Management will conduct construction checks as needed to
   ensure construction sites are safe and added safety measures are being implemented. All
   discrepancies will be reported to the AFM and logged in the events log.
   2.5.7. Sailplane Landing Area. AFI 13-204, Volume 3, states that AMOPS must inspect
   pavement areas for conditions that could impair safe aircraft operations. Although the SPLA
   is not pavement, the requirement for inspections still applies. When conducting morning
   inspections/checks, AMOPS will check the SPLA for Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
   (BASH), FOD, grass height and erosion. All discrepancies will be reported to the AFM and
   logged in the events log.
2.6. Closing and Opening Runways. AMOPS has the authority to close portions of the
airfield. AMOPS will normally close a runway, SPLA, or Parachute DZ when maintenance or
hazards exist on or near that runway or zone. AMOPS will coordinate with Academy Tower
prior to closing a runway, taxiway, SPLA or parachute DZ. AMOPS will accept inputs from the
306 FTG SOF/FTGA when determining the status of runways and zones.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                  17


   2.6.1. When a runway/SLPA/Parachute DZ is closed AMOPS will notify the FTGA, 306
   FTG SOF, and other affected agencies, provide an estimated opening time, and issue a
   NOTAM as appropriate.
       2.6.1.1. Depending on the reasoning to close runways/SPLA/Parachute DZ, it may/may
       not be appropriate to maintain the CMA status of the closed area. If the CMA status is
       also being removed to allow non-ATC approved vehicle operations, the NOTAM closing
       the area must also state the area involved is ―temporarily removed from the CMA.‖
   2.6.2. Notify the FTGA, 306 FTG SOF, and affected agencies when the runway is reopened.
   AMOPS will cancel appropriate NOTAMs when the runway is reopened.
2.7. Relay of Airfield Information. To ensure current airfield information is available to all
airfield users, AMOPS will keep the Airfield Status Display current. Additionally, AMOPS will:
   2.7.1. Make appropriate notifications IAW local Quick Reaction Checklists (QRC)
   whenever there is a change in runway condition, field condition, bird/wildlife watch
   condition, aerodrome facilities conditions, construction activity, or obstructions in close
   proximity to or on the runways or taxiways. Notify the FD when necessary.
   2.7.2. Call ATC to coordinate vehicles, personnel, or equipment operations on or near the
   runways or taxiways.
2.8. Inclement Weather Procedures. In the event local flying activities stop due to inclement
weather, individual squadron operations supervisors will notify the 306 FTG SOF of their
squadron’s decision to cancel flying operations for the remainder of the day. The 306 FTG SOF
may also cancel 306 FTG flying. Upon notification from the 306 FTG SOF, AMOPS will notify
USAFA Weather, Fire Station 3, Command Post and ATC via telephone when all operations
have been canceled. A NOTAM is required to close USAFA Class D airspace during published
flying hours.
2.9. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Procedures.
   2.9.1. DV operations at the airfield are normally scheduled and coordinated by the Director
   of Protocol through the 306 FTG/CC.
   2.9.2. When AMOPS is required to arrange for DV operations, AMOPS will contact Fire
   Station 3, Security Forces, USAFA Hospital (if required), 10th Air Base Wing Command
   Post (10 ABW/CP) and the control tower. Requested support will be in place 15-minutes
   prior to the scheduled arrival/departure of the DV.
   2.9.3. For no-notice/unscheduled DV arrivals, AMOPS will immediately notify the FTGA
   and the 10 ABW/CP. The FTGA or designated representative will meet and greet all no-
   notice/ unscheduled DV arrivals.
   2.9.4. ATC shall call AMOPS on any inbound DV aircraft as soon as possible after initial
   contact with the aircraft.
   2.9.5. DV civilian aircraft must comply with all civil aircraft landing permit (CALP)
   requirements.
2.10. Use of Academy Airfield by Civil and Transient Aircraft.

   FTG, Academy Aero Club and transient aircraft with a Prior Permission Required (PPR)
   number.
   2.10.2. Transient aircraft that have not pre-coordinated flight requests are not authorized to
   conduct ―drop-in‖ touch-and-go or low approach training unless they have 306 FTG SOF or
   FTGA approval. Airborne aircraft may request a PPR number through Academy Tower.
   Requests will be forwarded to AMOPS.
   2.10.3. Colorado State Patrol and US Forest Service aircraft are authorized to land IAW
   individual letters of agreement and understanding on file with AMOPS, but still require a
   PPR number.
   2.10.4. Other agencies requesting access to USAFA airfield will be considered IAW AFI 10-
   1001.
   2.10.5. Unauthorized/Unscheduled Landings/Airspace Entry. When a civil aircraft makes an
   unauthorized landing at the airfield, AFI 10-1001 and AFI 10-1002 apply. The following
   actions are required in the event of an unauthorized landing by nonlocally assigned aircraft:
      2.10.5.1. AMOPS will notify the AOF/CC, FTGA, and Security Forces.
      2.10.5.2. The AOF/CC, AFM, Assistant Airfield Manager (AAFM), or AMOM/NAMO
      determines the type of unauthorized landing IAW AFI 10-1001 and AFI 10-1002 and
      takes appropriate action as defined in the instruction.
   2.10.6. Any aircraft not in compliance with CALP requirements are not authorized to land.

                                           Chapter 3

                         AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OPERATIONS

3.1. Air Traffic Control Facilities.
   3.1.1. Academy Tower provides ATC services and regulates the use of USAFA Class D
   airspace and controlled movement areas on the airfield.
   3.1.2. ATC services shall be provided IAW FAA Orders, DoD Instructions, AFIs and 306
   FTG OIs.
   3.1.3. Airfield Opening/CMA Transfer of Control. Academy Tower and the main airfield
   will open as published in the DoD VFR Supplement unless a NOTAM indicates otherwise.
   The control tower will normally be staffed 30-minutes prior to opening.
       3.1.3.1. After the airfield movement area is checked, including the CMA, AMOPS shall
       transfer control of the movement area and CMA to Academy Tower at opening.
       Academy Tower shall transfer control of the airfield movement area and CMA back to
       AMOPS at closing. Prior to transferring control of the airfield movement area and CMA,
       AMOPS and tower shall brief the receiving facility on all pertinent traffic (vehicles,
       pedestrians/personnel, and aircraft) operating within the airfield movement area and
       CMA. ATC and AMOPS must coordinate the closing time based on the termination of
       all flight activities, controlled or uncontrolled if prior to sunset. In addition, the
       following shall be briefed/verified prior to opening:
           3.1.3.1.1. Airfield status, NOTAMS, advisories, and special operations (306
           OSS/OSO AE 210).
           3.1.3.1.2. Proposed runway in use and confirmation of opening time.
           3.1.3.1.3. RSC and RCR information.
       3.1.3.2. ONE MINUTE PRIOR TO OPENING: ATC shall broadcast on Tower,
       Skytrain, Ground Control (GC), AF-1, and AF-2 frequencies, "Academy Airfield is ready
       to open; anyone on or near the runways say position, call sign, and intentions."
       3.1.3.3. If anyone is observed on the runways and not in communication with tower,
       ATC shall call AMOPS and advise them to delay opening the airfield until the situation is
       investigated/ corrected.
       3.1.3.4. AT OPENING: ATC shall broadcast on Tower, Skytrain, GC, AF-1, and AF-2
       frequencies, "Academy Airfield is open; Runway (XX) in use.”
       3.1.3.5. AT CLOSING: ATC shall broadcast on Tower, Skytrain, GC, AF-1, and AF-2
       frequencies, ―Academy Airfield is closed.”
           3.1.3.5.1. If any aircraft are still on a runway or taxiway at sunset closing, ATC will
           notify AMOPS.         Closing the USAFA airfield cannot be delayed because
           runway/taxiways do not have lighting.
   3.1.4. Skytrain controller duties in addition to normal ATC duties IAW FAA and AF
   directives:
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                  21


     3.1.4.1. Notify Colorado Springs approach control (COS) when soaring operations begin
     and end. Notify COS when soaring operations exceed 12,500 feet MSL and 15,500 feet
     MSL and when soaring operations above those altitudes have been completed.
     3.1.4.2. Delegate parachuting airspace (within USAFA Class D) to the Drop Zone
     Control Officer (DZCO).
     3.1.4.3. Coordinate with the 94 FTS SCO to delegate all or portions of soaring airspace
     to DZCO.
     3.1.4.4. When parachuting airspace is active, coordinate with DZCO for any flight
     operations that affect parachuting airspace (i.e., demo patterns, gate finishes, etc.).
     3.1.4.5. Advise the 94 FTS SCO of any potential conflicts/deviations from normal
     procedures or airfield discrepancies.
     3.1.4.6. Allow the use of the Skytrain frequency during time-critical situations that
     require SCO, Observer or Spotter safety of flight intervention (i.e., directing a solo-
     student on departure leg to release immediately). Note: The Spotter, Observer, and SCO
     have override capability on Skytrain’s frequency. Overrides shall only be used when
     necessary to maintain safety of flight. When either overrides Skytrain’s transmissions,
     they have commandeered the frequency and assume responsibility for the consequences
     until Skytrain takes control back.
     3.1.4.7. Approve use of the east, west, and northern aerobatic areas based on traffic and
     airspace availability. ATC normally authorizes one glider into an aerobatic area at a
     time. The SCO is the approval authority for allowing more than one glider into the same
     aerobatic area.
     3.1.4.8. Broadcast on Skytrain frequency any changes in airspace configuration/status.
     Notify all aircraft two minutes prior to, and upon activating any aerobatic areas.
     3.1.4.9. Advise DZCO of gliders on ―very low‖ and ―extremely low‖ patterns.
     Intentional ―low‖ patterns do not need to be called to the DZCO as they do not impact
     parachute operations. Inform DZCO of any gliders that are forced to enter parachuting
     airspace or forced to land within parachute drop zones. Controllers shall not approve
     practice landings in alternate sailplane areas B and C when the parachuting DZ/airspace
     is active.
     3.1.4.10. Stop launch for any unsafe condition/situation.
     3.1.4.11. Provide wind and sequence information to gliders landing in the SPLA or
     alternate sailplane landing areas on the airfield.
     3.1.4.12. Use the midfield light system to control pedestrian crossings of Runway
     16/34C at midfield.
        3.1.4.12.1. To begin soaring operations, gliders, vehicles, and pedestrians shall wait
        in the east staging area until a marshaller is available to accept control of Runway
        16R/34L between the end of runway (EOR) lines. Before crossing the center runway,
        the marshaller shall contact Skytrain and request control of the Runway 16R/34L
        non-movement area between the EOR lines. Once a marshaller is in place, normal
        crossings via the midfield light system are authorized. The marshaller shall return
 22                                                           USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


          control of the Runway 16R/34L staging areas when operations are complete or upon
          Skytrain request
          3.1.4.12.2. Runway crossing training for 94 FTS may be coordinated with the tower-
          watch supervisor (WS) and approved on a case-by-case basis.
          3.1.4.12.3. When necessary and without a marshaller in place, ATC may allow
          center/west runway crossings using big voice or radio control to retrieve aircraft,
          ropes, FOD, etc.
      3.1.4.13. The midfield public address system (big voice) may be used during time-
      critical situations to avert unsafe conditions.
      3.1.4.14. Coordinate with the east pattern local controller on south, north, east and
      woodmen departures from Runway 16/34C.
      3.1.4.15. Acknowledge Landings-In-Between. This refers to landing-in-between two
      sailplanes or a sailplane and Runway 34L/16R. Skytrain’s acknowledgement of landing-
      in-between indicates personnel in the SPLA will be advised over radio/big voice of the
      landing-in-between. It is a pilot’s responsibility to comply with unit established
      separation standards in the SPLA. ATC does not provide separation service within the
      SPLA.
      3.1.4.16. Alert personnel/pedestrians by activating the midfield siren when aircraft are
      taxing on Taxiway H between Runway 08/26 and the south edge of the midfield ramp
      (the south edge is adjacent to the curved portion of Taxiway H).
      3.1.4.17. Acknowledge any non-standard pattern entry (i.e., extended base, intentional
      low pattern, relight request). A standard two minutes to downwind call does not require
      acknowledgement from Skytrain.
      3.1.4.18. Advise personnel at midfield, using the big voice, anytime tow aircraft will be
      directed from the west side-holding apron to depart on Runway 16/34C.
      3.1.4.19. Announce ATC directed movement of powered aircraft onto/across Runway
      16/34C from the staging areas using big voice/radio.
      3.1.4.20. Glider Re-Lights. Once a glider stops on Runway 16/34C and all other
      conflicts are resolved, ATC will activate the green crossing light to allow a ground crew
      in either crossing box to proceed down the runway to the aircraft. If a ground crew is
      pre-positioned on the apron near the EOR lines for TG-15 re-lights, controllers may
      initiate or TG-15 pilot may request authorization to wave his crew to the aircraft. A tow
      plane will not be positioned for the TG-15 until the ground crew is at the aircraft.
      3.1.4.21. Gliders Angling into the Wind during SPLA Landings. Glider pilots may
      request permission to cross the final approach course of the west and center runways on
      an angling approach to the SPLA. ATC will approve/disapprove angling into the wind
      based on traffic.

3.3. Operational Procedures.
   3.3.1. All local aircraft will follow the local operating procedures outlined in the 306 FTG
   Supplement to AFI 11-2 Volume 3 of the appropriate specific mission design series (MDS).
   3.3.2. All 557 FTS and Aero Club aircraft shall utilize the 557 FTS standard departure,
   arrival, and breakout procedures. The VFR arrival/departure routes and breakout procedures
   are identified in the 557 FTS In-Flight Guide.
   3.3.3. Flight operations are not authorized for USAFA assigned aircraft when the reported
   weather is below 1,500-foot ceiling and/or 3 miles visibility. Exception: USAFA Flying
   Team T-51 and T-41D aircraft may fly pattern-only sorties during actual National
   Intercollegiate Flying Association (NIFA) competition, i.e., not practice sorties, when the
   observed weather is at least 1,300 feet/3 miles. The minimum permissible pattern altitude is
   800 feet AGL. (AETC Waiver 2008-2 provides this exception.)
   3.3.4. IAW 306 FTG Supplement to AFI 11-202V3, if reported conditions are between
   1,500 feet/3-miles and 2,000 feet/3-miles, there may be up to four powered-flight aircraft in
   the east pattern. In addition, there may be up to two sailplanes, plus tow aircraft, in the west
   pattern. Sailplane sortie duration is limited to 10-minutes.
   3.3.5. Special VFR operations are not authorized for Air Force fixed-wing aircraft and
   aircraft assigned to the 306 FTG. Special VFR operations may be authorized by Academy
   Tower for other aircraft when requested by the pilot. Special VFR flights are restricted to
   one aircraft/flight in Class D airspace at a time.
   3.3.6. The SOF will ensure that all gliders are landed and all powered aircraft are in parking
   prior to sunset. Departures/arrivals or taxi operations between sunset and sunrise are not
   authorized under any circumstance. Maintenance towing and glider drag-in operations are
   authorized between sunset and sunrise and are the responsibility of maintenance/unit
   operators.
   3.3.7. Controllers shall report airfield abnormalities and trend data to AMOPS and the
   306 FTG SOF (e.g., FOD on the airfield, airfield driving violations, bird/wildlife advisories,
   pavement deterioration, taxi operations after closing, suspicious activity, etc.).
      3.3.7.1. When utilizing full runway procedures for Runway 34/16C or Runway 34L/16R,
      report any unauthorized individual or vehicle entry onto the CMA as a CMA violation
      (CMAV) using AF Form 457.              Report an unauthorized entry as a runway
24                                                              USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


     intrusion/HATR using AF Form 651 if the entry resulted in the endangerment of an
     aircraft.
     3.3.7.2. When an unauthorized individual or vehicle entry onto the center or west staging
     areas occurs (not full use), report the event as a staging area infraction using AF Form
     457. 306 FTG/SE is the OPR for tracking and reporting infraction data.
  3.3.8. Controllers may suspend operations to their respective runways when deemed
  necessary. A broadcast of the suspension will be made on appropriate frequencies.
     3.3.8.1. Controllers shall notify AMOPS immediately of any operations suspensions.
     3.3.8.2. AMOPS shall determine the runway status; inform ATC and the 306 FTG SOF.
  3.3.9. Active Runway Designation. ATC designates the active runway at USAFA airfield.
  The tower supervisor will coordinate the runway in use with the 306 FTG SOF and the 94
  FTS SCO and advise 98 FTS/DZCO. Intersecting runways cannot be active simultaneously
  (i.e., when Runway 16/34 is use, Runway 08/26 will be inactive). Aircraft/vehicles may exit
  the current landing runway/runway-in-use onto an inactive/intersecting runway. The inactive
  runway(s) will be released to the tower ground controller on the east side and the Skytrain
  controller on the west side for taxi and ground movements. ATC shall accomplish a runway
  change to activate and place inactive runways in use.
     3.3.9.1. Controllers are required to issue the steady state wind direction and velocity
     including the full gust factor in conjunction with ATC clearances. The 306 FTG/CC has
     waived the requirement for ATC to issue variable wind information. ATC will issue
     variable winds to pilots when requested.
     3.3.9.2. Wind sensors will be selected to the approach ends of the runways. Runways 08
     and 16L/C/R use the same sensor. When the approach end wind sensor is out of service,
     tower controllers will issue winds from the departure end wind sensor stating, ―departure
     end winds.‖ This will alert the pilots to the wind sensor outage. Should all wind sensors
     be out of service, controllers will issue estimated winds from the latest weather
     observation, example: "wind estimated one-six-zero at one-four as of one-niner-five-five
     Zulu."
         3.3.9.2.1. The SOF is responsible for interpreting wind data and tailwind impact on
         flying and advising controllers of any action required for support of aircraft.
  3.3.10. Runway Change Procedures. ATC will transmit 5-minute and 2-minute warnings of
  runway changes on their frequencies unless safety, weather etc., dictate otherwise.
     3.3.10.1. At the 5-minutes to runway change announcement, aircraft in the east pattern
     will inform the tower of their intentions (i.e., full stop, departing the pattern, or climbing
     to high traffic). Powered aircraft in the west pattern may return immediately for a full-
     stop landing or hold outside Class D airspace. Gliders on tow and gliders off tow with
     enough altitude will transition to the opposite training areas. Gliders off tow not high
     enough to transition to an opposite training area must return to the pattern immediately
     for landing.
     3.3.10.2. At the ―two-minutes to runway change‖ announcement, with up to three aircraft
     in the pattern, ATC may direct aircraft to make turns on downwind, base or final to
     expedite maneuvering to the new runway. With more than three aircraft in the east
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                     25


       pattern, aircraft will climb to high traffic at 8,100 feet MSL. Academy Tower will
       designate which aircraft is to be the first to fly a descending teardrop (course reversal)
       from the high traffic downwind leg to join the downwind for the new runway direction at
       7,300 feet MSL. Other aircraft established in high traffic will teardrop from the same
       point to follow the lead aircraft to the new downwind. Aircraft in the west pattern will
       continue to landing as directed by Skytrain. Skytrain will ensure that midfield personnel
       setup for the new runway.
       3.3.10.3. ATC notifies AMOPS, weather, and DZCO of runway changes. Skytrain will
       notify DZCO of runway changes when Skytrain is open.
       3.3.10.4. During a runway change to Runway 08/26, ATC will direct aircraft to climb to
       high traffic for Runway 16L/34R for holding to sterilize east pattern airspace below 8,100
       feet MSL as necessary to facilitate sailplane west landings.
       3.3.10.5. ATC will designate Runway 08/26 in use when both Skytrain and local control
       (LC) are ready for the change.
       3.3.10.6. Aircraft shall be sequenced on a first-come, first-served basis with priority
       given to non-motorized aircraft.
   3.3.11. Calm Wind Runways. Runways 16L/C/R are the calm wind runways.
   3.3.12. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). The ATIS is operated from the
   control tower (frequencies are published in VFR Supplement). The hours of the ATIS
   correspond with the operational hours of the airfield. A closed airport ATIS broadcast will
   be transmitted during closed hours.
       3.3.12.1. 306 FTG assigned or attached pilots shall obtain ATIS information prior to
       requesting taxi instructions or proceeding inbound to the airport. Efficient use of the
       ATIS will significantly reduce radio frequency congestion. Gliders and tow aircraft
       conducting tow operations are exempt.
   3.3.13. Aircraft shall not be staged on runways prior to official sunrise.
   3.3.14. The auto-start emergency generator is considered reliable and Academy Tower is not
   required to operate on generator power 30-minutes prior to the arrival of severe weather.
3.4. Traffic Pattern Procedures. Academy Tower is responsible for the efficient use of the
runways and will coordinate runway use, as necessary, to meet mission needs. Assign aircraft to
the appropriate frequency for the pattern they are flying in. Controllers should use frequency
134.1 for west pattern operations and frequency 124.15 for east pattern operations to prevent
confusion among pilots in the pattern.
   3.4.1. Simulated Forced Landings (SFL). All USAFA assigned aircraft are authorized to
   conduct SFLs at KAFF. See paragraphs 3.4.2. and 3.4.3. for pattern altitudes and direction of
   turns (Attachment 9).
       3.4.1.1. Pilots must request the SFL prior to proceeding to high key.
       3.4.1.2. An approved SFL may be terminated at any point in the pattern by ATC.
       3.4.1.3. Landing clearance will normally be provided at low key.
   3.4.2. Runway 16L/34R. Patterns for runway 16L/34R are flown east of the runway.
26                                                             USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


     3.4.2.1. The rectangular pattern altitude is 7,300 feet MSL.
     3.4.2.2. The high rectangular pattern (normally used for holding during a runway
     change) altitude is 8,100 feet MSL.
     3.4.2.3. The overhead maneuver (OHM) pattern altitude is 8,100 feet MSL. Initial for
     the OHM pattern is 3 miles. The break point is the approach end of the runway with an
     east break unless directed otherwise by ATC.
     3.4.2.4. High key for the SFL pattern is at 8,100 feet MSL over the approach end of the
     runway. Aircraft are expected to make an east turn for low key within the first 1/3 of the
     runway after high key. (Note: Only USAFA assigned aircraft are authorized to fly SFL
     patterns. The SFL pattern is not to be confused with the Emergency Landing Pattern
     (ELP) as described in FAAO JO7110.65T.)
     3.4.2.5. Traffic pattern entry for UV-18s may vary (direct downwind, short approach,
     etc.). UV-18 straight-in approaches begin at the 5-mile point at 8,000 feet MSL if on
     initial arrival from Colorado Springs to Runway 34, or 10,000 feet MSL otherwise.
     3.4.2.6. No more than six aircraft are authorized in the east pattern excluding departures
     leaving the pattern and the UV-18. Initial solos in the east pattern shall be limited to
     three. Initial solos will call Academy Ground with ―solo‖ as part of the first radio call to
     ground.
        3.4.2.6.1. Pattern Saturation Procedures. Pattern saturation procedures have been
        developed to decrease the probability of choke points on inbound 557 FTS arrival
        routes, reduce the frequency of aircraft holding outside the Academy's Class D, and to
        ensure safe and predictable courses of action for those periods when the Academy's
        East Traffic Pattern becomes saturated. These procedures include holding patterns
        outside of Academy's Class D that will not be assigned by ATC. These procedures
        will be implemented anytime the tower observes a situation that will place more than
        six aircraft in the east downwind pattern. Note: East Pattern includes aircraft in the
        rectangular pattern, aircraft in breakout status, and aircraft inbound from the active
        entry point. This does not include departures leaving the pattern. Nothing precludes
        the SOF and Linebacker from formulating solutions to reduce numbers in the east
        pattern prior to or during the initiation of the following procedures.
        3.4.2.6.2. Tower Local Control will broadcast "East Pattern Full" in the blind on
        tower frequencies. This broadcast will be made as frequently as necessary to keep the
        pattern safe and efficient.
        3.4.2.6.3. Linebacker will echo "East Pattern Full" on Eagle Traffic frequency.
        3.4.2.6.4. Upon hearing the "East Pattern Full" broadcast, any 557 FTS pilot in the
        east pattern capable of accepting a full-stop landing, a climb to the high-traffic
        pattern, or a departure from Class D airspace via the departure/upwind leg shall notify
        tower immediately of their requested option. Note: Only two aircraft are authorized
        in the high-traffic pattern for "Full-Pattern" ops. Tower will limit the time that
        aircraft remain in high traffic to ensure this option is available as a relief valve for
        additional full pattern situations.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                 27


        3.4.2.6.5. If after one minute, there are not enough pattern reduction responses by
        pilots in the pattern, the Tower Watch Supervisor shall immediately direct as many
        full-stop landing clearances as required to manage the traffic pattern and prevent
        choke points on the arrival routes.
        3.4.2.6.6. Depending on Skytrain/west pattern traffic conditions and center runway
        availability, tower may implement straight-in-full-stop landing options on Runway
        16C and 34C to prevent choke points on the arrival routes. Aircraft cleared to, but
        unable to land on the center runway due to wind limits/other conditions are expected
        to exit the pattern and hold at one of the reentry holding points described below
        unless otherwise directed by tower.
        3.4.2.6.7. Re-Entry Procedures. Perform the re-entry procedure for the runway in
        use if directed by tower, desired for training, or upon reaching the Oracle Building
        (just east of I-25, approximately 2.5 miles north of KAFF) on Runway 34, or DEPOT
        on Runway 16 without receiving clearance for a closed pattern. Remain on tower
        frequency while squaking 1,200. Unless the re-entry procedure was directed by
        tower, inform tower as soon as conditions permit. Re-enter the pattern using the
        following procedures:
            3.4.2.6.7.1. Runway 16. Fly the Woodman Departure to WALLY. Report
            WALLY to Tower, proceed to SCARBO and hold. Tower may clear aircraft
            from WALLY to TANK.
            3.4.2.6.7.2. Runway 34. Fly the East Departure to 83. Report 83 to Tower,
            proceed to SHOUP and hold. Tower may clear aircraft from 83 to BRIDGE.
            3.4.2.6.7.3. Holding points depicted in the 306 FTG, Supplement to AFI 1-2T-
            41-51-52, V3.
     3.4.2.7. Breakouts. Unless tower instructs otherwise, aircraft will turn toward the east
     between midfield and departure end downwind, away from the traffic, climbing to 7,900
     feet and proceed to the opposite pattern entry point (Tank or Bridge) to hold until
     directed by tower to proceed to the entry point in use.
     3.4.2.8. Go-Around. Aircraft instructed to go-around shall avoid over-flying aircraft on
     the runway and when necessary fly a ground track east of runway 16L/34R to avoid
     overtaking another aircraft on departure leg.
     3.4.2.9. Flying Team Message Drops. The flying team may request a ―message drop‖
     instead of a low approach, go-around, or offset. When ATC approves a message drop,
     the aircraft will over-fly the wind socks immediately east of runway 16L/34R and drop a
     packet near the windsock. For separation purposes, a message drop will be treated as a
     go-around (no runway spacing required) and ATC shall issue pertinent traffic advisories.
     3.4.2.10. Closed Traffic in the East Pattern.
        3.4.2.10.1. When ATC approves closed traffic for 557 FTS and Aero Club aircraft,
        pilots will acknowledge the approval by turning crosswind for the closed traffic
        pattern. Verbal acknowledgement from the pilot is not required. Pilots shall not
        request closed until ready to turn crosswind. Pilots should not delay the crosswind
        turn once closed traffic is approved.
28                                                            USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


         3.4.2.10.2. Pilots shall verbally acknowledge traffic advisories, sequencing
         instructions, and runway clearances.
     3.4.2.11. ATC will clear 557 FTS and Aero Club aircraft established in the pattern for a
     touch-and-go unless the pilot requests otherwise.
  3.4.3. Runway 16/34C is a full-use runway requiring FAA standard category separation for
  landings and takeoffs for aircraft other than tows and gliders IAW paragraph 3.4.4.1. When
  94 FTS aircraft (Tow Planes and Gliders) are staged between the end of runway (EOR) lines,
  the runway is no longer full-use. The EOR lines for Runway 34/16C are designated by solid
  white lines painted on the surface and white-on-blue traffic cones located at the runway
  edges prior to midfield. The area between the north and south EOR lines, within 100 ft of
  Runway 34/16C between EOR lines, and the runway between EOR lines are designated the
  center staging area. 94 FTS aircraft between the EOR lines (within the center staging area)
  are considered off the runway. If Skytrain has given control of the center staging area to a
  marshaller and needs the area back to accommodate non-94 FTS aircraft, Skytrain may direct
  that aircraft, vehicles, and personnel exit the runway and take control back from the
  marshaller using radios and/or big voice (Runway 34/16C becomes full-use again when 94
  FTS aircraft are no longer staged between the EOR lines and at least 100 feet from the
  runway edges).
     3.4.3.1. The rectangular pattern for Runway 16/34C is flown west of the runway pattern
     altitude is 7,500 feet MSL.
     3.4.3.2. The high rectangular pattern altitude is 8,100 feet MSL.
     3.4.3.3. The OHM pattern altitude is 8,100 feet MSL. Initial for the OHM pattern is 3-
     miles. The break point is the approach end of the runway with a west break unless
     directed otherwise by ATC.
     3.4.3.4. High key for the SFL pattern is at 8,100 feet MSL over the approach end of the
     runway. Aircraft are expected to make a west turn to low key within the first 1/3 of the
     runway after high key.
     3.4.3.5. UV-18 straight-in approaches from Colorado Springs begin at the 5-mile point at
     8,000 feet MSL if landing Runway 34, otherwise 10,000 feet MSL at the 5-mile point.
     3.4.3.6. Tower may use the west pattern for any aircraft as long as the soaring and
     parachute programs are not flying. Skytrain shall not allow gliders to fly Demo 360,
     Demo Tear Drop, or Demo 270 patterns when parachute airspace is active unless
     coordination is accomplished with DZCO. Skytrain shall not authorize Demo 360, 270
     and Teardrop patterns when the east acro area is hot/active.
     3.4.3.7. With tower approval, any aircraft is authorized to land or depart Runway 16/34C
     during 94 FTS soaring operations on Runway 16R/34L.
     3.4.3.8. When Runway 16/34C is being used for glider arrivals/departures, the rules in
     paragraph 3.4.4.1. shall be applied for Runway 16/34C.
     3.4.3.9. Non-94 FTS aircraft executing a go-around from Runway 16/34C may be
     sequenced into the east traffic pattern for an immediate landing or directed to an entry
     point for pattern reentry.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                       29


  3.4.4. Runway 16R/34L. Authorized, designed and built as a glider strip, Runway 16R/34L
  is used for sailplane and tow plane landings and takeoffs only, unless otherwise authorized
  by FTGA. The ―runway‖ versus ―strip‖ designation was implemented to standardize
  procedures and avoid confusion in communications. Pattern information is the same as
  Runway 16/34C. SFLs and OHMs to Runway 16R/34L are not authorized. (Exception: 94
  FTS gliders may conduct Demo 360, Demo Tear Drop, and Demo 270 patterns when
  Parachuting airspace is not active and the east acro area is cold/inactive.)
     3.4.4.1. When 94 FTS aircraft (tow planes and gliders) are staged between the EOR
     lines, the runway is no longer full-use. The EOR lines for Runway 34/16C are
     designated by solid white lines painted on the surface and white-on-blue traffic cones
     located at the runway edges prior to midfield. The area between the north and south EOR
     lines, within 100 ft of Runway 34/16C between EOR lines, and the runway between EOR
     lines are designated the center staging area. 94 FTS aircraft between the EOR lines
     (within the center staging area) are considered off the runway. If Skytrain has given
     control of the center staging area to a marshaller and subsequently needs the area back to
     accommodate non-94 FTS aircraft; Skytrain may direct that aircraft, vehicles, and
     personnel exit the runway and take control back from the marshaller using radios and/or
     big voice (Runway 34/16C becomes full-use again when 94 FTS aircraft are no longer
     staged between the EOR lines and at least 100 ft from the runway edges).
  3.4.5. Runway 08/26. Normally used during east/west wind conditions when the wind
  exceeds aircraft crosswind limits for Runways 16/34. Traffic patterns to Runway 08/26 are
  normally flown north of the runway. Pattern altitude is 7,500 feet MSL. An official runway
  change is required to land or depart aircraft on Runway 08/26.
     3.4.5.1. When it is necessary to change to Runway 08/26 for sailplane east/west landings
     or motorized aircraft wind limits, local control will release airspace and Runway 08/26 to
     Skytrain as soon as the east pattern can be sterilized through the use of high traffic and
     holding. Skytrain will normally recover all nonpowered aircraft first, and then tow
     planes. As soon as Skytrain has recovered and/or coordinated the holding of aircraft
     requiring landings, airspace and Runway 08/26 shall be returned to local control.
         3.4.5.1.1. If aircraft in the west pattern are directed or elect to hold out, Skytrain and
         the local controller will coordinate Runway 08/26 landings as needed.
         3.4.5.1.2. Should the traffic situation dictate, the WS may direct that either east
         pattern traffic be handed off to Skytrain for Runway 08 landings or west pattern
         traffic be handed off to local control for Runway 26 landings. Runway 08/26 shall
         not be used simultaneously by the Skytrain and local controller.
     3.4.5.2. The gate located on the access road southeast of Runway 26 under run (Gate 8)
     shall remain locked when Runway 08/26 is in use. AMOPS may request assistance from
     Fire Station 3 in opening and closing the gates.
  3.4.6. Soaring Operations. Gliders landing in the SPLA will receive traffic, sequencing and
  wind information only. Landing clearance shall not be issued. ATC will assume that a glider
  intends to land in the SPLA unless the pilot requests otherwise. The controllers are not
  responsible for separation of aircraft landing in the SPLA. Glider pilots landing in the SPLA
  maintain clearance from other aircraft and obstacles IAW 94 FTS local instructions.
30                                                            USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


     3.4.6.1. Runway 16/34C glider operations. Skytrain maintains control of Runway
     16/34C and may allow glider operations (IAW paragraph 3.4.4.1.) on the runway.
     Control of Runway 16/34C between the EOR lines may be delegated to the 94 FTS
     Marshaller should the situation dictate.
         3.4.6.1.1. Unless a tow plane, glider, or both are predeparture staged at the midfield
         line, ATC shall ensure Runway 16/34C midfield runway crossings (personnel,
         aircraft, and vehicles) are complete before a landing aircraft crosses the landing
         threshold. Gliders/tows shall not be predeparture staged on Runway 16/34C at any
         point after a landing glider or tow plane crosses landing threshold.
         3.4.6.1.2. Tow aircraft landing on Runway 16/34C shall exit the runway to the west
         holding areas between runways awaiting their next tow, or exit to the east apron at the
         farthest point from the midfield point to park. Tow aircraft are not permitted to taxi
         through the midfield area without ATC approval.
         3.4.6.1.3. Skytrain shall announce on big voice intentions of taxiing tow planes from
         the west holding area into holding position or crossing the center runway. At the big
         voice announcement, the marshaller shall not authorize pedestrians to the crossing
         box and Skytrain shall not move the tow plane until the west-crossing box is clear.
     3.4.6.2. During normal soaring operations, tow planes are authorized to enter the
     USAFA Class D surface area immediately after tow release and make initial contact on
     base leg for Runway 16R/34L or 16/34C (Note: This includes all recoveries from towing
     operations west of Runway 16/34C).
         3.4.6.2.1. The marshaller is responsible for the movement of aircraft in his/her
         staging area. The marshaller shall ensure personnel remain clear of gliders and tow
         planes ready for departure, and any aircraft rolling from the runway into the sailplane
         staging area. Any vehicle (e.g., gators, maintenance and military vehicles) operating
         at midfield supporting glider operations shall monitor Skytrain FM frequency at all
         times when near the movement area or staging area to ensure receipt of emergency
         instructions.
         3.4.6.2.2. If a glider stops short of the EOR line, runway operations are suspended
         for that runway. Operations can be resumed after the glider is dragged beyond the
         EOR line into the sailplane staging area or dragged clear of the runway (at least 100
         feet away from the runway edge).
         3.4.6.2.3. Ground crews from the sailplane staging area are authorized to cross the
         EOR lines without contacting Skytrain and proceed down the runway to recover a
         glider that has stopped short of the EOR line. Glider recovery is the only time
         personnel may cross the EOR lines without Skytrain approval.
         3.4.6.2.4. Ground crews shall not drag gliders onto the sailplane staging area from
         the grass landing areas until they are abeam the beach between EOR lines to avoid
         conflict with aircraft exiting the landing surface.
  3.4.7. Tow aircraft are authorized to land on any runway on the airport with a 200-foot tow
  rope attached to their aircraft but may have to drop the tow rope upon initiating a go-around
  to avoid dragging the rope over personnel, vehicles, or aircraft.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                     31


   3.4.8. Arrival procedures. ATC will direct inbound aircraft to the appropriate VFR entry
   point for pattern entry to Runway 16L/34R or Runway 16C/34C as traffic dictates.
   3.4.9. Departure Procedures. Locally assigned aircraft are authorized automatic frequency
   change when departing USAFA Class D airspace, established on a published departure, or
   otherwise specified by Academy Tower.
   3.4.10. Aircraft Priorities. Local operational priorities must not take precedence over
   priorities listed in FAAO 7110.65 and AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Except as directed by FAAO
   7110.65 and AFI 11-202, Volume 3, local aircraft will be handled on a ―first-come, first-
   served‖ basis with the following exceptions:
      3.4.10.1. 557 FTS operations have priority in the east pattern.
      3.4.10.2. Timely completion of functional check flight (FCF)/operational check flight
      (OCF) sorties is extremely important. FCF/OCF sorties take priority over student and
      continuation training missions.
   3.4.11. Protection of the OHM pattern.
      3.4.11.1. To protect the OHM approach ATC shall instruct any departing aircraft (touch-
      and-go, low approach or option) to remain at or below 7,300 feet MSL (east runway) or
      at or below 7,500 feet MSL (center runway) from the 3-mile initial report until observing
      the overhead aircraft in the break.
      3.4.11.2. Aircraft are not authorized to conduct OHM patterns for the center runway
      when either the 94 FTS or 98 FTS is operating. Tower shall deconflict the overhead
      approach from other aircraft conducting straight-in approaches, established in the pattern,
      or entering the pattern. UV-18s entering the OHM pattern from the east will remain
      above 9,000 feet MSL until 90 degrees to initial to avoid downwind departure traffic.
      3.4.11.3. To protect the OHM approach, ATC shall instruct any departing aircraft (touch-
      and-go, low approach or option) to remain below 7,300 feet MSL (east runway) or 7,500
      feet MSL (center runway) from the 3-mile initial report until observing the overhead
      aircraft in the break.
      3.4.11.4. Termination of the overhead approach for any reason will result in that aircraft
      being directed to carry through initial and re-enter at 3 miles. ATC may work the aircraft
      back into the pattern on a case-by-case basis. Traffic advisories will be provided as
      necessary.
3.5. Aircraft Holding. ATC may instruct aircraft to hold outside of Class D airspace or at
designated holding points. Ideally, aircraft holding should be minimized.
3.6. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). RSRS is authorized for USAF use by the
FAA to be applied to military aircraft. USAFA RSRS standards are governed by AETC and this
instruction. All other separation standards will be IAW FAAO 7110.65. (Note: Apply full
runway separation between an emergency and preceding or succeeding aircraft.)
   3.6.1. RSRS Operations for Sailplanes and Tow Planes.
      3.6.1.1. The RSRS for successive Category I tow plane arrivals is 1,000 feet minimum in
      all cases.
 32                                                              USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


       3.6.1.2. Sailplanes must be beyond the end of runway (EOR) line before a tow plane
       crosses the landing threshold on the same runway.
       3.6.1.3. The RSRS for sailplanes landing behind a tow plane is 1,500 feet in all cases.
       3.6.1.4. The RSRS for tow planes when only Category I aircraft are involved is 3,000
       feet minimum or the previous aircraft is airborne.
       3.6.1.5. USAFA Category I aircraft are authorized RSRS of 3,000 feet minimum or the
       previous aircraft is airborne without using Alternate Side Runway Procedures.
   3.6.2. Controllers shall ensure full runway separation between all aircraft and a preceding
   Glider (exception: tow planes IAW paragraph 3.6.1.).
   3.6.3. Simultaneous departures are not authorized for Runways 16R/34L and 16/34C. The
   preceding departure must be airborne and beyond the departure end before a successive
   departure begins departure roll.
   3.6.4. Simultaneous arrivals are authorized IAW FAAO JO 7110.65.
3.7. Parachute Operations. Academy Tower is the approving authority for parachute
operations over/onto Academy Airfield during airfield operating hours.            Academy
Tower/Skytrain will delegate parachute airspace as appropriate. 98 FTS DZCO shall obtain
airspace/approval from Skytrain (Academy Tower if Skytrain is closed) before parachute
operations begin. Two-way radio communication shall be maintained between aircraft involved
in parachute operations and DZCO while jumps are in progress.
   3.7.1. Parachute Advisories. DZCO shall notify Academy Tower or Skytrain anytime
   parachutists will be exiting aircraft or are under canopy east of the west runway. Academy
   Tower and/or Skytrain shall issue advisories on frequency 124.15/134.1 to airborne aircraft
   when parachutists drift out of parachute-designated airspace or towards the center runway or
   into aircraft patterns. Anyone observing a parachutist drift into or near aircraft patterns shall
   immediately notify Academy Tower or Skytrain as appropriate. DZCO shall notify Skytrain
   (or Tower, if Skytrain is closed) if jumpers will be exiting west of the creek bed west of the
   airfield.
       3.7.1.1. Skytrain and Academy Tower shall broadcast on appropriate frequencies the
       activation and deactivation of parachuting airspace. Parachuting airspace status will be
       included in ATIS broadcasts.
       3.7.1.2. DZCO shall notify Skytrain (or Tower, if Skytrain is closed) prior to WDI drops
       into Class D airspace so aircraft in the patterns can be alerted to descending WDIs.
3.8. Intersection Departures. Sailplanes on tow and tow planes may depart from the midfield
areas of Runway 16/34C and 16R/34L. Any aircraft may depart Runway 16C from the
intersection of Runway 08/26 (south departure only; 3,500 feet available).
3.9. Opposite Direction Traffic. When pilot requested or controller initiated opposite direction
departures/arrivals are authorized so as not to impede/delay other aircraft already established in
the pattern.
   3.9.1. Arrival versus Arrival. An opposite direction arrival shall be no closer than 3NM final
   until the preceding arrival has landed.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                    33


   3.9.2. Arrival versus Departure. An arrival shall be no closer than 3NM final until an
   opposite direction departure is airborne.
      3.9.2.1. Sailplanes landing in the SPLA are exempt from the opposite direction minima
      in paragraphs 3.9.1. and 3.9.2.
3.10. Cooperative Weather Watch Program (COOPWX).
   3.10.1. Variable local weather conditions require constant vigilance to detect potential
   hazards such as high wind, rotor cloud formations, thunderstorms, and lightning activity.
   3.10.2. ATC will report any significant observation of changing weather conditions to
   306 OSS/OSW as soon as practical. Changes may include: precipitation beginning or
   ending, changes in ceiling heights, wind shear reports, rapid wind direction changes, changes
   in visibility, and obstruction materials, etc.
   3.10.3. Pilots should immediately report any observed or encountered developments of
   hazardous or un-forecasted weather conditions to Academy Tower or Skytrain.
3.11. Mid-Air Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program.
   3.11.1. General Procedure: local USAFA airfield flying is conducted exclusively during
   daytime VFR. All pilots are encouraged to fully familiarize themselves with all aspects of
   KAFF and Bullseye operations. This includes local flight routes into and out of these
   airports to reduce the potential of mid-air collisions. Immediate recognition of potential
   hazardous situations is the key to making this program a success.
   3.11.2. Program Management. The MACA program’s OPR is the 306 FTG/SEF (Flight
   Safety), but successful program employment requires an aggressive effort by all locally
   assigned flying organizations, ATC, AMOPS, and 306 FTG/SEF.
      3.11.2.1. High priority areas are:
          3.11.2.1.1. Unauthorized flights through the USAFA Class D airspace.
          3.11.2.1.2. Flights through the alert areas and the local training areas for all USAFA
          airfield-flying operations.
          3.11.2.1.3. High density airspace common with Peterson Air Force Base (AFB)/Fort
          Carson/ Colorado Springs Airport and other local airports.
          3.11.2.1.4. USAFA Flyovers.
      3.11.2.2. Any person or agency filing an AF Form 651, shall notify the 306 FTG/SEF
      within 24-hours. The AOF/CC, or appropriate ATC representative, shall forward any
      hazard reports, airspace violations, or safety issues through the 306 OSS/DO and the 306
      FTG/SEF as soon as possible.
 34                                                             USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


                                           Chapter 4

                                  EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

4.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and guidelines for activating the Primary
Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and the Secondary Crash Net (SCN). These procedures are general
in nature and pertain to all aircraft using the airfield. Individuals must comply with appropriate
directives for their particular aircraft or program. Also refer to the USAFA Integrated Defense
Plan.
4.2. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). The purpose of the primary crash alarm system is
to alert first response agencies necessary to perform lifesaving or support functions during
aircraft emergencies. The PCAS operational status check, for audio clarity and recording
quality, will be conducted between the hours of 0730L and 0745L daily or as soon as practical
after airfield opening.
   4.2.1. Agencies on the PCAS are as follows:
       4.2.1.1. ATC (Activating Agency).
       4.2.1.2. Flight Surgeon's Office.
       4.2.1.3. Acute Care Clinic.
       4.2.1.4. Emergency Communications Center (USAFA Fire and Security Forces).
       4.2.1.5. AMOPS.
   4.2.2. If the PCAS is out of service, Tower will relay emergency information to AMOPS via
   direct landline for activation of the SCN. If the emergency does not involve an aircraft,
   tower may relay information via 911 or FM Net.
4.3. Secondary Crash Net (SCN). AMOPS personnel will check the SCN daily for audio
clarity after the check of the PCAS.
   4.3.1. Agencies on the SCN are as follows:
       4.3.1.1. AMOPS (Activating Agency).
       4.3.1.2. Emergency Communications Center (ECC #3 - USAFA Fire and Security
       Forces).
       4.3.1.3. Vehicle Operations.
       4.3.1.4. Public Affairs.
       4.3.1.5. 10 CES.
       4.3.1.6. Emergency Management Control Systems (EMCS).
       4.3.1.7. 10th Air Base Wing Command Center.
       4.3.1.8. Acute Care Clinic.
       4.3.1.9. Chaplain.
       4.3.1.10. USAFA Weather.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                   35


      4.3.1.11. 10 ABW/CC.
      4.3.1.12. USAFA/CW (USAFA/Cadet Wing Commander).
      4.3.1.13. 557 FTS.
      4.3.1.14. Cadet Clinic/Flight Surgeon's Office.
      4.3.1.15. 94 FTS.
      4.3.1.16. 98 FTS.
      4.3.1.17. USAFA/SE.
      4.3.1.18. 306 FTG/SEF.
      4.3.1.19. 306 FTG/CC.
   4.3.2. The emergency telephone number 911 may be used as a backup system to the SCN.
   911 will connect directly to the fire department dispatcher who will relay emergency
   information to the hospital and emergency personnel.
4.4. ATC Response to Emergencies.
   4.4.1. ATC will ensure activation of the PCAS for all emergencies and AMOPS will
   immediately activate the SCN and relay the same information under the following actual or
   exercise conditions:
      4.4.1.1. Any aircraft that is suspected or known to have made a forced landing/crashed
      on USAFA property including Bullseye. (Note: The USAFA Disaster Response Force is
      committed to respond to any mishap involving military resources, when USAFA is the
      nearest military installation. If there is doubt as to which military installation is the
      nearest, the primary crash alarm system will be activated.)
      4.4.1.2. Locally assigned aircraft that is suspected or known to have made a forced
      landing/crashed within the local flying area (65 NM radius).
      4.4.1.3. Aircraft cleared to land/takeoff on a runway and subsequently departs the paved
      surface.
      4.4.1.4. The SOF shall determine PCAS activation requirement on any glider landing
      outside of the primary SPLA or alternate landing areas A–D.
      4.4.1.5. Non-assigned aircraft makes an unauthorized landing.
      4.4.1.6. Parachutist injured on landing and PCAS activation is requested by DZCO.
      4.4.1.7. For locally assigned aircraft with radio failure (NORDO).
      4.4.1.8. For tower evacuation.
      4.4.1.9. Aircraft with hot brakes: runway 16L/34R, may park in the run-up areas on the
      North/South hammerheads. Runway 16C/34C, may park on Taxiway L and Taxiway G.
   4.4.2. Not all contingencies will fit one of the above categories. Common sense and the
   judgment of the ATC supervisor will determine whether or not the primary crash alarm
   system will be activated.
 36                                                             USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


   4.4.3. ATC will relay the following information over the primary crash alarm system: (>>
   Symbol indicates the minimum required information IAW FAAO 7110.65. All other
   information may be obtained as necessary on a time permitting basis).
      4.4.3.1. >> Aircraft identification and type.
      4.4.3.2. >> Nature of emergency.
      4.4.3.3. >> Pilot’s desires.
      4.4.3.4. Fuel status and tail number.
      4.4.3.5. Number of personnel on board.
      4.4.3.6. Estimated time of arrival (ETA) to the airfield and revised ETAs with PCAS
      activations.
      4.4.3.7. Landing runway.
      4.4.3.8. Wind.
      4.4.3.9. Any other information pertinent to emergency response teams.
   4.4.4. If a pilot requires assistance from the 306 FTG SOF, tower controllers will authorize a
   frequency change to the appropriate frequency. If equipment permits, controllers will
   monitor and issue a landing clearance on the 306 FTG SOF frequency to preclude another
   frequency change.
4.5. Response to Emergencies.
   4.5.1. AMOPS Response to Emergencies.
      4.5.1.1. Activate the SCN, passing information as received from Academy Tower.
      Additionally, if AMOPS is the first agency notified of an emergency they will pass the
      information to Academy Tower via landline for PCAS activation, then complete the
      AETC Form 745, Emergency/ Accident and Hazardous Cargo Log.
      4.5.1.2. In the event of an actual crash, notify the Airfield Operations Flight Commander,
      333-2479.
      4.5.1.3. Notify 306 FTG SOF or FTGA (as required).
      4.5.1.4. Prior to returning to normal operational status, check airfield facilities affected
      by the emergency or mishap (for FOD, dropped objects, damage, etc.) including the
      SPLA.
      4.5.1.5. Coordinate with 10 CES for removal of wreckage from the runway or adjacent
      areas around the airfield. Wreckage will not be removed until ordered to do so by the
      appropriate authority for the mishap class (National Transportation Safety Board for civil
      aircraft, Single Investigating Officer, Interim Safety Board president, or Safety
      Investigation Board president).
      4.5.1.6. If the crash is on a runway or SPLA, close the affected runway/SPLA and issue a
      NOTAM.
      4.5.1.7. If after duty hours (weekdays 0730-1630), notify the following personnel at
      home: (when the 306 FTG SOF is on duty, he/she will make these calls.)
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                     37

          4.5.1.7.4. AOF/CC and AFM.
   4.5.2. During other base emergencies and contingencies (attack warning, base recalls for
   readiness, natural disasters, etc.), the USAFA Command Center (10 ABW/CP) will broadcast
   alert notification messages.
4.6. Ground Response to Emergencies.
   4.6.1. 10th Medical Group (MDG) will provide for medical response to all PCAS activations
   involving airfield emergencies. The 10 MDG will not normally respond to emergencies at
   Bullseye. Medical support will be provided as required.
      4.6.1.1. American Medical Response (AMR) ambulance response is mandatory for all
      activations of the PCAS. This response may be terminated at any time during the
      emergency as deemed appropriate by the Incident Commander.
      4.6.1.2. AMR, and a flight surgeon as appropriate, will respond to emergencies of the
      following natures:
          4.6.1.2.1. Actual crashes on or near USAFA property.
          4.6.1.2.2. Any emergency involving a fire.
          4.6.1.2.3. Any physiological incident.
          4.6.1.2.4. Any additional condition as deemed necessary by the Incident
          Commander.
      4.6.1.3. For any emergency not requiring immediate response, Flight Surgeon will
      monitor the Crash Net until emergency termination.
      4.6.1.4. Acute Care Clinic personnel will recall the Flight Surgeon, as necessary, for any
      emergency resulting in transport on weekends or holidays.
   4.6.2. Fire protection responds IAW AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program. Fire
   Station 3 will immediately notify AMOPS and ATC of any "call-in" ground emergency it
   receives via other than the PCAS or SCN, which requires response on the airfield. Bullseye
   Fire Support Crew will support Bullseye Airfield when active. If an emergency occurs at
   Bullseye the fire crew at Bullseye will follow their QRC and contact Fire Station 3 located on
   the airfield. Fire Station 3 will notify AMOPS, and then SCN will be rung out by AMOPS.
   All other support will be provided through the appropriate civilian agency.
   4.6.3. All emergency response vehicles will respond to the emergency location as directed
   by ATC. The fire department should make contact with Academy Ground and position on
   Taxiway D to allow immediate access to the runway. All emergency response vehicles will
   remain clear of active runways until directed by Academy Ground to proceed to the
   emergency location/onto the runway. If the emergency aircraft is on or landing on Runway
   16R/34L or 16C/34C, emergency response vehicles will contact Skytrain after crossing
   Runway 16L/34R for access to the aircraft. AMOPS will establish contact with Academy
 38                                                              USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


   Ground/Skytrain on the FM net. Airfield operations personnel will escort responding
   vehicles to the scene of the emergency if required.
   4.6.4. The senior fire official responding to the emergency assumes the Incident Commander
   role and will determine crash and rescue equipment responsibilities.
   4.6.5. Once an emergency aircraft has landed, only the On-scene Commander may terminate
   the emergency. ATC will then advise AMOPS of emergency termination via landline.
   Aircraft commanders may terminate the emergency at any time prior to landing.
   4.6.6. Any USAFA agency that is informed of a potential aircraft mishap or accident shall
   immediately forward all known information to ATC or AMOPS staff. This information shall
   be exchanged between AMOPS and ATC to ensure appropriate checklist/response is
   accomplished.
   4.6.7. SF vehicles/personnel responding to emergencies will remain off the airfield unless
   directed by the FD, AMOPS or tower.
4.7. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.
   4.7.1. ATC will notify AMOPS when an ELT signal is detected. PCAS activation is not
   required until information is received suspecting an actual aircraft mishap. ATC will call
   Colorado Springs Approach Control to ask if the ELT has been received through their
   facility.
   4.7.2. AMOPS will check with the 94 FTS, 98 FTS, FTC, 557 FTS and 306 OSS/OSTL
   (Aircrew Flight Equipment) for accountability of ELT equipment and an inadvertent
   activation. If an inadvertent activation cannot be confirmed, AMOPS will notify Denver FSS
   who will notify Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center.
   4.7.3. If the ELT strength indicates the signal is on KAFF, Aircrew Flight Equipment will
   attempt to locate the source by using the portable hand-carried ELT locator (YELPER). If it
   is not found on the Academy Airfield or vicinity, AMOPS will notify the El Paso County
   Sheriff who will, in turn, notify El Paso County Search and Rescue.
   4.7.4. In the event of a known accidental activation of an ELT, the individual responsible
   will immediately report it to AMOPS.
4.8. ATC/AMOPS Evacuation Procedures. ATC will evacuate, IAW local QRCs, for bomb
threats, fires, when winds register a steady 90 knots or greater, or for other situations as deemed
necessary by the WS/SC for safety of personnel. AMOPS will evacuate IAW local QRCs and
evacuation procedures.
   4.8.1. Except for bomb threats, ATC will transmit on all tower frequencies, including the
   trunk radio system, 243.0 MHz, and 121.5 MHz, that Academy Tower is being evacuated.
   Advise all airborne traffic in the east pattern to climb to high traffic (pattern altitude 8,100
   feet) or depart the pattern on upwind leg. Advise all ground traffic to hold position and
   contact their appropriate SOF/Ops Sup/DZCO. In case of a bomb threat, only intrinsically
   safe FM radios will be used to communicate within a cordon area. Aircraft attempting to
   land will do so at the pilot’s own risk. The runway is then uncontrolled.
   4.8.2. Except for bomb threats and high winds, ATC may relocate to the alternate tower
   (Building 9207). During a bomb threat to Building 9231, tower personnel shall proceed to
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                         39


   the south wind sensor located between Taxiway H and the midfield access road or the
   taxiway north of the midfield hangar, unless directed otherwise. For situations requiring
   evacuation to assigned shelters, refer to USAFA Plan 32-2, CE Contingency Response Plan.
   4.8.3. No arrivals/departures will be authorized until the tower or alternate tower is open and
   ready to resume operations. Alternate procedures after a bomb threat evacuation will be
   determined by the FTGA.
   4.8.4. Only mission essential vehicles will be permitted on or near runways and taxiways
   during evacuation. AMOPS shall hold all nonessential vehicles away from runways and
   landing zones until ATC has relocated and is ready to resume operations.
   4.8.5. An in-flight emergency attempting to land during a facility evacuation will do so at
   the pilot’s own risk.
4.9. Alternate Control Tower Services. The alternate control tower is located above Building
9207. This facility is self-contained and ready at all times for use by controllers. Attachment 4
depicts the alternate control tower’s visual and radio blind spots.
   4.9.1. Communication capability in the alternate tower is adequate to sustain limited air
   traffic control operations. There are two Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS) consoles
   or Touch Entry Displays (TED) installed for use. Both have all UHF, VHF, and FM radio
   channels, and landlines applicable to USAFA Airfield. There are also two multi-channel
   radios (one VHF and one UHF), and a commercial phone available as back-up to the TEDs.
   A hard copy of the tower QRC, necessary forms, and the airfield crash grid map are pre-
   positioned in the alternate tower. Airfield, NOTAM, and weather data shall be obtained via
   landline.
   4.9.2. All vehicle movement shall cease unless coordinated and approved by AMOPS, until
   the alternate tower/primary tower is open and ready to begin/resume operations.
   4.9.3. The minimum controller staffing for the alternate tower is one WS and one qualified
   controller. To relocate back to the main tower, supervisors may temporarily staff with one
   WS controller to facilitate the move.
   4.9.4. No more than three aircraft are authorized in the pattern when using alternate control
   tower procedures.
   4.9.5. When ATC is operating from the alternate facility emergency information will be
   passed to AMOPS by phone for relay via the SCN.
4.10. Antitheft and Antihijack Procedures. The hijacking or theft of an aircraft at USAFA
Airfield is a real and definite possibility. Personnel must be alert for suspicious activity at all
times. Individual flying squadrons, Doss Aviation, and the aero club are responsible for
monitoring the use of their aircraft. They shall notify AMOPS if an unauthorized start-up or taxi
occurs.
   4.10.1. AMOPS shall notify ATC when an aircraft will be departing KAFF on a
   crosscountry flight. Aircraft shall be allowed to taxi but not depart until all flight plan issues
   are resolved with AMOPS.
   4.10.2. AMOPS will investigate all suspected unauthorized aircraft movements, to include
   taxi operations after sunset, and take appropriate action.
 40                                                             USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


4.11. Aircraft Mishap Response Procedures. 306 FTG personnel shall not release
information, to include personnel information, regarding aircraft incidents or mishaps to
unauthorized agencies. Inquiries regarding aircraft incidents or mishaps shall be referred to
USAFA Public Affairs.
   4.11.1. IAW USAFA Plan 91-204, Incident Response Plan, immediately following an
   aircraft incident/mishap, the ATC WS or Senior Controller (SC) shall:
       4.11.1.1. Ensure other aircraft are prevented from flying over the incident/mishap site.
       4.11.1.2. If requested by the Incident Commander, FTGA, or 306 FTG SOF, ATC will
       notify COS Approach and ask for a temporary flight restriction (TFR) over the
       incident/mishap site.
       4.11.1.3. Plot the incident/mishap site on the crash grid map and relay updated
       coordinates and information via the PCAS.
       4.11.1.4. Notify the ATC CCTLR.
       4.11.1.5. Safeguard written and recorded data pertaining to an aircraft mishap.
       4.11.1.6. Notify the CCTLR, AOF/CC or designated representative who will in turn
       notify HQ AETC (Mon – Fri, 0730 – 1530 local time), at DSN 487-5757. (Note:
       Obtain 306 FTG/CC or FTGA concurrences prior to notifying AETC.)
4.12. Dangerous Cargo Area. Aircraft carrying dangerous cargo will park at the isolation pad
or the north hammerhead.
4.13. Controlled Bailout Areas. (Not applicable for USAFA.)
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                    41


                                          Chapter 5

                                  GROUND OPERATIONS

5.1. Aircraft Parking Plan. The USAFA airfield-parking plan is published in 306 FTG OI 13-
203 Volume 3, Airfield Parking Plan and Operational Data. The USAFA airfield is used solely
for flight training of USAFA cadets and Aero Club. The airfield does not have the ability to
allow for hazardous cargo. All hazardous materials are delivered to the USAFA by ground
transportation. In the event that an aircraft arrives at the USAFA airfield with hazardous cargo
the aircraft will be parked on the north hammerhead/taxiway A.
5.2. Personnel, Aircraft, and Vehicles in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   5.2.1. CMA: ATC, Operations, and cadet personnel utilizing the airfield are required to be
   trained and tested periodically on CMAs, staging areas, and local airfield operating
   procedures. AMOPS, individual flying squadrons, and ATC will administer the training and
   testing for their own personnel.
       5.2.1.1. Consists of all active runway surfaces and overruns, including portions of
       taxiways from the hold lines to the runway surface. Hold lines are painted 100 feet
       outward from the runway edges on each taxiway except on Taxiways J and K. Taxiways
       J and K are CMA including 50 feet north and south of Taxiways J and K. Inactive
       runways are designated as CMA, area NOTAMed closed may or may not be CMA.
       Depending on the reasoning for why a runway is NOTAMed closed, it may or may not be
       appropriate to maintain CMA status of the closed area. If the CMA status is removed to
       allow non-ATC approved vehicle operations, the NOTAM closing the area must also
       state the area involved is ―temporarily removed from the CMA.‖
       5.2.1.2. Due to the unique nature of sailplane and jump operations on the USAF
       Academy airfield, the SPLA (controlled by the 94th FTS) and DZ (controlled by the 98th
       FTS) are not included as part of the CMA (exception: the SPLA within 100 feet of the
       west runway). For specifics regarding ground operations within the SPLA and DZ,
       reference the 94 FTS Sailplane Ground Training publication and 98 FTS OI 11-418, 98
       FTS Operations Supervision.
       5.2.1.3. Aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians must obtain specific ATC approval to enter
       the CMA. All aircraft and vehicle operators shall maintain direct two-way radio contact
       with Academy Ground/Skytrain while on the CMA. No exceptions will be granted
       unless under strict escort of an authorized agency.
       5.2.1.4. Vehicle operators and pedestrians are expected to visually check for
       approaching/ departing aircraft in both directions, prior to proceeding onto or across a
       runway.
   5.2.2. Academy Ground/Skytrain does not normally monitor the Fire Department’s trunk
   radio system (TRS). Personnel unable to talk to ATC via the TRS should contact either the
   fire control dispatcher or AMOPS who will call the tower via landline to select the TRS prior
   to crash response vehicles entering the CMA.
 42                                                               USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


   5.2.3. Personnel who have successfully completed midfield ―access road only‖ drivers
   training are authorized to drive vehicles on the midfield access road between the east and
   center runways, and cross Taxiway G to and from midfield facilities.
   5.2.4. Pedestrians on Runway 16/34C and 16R/34L will be under the control of Skytrain/
   Academy Tower and/or the 94 FTS Marshaller, as appropriate.
   5.2.5. If radio contact with Academy Tower/Ground/Skytrain is lost, personnel and vehicles
   will move at least 100 feet from the runways and proceed with caution via the access road,
   and if practical, to Airfield Drive. When necessary, ATC will use light gun signals to
   attempt communication and if unable, notify AMOPS who will dispatch a vehicle to remove
   the NORDO personnel from the runway environment.
5.3. Towing Operations.
   5.3.1. Vehicles towing aircraft shall contact Academy Ground Control/Skytrain prior to
   entering any taxiway in order to prevent any conflicts with taxiing aircraft. Two-way radio
   contact with ATC will be maintained while in the controlled movement area. Towing during
   airfield closure and during the hours of darkness is allowed. Taxi operations are not
   authorized between sunset and sunrise. Vehicle operators must be vigilant for any type
   aircraft operations between sunset and sunrise.
   5.3.2. The AFTC Manager, 98 FTS/CC, 557 FTS/CC and 94 FTS/CC will ensure that all
   contract personnel authorized to start, warm-up, operate, test engines or taxi aircraft are
   qualified IAW AFI 11-218, Air Operations and Movement on the Ground, and appropriate
   squadron regulations.
   5.3.3. Towing operations will not be conducted during snow removal operations unless
   approved by the AFM.
5.4. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements/Routes.
   5.4.1. Minimum wingtip taxi clearance distance without a wing walker is 25 feet. With a
   wing walker or when utilizing established taxi lines, this distance is reduced to 10 feet for
   locally assigned aircraft.
   5.4.2. Aircraft will not taxi while obstructions are within their prescribed taxi lines.
   5.4.3. Aircraft shall not taxi within 50 feet of any refueling operations. Refueling operations
   shall cease if an aircraft taxis within 50 feet of the aircraft being refueled.
   5.4.4. Aircraft parking on the north ramp will normally taxi in a counterclockwise direction.
   Enter the apron on the south side and exit on the north end. If nonstandard taxi is desired,
   aircraft shall state their location obtain approval from Academy Ground.
   5.4.5. The south apron taxi/parking procedures are clockwise: enter through the north and
   exit through the south.
   5.4.6. ATC will issue taxi instructions to aircraft IAW FAA JO 7110.65T, paragraph 3-7-2.
   5.4.7. After landing, base assigned aircraft may turn off on the first practical taxiway or
   intersecting inactive runway unless otherwise directed by ATC. Vehicles may also turn off
   on a taxiway or intersecting inactive runway unless otherwise directed by ATC.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                      43


      5.4.7.1. From Runway 16L/34R and taxiing to the Airmanship ramp: aircraft should exit
      to the west (onto Runway 08/26 is authorized), hold short of Taxiway H, and contact
      Skytrain.
      5.4.7.2. From the Airmanship ramp to any runway: aircraft are authorized to taxi up to
      the hold short lines on Taxiways J or K before contacting Skytrain/Academy Ground.
      Expect taxi clearance at the hold line.
          5.4.7.2.1. Use caution when taxiing aircraft on Taxiways J and K when Runway 34 is
          in use, or when a sailplane will be landing in alternate sailplane landing areas ―A‖ or
          ―D.‖ In those situations, sailplanes will be flying very low over or landing toward the
          taxiways.
          5.4.7.2.2. Ensure taxiing aircraft are clear of Taxiways J and K between Runway 34L
          and the west ramp before a glider over-flies the taxiways (Runway 34 in use).
      5.4.7.3. Tail and wing walkers are not required when towing aircraft on marked guide
      lines. (AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities,
      paragraph 2.2.3.)
      5.4.7.4. Taxi operations between sunset and sunrise are not authorized. Civil twilight
      does not apply.
      5.4.7.5. Pilots/maintenance personnel must contact ground control/Skytrain for any taxi
      operation utilizing any taxiway to ensure deconfliction from other taxiing aircraft.
      5.4.7.6. Aircraft with wingspans greater than 40-feet are not authorized to taxi through
      the Taxiway A and C hammerheads (warm-up pad) when other aircraft are parked in the
      hammerhead due to lack of wingtip clearance. Aircraft with wingspans greater than 40-
      feet are not authorized on the north ramp, aero club ramp, or south ramp without the prior
      approval of the AFM.
5.5. Procedures for Movement on or Across Runways.
   5.5.1. Academy Ground/Skytrain issues clearances onto and across runways when the
   airfield is open. Clearances to cross Runway 16/34C are issued by Skytrain when soaring
   operations are in progress. The marshaller controls crossings of Runway 16R/34L (between
   the EOR lines) when soaring operations are in progress.
   5.5.2. Pedestrian Crossing Procedures for Runway 16/34C and 16R/34L. Proper use of the
   runway crossing procedures is important to prevent personal injury. Personnel must be
   trained and training must be documented on pedestrian crossing procedures IAW the 306
   FTG Airfield Driving Operating Instruction to utilize the procedure. Controllers will use the
   crossing light system to authorize Runway 16/34C crossings. When the crossing light system
   is inoperative, the Skytrain public address system (big voice) is recorded and will be used. In
   the event both the crossing light system and big voice are inoperative simultaneously, the
   tower supervisor will coordinate an alternate means of pedestrian crossing procedures to be
   used with squadron supervision. All runway crossings in that case shall be controlled via
   radio (FM Net). The 94 FTS Operations Supervisor will provide an individual to act as a
   runway crossing expeditor. The expeditor will be posted near the east crossing box with a
   handheld FM radio tuned to AF-2. Skytrain will advise the expeditor on AF-2 when center
   runway crossings to and from the west crossing box are authorized. The expeditor will
44                                                            USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


  inform personnel in the east crossing box (by voice command) and inform personnel in the
  west crossing box (with a hand signal) that they may proceed across.
     5.5.2.1. Upon receipt of Skytrain approval, all personnel shall cross Runway 16C/34C, in
     the pedestrian crossing lane (between the yellow lines) starting from either the eastern or
     western crossing box (yellow hashed area). Approval will be signaled with a green light.
     The signal lights are located on the northwest corner of the midfield facility, directly
     above the logger box. Normally the light is red, indicating do not cross. The light will be
     changed to green to indicate approval to cross.
         5.5.2.1.1. To cross east to west: approval to cross Runway 16C/34C is only granted
         to those personnel waiting in the eastern crossing box when the green crossing light is
         illuminated; others outside or approaching the eastern crossing box shall not cross.
         When the green crossing light is illuminated, pedestrians shall proceed expeditiously
         to the western crossing box and get further clearance from the marshaller (Skytrain
         when no marshaller is present) before crossing Runway 16R/34L. (Note: Skytrain
         maintains control of all portions of Runway 16R/34L until control is transferred to the
         marshaller.)
         5.5.2.1.2. To cross west to east: Pedestrians shall obtain approval from the
         marshaller (Skytrain when no marshaller is present) before crossing Runway
         16R/34L. Cross Runway 16R/34L when cleared by the marshaller (Skytrain when no
         marshaller is present) to the western crossing box and await further clearance (green
         light). Approval to cross Runway 16C/34C is only granted to those personnel waiting
         in the western crossing box when the green crossing light is illuminated; others
         approaching the western crossing box shall not cross. When the green crossing light
         is illuminated, pedestrians shall proceed expeditiously across Runway 16C/34C to the
         eastern crossing box.
     5.5.2.2. Assisting sailplanes on Runway 16/34C. When Skytrain illuminates the green
     crossing light, pedestrians may either cross the Runway (16/34C) or proceed beyond the
     yellow stripes to assist a sailplane on Runway 16/34C. During TG-15 operations,
     Skytrain will not allow the tow plane onto the runway until the ground crew is in place at
     the aircraft if not at the midfield stripe.
  5.5.3. All sailplanes and vehicles desiring to cross Runway 16/34C or 16R/34L must be in
  radio contact with the Skytrain controller. When cleared to cross Runway 16/34C or
  16R/34L by the Skytrain controller, the vehicle cleared will immediately cross. When the
  marshaller has control of the west runway staging areas, clearance can be obtained from the
  marshaller for crossing Runway 16R/34L to and from the western crossing box.
  5.5.4. Skytrain shall announce on big voice their intentions of taxiing tow planes from the
  west holding area into holding position or crossing the center runway. At the big voice
  announcement, the marshaller shall not authorize pedestrians to the crossing box and ensure
  pedestrians already in the crossing box proceed west away from tow plane route to Runway
  16/34C.
  5.5.5. Pedestrian Crossing Procedures for Taxiway Hotel. A siren will be used to stop
  personnel from crossing Taxiway H at midfield. The siren is activated by Skytrain
  controllers when aircraft are instructed to proceed through the intersection of Taxiway H and

                                           Chapter 6

                                  SPECIAL OPERATIONS

6.1. Helicopter Operations. Helicopter crews shall be directed to Current Operations, Airspace
Aerial Events (306 OSS/OSOA, at 333-4617) for coordination of helicopter operations. Aerial
Events will coordinate with AMOPS for fire protection coverage, desired landing zone, and
support requirements. This procedure is not required for medical assistance to safety and traffic
(MAST) or medical evacuation flights. USAFA Fire Department will determine the appropriate
fire protection coverage at the landing zone for MAST, medical evacuation, and DV helicopter
landings.
   6.1.1. Helicopter Landings at USAFA Airfield: Helicopters inbound for landing at the
   airfield shall contact ATC no later than 5-miles south and 10-miles from the north of the
   airport and prior to entering USAFA Class D airspace or alert area A-260. The designated
   helicopter parking site at the USAFA airfield is the concrete isolation pad located on the
   northeast portion of the airfield unless directed otherwise by AMOPS. Large helicopters or
   helicopters with skids shall not be parked on any asphalt surface on the airfield unless
   directed by AMOPS.
   6.1.2. Helicopters taxiing to the south apron from the isolation pad should be air-taxied.
   Note: GATR antennas (100 feet tall) east of Airfield Drive and abeam the south ramp.
   6.1.3. USAFA Off-Airfield Helicopter Landing Zones (LZ): normal off-airfield landing
   zones include the cadet area, parade field, Jacks Valley, the officers club, and Aardvark
   Auxiliary Airfield. MedEvac flights normally use officers club LZ. Helicopters inbound for
   landing at an off-airfield LZ shall contact ATC no later than 5-miles from the intended LZ.
   When scenic control is on site, ATC shall transfer radio communications to scenic control as
   soon as practical after ensuring all traffic conflicts are resolved.
   6.1.4. Helicopter Orientation Flights. Helicopter orientation flights are conducted during
   basic cadet training (BCT), the Commandant’s Challenge, and other various times during the
   year. The pilot will maintain radio communications with ATC/Scenic Control during the
   orientation flights. These and other helicopter orientation flights must be coordinated
   through 306 OSS/ OSOA (333-4617) and AMOPS.
6.2. Hazardous Cargo, Arm/De-arm, Hydrazine and Hot Armament. Guidance on handling
arriving aircraft carrying dangerous materials are contained in AFJI 11-204, Operational
Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials. Except in an emergency, aircraft with
dangerous materials will be directed to divert to a different location than KAFF. The following
procedures will apply to emergency aircraft carrying hazardous cargo/armament that land at
KAFF:
   6.2.1. Aircraft carrying hazardous cargo/armament will park facing north on the isolation
   pad.
   6.2.2. ATC will, as soon as possible, advise AMOPS of ETA of hazardous cargo/armament.
   ATC will give these aircraft priority in landing, departure, and taxi clearances.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                      47


   6.2.3. AMOPS coordinates with the aircraft commander to ensure all cargo or armament
   aboard the aircraft is safe, and notifies appropriate agencies, including Security Forces and
   weapons safety (USAFA/SE, 333-3205), who will determine if a security guard is required.
6.3. Night Parachuting Operations. Parachutists jumping from aircraft after official sunset
will be equipped with adequate lighting as prescribed in FAR, Part 105. During night parachute
operations, the DZCO will notify emergency agencies directly if needed.
   6.3.1. USAFA Weather will provide support during night jump operations when scheduled.
   As a minimum, one observer and one forecaster will be on duty. DZCO will notify USAFA
   Weather when all night jumps are completed.
   6.3.2. Airspace Management will complete a USAF Academy Aerial Event Notification
   Worksheet, for night jumps. AMOPS will publish a safety NOTAM and coordinate with
   Denver FSS for civilian NOTAM action. Additionally, AMOPS will coordinate the night
   jumps with agencies IAW their operating checklists.
6.4. Special Events/Flyovers. Participating pilots will contact 306 OSS/OSOA at 333-4617 at
least 48-hours, preferably at least five days prior to ETA. OSOA will coordinate with AMOPS
for support requirements and local flying restrictions.
   6.4.1. With the exception of sailplanes off tow, aircraft will not over-fly the USAFA clinic
   or the buildings in the cadet area unless authorized by the Airspace Manager.
   6.4.2. USAFA flyovers are conducted IAW DoD and Air Force instructions, to include
   applicable MAJCOM and FTG supplements.
6.5. Bullseye Operations. Attachment 6 depicts Bullseye Auxiliary airfield.
   6.5.1. Fire Department will dispatch firefighters to Bullseye one-hour prior to the day’s first
   scheduled Bullseye flight operation. Bullseye flight operations times are published on the
   weekly flying schedule. As a minimum, an airfield check of active landing surfaces will be
   conducted prior to the start of flying operations. AMOPS personnel will arrive no-later-than
   30 minutes prior to scheduled flight operations and conduct the prior to flying check. All
   personnel performing airfield checks must be certified in their training record (see AFI 13-
   204, Volume 3, paragraph 17.2.1.).
   6.5.1.1. Upon arrival at Bullseye, Fire Department personnel will tour/examine the airfield.
   The purpose of this tour is to disperse any antelope found on the airfield and to ensure no
   hazard exists (i.e., no sinkhole has appeared in the runway, no dead animals on the runway,
   no obvious FOD hazard, etc.). Once the tour/examination is completed, the fire department
   will notify AMOPS (document call in Duty Log) and notify the 557 FTS that they are in
   place and ready for flight operations.
       6.5.1.2. FD personnel do not establish current BWC or RSC conditions; both conditions
       will be considered ―unknown‖ until the individual conducting the prior to flying check
       establishes the conditions. Since there are no AMOPS or ATC services at Bullseye,
       aircrews operating at Bullseye will update BWC or RSC conditions via aircraft radio
       communications to the SOF, who in-turn will notify AMOPS and 557 FTS.
       6.5.1.3. When the last aircraft operation is completed at Bullseye, the 557 FTS will
       notify the Bullseye fire department. The fire department will, in turn, notify AMOPS
 48                                                             USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011


      they are departing Bullseye for the day (AMOPS will document the call in AF Form
      3616).
   6.5.2. Should fire department personnel observe unfamiliar/non-306 FTG aircraft flying at
   Bullseye, they will attempt to obtain the aircraft tail number, an aircraft description (single
   engine, twin engine, color(s), etc.) and what the aircraft was doing (touch-and-go, low
   approach, etc.). The fire department will pass this information to AMOPS (AMOPS will
   document the call in AF Form 3616).
6.6. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).
   6.6.1. When ATC is notified that RPA/UAS area/airspace is active/deactivated, ATC shall
   broadcast the information on all local ATC frequencies at the time of the notification.
   6.6.2. RPA/UAS area/airspace status shall be included in ATIS broadcasts.
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                        49


                                           Chapter 7

                                306 FTGA AND SOF DUTIES

7.1. Duties and Responsibilities.
   7.1.1. Flying Training Group Commander Available (FTGA), normally the 306 FTG/CC, or
   designated representative, is responsible for the overall supervision of 306 FTG training
   programs at KAFF and Bullseye. Operations supervision is described in 306 FTG
   Supplement to AFI 11-418. The FTGA will be notified by the 306 FTG SOF or AMOPS of
   all incidents/conditions that affect safety of flight (e.g., severe weather, fire fighting status
   below 100%, aircraft emergencies/ accidents, and aircraft hazard reports).
   7.1.2. During flying hours, the FTGA will maintain continuous availability via
   radio/telephone. Although not required to be physically present at the airfield, the FTGA
   should be able to report to the airfield within 30 minutes of incident notification. A SOF
   must be on duty in accordance with AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision. During towered
   operations, Aero Club and Doss Aviation contractor personnel and aircraft may conduct full
   operations regardless of 306 FTG SOF presence.
   7.1.3. The 306 FTG SOF or AMOPS personnel are responsible for status updates to the duty
   FTGA listing (all updates to the FTGA schedule will be posted on the FTGA monitor in
   AMOPS and updated on the Airfield Information slides, visible to all personnel), and
   notifying the 10 ABW/CP of changes to the FTGA schedule.
   7.1.4. 306 FTG SOF will notify the FTGA when all military flying activities have finished
   for the day. The FTGA and 306 SOF will not authorize flight or taxi operations between
   sunset and sunrise as the USAFA airfield does not have the required airfield lighting systems;
   at the moment of sunset, all aircraft with engines running will be shut down in place and the
   SOF direct towing operations through the aircraft owners unit SOF.
7.2. FTGA Procedures. The USAFA Weekly Flying Schedule identifies the FTGA at the
beginning of each day. Alternate FTGAs will also be listed for applicable time periods. In the
event that the FTGA changes, it is the responsibility of the current FTGA to notify the on-
coming FTGA, 306 FTG SOF and AMOPS of the change in status. When notified by the current
(out-going) and on-coming FTGA, AMOPS personnel will brief the on-coming FTGA of
significant airfield data, and then notify 10 ABW/CP of the change to the FTGA.
   7.2.1. AMOPS personnel will continually monitor status changes to the FTGA schedule,
   post the changes on the FTGA board located in AMOPS and advise their oncoming shift of
   who is performing FTGA duties.

                                   RPA/UAS AIRSPACE

A12.1. RPA/UAS operations within the RPA/UAS Operating areas are outlined below and will
be conducted in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) from the surface up to but not
including the following altitude restrictions: Area A (only authorized for RPA/UAS under 20
pounds) maximum altitude as specified in the approved FAA COA. The SOF may restrict
RPA/UAS operations below a specified altitude and/or may direct the termination of any or all
RPA/UAS operations in the interest of flight safety.




A12.2. In the event of lost link, the RPA/UAS, will follow the approved FAA COA. Current
FAA COA includes the following information:
   A12.2.1. The lost-link procedure begins after the 10 second link timeout timer has expired
   without the unmanned aircraft (UA) receiving any messages from the ground control station
   (GCS). Often, two UA are airborne concurrently, which requires a segregated lost link plan
   to avoid simultaneous lost link scenarios from terminating at the Aardvark Airstrip at the
   same time.
   A12.2.2. Lost link in West Operations Area. UA will fly directly to the West UAS Holding
   Area defined as:
N 39° 02' 14.97" / W 104° 53' 40.72"
N 39° 02' 26.91" / W 104° 53' 41.05"
USAFAI13-204 6 APRIL 2011                                                                      69


N 39° 02' 27.30" / W 104° 53' 09.88"
N 39° 02' 15.35" / W 104° 53' 09.47"
       A12.2.2.1. Once in the West UAS Holding Area, the pilot in command (PIC) shall notify
       the Jacks Valley PIC. The West Area UA will orbit for one hour while attempting to
       reacquire link with the GCS. At the conclusion of one hour without regaining link the
       West UA is preprogrammed to return to the Aardvark Airstrip for an autonomous
       recovery. Unless notified of link reacquisition, the PIC in Jacks Valley will orbit for 10
       minutes before returning to Aardvark Airfield for a normal recovery to clear the airspace.
   A12.2.3. Lost link in the Jack Valley Operations Area. UA will fly directly to the Jacks
   Valley UAS Holding Area defined as:
N 39° 01' 37.45" / W 104° 52' 37.31"
N 39° 01' 37.90" / W 104° 52' 06.16"
N 39° 01' 26.64" / W 104° 52' 05.97"
N 39° 01' 26.09" / W 104° 52' 37.20"
       A12.2.3.1. Once in the Jacks Valley UAS Holding Area, the PIC shall notify the West
       Area PIC. The Jacks Valley UA will orbit for 30 minutes while attempting to reacquire
       link with the GCS. At the conclusion of 30 minutes without regaining link the Jacks
       Valley UA is preprogrammed to return to the Aardvark Airstrip for an autonomous
       recovery. Until notified of link reacquisition or landing at the Aardvark Airstrip, the PIC
       in the West Area will coordinate with the Jacks Valley PIC before returning to Aardvark
       Airfield for a normal recovery.
