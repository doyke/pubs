SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision extends
the support originally provided to the US Army’s Battle Command Training Program under the
Joint Training Transformation Initiative to the Service training programs accredited within the
Joint National Training Capability (JNTC). This revision also addresses the rapidly evolving
organizational and force structure changes within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
and the Services (i.e. Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-13). PAD 07-13 designates Lead
MAJCOMs (L-MAJCOM) and their responsibilities. Use of the term, L-MAJCOM, will imply
HQ Air Combat Command (ACC). The major changes include: establishment of the Air Force
Joint Exercise Coordination Team (AFJECT) which maintains the Global Exercise Schedule
2                                                          AFI10-251 5 FEBRUARY 2009

(GES), consolidation of specific exercise responsibilities into Air Force Participation Matrices
which can be tailored to unique exercise requirements and expanding the scope of the instruction
to include other Services and joint events. The revised participation matrix (Table 3.1) attempts
to strike a cost-effective balance between available resources (personnel, equipment, and
financial) and the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) support required by the various
training programs, exercises, and events. Additionally, funding and man-day issues associated
with designated training events will not be addressed in this instruction. Funding and man-day
issues will be adjudicated at the Initial Planning Conference (IPC).

                          INTRODUCTION AND COMPLIANCE

1.1. Introduction. This instruction provides guidance and responsibilities for Air Force
MAJCOMs that are engaged in replicating for training purposes AOC functionality and
operational functions of air, space, and cyberspace power. This includes Joint, Air Force, and
Service exercise and training programs accredited within the JNTC. The intent is to provide
realistic and scalable AOC products, and processes functionality appropriate to the
organizational level of the training audience. Depending on the specific training program,
exercise, or event, the training audience may range from the operational level of the
Joint/Combined Force Commander to airmen, soldiers, sailors, and marines at the tactical level.

1.1.1. Air Force participation overlays elements of air, space, and cyberspace power doctrine by
replicating the air component products, processes, and the effects of air, space, and cyberspace
power employment. The intent is to demonstrate and establish an understanding within the
training audience of the full air, space, and Information Operations (IO) capabilities presented
through the Combined or Joint Force Air Component Commander (CFACC or JFACC
C/JFACC), and the Combined or Joint Air Operations Center (CAOC or JAOC C/JAOC).
Effective synchronization of air, space, and cyberspace power effects into the ground scheme of
maneuver and/or maritime employment concepts will enhance future joint contingency
operations. Likewise, Air Force General Officer (GO) participation will build a cadre of senior
officers who have an understanding of Joint doctrine and decision-making processes at the
operational and tactical levels.

1.1.2. Air Force enablers include Senior Mentors (SM), Observer/Trainers (OT), Command and
Control (C2) Trainers/Supervisors, Controllers, a GO Subject Matter Expert (SME), Modeling
and Simulation (M&S) capabilities with associated databases and SME support, and a Deputy
Exercise Director for Air and Space (DEDAS).

1.1.3. The Air Force participants include AOC personnel, the Air Component Coordination
Element (ACCE) Director and support staff, and those elements of the Theater Air Control
System (TACS) and Battlefield Weather (BW) that are integrated with their USA Component.
The ACCE and appropriate TACS and BW elements, as outlined in Table 3.1., will support
Battle Command Seminars (BCS), planning/execution of training programs, and exercises.

1.1.4. Specific requests for Air Force (training audience and or enablers) participation will be
submitted by each MAJCOM or Joint/Service users on an annual basis utilizing the Joint
Training Information Management System (JTIMS) to the L-MAJCOM. ACC/A3J will
prioritize and provide process adjudication oversight through the AFJECT. Failure to submit a
request for support in accordance with AFJECT established scheduling criteria will result in no
support being provided.

1.1.5. Consistent with resource and fiscal constraints, this instruction will provide levels of
effort to properly integrate air, space, and cyberspace power to meet AF and Joint/Service
training objectives. Participating MAJCOMs will publish supplements to this instruction to
4                                                           AFI10-251 5 FEBRUARY 2009

further define operational,     logistical,   and   administrative   support   requirements   and
responsibilities.

1.2. Background. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for Army/Air Force Liaison
Support, dated 23 January 2008, provides Service guidance to USA and USAF Major
Commands for Liaison duties during home station training, collective training, and deployed
operations. This MOA addresses participation within USA training events by USAF ACCE and
appropriate Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP) and Battlefield Weather (BW) personnel.
Subsequently, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) promulgated additional guidance
directing MAJCOMs to “provide a one or two-star Joint Force Air Component Commander
(JFACC) capable GO for all Corps and select Division-level BCTP exercises that occur in a
MAJCOM’s respective Area of Responsibility (AOR). Additionally, the MAJCOMs will
provide a tailored AOC-trained response cell to support the GO and provide the requisite level of
intelligence, strategy, combat plans, and combat operations support necessary to adequately plan,
supervise, and execute the air component portion of the exercise.” AFI 10-251, Air Force
Participation in the Army Battle Command Training Program under the Joint Training
Transformation Initiative, codified the MOA and CSAF guidance. JTTI is a Chief of Staff of the
Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) initiative to improve air, space, and cyberspace
power fidelity to BCTP, a USA training event for senior commanders and their staffs, as well as
improving ground component fidelity to AF operational-level exercises. OSD’s JNTC initiative
began expanding the JTTI concept. JNTC is an initiative to provide persistent joint context to
existing training programs to improve the overall war fighting capability of the total force. This
gradually took JTTI beyond the scope of the original instruction.

1.3. Applicability and Compliance. Active component, Reserve, and National Guard
units/personnel either providing AOC functionality to Joint/Service training programs or
integrated with USA units are governed by this instruction. Responsibility for successful
implementation of this instruction rests with MAJCOM Directors of Operations or (delegated)
equivalent.

Notes:
   1. Normally one observer trainer from OCTP.
   2. Normally a 20-30 person AOC Functional Cell. If aligned with a BLUE FLAG exercise a
   larger AOC function will be required.
   3. Air Mobility Director must ensure situational awareness of airlift prioritization and
   support, if being played by HICON. ACC and Air Mobility Command (AMC) planners will
   evaluate each exercise to determine support required. AMC, in coordination with ACC, will
   tailor AMC support to achieve training priorities and objectives.
   4. USAFWC may require augmentation to accomplish the AOC function.
   5. The level of support will be determined during the planning conference.
   6. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) SME participation will be the same level as AMLO
   column. AE support is only required when the exercise involves fixed wing movement of
   patients.
   7. HICON and ASOC are not applicable (N/A) for ARNG Bde level WFX because ANG
   ASOGs are not aligned with ARNG brigades.

3.2. Air Force support for the United States Navy/United States Marine Corps
(USN/USMC).

3.2.1. The level of AF participation in USN/USMC events/exercises will be coordinated and
established during early concept development and initial planning conferences. Air Force
participation will be tailored to specific event requirements and will be dependent on available
resources.

Air Component Coordination Element (ACCE) - The air component coordination element
(ACCE) is responsible to the JFACC and coordinates with the CFLCC staff, representing the
JFACC needs in either a supporting or supported role. The ACCE is organized with expertise in
the following areas: plans, operations, intelligence, airspace management, and airlift.

Air Support Operations Group (ASOG) - USAF organization designed to provide the AF
unique administrative support to Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS), Air Support
Operations Flight (ASOF), and weather squadron personnel on Army installations. The ASOG
Commander is normally the Corps’ Senior Air Liaison Officer (ALO). Additionally the ASOG
Commander becomes the ASOC Director when deployed. The ASOG Commander reports to the
appropriate Numbered Air Force Commander.

Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS)/Air Support Operations Flight (ASOF) - USAF
organizations designed to provide support of AF personnel assigned to US Army installations.
The ASOS/ASOF Commander is the senior USAF representative to the supported Army unit.
ASOS/ASOF Commanders report within the Air Force chain of command, normally to the
appropriate Air Support Operations Group Commander.

Air Support Operations Center (ASOC) - The principal air control agency of the theater air
control system responsible for the direction of air operations directly supporting the ground
combat element. It processes and coordinates requests for immediate air support and coordinates
air missions requiring integration with other supporting arms and ground forces. It normally
collocates with the Army tactical headquarters senior fire support coordination center within the
ground combat element.

Air Mobility Liaison Officer (AMLO) - USAF rated officer who functions as the primary
advisor to the Army conventional maneuver or Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF)
AFI10-251 5 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                29

commander on the optimum use of airlift air mobility resources. AMLOs are specifically
designated and trained to control airlift air mobility assets in support of ground troops and
operate the Airlift Mobility Advance Notification/Coordination Net.

Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) - BCTP deploys, trains, and exercises Brigade,
Division, Corps, and Echelon Above Corps (EAC) commanders and staffs; the unit's maneuver
forces are not "live" play but simulated using various computer based models and simulations.
Therefore, at Corps level and below, BCTP is primarily organized, trained and, equipped to
exercise and train USA commanders and staff at the tactical level of warfare. BCTP supports
realistic, stressful unit training and leader development for operational and tactical-level
commanders and supports contingency operations worldwide. BCTP provides a training
environment that reflects full spectrum Joint Interagency Multinational (JIM) operations in the
contemporary operational environment in order to assist the CSA in fulfilling his obligation to
provide Combatant Commanders with trained and ready, joint expeditionary, campaign quality
units.

Battlefield Weather (BW) - AF resources tasked to deploy in support of conventional Army
forces, Air Force special tactics units, or Army special operations forces. BW personnel are
trained and equipped to operate and survive in the forward battlespace e.g., outside the airbase
perimeter.

Joint Force Meteorological and Oceanographic Officer (JMO) - Officer designated to
provide direct meteorological and oceanographic support to the joint task force commander.
(Ref: Joint Pub 3-59, 23 March 1999. JMO Responsibilities outlined in CJCSI 3810.01B,
Enclosure B, Paragraph 12).

Joint Training Transformation Initiative (JTTI) - JTTI is a CSAF and CSA initiative to
improve the integration of USAF and USA forces to best meet the objectives of the combatant
commanders by providing an integrated force to the Combined Forces Commander. The purpose
of JTTI is to enable the USA and USAF to realistically “train like we fight” using doctrinally
correct processes and procedures to integrate USAF and USA forces in service training
exercises. The focus of JTTI is on the integration of air, space, and cyberspace component into
USA BCTP events and the land component into the USAF BLUE FLAG training program.

Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) - A term used to convey all meteorological,
oceanographic, and space environmental factors. These factors include the whole range of
atmospheric and oceanographic phenomena, from the sub-bottom of the Earth’s oceans up to and
including the space environment (space weather). (Ref: CJCSI 3810.01B, 25 August 2003).

Mission Readiness Exercise (MRE) - An exercise that prepares a unit to execute a mission
involving activities associated with Peace Keeping. These exercises are directed by United
States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), tied to a Regional Combatant Commander, and
scheduled based on a Department of the Army (DA) G3 directed Transfer of Authority (TOA).

Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRX) - A USA command post exercise normally associated with
BCTP that provides a training opportunity for senior USA Commanders and their staffs prior to a
deployment into a combat zone. These exercises are directed by United States Army Forces
30                                                        AFI10-251 5 FEBRUARY 2009

Command (FORSCOM), tied to a Regional Combatant Commander, and scheduled based on a
DA G3 directed TOA.

Operational Command Training Program (OCTP) - CSAF directed training program
executed and administered by the 505 Command and Control Wing (CCW). OCTP is designed
to supply doctrinally correct operational-level subject matter expertise to the JFACC and the
AOC. Air Force Senior Mentors interface directly with senior Air Force and Army senior
leaders and conduct Officer Professional Development. Observer Trainers interface at the AOC
Director and Division Chief level, providing academic and over-the-shoulder training. Senior
Mentor and Observer Trainer activities are synchronized.

Staff Weather Officer (SWO) - The Air Force officer directing all space and terrestrial weather
support to the Army unit to which aligned. The SWO is a member of the Army commander’s
special staff under the staff supervision of the G2. The SWO’s primary duty is to advise the
commander on all matters pertaining to how terrestrial and space weather impacts friendly and
enemy operations and weapons systems.

Warfighter Exercise (WFX) - A USA command post exercise normally associated with BCTP
that serves as the capstone training event for senior USA Commanders and their staffs.

Warrior Preparation Center (WPC) - USAFE’s Joint Warfighter Center of Excellence for
operational level training. WPC provides mission rehearsals, exercises and training to
USEUCOM and component senior commanders and battle staffs. WPC employs interactive and
distributed computer simulations to exercise component, joint and combined wartime plans.
Supports joint, combined contingency operation planning and execution for USEUCOM, NATO,
PfP and coalition components.

White Cell - Group of subject matter experts who replicate specialized functions/activities that
are not represented in the exercise.

              USAF MODELING AND SIMULATION OPTIONS MATRIX

A3.1. The following matrix (Table A3.1.) represents the USAF’s suggested modeling and
simulation options designed to achieve the objectives outlined in Chapter 4. Modeling and
Simulation is a critical enabler to the success of the BCTP. Because each event is unique,
modeling and simulation requirements should be coordinated early in the planning stages and
vetted through the 505th Combat Training Squadron (CTS) M & S planner for the given event.
The 505th CTS M&S planner will coordinate with Air Force Agency for Modeling and
Simulation (AFAMS) on any compatibility issues that arise between Air Forces models and real-
world C4 / C2 systems.
