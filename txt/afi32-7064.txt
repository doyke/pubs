This publication implements Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 4715.03, Natural
Resources Conservation Program and Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, Environmental
Quality. It identifies requirements to manage natural resources on Air Force installations in
accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. It applies to
individuals at all levels who manage natural resources on AF installations within the United
States and its territories, including the Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard (ANG), and
government-owned, contractor-operated facilities on Air Force controlled lands except where
noted otherwise. At installations outside the United States and its territories, implement this AFI
consistent with applicable international agreements, Unified Combatant Command (UCC)
policy, environmental annexes to operational orders or plans, country-specific Final Governing
Standards (FGS), or in their absence, the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document
(OEBGD). In case of conflict, UCC policy, the environmental annex, the FGS, or the OEBGD
takes precedence over this AFI. Any organization may supplement this instruction, to include
the Major Commands (MAJCOMs), ANG, and AFRC, however, direct supplements must be
provided to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval.
Further, the ANG or AFRC will support the intent of this Air Force Instruction, and where
needed may prepare an appropriate policy, supplement, guidance, and/or procedural document
reflecting its unique legal status, resources, and structure, as recognized by the reserve
component authorities of Title 10 of the United States Code, Air Force Doctrine and other
governing authorities. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) listed above using the Air Force Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route Air Force Forms 847 from the field through

the appropriate functional chain of command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level
requirements in this publication are identified with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number
following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management,
Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated with the tier numbers. Submit requests
for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate tier waiver approval authority, or
alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS). The use of the name or mark of any specific
manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document includes substantial revisions and must be completely reviewed. This revision
updates and replaces AFI 32-7064, 17 September 2004. It includes updated regulatory
compliance requirements for personnel involved in the management of natural resources on Air
Force installations. It also complies with AFI 33-360 waiver tier requirements described above
and incorporates revised roles and responsibilities based on Program Action Directive 12-03,
Enterprise-Wide Civil Engineer Transformation, and associated Programing Plan. Air Force-
specific policy remains in this AFI, however, additional and more detailed information can be
found in the non-directive process Natural Resources Management playbook published on the
Air Force Civil Engineering A4C Portal: https://app.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/Pages/default.aspx.

                                            Chapter 3

      IMPLEMENTING INTEGRATED NATURAL RESOURES MANAGEMENT

3.1. Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan. In accordance with the Sikes Act, 16
U.S..C § 670 et. seq., the INRMP is the principal tool for managing military installation natural
resources. Each military installation in the United States under the jurisdiction of the Secretary
of Defense must prepare and implement an INRMP unless a determination is made that the
absence of significant natural resources makes preparation of such a plan inappropriate (see 2.2).
INRMPs will be prepared to assist the installation commander with the conservation and
rehabilitation of natural resources consistent with the use of the installation to ensure the
readiness of the Armed Forces. The INRMP will define natural resources management goals and
objectives that are consistent with the military mission and ensure no net loss in the capability of
installation lands to support the military mission. All installation organizations, to include tenant
units, must support the implementation of INRMP goals and objectives, as applicable.
Attachment 2 provides guidelines for INRMP preparation. (T-0).
3.2. Determining the Need for an INRMP. Air Force will determine the requirement for an
installation INRMP based on Category I and II criteria defined below. (T-0).
   3.2.1. Category I Criteria: Category I installations require an INRMP. Category I
   installations have significant natural resources requiring conservation and management.
   Installation size (acreage) should not be used as a sole determining factor in deciding the
   need for an INRMP. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the state
   fish and wildlife management agency should be consulted when determining if significant
   natural resources exist to warrant an INRMP. Installations including or bordering marine
   environments must also consult with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
   National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries). An installation has significant natural
   resources, and will develop and implement an INRMP, if any of the following criteria apply:
       3.2.1.1. The installation conducts on-the-ground military missions on unimproved lands
       that necessitates conservation measures to sustain the natural resources and minimize
       impacts (e.g. soil erosion control). (T-0).
       3.2.1.2. Species listed as threatened or endangered in accordance with the Endangered
       Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. Sections (§§) 1531-1544) are present on the installation, or
       critical habitat has been designated or is currently proposed on the installation, and active
       installation conservation measures are necessary to conserve the species. (T-0).
       3.2.1.3. Hunting, fishing or other natural resources-based outdoor recreation activities
       (e.g. off-road vehicles) are allowed on the installation. (T-0).
       3.2.1.4. The installation operates outgrants (leases, licenses, permits) for livestock
       grazing, crop production, or stable operations that allow horseback riding on unimproved
       lands. (T-0).
       3.2.1.5. The installation operates a commercial forestry program or manages other non-
       urban forest lands in support of: readiness and training activities, maintaining forest
       health, or in support of other ecosystem management goals and objectives. (T-0).
 12                                                          AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


       3.2.1.6. The installation has significant Bird/wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard issues that
       require habitat manipulation outside the managed airfield; or require wildlife hazing or
       depredation activities that are beyond the scope of standard bird/wildlife prevention,
       control, and dispersal operations conducted under the auspices of a BASH Plan
       administered by the Wing Flight Safety office. (T-0).
       3.2.1.7. Important or unique biological resources are present, such as wetlands, species
       listed for state protection, candidate species for federal protection, or unique habitats that
       provide essential loafing, nesting, or foraging areas for migratory birds, bats, or other
       wildlife protected by state or federal law. The unique character of a biological resource is
       determined through consultation with the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency,
       whereby it is established that ecological issues related to the resource require a level of
       planning and management that can only be addressed by an INRMP. (T-0).
   3.2.2. Category II Criteria: Category II installations do not require an INRMP. Category II
   installations are deemed exempt from the INRMP requirement because of the absence of
   significant natural resources as defined by the Category I criteria. Consult with the USFWS
   and appropriate state natural resource management agencies when determining whether
   significant natural resources exist. Installations including or bordering marine environments
   must also consult with NOAA Fisheries. The Director, AF/A4C, or delegated authority
   confirms Category II status. (T-1).
3.3. Cooperative INRMP Preparation. Prepare INRMPs in cooperation with appropriate
stakeholders. Notify stakeholders when a new or revised INRMP will be prepared, and solicit
participation and input to the INRMP development and review process. Attachment 3 specifies
the required coordination and approval process and timeline for cooperative INRMP preparation.
   3.3.1. Internal Stakeholder Participation. Implementation of an INRMP will require the
   action and/or collaboration of the entire installation command structure as well as tenant
   organizations to ensure mission readiness. Solicit participation from known installation
   stakeholders early in the INRMP preparation process, to inlude the Flight Safety office. (T-
   1).
   3.3.2. Interagency Stakeholder Participation. The Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. § 670a(a)(2)),
   requires that an INRMP be prepared in cooperation with the USFWS, the appropriate state
   fish and wildlife agency for the state in which the military installation is located, and NOAA
   Fisheries for installations that include or border marine environments. Invite the USFWS,
   NOAA Fisheries (if applicable), and the state fish and wildlife agency to participate in the
   scoping, design, and preparation of an INRMP. For installations occupying lands withdrawn
   from the public domain, invite the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to participate in the
   scoping and design of an INRMP. On withdrawn lands where the BLM is a stakeholder, a
   Memorandum of Understanding between the installation and the BLM may be used to
   establish agreement on the roles and responsibilities of each party for the management of
   installation natural resources. (T-0).
   3.3.3. Internal Review. Draft INRMP documents must undergo internal agency review prior
   to release for review and comment by external agencies and the general public.
       3.3.3.1. Submit the draft INRMP for formal review and comment within the installation
       chain of command. Incorporate comments into the INRMP as appropriate. (T-1).
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    13


       3.3.3.2. Provide the Installation Support Team the opportunity to review and comment
       on draft INRMP documents; and to Headquarters, Air National Guard for ANG
       installations (T-2).
   3.3.4. Interagency Review. The USFWS, state fish and wildlife agency, and NOAA
   Fisheries (when applicable), must be given the opportunity to review a draft INRMP before
   submitting the document for public review. For installations occupying lands withdrawn
   from the public domain, the BLM must also be given the opportunity to review a draft
   INRMP before submitting for public review. (T-0).
   3.3.5. Public Review. Provide an opportunity for the public to review any initial draft
   INRMP document, or major INRMP revision, and provide comments. Public notification
   must be made when a draft INRMP is available for comment, and the period allowed for the
   submittal of comments must be no less than 30 days. The USFWS, state fish and wildlife
   agency, and NOAA Fisheries (if applicable), must be given the opportunity to review all
   public comments received on an INRMP. (T-0).
3.4. INRMP Approval. An INRMP is considered compliant with the Sikes Act if it has been
approved in writing by the appropriate representative from each cooperating agency within the
past five years. Approval of a new or revised INRMP is documented by signature on a signature
page signed by the Installation Commander (or designee), and a designated representative of the
USFWS, state fish and wildlife agency, and NOAA Fisheries when applicable. A letter of
coordination and approval signed by the designated representative of a cooperating agency will
suffice in lieu of a signature on the INRMP signature page. INRMP approval is sustained
through the annual INRMP review and coordination process (see 2.5). The INRMP is
considered current until an annual review coordination process results in a determination by the
cooperating agencies that a revision is required; or if concurrence is rescinded by notice from a
cooperating agency. The BLM is not a required signatory to an INRMP, but must be given the
opportunity or review and comment on draft INRMP documents (T-0).
   3.4.1. Establishment of Mutual Agreement. Each signature on an INRMP signature page,
   approval letter, or annual review document shall reflect the mutual agreement of the parties
   on those portions of the INRMP within the scope of each agency’s authority. By signature of
   the authorized representative from a cooperating agency, the agency asserts agreement that
   the INRMP is sufficient and compliant in accordance with the Sikes Act. Mutual agreement
   will be the goal with respect to the entire INRMP. However, mutual agreement is required
   only with respect to those elements of the INRMP that are subject to the jurisdictional
   authority of the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries as specified by law (e.g. Endangered Species
   Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act), or the inherent rights of the state to conserve, protect,
   and manage fish and wildlife resources.
   3.4.2. Failure to Reach Mutual Agreement. In cases where the USFWS or state withholds its
   agreement to an INRMP based on objections to elements of the INRMP that are clearly not
   within the scope of the particular agency's authority, an installation may, notwithstanding the
   objections, finalize the INRMP as specified in Attachment 3 and proceed to manage its
   natural resources in accordance with the terms of the plan. The installation shall seek a
   written explanation from a cooperating agency to document why a signature is withheld.
 14                                                          AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


3.5. Annual INRMP Review and Coordination. Establish and maintain regular
communications with the appropriate federal and state agencies for the region where the
installation is located (see 2.3). At a minimum, the installation natural resources manager shall
conduct an annual review of the INRMP in coordination with internal stakeholders and local
representatives of the USFWS, state fish and wildlife agency, and NOAA Fisheries where
applicable. Installations will document the findings of the annual review in an Annual INRMP
Review Summary. By signature to the Annual INRMP Review Summary, the collaborating
agency representative asserts concurrence with the findings. If any agency declines to participate
in an on-site annual review, the installation shall submit an Annual INRMP Review Summary
document to the agency via official correspondence and request return correspondence with
concurrence. (T-0).
   3.5.1. The Annual INRMP Review Summary must include:
       3.5.1.1. A summary of specific INRMP accomplishments since the last review.
       3.5.1.2. An Annual Work Plan for implementing the INRMP that includes the current
       year and at least two future fiscal years. The Work Plan must include all projects and
       activities identified as essential for the successful implementation of INRMP goals and
       objectives, and an implementation schedule that is realistic and practicable.
       3.5.1.3. A statement that sufficient numbers of qualified natural resources management
       personnel and resources are available to oversee implementation of projects and activities
       identified in the INRMP Work Plan.
       3.5.1.4. A summary of the required INRMP updates that will be incorporated into the
       INRMP to keep the INRMP current in operation and effect for the management of
       installation natural resources; or alternatively, a statement that significant changes to the
       installation mission or natural resources goals require an INRMP revision (see 2.6).
3.6. INRMP Update and Revision. INRMP updates and revisions must be conducted in
cooperation with the USFWS, state fish and wildlife agency, and NOAA Fisheries where
applicable. Include all appropriate internal and external stakeholders in the update and revision
process. In accordance with the Sikes Act, the cooperating agencies must review an INRMP on
a regular basis, but not less often than every five years. Cooperating agencies must mutually
agree that the INRMP presents a natural resources management program that is current as to
operation and effect for those elements of the INRMP under the jurisdictional authority of each
agency. (T-0).
   3.6.1. INRMP Update. An INRMP update consists of minor edits that provide current
   information, or adjusts implementation timelines that would not result in changes to
   management goals and objectives that are substantively different than those previously
   agreed to by the cooperating agencies, and would not result in environmental consequences
   different from those in the existing INRMP. Minor update requirements are identified during
   the annual INRMP review and coordination (see 2.5). An INRMP update documents minor
   changes agreed to by the partners on how the INRMP will be implemented, and does not
   represent a change in the scope of the INRMP. Mutual agreement by cooperating agencies
   that an updated INRMP remains current as to operation and effect with respect to the Sikes
   Act is documented by signatures to the Annual INRMP Review Summary document. An
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    15


   INRMP update does not require public review and comment on the decision to continue
   implementing the INRMP as updated.
   3.6.2. INRMP Revision. An INRMP must be revised if changes in the installation mission
   or land use that would alter the biogeophysical environment such that significant edits need
   to be made to ensure that the INRMP reflects the current natural resources management
   requirements and appropriate program goals and objectives. Revise an INRMP if a change in
   land use or condition would result in environmental impacts not anticipated by the parties to
   the INRMP when the INRMP was last reviewed as to operation and effect. The need for an
   INRMP revision is determined during the annual INRMP review (see 2.5). Provide an
   opportunity for the public to review and comment on a draft INRMP revision (see 2.3.3).
   For new and revised INRMPs, mutual agreement by a cooperating agency is documented by
   the signature of an authorized representative from each agency on the signature page for the
   INRMP, or by written correspondence (see 2.4). (T-0).
3.7. Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) and INRMP Implementation. Actions
proposed as part of development of an INRMP generally will constitute an action subject to the
National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 - 4347, et seq.), the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the
NEPA (40 C.F.R. §§.1500 - 1508), and the Air Force’s Environmental Impact Analysis Process
(EIAP) (32 C.F.R. § 989). The affects of implementing the INRMP must be considered in
support of the decision(s) to implement the INRMP and in furtherance of 40 C.F.R. §1505.25.
Alternative means of implementing the proposed INRMP will constitute the alternatives
considered, and integrated, in the NEPA analysis and should be generally formatted and
generally scoped to allow tiering consistent with 40 C.F.R. §.1500.4, 40 C.F.R. §.1502.4(b), and
40 C.F.R. §.1502.20. (T-0).
3.8. Ecosystem Management. The INRMP implements ecosystem management on AF
installations by setting goals for attaining a desired land condition. When preparing or revising
an INRMP, follow the ecosystem management principles and guidelines in DoDI 4715.03,
Natural Resources Conservation Program, and the guidance provided herein. (T-0).
   3.8.1. Air Force Principles for Ecosystem Management.
       3.8.1.1. Maintain or restore native ecosystem types across their natural range where
       practical and consistent with the military mission.
       3.8.1.2. Maintain or restore ecological processes such as fire and other disturbance
       regimes where practical and consistent with the military mission.
       3.8.1.3. Maintain or restore the hydrological processes in streams, floodplains, and
       wetlands when feasible and practical and consistent with military mission.
       3.8.1.4. Use regional approaches to implement ecosystem management on an installation
       by collaboration with other DoD components as well as other federal, state and local
       agencies, and adjoining property owners.
       3.8.1.5. Provide for outdoor recreation, agricultural production, harvesting of forest
       products, and other practical utilization of the land and its resources, provided that such
       use does not inflict long-term ecosystem damage or negatively impact the AF mission.
 16                                                        AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


   3.8.2. Biodiversity Conservation. Biodiversity conservation is an integral part of ecosystem
   management. Maintain or reestablish viable populations of all native species on AF-
   controlled lands when practical and consistent with the military mission and not in conflict
   with airfield operations. Consider the effects of climate change in plans to restore native
   ecosystems.
   3.8.3. Climate Change. Changing climate conditions may significantly affect native
   ecosystems and require the Air Force to adjust natural resources management strategies to
   support military mission requirements and address the needs of sensitive species. INRMP
   goals and objectives for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation must consider
   projected climate change impacts, and favor an adaptive ecosystem-based management
   approach that will enhance the resiliency of the ecosystem to adapt to changes in climate.
   The INRMP will assess climate change risks, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies using
   authoritative region-specific climate science, climate projections, and existing tools. The
   INRMP should list, or include by reference, installation-specific climate data and region-
   specific climate projections from the most current quadrennial National Climate Assessment
   Report, and include other pertinent Federal climate science documents as appropriate. (T-
   2).
   3.8.4. Exotic and Invasive Species Control. The INRMP will indicate if any exotic and
   invasive species are present on an installation, and identify any existing programs to control
   and/or eradicate those species. Develop and implement management strategies oriented
   toward the control of exotic and invasive species when practical and consistent with the
   military mission. (T-2).
3.9. Staffing. As defined in DoDI 4715.03, use professionally trained natural resources
management personnel with a degree in the natural sciences to develop and implement the
installation INRMP. (T-0).
   3.9.1. Outsourcing Natural Resources Management. As stipulated in the Sikes Act, 16
   U.S.C. § 670 et. seq., the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, Performance
   of Commercial Activities, August 4, 1983 (Revised May 29, 2003) does not apply to the
   development, implementation and enforcement of INRMPs. Activities that require the
   exercise of discretion in making decisions regarding the management and disposition of
   government owned natural resources are inherently governmental. When it is not practicable
   to utilize DoD personnel to perform inherently governmental natural resources management
   duties, obtain these services from federal agencies having responsibilities for the
   conservation and management of natural resources. (T-0).
   3.9.2. Use of Non-Appropriated Fund Personnel. Non-Appropriated Fund personnel and
   resources may be utilized to assist in the implementation of natural resources management
   programs. In such cases, supervision and control of natural resources management programs
   will remain under the designated natural resources program manager for the installation. (T-
   2).
   3.9.3. Wildland Fire and Conservation Law Enforcement. Title 10, U.S.C., § 2465 prohibits
   contracts for performance of firefighting or security guard functions, with some exceptions.
   Contractors will not perform fire fighting or conservation law enforcement as a primary task
   unless an exception to 10 U.S.C. § 2465 applies. (T-0).
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     17


3.10. Integration of Natural Resources Management with Other Air Force Programs.
   3.10.1. Integration with the Installation Planning Process. The INRMP is a key component
   plan of the Installation Development Plan as detailed in AFI 32-7062, Air Force
   Comprehensive Planning. The INRMP identifies natural resource features that need to be
   considered and incorporated into the Installation Development Plan and other component
   plans and studies regarding future installation development. (T-1).
   3.10.2. Integration with EIAP. Integration with EIAP. The installation or IST natural
   resources manager will collaborate with the action proponent and the EIAP manager to
   ensure that activities that may affect natural resources are fully considered in compliance
   with NEPA.(T-0).
   3.10.3. Integration with Other Installation Programs. Draft INRMP revisions must be
   coordinated through the installation chain of command and the BASH working group.
   Ensure that the INRMP, Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan, Bird/Wildlife
   Strike Hazard (BASH) Plan, Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP), and Air Installation
   Compatible Use Zone studies are mutually supportive and not in conflict. (T-1).
3.11. Preventing Natural Resources Damage from Air Force Activities.
   3.11.1. Prior to initiation of any new construction activity, the installation natural resources
   manager will coordinate on all Certificates of Compliance for Critical Planning Actions
   prepared IAW AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON)
   Projects. (T-1).
   3.11.2. Environmental Restoration Program operations conducted IAW AFI 32-7020, The
   Environmental Restoration Program must include plans to mitigate potential damage to
   natural resources from restoration activities. (T-1).
   3.11.3. Real property outleases, easements, or licenses on Air Force property must not
   negatively impact the ability of an installation to meet statutory requirements for compliance
   with federal and applicable state laws related to natural resources conservation. (T-1).
3.12. Assessing Natural Resources Damage by Other Parties. In the event that natural
resources under AF control are damaged by another party, such as an accidental spill of a
hazardous substance, the installation incurring the damage must assess and claim damages.
Refer to Title 43, C.F.R. § 11, Natural Resource Damage Assessments for guidance on claiming
damages. Recovered funds must be used to restore, replace, or acquire equivalent natural
resources on the installation where the damage occurred. Installations must coordinate with
AFCEC/CZ, SAF/IEE and AFLOA/JACE during the claims process. (T-0).
3.13. Natural Resources Program Metrics. DoDI 4715.03 identifies the natural resources
conservation metrics that must be tracked and reported to DoD as part of the annual
Environmental Management Review, and for the Defense Environmental Programs Annual
Report to Congress. AF/A4C may develop and track other measures of merit to monitor natural
resources program performance and ensure compliance with law. Installations will report
required metrics data to AFCEC for integration and upward reporting to AF/A4C and SAF/IE.
(T-0).

3.14. Recognition of Outstanding Natural Resources Management. The AF General
Thomas D. White and the Secretary of Defense environmental awards program recognizes
outstanding individual and installation contributions to natural resources management. See AFI
36-2817, Engineering Awards Program, for standards and submittal procedures.
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        19


                                             Chapter 4

                       WETLANDS AND WATERS OF THE UNITED

4.1. Protection of Wetlands. In compliance with Executive Order 11990, Protection of
Wetlands, May 24, 1977, the AF will seek to preserve the natural values of wetlands while
carrying out its mission on both AF lands and non-AF lands. To the maximum extent
practicable, the AF will avoid actions which would either destroy or adversely modify wetlands.
The AF will fully disclose the location of known wetlands, and any land-use restrictions imposed
by regulatory authority, on lands that are leased, transferred or sold to non-federal entities. (T-0).
   4.1.1. Baseline Wetlands Inventory. Develop a baseline inventory and map that indicates the
   location of known wetlands, water bodies, and waterways on lands controlled by the AF.
   The baseline wetlands inventory would include all wetland areas, regardless of regulatory
   status. Installations are not required to update existing wetland inventory maps unless there
   exists a change in hydrology or in the wetland delineation methodology. (T-2).
   4.1.2. Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA). Prior to any construction activity in
   a wetland area (as defined by E. O. 11990), proponents must first prepare a Finding of No
   Practicable Alternative, which documents that there are no practicable alternatives to such
   construction, and that the proposed action includes all practicable measures to minimize
   harm to wetlands. In preparing the FONPA, the AF must consider the full range of
   practicable alternatives that will meet the proposed mission requirements. AF/A4C, or
   delegated authority, signs a Finding of No Practicable Alternative for active installations, and
   the Director, Air Force Civil Engineer Center for an installation identified for closure
   pursuant to the Base Realignment and Closure Act, and the Deputy Director, Air National
   Guard for ANG installations. A FONPA is not required for projects on wetland sites that are
   conducted under the regulatory authority of Comprehensive Environmental Response,
   Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended, (Title 42, U.S.C. §§ 9601-
   9675), as the substantive regulatory requirements would be fulfilled within the CERCLA
   process. (T-0).
   4.1.3. Coastal Zone Management Act Consistency. Proposed actions in wetlands may
   require a Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination. Refer to Chapter 5 for
   further guidance. (T-0).
4.2. Clean Water Act (CWA) Compliance. Activities that may impact waters and wetlands of
the United States as defined in Title 40, C.F.R. § 110.1, must be evaluated for compliance with
CWA regulations. (T-0).
   4.2.1. Jurisdictional Wetlands Delineation. Jurisdictional wetlands are those wetlands, water
   bodies and waterways that fulfill the criteria as jurisdictional waters of the United States
   subject to the regulatory requirements of the CWA. Site level jurisdictional wetland
   delineations are required for proposed development activities that may affect wetlands, and
   are the responsibility of the proponent as part of project costs. The proponent of any activity
   that may affect known or suspected wetlands must conduct a jurisdictional wetland
   delineation utilizing the criteria approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and
   affirmed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The AF will refer to and accept as
   determinative the current USACE definitions for wetlands under USACE jurisdiction.
 20                                                         AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


   Jurisdictional delineations are valid for a limited period of time, as established by the
   USACE District Regulatory Office. Installations are not required to update an expired
   jurisdictional wetland delineation unless there exists a proposed mission activity that
   necessitates an updated demarcation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the proponent
   activity. (T-0).
   4.2.2. CWA Section 404 Compliance. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (Title 33, U.S.C.
   § 1344) establishes a program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into
   jurisdictional waters and wetlands of the United States. Actions that may impact wetlands, to
   include dredging, filling, and activities that may displace soil or other materials into a
   wetland, may require a 404 permit from the USACE. Submit USACE ENG Form 4345,
   Application for Department of the Army Permit to the appropriate USACE District Engineer
   prior to any land disturbance activity located in or near a regulated wetland area or regulated
   waters of the United States. Along with the permit application, submit a vicinity map and
   site development plan that includes a cross-sectional view of the affected area showing limits
   of jurisdictional waters, the normal water level, volume of fill material to be discharged
   below ordinary high water, and the area of waters affected. In some states, the authority to
   issue Clean Water Act Section 404 permits has been delegated to the state. (T-0).
   4.2.3. CWA Section 401 Compliance. Section 401 of the CWA directs that any proponent
   of an action that requires a federal license or permit, such as a Section 404 or National
   Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit, must obtain a Water Quality Certificate from
   the state water pollution control agency. The Water Quality Certificate certifies that the
   action complies with state water quality criteria. State permits to undertake projects within a
   specified buffer zone surrounding wetlands may also be required. When applying for a
   permit under state wetland protection laws, certain information not required for an USACE
   permit, such as a delineation of a regulated buffer area, may also be required. In some cases,
   permit applications may be submitted concurrently for review by both the state and the
   USACE. (T-0).
4.3. Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 Compliance. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 33
U.S.C. § 401, establishes a program to regulate activities affecting navigable waters of the
United States. Section 10 of the Act (33 U.S.C.§ 403) directs that proponents must obtain a
Section 10 permit administered by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for
construction, excavation, or deposition of materials in, over, or under navigable waters, or for
any work which would affect the course, location, condition, or capacity of those waters.
Activities requiring Section 10 permits include structures (e.g., piers, wharves, breakwaters,
bulkheads, jetties, weirs, transmission lines) and work such as dredging or disposal of dredged
material, or excavation, filling, or other modifications to the navigable waters of the United
States. Contact the USACE prior to construction or other activities that may affect open water
habitats to determine if a Section 10 permit is required. (T-0).
4.4. EIAP for Actions that May Affect Wetlands. Proposed actions that may affect wetlands
require full compliance with the EIAP and E.O. 11990 prior to implementing the proposed
action. Proponents shall fully consider avoiding affects to wetlands in their initial planning,
design (ref. 40 C.F.R. §1508.20(a)). Supporting NEPA documentation shall reflect consideration
of alternatives to actions potentially affecting wetlands. In cases where there is no practicable
alternative to taking an action having an affect on a wetland, a Finding of No Practicable
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    21


alternative will be made either in the supporting Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or
Record of Decision (ROD). E.O. 11990 §7(c) defines wetlands for purposes of this this section.
(T-0).
4.5. Wetland Mitigation Banks. A wetland mitigation bank is a wetland area that is currently
being created, restored, or enhanced, and set aside to compensate for future actions that may
negatively impact other wetlands within the same watershed and provide like (in-kind) wetland
functions. A wetland bank is established by means of a formal agreement with the Army Corps
of Engineers or other appropriate regulatory agency(ies) enacted prior to nomination of a
wetland to the program. The value of a bank is determined through cooperation with the
regulating agency to quantify the wetland values restored, enhanced, or created in terms of
compensatory mitigation credits. Development of off-installation wetland mitigation banks, and
purchase of credits from certified third-party mitigation banks, is encouraged when practicable as
a cost-effective method to reduce the uncertainty and delays that may be associated with
mitigation requirements for future installation development. Costs associated with wetland
mitigation banking may be treated as eligible project costs for military construction.

                                            Chapter 5

                                         FLOODPLAINS

5.1. Floodplain Protection. Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, May 24, 1977,
requires all federal agencies to provide leadership and take action to reduce the risk of flood loss,
minimize the impacts of floods on human safety, health, and welfare, and restore and preserve
the natural and beneficial values of floodplains when acquiring, managing, or disposing of
federal lands. (T-0).
5.2. Floodplain Boundary Determination. Use the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
maps distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine whether
a proposed action occurs in a floodplain. If NFIP maps are not available for the affected area,
develop a flood plain map that is certified by a professional engineer, and provide the map data
to the NFIP. (T-1).
5.3. Assessment of Proposed Actions within a Floodplain.
   5.3.1. EIAP for Actions that May Affect Floodplains. Proposed actions that will occur in, or
   could adversely affect floodplains, require compliance with the EIAP and E.O. 11988
   “Floodplain Management” prior to implementing an action. Proponents shall, during initial
   planning and design, reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize the impact of floods on human
   safety, health and welfare and the Air Force mission; and restore or preserve the natural and
   beneficial values served by floodplains. (T-0).
       5.3.1.1. NEPA documentation shall reflect consideration of alternatives to actions
       proposed in floodplains, which potentially adversely affect floodplains or increase the
       risk of flood loss, as well as measures necessary to minimize potential harm to the
       floodplain or reduce the risk of loss in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §1508.20 and 32 C.F.R.
       §989.22(a). For such actions initially considered for an Environmental Assessment (EA),
       early public notice will be prepared and made available to the public in accordance with
       32 C.F.R. § 989.24(c). At a minimum the notice must solicit written comments from the
       public to ensure early and meaningful public involvement. Refer to E.O. 11988, Section
       2(a)(4) and 32 C.F.R. §.989.14(l). The early public notice must include a description of
       the action, its purpose and expressly state the proposed action is subject to the
       requirements and objectives of E.O. 11988 because its intended location is in the
       floodplain. This notice shall identify state and federal regulatory agencies with special
       expertise that have been contacted and request public comment on the proposed action
       and any practicable alternatives. Whenever practicable, the notice shall provide 30 days
       for public comment. (T-0).
       5.3.1.2. Pursuant to 32 C.F.R. § 989.14 (l), the EPF will review the input received from
       the early public notice process. Based on the magnitude and complexity of the proposed
       action and the public comments, if any, received during the early public notice process,
       the EPF will determine whether or not to initiate an EIS or EA. (T-0).
           5.3.1.2.1. If an analysis determines that an EA is to be accomplished, the EA and
           unsigned Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will be made available for public
           review for at least 30 days per 32 C.F.R. § 989.15(e)(2) and the public notice of
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  23


         availability must meet the requirements of 32 C.F.R. § 989.24(c). The EPF may also
         conduct a public meeting on the Draft EA. (T-0).
         5.3.1.2.2. If the analysis reveals a significant adverse impact, or an Environmental
         Impact Statement (EIS) is undertaken initially, follow the procedures for EISs in 32
         C.F.R. § 989.17-21. When there is no practicable alternative to taking an action
         within a floodplain, a Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA) will be made
         either in the supporting FONSI or Record of Decision (ROD). (T-0).
         5.3.1.2.3. Application of Categorical Exclusions (CATEXs) to actions located in, or
         adversely affecting floodplains is normally not appropriate, given the additional
         analysis requirements under Air Force regulations (See Section A2.2.7 of Appendix B
         to 32 C.F.R. § 989) and the level of public involvement required as described above.
         (T-0).
  5.3.2. Actions that Alter Floodplain Hydrology. If an action is taken within a floodplain that
  permanently alters the flood hazard delineations on a NFIP map, prepare and submit
  recommended map modification to FEMA. (T-1).
 24                                                            AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


                                             Chapter 6

                           COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES

6.1. Protection of Coastal and Marine Resources. The AF will conserve and protect all
coastal and marine resources whenever feasible as part of the overall natural resources
management program. (T-0).
6.2. Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) Compliance. The Coastal Zone Management
Act (Title 16 U.S.C.§§ 1451-1462) authorizes coastal states to establish a Coastal Zone
Management Program (CZMP) to coordinate state, local, and federal programs for the
management of coastal areas. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office
of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management administers the program at the federal level. Once
a state’s program is federally approved, the CZMA allows participating states to set goals and
procedures that control the use and development of designated Coastal Zones. (T-0).
   6.2.1. Applicability. A Coastal Zone is the area specified or delineated by a state within its
   federally approved Coastal Zone Management Program. All AF activities, operations,
   projects, and programs that affect any lands, water use or natural resources of a state’s
   Coastal Zone must be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the state CZMP.
   For AF installations within a Coastal Zone management area, the INRMP should specifically
   address how activities and operations will be consistent with the state CZMP. (T-0).
   6.2.2. Federal Consistency Determination. Installations must prepare a Federal Consistency
   Determination to assess consistency with the state CZMP for any activity, regardless of
   location, that is likely to affect any land, water, or natural resource of a Coastal Zone in the
   reasonably foreseeable future. The installation will submit a Federal Consistency
   Determination to the appropriate state agency (e.g. Coastal Zone Coordination Council) at
   least 90 days before final approval of the proposed action, unless otherwise agreed upon.
   The state will produce a federal consistency review response indicating whether or not the
   state concurs with the determination. Actions requiring consistency determinations will be
   fully considered and addressed in applicable NEPA documentation. Analysis of the
   proposed action, and the purpose for the proposed action, will be addressed no later than the
   draft version of the NEPA documentation, and provided to the applicable State office for
   review and comment. The state response will become part of the EIAP documentation for
   the proposed project. (T-0).
6.3. Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 Compliance. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act
(Title 16 U.S.C. §§3501-3510) regulates the expenditure of federal funds to discourage
development within boundaries of undeveloped, unprotected coastal barriers (such as a bay
barrier, barrier spit, or barrier island) on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, as identified in the Coastal
Barriers Resources System maps established by the Act. Federal funds may be used for
permissible activities listed in 16 U.S.C. §3505, which include national security related military
actions and the management, protection and enhancement of natural resources, and maintenance
of existing structures for navigation and shoreline stabilization. Proponents must consult with
the USFWS when planning activities and operations that may impact lands identified in the
Coastal Barriers Resources System. (T-0).

6.4. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 Compliance. The Marine Mammal Protection
Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. §§1361 - 1421(h)) protects marine mammals, their critical habitat, and
migratory routes. Installations with marine resources must address the protection of marine
mammals in the INRMP and must submit the INRMP to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service for review. Any action undertaken by the AF
in a marine or coastal environment, to include activities that generate noise, must first assess the
potential impacts on marine mammals. Proponents whose activities may impact marine
mammals must coordinate the proposed actions with NOAA Fisheries. (T-0).
6.5. Coral Reef Protection. Executive Order 13089, Coral Reef Protection, June 11, 1998
directs the protection of all coral reef ecosystems, to include those species, habitats, and other
natural resources associated with coral reefs within all maritime areas and zones subject to the
jurisdiction or control of the United States (e.g., federal, state, territorial, or commonwealth
waters). Installations will identify all coral reefs and related endemic mangrove and sea grass
ecosystems in the INRMP. Installations with these protected ecosystems must address the
conservation and management of these habitats in the INRMP. (T-0).
6.6. Coastal America Partnership. The Department of Defense and other federal agencies
with statutory responsibilities for coastal resources formed the Coastal America Partnership by
Memorandums of Understanding in 1992, 1994, and 2002. The purpose of the Coastal America
Partnership is to (1) protect, preserve, and restore the Nation’s coastal ecosystems through
existing federal capabilities and authorities; (2) collaborate and cooperate in the stewardship of
coastal living marine resources; and (3) provide a framework for action that effectively focuses
expertise and resources on jointly identified problems to produce demonstrable environmental
and programmatic results that may serve as models for effective management of coastal
resources. In support of the Coastal America Partnership, AF installations are encouraged to
coordinate and cooperate with partners in support of regional programs for the protection and
restoration of coastal ecosystems, and to incorporate Coastal America goals within the
installation Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan when compatible with statutory
authorities and military mission activities. Collaborative projects that protect or restore coastal
resources on Air Force installations may be submitted for consideration to the Coastal America
Awards Program. (T-3).

                                           Chapter 7

                          FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

7.1. Wildlife Management Programs on Air Force Lands. The INRMP will address the
management of game and non-game fish and wildlife on AF installations, to include any
requirement to inventory and monitor fish and wildlife resources. The INRMP will be prepared
in cooperation with the USFWS, state fish and wildlife agency, and NOAA Fisheries for
installations that include or are adjacent to marine environments. The resulting plan will reflect
the mutual agreement of the installation and the cooperating agencies for the conservation,
protection, and management of wildlife resources (see 2.3). (T-0).
7.2. Hunting, Fishing, Trapping and Outdoor Recreation Programs.
   7.2.1. Program Management. The Sikes Act, 16 U.S.C. § 670a(a)(3)(A), requires that,
   consistent with the use of a military installations to ensure the preparedness of the Armed
   Forces, military installations must provide for the sustainable multipurpose use of the
   resources, to include hunting, fishing, trapping, and non-consumptive recreational access.
   Hunting, fishing, trapping and dispersed outdoor recreation programs are appropriate on AF
   installations when they are consistent with INRMP goals for natural resources management,
   and are in accordance with installation security and safety requirements. Fish and game
   harvests must comply with all federal and state laws and regulations, and will be consistent
   with DoD principles for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. The
   designated installation or IST natural resources manager is responsible for direction and
   oversight of hunting and fishing programs. Administrative and management costs associated
   with hunting, fishing, trapping and the management of outdoor recreation access must be
   fully reimbursed by user fees. Installations may utilize the voluntary assistance of others to
   help manage hunting and fishing programs, to include units of the Air Force Personnel
   Center Directorate of Services, Force Support Squadrons, and non-AF affiliated clubs (e.g.
   Rod and Gun Club); but these organizations shall not direct activities related to hunting,
   fishing, trapping and outdoor recreation that are outside the scope and direction of the
   installation INRMP. Program support provided by a Force Support Squadron may be
   reimbursed from user fees. (T-0).
   7.2.2. Fee Collection. Hunting, fishing, trapping and outdoor recreation access fees are
   collected by the installation and deposited into the AF account for fish and wildlife
   management (57 5095). The INRMP will address the installation procedures for the
   collection of fees for hunting, fishing, trapping and access to outdoor recreation areas. Use
   DoD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher to report cash collections to 57 5095. If the Air
   Force Personnel Center Directorate of Services, Force, or other organization assists the
   natural resources management program office with the collection of user fees, any
   administrative fees charged must be accounted for separately from fees collected into the 57
   5095 account. In such case, the permit issued must identify the portion of the fee payment
   that represents the seller’s administrative charge. Upon termination of a fee collection
   program for hunting, fishing, trapping, or outdoor recreation, installations must notify
   AFCEC/CZ and the collection account will be closed. (T-0).
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  27


  7.2.3. Access and Participation. The INRMP will address the specific rules and procedures
  for authorized participation and access to AF installations for hunting, fishing, trapping and
  dispersed outdoor recreation. The INRMP will identify access areas by category, and the
  authorized participants for each access area category, using the criteria established below. A
  commander may restrict or exclude hunting, fishing and trapping if such activity is not
  compatible with the military mission. When access is denied to the general public, the
  rationale for that determination must be included in the INRMP. (T-2).
     7.2.3.1. Access Categories. Installations with unimproved lands will identify in the
     INRMP the availability of lands, by access category, for hunting, fishing, trapping and
     other dispersed outdoor recreation activities. The INRMP will establish the criteria used
     to designate lands into each access category, and must identify how access category
     designations may change with each Force Protection Condition (Normal, Alpha, Bravo,
     Charlie, Delta) imposed on the installation. Refer to AFI 13-212, Volume 1, Range
     Planning and Operations for guidance on access to military ranges. There are three basic
     access area categories. (T-2).
         7.2.3.1.1. Open Areas. Unrestricted areas on the installation where hunting, fishing,
         trapping and outdoor recreation are permitted to all participants.
         7.2.3.1.2. Restricted Areas. Areas designated by the commander where hunting,
         fishing, trapping and outdoor recreation are permitted to certain categories of
         participants or under special arrangements as defined by the commander. The
         INRMP must state the rationale by which access to an area is limited to certain
         categories of participants.
         7.2.3.1.3. Off Limits Areas. Areas designated by the commander as being off limits
         to recreational hunting, fishing, trapping and dispersed outdoor recreation by any
         person at any time. These are areas where mission security and safety concerns will
         not allow such use. The INRMP must state the rationale by which access to an area is
         designated to be off limits due to safety considerations.
     7.2.3.2. Participant Categories. The INRMP will establish criteria and protocols
     addressing user access and conduct for open and restricted areas by Participant Category.
     Do not confuse these Participant Categories with the Eligibility Categories described in
     AFI 34-101 Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Program and Use
     Eligibility. Installation policy for hunting, fishing, trapping, and non-consumptive
     recreational access indicated in the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. § 670a(a)(3)(A)) will be based
     upon safety, mission requirements, and the ability of the natural ecosystem to sustain
     these activities. For open and restricted areas, the INRMP will identify access priveleges
     for the following categories of participants:
         7.2.3.2.1. Active Duty Military (includes Reserve and National Guard on active duty
         or full time manning)
         7.2.3.2.2. Department of Defense Civilians
         7.2.3.2.3. Active Duty Military Dependents and Family Members
         7.2.3.2.4. Military Retirees
         7.2.3.2.5. Department of Defense Civilian Retirees
 28                                                         AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


           7.2.3.2.6. Employees of Installation Prime Contractors (defined as a contractor with a
           five or more year term contract).
           7.2.3.2.7. General Public.
7.3. Conservation Law Enforcement. Commanders are responsible for the enforcement of
state and federal fish and game laws on AF installations. In accordance with the Sikes Act (16
U.S.C.§ 670a(b)(1)(H), installations must address the enforcement of applicable natural
resources laws in the INRMP. DoDI 5525.17, Conservation Law Enforcement Programs
(CLEP) provides guidance for conservation law enforcement on Department of Defense
installations. (T-0).
   7.3.1. Cooperative Law Enforcement. Commanders will provide reasonable access to
   federal and state conservation officers for the purpose of fish and wildlife law enforcement
   on AF installations. Commanders are authorized to enter into law enforcement support
   agreements on a reimbursable basis with federal and state agencies having responsibility and
   jurisdiction for conservation law enforcement. (T-1).
   7.3.2. Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement by Air Force Personnel. The Sikes Act (16
   U.S.C. § 670e-1) authorizes the Department of Defense to enforce all federal natural
   resources laws on military installations. The commander may designate military and civilian
   personnel as fish and wildlife law enforcement officers only if those persons have been
   certified in conservation law enforcement through successful completion of the Land
   Management Police Training course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center or,
   alternatively, have been commissioned as a fish and wildlife conservation officer in the state
   where the installation is located. Law enforcement personnel who do not possess either
   federal or state fish and wildlife enforcement certification can be used to supplement fish and
   wildlife law enforcement under the direct supervision of certified personnel. (T-0).
7.4. Protection of Migratory Birds. In accordance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918
(Title 16 U.S.C. §§ 703-712) and Executive Order No. 13186, Responsibilities of Federal
Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds, January 10, 2001, avoid or minimize the negative impact of
AF actions on migratory birds. This includes preventing or abating pollution or detrimental
alteration of the environment, and incorporating migratory bird conservation into the installation
INRMP as practicable. Notify the USFWS if unintentional take of migratory birds reasonably
attributable to AF actions is having, or is likely to have, a measurable negative effect on
migratory bird populations; and implement conservation measures as specified in E.O. 13186,
Section 3(e)(9). (T-0).
   7.4.1. Intentional Takes of Migratory Birds. Any proposal to intentionally kill, wound,
   capture, or collect a migratory bird requires a migratory bird depredation permit issued by the
   USFWS IAW Title 50, C.F.R. § 21.41. Depredation of migratory birds is also subject to
   NEPA (42 U.S.C.§4321 et seq.) and the Air Force EIAP at 32 C.F.R. § 989. Once a
   depredation permit is issued, installations will maintain records and submit reports as
   mandated under the terms of the permit. (T-0).
   7.4.2. Incidental Takes of Migratory Birds During Military Readiness Activity. In
   accordance with Section 315 of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act of 2003
   (P.L. 107-314), Migratory Bird Treaty Act requirements indicated in 16 U.S.C. § 703 shall
   not apply to the incidental taking of a migratory bird by a member of the Armed Forces
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    29


   during a military readiness activity. A military readiness activity, as defined at 50 C.F.R. §
   21.3, includes all training and operations that relate to combat. It does not include routine
   operation of support functions, operation of industrial activities, or construction or
   demolition of support or industrial facilities. Incidental takes during military readiness
   activities must conform to the regulations in 50 C.F.R. § 21.15, which authorizes incidental
   take of migratory birds for military readiness activities provided that a determination is made
   by means of the National Environmental Policy Act process (32 C.F.R. § 989) that the
   proposed readiness action will not have significant negative effects on a population of
   migratory birds. If it is determined that the readiness action will have significant negative
   effects on a population of migratory birds, the installation must confer with the USFWS to
   develop and implement appropriate conservation measures to minimize and mitigate, to the
   extent practicable, adverse impacts of military readiness activities on migratory birds; and to
   monitor the impacts of such activities on affected migratory bird species. Not all operations
   and maintenance activities on an installation qualify as a military readiness activity. Seek
   legal advice if uncertain whether an activity qualifies as a military readiness activity
   consistent with 50 C.F.R. § 21.15. Vegetation management within the airfield Clear Zones
   and Primary Surface, as defined in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and
   Design, is a military readiness activity covered under 50 CFR § 21.15. (T-0).
7.5. Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16
U.S.C. 668-668c) prohibits harm or harassment to bald and golden eagles. This includes
removal of inactive nests as well as active nests. In accordance with 50 C.F.R. §22, installations
must obtain a permit from the USFWS if an activity may result in "take" of a bald or golden
eagle as defined in the regulations. Eagle permits authorize take only in circumstances where the
take cannot be practicably avoided in the course of an otherwise lawful activity. Conditions of
the permit may include mitigative actions to minimize impacts. (T-0).
7.6. Wildlife Damage Control.
   7.6.1. Nuisance Wildlife Control. Installation pest management personnel have primary
   responsibility for the control of nuisance wildlife species, although the program can receive
   substantial support from natural resources management personnel for control of wildlife that
   requires specialized training and permits.
       7.6.1.1. Contact the state fish and wildlife agency prior to killing or trapping nuisance
       wildlife. Wildlife control activities may require a state depredation permit. Activities
       that affect migratory birds may require a federal permit (see 6.4.1.). Any action that may
       affect a species listed for protection under the auspices of the Endangered Species Act
       will require consultation with the USFWS (see Chapter 7). (T-0).
       7.6.1.2. The INRMP must address nuisance wildlife control objectives, appropriate
       control techniques, and the installation organizations responsible for each aspect of
       nuisance wildlife control. The installation INRMP, Integrated Pest Management Plan,
       Solid Waste Management Plan, and Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan must be
       mutually supportive, and must adequately differentiate the responsibilities for natural
       resources, pest management, flight safety, public health, and veterinary services
       personnel for the control of nuisance wildlife. Include procedures for animal carcass
       disposal. (T-1).
 30                                                          AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


   7.6.2. Wildlife Control in Support of Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Reduction. The
   INRMP and Bird/wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan and incorporate the guidance within
   AFI 91-202, USAF Mishap Prevention Program and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-212,
   BASH Management Techniques. Coordinate draft INRMPs and updates with airfield
   operations and flight safety personnel to ensure conformance with airfield safety criteria.
   Request assistance for BASH related wildlife control issues from personnel at Headquarters
   Air Force Safety Center (AFSEC/SEFW). See Chapter 14 for additional BASH program
   requirements. (T-1).
   7.6.3. Emergency Wildlife Control. Emergency wildlife control measures may be warranted
   if unanticipated wildlife problems endanger installation operations or threaten public health.
   The installation INRMP will, consistent with the Integrated Pest Management Plan and
   BASH Plan, identify the protocols and notification requirements for emergency wildlife
   control consistent with the terms of federal and state depredation permits. (T-1).
7.7. Participation in Conservation Banking Programs. An installation may enter into
agreements for, and make payments to, an off-installation conservation banking program or other
“in-lieu-fee” mitigation sponsor, to satisfy a mitigation responsibility that is required for new
construction or other military activity that has the potential to adversely impact species protected
under the Endangered Species Act or Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Payments made to a
conservation banking program or “in-lieu-fee” mitigation sponsor for the purpose of facilitating
military construction may be treated as eligible costs of the military construction project.
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        31


                                            Chapter 8

            THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES MANAGEMENT

8.1. Endangered Species Act Compliance. The Endangered Species Act (ESA), (Title 16
U.S.C. §§1531-1544), requires protection and conservation of federally listed threatened and
endangered (T&E) plants and animals and their habitats. Section 7(a)(1) of the ESA states that
all federal departments and agencies shall utilize their respective authorities to conserve
threatened and endangered species. Conservation includes the use of all methods and procedures
which are necessary to bring any T&E species to the point where the measures pursuant to the
ESA are no longer necessary. (T-0).
   8.1.1. Federally Listed Species. Installations known to sustain federally listed T&E species
   or their habitats must address T&E species conservation in the INRMP. The INRMP goals
   and objectives must provide an overall ecosystem management strategy for the protection
   and recovery of T&E species. When practical, provide similar protection to plants and
   animals that are candidate species for protection by federal listing. The INRMP must include
   provisions addressing the requisite "benefit to the species" criteria to support a critical habitat
   exemption (see 7.4). (T-0).
   8.1.2. State Listed Species. INRMPs will provide for the protection and conservation of
   state listed protected species when practicable. Although not required by the Endangered
   Species Act, provide similar conservation measures for species protected by state law when
   such protection is not in direct conflict with the military mission. When conflicts occur,
   consult with the appropriate state authority to determine if any conservation measures can be
   feasibly implemented to mitigate impacts. (T-2).
   8.1.3. Host Nation Protected Species. For installations and AF operations outside the United
   States and its territories, responsibility for protection of host nation protected species will be
   as specified in the Final Governing Standards for the host country (refer to AFI 32-7006,
   Environmental Program in Foreign Countries). (T-1).
8.2. Inventory and Monitoring. All installations will conduct a basic reconnaissance survey to
determine the presence of any federally listed Threatened, Endangered or Candidate species on
an installation. The survey methodology, scope, and species considered in the inventory will be
determined after consultation with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries, depending upon jurisdiction.
Follow-up reconnaissance surveys are required if the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries determines
that a new federally listed species may occur on the installation. Periodic resurveys and
monitoring of known listed species are required if they are stipulated in: (1) the ‘Terms and
Conditions’ that implement the ‘Reasonable and Prudent’ conservation measures rendered in a
Biological Opinion from the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries, (2) a USFWS or NOAA Fisheries
Species Recovery Plan, or (3) an INRMP, coordinated and approved in accordance with the
Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. §670a-f). All information collected on military lands and waters that
pertains to a federally listed Threatened, Endangered, and Candidate species will be shared with
the USFWS and/or NOAA Fisheries. If practical, share known information on state listed
species with the relevant state agency (e.g. state Department of Natural Resources or Natural
Heritage Program) for inclusion in their biological and conservation database. (T-0).
 32                                                        AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


8.3. Interagency Consultation and Coordination.
   8.3.1. Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation. Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires
   agencies to consult with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries when proposed or ongoing actions,
   including the implementation of an INRMP, may affect a listed species or its habitat, action
   may affect a listed species. Consult with the USFWS for terrestrial species and freshwater
   aquatic species, and with NOAA Fisheries for saltwater fish and marine mammals.
   Attachment 4 outlines standard consultation procedures. Installations must notify the
   AFCEC Installation Support Team when entering into formal consultations under the
   auspices of the ESA. (T-0).
   8.3.2. Marine Mammal Protection Act Consultation. Consult with NOAA Fisheries or the
   USFWS when an ongoing or proposed activity, including the preparation and implementation
   of an INRMP, has the potential to impact marine mammals protected under the authority of
   the Marine Mammal Protection Act as specified in Title16, U.S.C. §§ 1361-1421h. This
   requirement may be in addition to Endangered Species Act consultation requirements. (T-0).
   8.3.3. INRMP Coordination. All INRMPs and draft revisions will be sent to the USFWS,
   NOAA Fisheries (if applicable), and to the appropriate state fish and wildlife agency for
   review, comment, and coordination as specified in Attachment 3. Installations harboring
   federally listed species must address Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation early in
   the INRMP preparation and review process. Identify if the plan submitted for review covers
   the protection and conservation of a federally listed species. The INRMP must include an
   evaluation of the potential effects of INRMP implementation on listed species and their
   habitats, and indicate the conservation measures that will be employed to manage those
   effects. If a Biological Opinion has been issued as a result of ESA Section 7 consultations,
   the INRMP becomes the document by which the AF will describe the specific programs and
   activities that will be implemented to satisfy the required terms and conditions. (T-0).
   8.3.4. Environmental Impact Analysis Process Coordination. Title 40, Code of Federal
   Regulations, Chapter V, Council on Environmental Quality, requires all federal agencies to
   consider the environmental effects of proposed programs, projects, and actions prior to
   initiation. Pursuant to the 40 C.F.R. §§ 1500-1508, Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act,
   and 32 C.F.R. § 989, proponents of AF actions will ensure that federally listed T&E species
   are fully considered at the earliest possible time in the scoping for the NEPA analysis. T&E
   species must be fully considered early in the planning process when preparing a Categorical
   Exclusion (CATEX), Environmental Assessment, or Environmental Impact Statement. An
   Air Force CATEX may not be applied if federally listed species are potentially affected by
   the proposed action. Submit all draft EIAP documents to the USFWS and/or NOAA
   Fisheries for review and comment. Any required ESA Section 7 consultation must be
   completed prior to the issuance of any decision action under EIAP. Written documentation
   supporting the coordination and/or consultation with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries must
   be included in the EIAP document. Copies of the final decision documents (e.g. Record of
   Decision, Finding of No Significant Impact) must be forwarded to the USFWS and NOAA
   Fisheries when federally listed species are involved. (T-0).
8.4. The INRMP as a Substitute for Critical Habitat Designation. Pursuant to Section
4(a)(3)(B)(i) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. §1533(a)(3)(B)(i)), the Secretary of
Interior “shall not designate as critical habitat any lands or other geographical areas owned or
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       33


controlled by the DoD, or designated for its use, that are subject to an integrated natural
resources management plan prepared under section 101 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. § 670a), if
the Secretary determines in writing that such plan provides a benefit to the species for which
critical habitat is proposed for designation.” In accordance with 50 C.F.R. § 424, an INRMP is
considered sufficient for critical habitat exemption if it meets the following criteria:
   8.4.1. The INRMP provides a conservation benefit to the species. The cumulative benefits
   of the management activities identified in the INRMP, for the period covered by the INRMP,
   must maintain or provide for an increase in a species’ population, or the protection,
   maintenance, enhancement or restoration of its habitat within the area covered by the INRMP
   (i.e., those areas deemed essential to the conservation of the species). A conservation benefit
   may result from reducing fragmentation of habitat, maintaining or increasing populations,
   insuring against catastrophic events, enhancing and restoring habitats, buffering protected
   areas, or testing and implementing new conservation strategies. Any restrictions on land use,
   whether contained in an INRMP or other agreements, must be temporary to allow flexibility
   in meeting future mission requirements, and must be approved by SAF/IE before the INRMP
   or agreement is signed. (T-1).
   8.4.2. The INRMP provides assurance that the management activities necessary to
   implement the goals and objectives of the plan will be implemented. Persons charged with
   INRMP implementation must be capable of accomplishing the objectives of the INRMP,
   have adequate funding to implement the INRMP, have the authority to implement the
   INRMP, and have obtained all the necessary authorizations or approvals. The INRMP must
   provide an implementation schedule (including projected completion dates) to achieve the
   goals and objectives identified in the plan. (T-2).
   8.4.3. The INRMP provides assurance that the conservation effort will be effective. Use the
   following criteria to determine if an INRMP provides an effective conservation effort:
       8.4.3.1. The INRMP includes biological goals (broad guiding principles for the program)
       and objectives (measurable targets for achieving the goals);
       8.4.3.2. The INRMP provides quantifiable, scientifically valid parameters that will
       demonstrate achievement of objectives, and standards for these parameters by which
       progress will be measured;
       8.4.3.3. The INRMP includes provisions for monitoring and, where appropriate, adaptive
       management;
       8.4.3.4. The INRMP includes provisions for reporting progress on implementation
       (based on compliance with the implementation schedule) and effectiveness (based on
       evaluation of quantifiable parameters) of the conservation effort.
8.5. Exclusion of Critical Habitat Designation Due to Economic Impacts or National
Security Issues. In accordance with ESA Section 4(b)(2) (16 U.S.C. §1533(b)(2)), the
Secretary of Interior may exclude areas owned or controlled by the DoD from critical habitat
designation if the Secretary determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweighs the benefits
of specifying the area as critical habitat; and that the exclusion of such area from critical habitat
will not result in the extinction of the species concerned. In order to support the ESA 4(b)(2)
exclusion, the installation shall provide the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries with evidence of how a
critical habitat designation would impact national security. (T-0).

                                          Chapter 9

                                 FOREST MANAGEMENT

9.1. Forest Management Practices on Air Force Lands. The principal objective of forest
management on AF installations is to maintain and enhance the ecological integrity of forested
landscapes while supporting the military mission. Under the principles of ecosystem
management (see 2.8), forest treatments, to include the harvesting of forest products, may be
used to achieve installation goals for forest enhancement and restoration, wildlife habitat
improvement, wildfire protection, recreational development, military training requirements,
airfield safety compliance, and wood production.
   9.1.1. Commercial Activities. Commercial harvesting of forest products on AF lands is
   authorized, provided that such use is compatible with the military mission and consistent
   with the goals stated in the INRMP. Never harvest forest products for short-term profit at the
   expense of long-term sustainability of other ecosystem functions. The Range Operating
   Agency will determine the availability of lands for commercial forestry activities on military
   training and testing ranges IAW AFI 13-212, Volume 1, Range Planning and Operations.
   (T-1).
   9.1.2. Timber Harvesting Methods. Use appropriate silvicultural practices to maintain the
   forest ecosystem in a healthy condition and to achieve the goals stated in the installation
   INRMP. The INRMP must state the acceptable timber harvesting practices for the
   installation and explain, in terms of current and desired future condition, how the chosen
   management practices achieve the INRMP goals. (T-3).
   9.1.3. Best Management Practices. Implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) in forest
   management operations to minimize environmental impacts. Utilize applicable state BMPs
   for forest management operations.
   9.1.4. Reforestation. Conduct reforestation activities as detailed in the INRMP. The
   INRMP must state the acceptable reforestation practices to meet the stated goals and
   objectives and minimize soil disturbance and ecological impacts. (T-3).
   9.1.5. Forest Road Construction and Maintenance. Installations with a commercial forest
   resource must evaluate the existing network of forest access roads and trails in the INRMP.
   Forest road construction and management should be consistent with the ecosystem
   management objectives stated in the INRMP. Design and maintain forest access roads in
   accordance with applicable state BMPs. Construct new single-purpose forest access roads
   only when absolutely necessary. Temporary roads and trails constructed solely for timber
   harvesting operations must be closed to vehicular traffic after the timber removal is
   completed. (T-3).
   9.1.6. Forest Inventory. Installations with commercial forest land capable of producing
   more than 20 cubic feet/acre/year in wood biomass must maintain a forest inventory. Update
   forest inventories at least once every 10 years. Utilize a geographic information system to
   record and access forest inventory data. (T-3).
   9.1.7. Airfield Safety. Installations with active airfields must manage forest areas so that
   trees do not pose a hazard to air operations. Refer to Uniform Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     35


   260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design for specifications on airfield flight
   surfaces and safety zones. (T-1).
9.2. Forest Product Sale Procedures. Do not give away, abandon or destroy forest products
with marketable value. In accordance with Financial Management Regulation, 7000.14-
R,Volume 11A, Chapter 16, collect payment for all forest products with economic value that are
removed from AF lands. Forest products may not be traded for goods or services nor used to
offset contract costs associated with construction, land clearing, or other contracted activity.
Lessees of government property will not remove or destroy commercial timber unless the forest
products have specifically been conveyed in the lease and fair market value has been paid to the
government. Make an attempt to offer for sale any forest products that require removal prior to
initiation of construction or other land clearing operation. Prior to any land clearing or
construction activity, contact at least three buyers of forest products within the region to
determine if they are willing to make an offer on the forest products requiring disposal. These
restrictions do not apply to materials determined to have no commercial value, as determined by
the AFCEC/CZ Natural Resources SME or Forester employed by the federal government. Refer
to 15.3.1.1 for guidance on forest product sale revenue collection. (T-0).
   9.2.1. Small-Lot Sales. Forest products with an appraised value at $25,000 or less may be
   sold by means of an installation small-lot sales permit. Do not split larger timber disposal
   sales into small lots to avoid formal bids. Installations may use a small-lot sales permit to
   remove timber appraised at greater than $25,000 when immediate tree removals are
   necessary to clear timber downfall resulting from a natural disaster, or to meet airfield safety
   requirements as defined by an impending downgrade of airfield operability status. Informal
   bids must be solicited from at least three potential buyers. Document all contacts made and
   bids received, including contacts that respond with no bid. Upon official request from the
   installation, the AFCEC/CZ Natural Resources SME may conduct appraisals and small-lot
   sales on behalf of the installation. (T-2).
   9.2.2. Large Sales. Dispose of forest products with an appraised value at greater than
   $25,000 by contract sale utilizing competitive bidding procedures and the following
   guidelines.
       9.2.2.1. Sale Preparation.     For all large forest product sales, prepare contract
       specifications that describe in detail the forest products offered, sale areas, allowable
       harvest methods and restricted activities. Include maps or drawings of the gross sale area
       and net removal area. A professional Forester or trained Forest Technician must
       supervise the marking and harvest of forest products within the sale area. Prior to
       removal of forest products, the effects of the proposed action must be evaluated and
       documented in accordance with the EIAP process defined in 32 C.F.R. § 989. (T-0).
       9.2.2.2. Sale Appraisal. Obtain an appraisal of the fair market value of forest products
       offered for sale. Do not sell forest products for less than their appraised value without
       first preparing a written justification approved by a Contracting Officer. Use regionally
       accepted standards for scaling, measuring, or weighing forest products. Mark appraisal
       documents for identified sales areas with "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY," and release
       appraisal documents only on a need-to-know basis.
       9.2.2.3. Sale Marketing. For each forest product sale contract, prepare a solicitation for
       bid describing the forest products offered for sale and required harvesting specifications.
 36                                                        AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


      Solicit bids either by means of lump-sum value or by scaled value per unit volume for
      each product class. Advertise forest products for sale to as many potential buyers as
      possible within the region specified by the servicing contracting office. (T-1).
      9.2.2.4. Sale Contract Term. Require removal of forest products within one year or less
      from the date of contract award unless a longer term is deemed to be in the best interest
      of the government. For sales extending longer than three years, include a rate
      predetermination clause to reflect changes in market value. Collect security deposits
      when appropriate to encourage buyers to honor payment and harvesting terms identified
      in the contract. (T-2).
      9.2.2.5. Sale Inspection. Regularly inspect ongoing forest harvesting activities. The
      forest products buyer will be responsible for executing all the terms and conditions of the
      contract. The contracting office will make a determination on contract completion based
      upon a final inspection report indicating that all contractual obligations have been met.
      Document discrepancies and report them to the contracting office. Make a final
      inspection at the conclusion of the contract. Allow buyers of forest products the
      opportunity to repair any site damage in violation of contract terms prior to withholding
      security deposits. (T-2).
   9.2.3. Protection of Sensitive Natural and Cultural Resources. In contracts for commercial
   harvesting of forest products, specify safeguards for protection of sensitive natural and
   cultural resources. Include clauses that identify penalties for damages incurred. Also include
   clauses that identify penalties for removal or damage or forest products not designated for
   disposal. (T-2).
9.3. Procuring Forest Management Services
   9.3.1. Federal Assistance. The United States Forest Service (USFS) is the lead federal
   agency responsible for forest management in the United States. Under the authority of the
   Sikes Act, Air Force installations may enter into Interagency Agreements that provide for the
   transfer of funds to the USFS for assistance in the form of personnel, agency services, or
   assistance with contracting actions that implement forest management practices, including
   forest product sales. Installations may access the services of the USFS by means of an
   agreement between AFCEC and the USFS for AF-wide forest management support. The
   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under authority of the Economy Act, may also be used as a
   contracting agent for the disposal of forest products or for other forest management
   assistance on AF lands. For installations on lands withdrawn from the public domain, the
   installation must confer with the Bureau of Land Management to determine the appropriate
   management and disposition of forest resources. (T-0).
   9.3.2. State Assistance. Under the authority of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. § 670a-f),
   installations may enter into cooperative agreements with states to execute forest management
   activities that implement the goals and objectives of the INRMP. Such agreements will
   provide a means by which the state will be reimbursed for obligations incurred in support of
   the forest management practices authorized by that agreement. (T-0).
   9.3.3. Service Contracts. Use service contracts or cooperative agreements for forest
   management support when federal, state, or in-house assistance is not available. A
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     37


   professional Forester employed by the government must review all service contracts that
   implement forest management practices. (T-3).
9.4. Financial Management. 10 U.S.C. § 2665 authorizes refunding forest management
obligations with proceeds derived from the sale of forest products. DoD Financial Management
Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 16, Accounting for Production and Sale of Forest
Products, lists the appropriate expenditures that can be reimbursed from forestry program funds.
Refer to Chapter 15 for additional guidance on financial management procedures for
Reimbursable Conservation Programs. (T-0).
9.5. Forest Protection.
   9.5.1. Protection from Insects and Disease. To the extent practicable, and within budget
   limits, support federal, state, and local programs for the detection, control and eradication of
   epidemic forest insects and diseases. Refer to AFI 32-1053, Integrated Pest Management for
   guidance on the use of pesticides for forest health protection. Public Law 95-313,
   Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 and Title 16 U.S.C. § 2104 provide for United
   States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service assistance for forest health
   problems on all federal lands. To obtain USDA Forest Health Protection funds, contact the
   appropriate United States Forest Service State and Private Forestry office to obtain the
   required biological evaluation and endorsements. If a USFS biological evaluation indicates
   the need for insect or disease control, submit a copy of the USFS funding request application
   along with a copy of the biological evaluation to the AFCEC/CZ Natural Resources Subject
   Matter Expert. AFCEC/CZ will review and consolidate AF funding requests and submit
   them to the Forest Service for consideration; with copy to the Armed Forces Pest
   Management Board. (T-0).
   9.5.2. Forest Fire Protection. Refer to Chapter 12 for guidance on wildland fire protection.

Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property, and the additional guidelines contained
herein.
   10.1.1. Compatibility with the Military Mission. All agricultural outgrants must be
   compatible with the military mission of the installation, as determined by the Installation
   Commander. The Range Operating Agency will determine the availability of outgrant lands
   on military training and testing ranges IAW guidelines in AFI 13-212. (T-2).
   10.1.2. Compatibility with the INRMP. Agricultural outgrants must be consistent with the
   goals and objectives of the installation INRMP. Agricultural outgrants for crop production,
   livestock grazing, equestrian operations, commercial seed harvesting, apiary placement,
   maple sugar collection and any other agricultural product may be conducted where feasible
   and compatible with the INRMP. The overriding principles of ecosystem management (see
   2.8) also apply to any outgrant of AF lands for agricultural uses. (T-2).
10.2. Agricultural Outgrant Program Management.
   10.2.1. Administration. The installation Real Estate Office and/or the Real Estate Division
   of the local U.S Army Corps of Engineers District are responsible for administrating
   agricultural outgrants on AF lands. Natural resources managers and real estate personnel will
   collaborate in developing agricultural outgrant documents. Outgrant renewal actions should
   begin at least nine months prior to expiration. The supporting Air Force or U.S. Army Corps
   of Engineers real property office will bill outgrantees in accordance with the terms of the
   outgrant. (T-2)
   10.2.2. Outgrant Instruments. Agricultural use of AF property requires a lease, license, or
   permit prepared, awarded, and executed IAW AFI 32-9003. All agricultural leases must
   require the outgrantee to pay cash, provide services, and/or make improvements to the extent
   that the government is receiving a fair market value for use of the land. Government-owned
   livestock are exempt from the fee collection requirement. Licenses and permits for
   agricultural uses at less than fair market value are not allowed unless the licensee or
   permittee is eligible for an exception from the consideration requirements under AFI 32-
   9003. (T-2)
   10.2.3. Outgrant Revenue Collection. Record revenues collected from agricultural outgrants
   on a DoD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. Deposit proceeds from agricultural
   outgrants to Deposit Fund Account 57 F 3875.00AG 31FA 667100.
   10.2.4. Land Use Rules. All agriculture outgrants, to include grazing/cropland leases,
   licenses, and permits, require written land use rules as requirements in the outgrant to ensure
   the compatibility of outgrant activities with the military mission as well as to conserve the
   soil, water, and other sensitive natural resources within the areas included in the outgrant.
   Land use rules will implement the appropriate Best Management Practices for erosion and
   sedimentation control as established by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     39


   (NRCS) and state guidelines. Land use rules must also be written to support the natural
   resources management goals and objectives in the INRMP. Develop a compliance checklist
   from the land use rules that can be used to perform objective inspections of outgrant
   operations to monitor compliance. (T-2)
   10.2.5. Technical Oversight. Agricultural outgrant documents and their associated land use
   rules must be reviewed and approved by the designated installation or IST natural resources
   management specialist, installation Flight Safety office, and Range Operating Agency, as
   applicable. When practicable, seek technical assistance from an agricultural specialist from
   the NRCS, USFS, BLM, state cooperative extension service, local soil and water
   conservation district, or other agency experienced in the management of agricultural and
   grazing lands. (T-3)
   10.2.6. Compliance Inspection. The installation natural resources manager and supporting
   real property management office jointly share responsibility for outgrant compliance
   inspection. Schedule inspections of agricultural outgrant operations in accordance with
   guidelines stated in AFI 32-9003. A qualified agronomist, livestock grazing specialist, or
   natural resources management specialist mustinspect outgrant sites semiannually to ensure
   that the outgrantee complies with the technical terms of the outgrant and associated land use
   rules. Cooperating agency personnel can make semiannually on-site reviews of the outgrant
   program to assess crop and grazing land conditions and outgrant compliance on behalf of the
   AF. The inspector will complete the land use rules compliance checklist at each review. All
   inspection reports will be delivered to the administering real estate office for further action.
   (T-2)
   10.2.7. Improvements and Services. Agricultural outgrants may require the outgrantee to
   provide agricultural land improvements, services and other in-kind consideration in lieu of a
   portion or all of the cash payment due the United States Government for the grant of the
   interest in the land. The administering real property office will calculate the fair market
   value of any such improvements and services and deduct the amount calculated from the cash
   rent or payment due the United States Government. Outgrant instruments will provide that
   all such improvements become the property of the United States Government. Installations
   with outgrants that allow improvements, services and other in-kind consideration in lieu of a
   portion or all of the cash payment must provide a justification for the substitution of in-kind
   consideration for the cash payment in the INRMP. The INRMP justification must evaluate
   the impact of improvements, services, and other in-kind consideration to the economic
   sustainability of the program, to the military mission, and to the achievement of INRMP
   goals and objectives. (T-2)

   10.3.3. Livestock grazing programs must not degrade the natural ecological integrity of the
   landscape. Do not allow grazing within native plant communities where it has been
   determined that such use is inappropriate for the plant community type. Suspend grazing on
   lands where historic overgrazing and other abusive grazing practices have limited the ability
   of the plant community to recover. (T-2).
10.4. Guidelines for Agricultural Crop Production. Crop production programs must support
the goals and objectives of the installation INRMP and Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
Plan. Installations with active runways must coordinate any new cropland outgrant proposals
with the installation Safety Office and Airfield Manager. (T-1).
10.5. Monitoring Outgrant Lands for Compliance with the INRMP. Monitor outgranted
lands to ensure that land use is in compliance with the applicable land use rules and the land
stewardship goals, objectives, and implementing guidelines stated in the INRMP. Installations
with agricultural outgrants will include a description of the monitoring program in the INRMP.
Monitoring programs will adhere to the guidelines listed below. (T-2).
   10.5.1. Monitor cropland outgrants annually, or when environmental conditions warrant, to
   ensure that they do not create unacceptable soil losses from erosion or cause point-source or
   non-point pollution to any natural water body. Also monitor other direct and indirect impacts
   of agriculture outgrant activities on surrounding land and water resources. (T-2).
   10.5.2. Monitor water runoff from cropland outgrants for levels of pesticides or fertilizer that
   exceed state regulatory requirements. The location, method and frequency of water samples
   will be determined through consultation with the appropriate state agency. (T-2).
   10.5.3. Monitor livestock grazing outgrants using sample plots, photo points, permanent
   grazing exclosures, and other acceptable means to evaluate forage condition, trend, and
   utilization, and determine if the overall health of the rangeland resources are being sustained.
   Also note the presence and extent of invasive plant species (see Chapter 13). (T-2).
10.6. Pest Management on Outgranted Lands.
   10.6.1. Use of Pesticides by Outgrantee. Any application of pesticides on AF lands must
   comply with AFI 32-1053, Pest Management Program. Outgrantees performing pesticide
   application on AF lands must maintain the certification requirements of the state, territory, or
   host nation in which the installation lies. Outgrant instruments must require that the
   outgrantee obtain the approval of the installation pest management point of contact prior to
   any pesticide application, and report all actual pesticide usage (in pounds of active
   ingredient) to the pest management point of contact. (T-2).
   10.6.2. Control of Noxious, Exotic, and Invasive Species. Air Force agricultural outgrant
   programs must comply with the requirements of the Federal Noxious Weed Act 7 U.S.C.
   2801. Outgrant programs will, to the extent practicable and within the limits of available
   funds, support state and federal programs for the control of noxious, exotic, and invasive
   plant species. Installations may enter into cooperative agreements with local area
   government entities that establish integrated pest management principles for the control of
   undesirable plant species. Expenditure of agricultural program funds to control noxious,
   exotic and invasive species will be consistent with the level of effort exhibited on similar
   federal, state or private agriculture and grazing lands in the vicinity of the installation. (T-0).

                                  OUTDOOR RECREATION

11.1. Outdoor Recreation Planning. The installation Integrated Natural Resources
Management Plan will address outdoor recreation management. Natural resources managers
must collaborate with the installation Community Planner, installation Services Directorate, and
other stakeholders in the planning and development of outdoor recreation on an AF installation;
and with the Range Operating Agency for AF ranges. The INRMP will identify the areas on the
installation where outdoor recreation activities are appropriate, and discuss the compatibility of
outdoor recreation programs with the military mission. Installation recreation areas shall be
categorized in the INRMP as follows: (T-1).
   11.1.1. Developed recreation areas contain facilities designed to accommodate intensive
   recreational activities such as sports fields, campgrounds, picnic areas, paved
   walking/jogging/cycling trails, winter sports areas, marinas, developed swimming beaches,
   and other outdoor recreation facilities managed by the Air Force Personnel Center
   Directorate of Services.
   11.1.2. Dispersed recreation areas are areas that are suitable to support dispersed recreational
   activities such as hunting, fishing, primitive camping, bird watching, boating, hiking, and
   sightseeing.
   11.1.3. Special interest areas are recreation areas that contain valuable archeological,
   botanical, ecological, geological, historic, zoological, scenic, or other features that warrant
   special protection and access control. Public use, to include interpretive displays and
   education programs, may be permitted as specified in the INRMP. Collection of plants, plant
   material, animals, rock, soil, or fossils on Air Force property is prohibited, unless authorized
   in the installation INRMP. (T-2).
11.2. Public Access for Outdoor Recreation. All developed and dispersed outdoor recreation
activities must be consistent with the INRMP. Allow use of outdoor recreation resources by the
general public when such use is deemed by the commander to be compatible with the military
mission and does not exceed the recreational carrying capacity of the land. See 6.2.3 for
guidelines on establishing access and participant criteria in the INRMP. The INRMP will
address the specific rules and procedures for outdoor recreation access on recreation areas that
are not under the direct control of Air Force Services Directorate. (T-2).
11.3. Off-Road Vehicle (ORV) Use. The INRMP will include installation policy on the use of
off-road vehicles, to include mountain bikes. Allow use of off-road vehicles only after
thoroughly analyzing the impact of such use on soils, archeological sites, wildlife, water quality,
and other ecosystem attributes. Periodically monitor and evaluate for damage any areas
designated for ORV use. Refer to Executive Order No. 11989, Off-road Vehicles on Public
Lands, May 24, 1977 for federal policy on ORV use. (T-0).
   11.3.1. Restrict use of off-road vehicles, including mountain bikes and other all terrain
   vehicles, to areas that can sustain their use without damage to natural or cultural resources.
   Require that all motorized off-road vehicles are licensed and insured.
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  43


   11.3.2. Areas that are damaged from off-road vehicle use must be closed to prevent further
   damage. Undertake rehabilitation projects to restore the damage. (T-0).
11.4. Watchable Wildlife Programs. The Air Force is signatory to a Memorandum of
Understanding that allows for cooperation with other agencies and non-governmental
organizations to develop and maintain a Watchable Wildlife Program on public and private
lands. The purpose of the program is to increase opportunities for people to observe native
wildlife in their natural habitats and to support wildlife habitat preservation. When compatible
with the installation mission, installations may designate Watchable Wildlife Areas in the
INRMP planning process. If access by the general public is permissible, submit information on
the Watchable Wildlife Area to Watchable Wildlife Incorporated for inclusion in publications.
(T-3).

                                     LAND MANAGEMENT

12.1. Land Management Programs. Air Force land management activities are intended to
protect and enhance desirable natural and man-made features on the installation. AF land
management programs include landscape design, grounds maintenance, urban forest
management, golf course maintenance, Bird/wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard reduction, irrigation
and water management, pest management, invasive species management, control of non-point
source pollution, and soil erosion control.
12.2. Grounds Maintenance Categories. For purposes of designating the intensity of grounds
maintenance, the INRMP will identify and map installation grounds into categories of
‘improved’, ‘semi-improved’, and ‘unimproved’ as defined in Attachment 1. The INRMP will
describe the scope of grounds maintenance activities that will take place within each category.
(T-2).
12.3. Designing and Maintaining Landscapes. Landscape design and maintenance activities
must comply with the land management goals of the INRMP and the BASH Plan. (T-2).
   12.3.1. Landscape Design. To the maximum extent possible, utilize regionally native plants
   in landscape designs for improved and semi-improved grounds. Do not utilize non-native
   species that tend to be invasive (reproduce outside the intended growing area). Design
   landscapes that reduce maintenance inputs in terms of energy, water, manpower, and
   equipment. Choose plant materials adapted to local environmental conditions that have the
   potential to reduce the need for irrigation, fertilization or pesticides to maintain a healthy
   condition. Do not establish or maintain vegetative species on or adjacent to the airfield that
   provide food, cover, roosting or nesting habitat to wildlife.” at the end of the paragraph.
   12.3.2. Grounds Maintenance. Establish grounds maintenance practices according to
   grounds maintenance category delineations. Where practicable, convert improved grounds to
   semi-improved or unimproved grounds, and convert semi-improved grounds to unimproved
   grounds. When feasible, convert landscapes dominated by non-native plants to native trees,
   shrubs, or grasses. Irrigate installation grounds only when necessary to fulfill a justified user
   requirement. (T-2).
12.4. Golf Course Environmental Management (GEM). The goals of a GEM program are to
minimize or eliminate potential negative impacts to the environment and the surrounding
community, and ensure compliance with all appropriate environmental regulations. Installations
are encouraged to develop a Golf Course Environmental Management Plan (GEM Plan) as a
component plan associated with the INRMP. The GEM Plan will address all environmental
aspects related to golf course management, and provide the appropriate goals and objectives for
managing the environmental aspects. (T-3).
12.5. Urban Forestry. Urban Forest Management. The INRMP will state long-term goals and
objectives to achieve a desired future condition for installation landscape trees (i.e. urban forest).
The INRMP will include a list of recommended landscape trees and shrubs that is based upon
site compatibility, life expectancy, maintenance requirements, and compatibility with BASH
safety guidelines. Replacement plantings will favor native trees and shrubs or other species that
are able to survive with minimal maintenance requirements. Do not plant trees or shrubs that

will require irrigation for survival beyond an initial two-year establishment period. Ensure that
tree plantings will not create a future hazard for aircraft and flight operations. An Urban Forest
Management Plan may be developed as a component plan of the INRMP. (T-3).
12.6. Pest Management. In accordance with AFI 32-1053, Pest Management Program, the
installation Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) must address all strategies for managing
pests. Natural resources managers will coordinate with pest management personnel to ensure
that the IPMP and INRMP are mutually supportive and not in conflict. (T-1).
12.7. Non-point Source Pollution Prevention.
   12.7.1. Use applicable Best Management Practices to minimize non-point sources of water
   pollution.     To determine appropriate BMPs, consult the USDA Natural Resource
   Conservation Service, local soil and water conservation district, state agricultural extension
   office, or state water quality office.
   12.7.2. The non-point source pollution control program and BMPs for specific projects
   should be consistent with the state non-point source pollution management program as well
   as any enforceable requirements of the state Coastal Zone Management Programs.
   12.7.3. Before using treated sewage effluent in irrigation systems, coordinate with the Air
   Force Civil Engineer Center to determine whether federal or state water quality requirements
   exist.
12.8. Mineral Leasing. The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for mineral leasing on
federal lands. The Air Force Civil Engineer Center, Installations Center of Excellence
(AFCEC/ICE) is the point of contact for coordination on all proposed mineral exploration and
mining on land controlled by the AF, and for negotiation of reclamation requirements. The Air
Force will ensure leases include provisions for it to be reimbursed for any damage to natural
resources or removal of commercial timber resulting from oil and gas leasing and mineral
exploration and mining. (T-1).

                            WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT

13.1. Wildland Fire Management Policy. The Review and Update of the 1995 Federal
Wildland Fire Management Policy (January 2001) is the primary wildland fire policy document
for federal agencies, and establishes the Guiding Principles, Policies and Implementation Actions
for wildland fire management on Department of Defense lands. The National Wildland Fire
Coordinating Group (NWCG) Wildland Fire Qualification Subsystem Guide (PMS 310-1/NFES
1414), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 295 – Standard for Wildfire
Control, NFPA Standard 1051 – Standard for Wildland Firefighter Professional Qualifications,
NFPA Standard 1143 – Standard for Wildland Fire Management, and NFPA Standard 1144 –
Standard for Protection of Life and Property from Wildfire establish the accepted professional
standards for AF wildland fire management policy. Installations with unimproved lands that
present a wildfire hazard, and installations which utilize prescribed burns as a land management
tool, will develop and implement a Wildland Fire Management Plan (WRMP). The WFMP will
be incorporated into, and be consistent with, the INRMP. For the purposes of this instruction,
the term “wildland fire” refers to both wildfire and prescribed fire. (T-0).
13.2. Program Authority.
   13.2.1. Air Force Wildland Fire Center (AFWFC). The Air Force Wildland Fire Center is
   responsible for providing oversight, technical direction and coordination of wildland fire
   management planning and implementation for Air Force.
   13.2.2. The Installation Commander, or appropriate designee, approves the installation
   Wildland Fire Management Plan. The WFMP will designate a Wildland Fire Program
   Manager and define the roles and responsibilities for wildland fire management on the
   installation. Prior to approval, a WFMP must be submitted for review and comment to a
   qualified wildland fire expert having at least NWCG Type 4 Incident Commander (ICT4) or
   Type 2 Burn Boss (RXB2) qualifications as defined in PMS 310-1/NFES 1414. (T-1).
   13.2.3. The installation Wildland Fire Program Manager is responsible for the development,

   C.F.R. § 989. (T-1).
13.4. Wildland Fire Operations. Air Force wildland fire policy and guidance applies to
operations on undeveloped lands that does not involve facilities and infrastructure. A wildland
fire is any non-structure fire that occurs on wildland and includes both: (1) wildfires, to include
unplanned natural fires (e.g. lightning), munitions caused fires, unauthorized human-caused fires,
and escaped prescribed fire projects, and all other unplanned wildland fires, and (2) prescribed
fires purposely ignited by natural resource managers to meet specific land management
objectives. A primary objectives for any wildland fire operations will be firefighter and public
safety. The Interagency Standards for Fire and Fire Aviation Operations (NFES 2724), may be
used as a reference for wildland fire operations.
   13.4.1. Wildfire Incident Management. Wildfires occurring on AF managed lands will have
   a response consistent with firefighter safety, known and potential hazards, and resource
   values at risk. Acceptable response to a wildfire incident shall be consistent with the
   direction specified in the installation Wildland Fire Management Plan, and may incorporate
   the full range of suppression options ranging from containment and monitoring to direct
   attack and full suppression.          In accordance with Homeland Security Presidential
   Directive/HSPD-5 – Management of Domestic Incidents, February 28, 2003, Air Force

                            INVASIVE SPECIES MANAGEMENT

14.1. Invasive Species Management Policy. Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species,
February 3, 1999 requires all federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species,
provide for their control and minimize their economic, ecological, and human health impacts.
Under Executive Order 13112, installations will, to the extent practicable and permitted by law,
not authorize, fund, or carry out management actions that are likely to cause the introduction or
spread of invasive species. Furthermore, Title 7 U.S.C. §2814 states that each federal agency
shall establish and adequately fund an undesirable plants management program through the
agency's budgetary process. (T-0).
14.2. Invasive Species Management Program. Address invasive species management in the
installation INRMP. Formulate and implement INRMP goals and objectives to detect, respond
to, and control populations of invasive species in a cost-effective and environmentally sound
manner whenever and wherever practical. INRMP goals should be consistent with the Federal
Invasive Species Management Plan and other guidelines promulgated by the Federal Invasive
Species Council. The invasive species management element of the INRMP will provide specific
information on species to be controlled, recommended control methods, and appropriate level of
control effort in consideration of available resources. Promote native habitats and the restoration
of native species in ecosystems that have been invaded. (T-0).
14.3. Invasive Species Detection and Monitoring. The INRMP will include a current
assessment of the presence and extent of exotic and invasive species on the installation. Conduct
surveys to detect and map invasive species. Monitor invasive species populations and update
inventory information as new species are discovered and known populations are controlled or
eliminated. (T-0).
14.4. Invasive Species Control on Agricultural Outgrants. Cropland and grazing outgrants
on AF properties will include requirements for the outgrantee to prevent the introduction and
spread of invasive species. Outgrant agreements will include requirements to implement and
report control measures for invasive species that are identified in the INRMP. (T-2).
14.5. Control of Feral Animals. Installations will, to the extent practicable and permitted by
law, not authorize, fund, or carry out activities that are likely to cause the introduction or spread
of feral dogs, cats, pigs, goats or other non-native domesticated animals on AF-controlled lands.
The INRMP will address the specific policies, programs and methods used to control feral
animals on AF installations. Feeding or harboring of feral domesticated species is prohibited
unless justified in the INRMP as necessary to achieve a specified natural resources management
objective. (T-2).
14.6. Interagency Cooperation. Title 7 U.S.C. §2814 authorizes cooperative agreements with
state agencies for the control of undesirable plant species on federal lands. Partner with other
federal, state, and local agencies and adjacent landowners in joint control strategies to
collaborate efforts for the control of undesirable species and increase the effectiveness of control
measures. (T-0). Installations are encouraged to participate in state or regional Exotic Pest Plant
Councils and Cooperative Invasive Species Management Areas at a level of effort that is
commensurate with efforts by the partners and within the legal authority of the AF.

activities must comply with the requirements of AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program, AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFPAM 91-212,
BASH Management Techniques. AFCEC/CO and the Air Force Safety Center (AFSEC/SEFW)
provide technical assistance to installations on BASH issues. (T-1).
   15.1.1. The installation Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan must support the
   BASH Plan. The INRMP must address habitat management techniques that can reduce the
   potential for wildlife hazards to aircraft operations. The BASH Plan must be referenced in
   the INRMP. A BASH Plan designated For Official Use Only (FOUO) is exempted from
   public review, but must be available to the USFWS and state wildlife agency upon request.
   (T-1).
   15.1.2. Natural resources personnel will assist the installation flight safety office and others
   in the development and implementation of the BASH Plan. Natural resource personnel will
   assist the flight safety office in providing oversight to external agencies or contractors
   involved in the implementation of the BASH program on Air Force property. (T-1).
   15.1.3. The installation natural resources manager must be an active member of the
   installation Bird/wildlife Hazard Working Group (BHWG). (T-1).
   15.1.4. Installations will establish procedures for coordination and review of construction
   and infrastructure improvement projects (e.g. landscaping, waste water treatment, golf
   courses etc.) to ensure that any BASH related impacts are considered. (T-1).
15.2. Natural Resources Management in the Airfield Environment. All aspects of
installation natural resources management must be reviewed for potential wildlife hazards to
aircraft operations. The land adjacent to aircraft operations areas must be managed to minimize
attractions to wildlife. Refer to Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 50/5200-
33B, Hazardous Wildlife Attractants on or Near Airports for guidance on identifying land uses
near airfields that have the potential to attract hazardous wildlife. (T-1).
   15.2.1. Airfield Vegetation Management. Vegetation within and around an active airfield
   will be managed to satisfy wildlife abatement objectives. Promote the establishment of a
   vegetative cover that reduces the attractiveness of the airfield to wildlife within a minimum
   distance of 500 feet from any aircraft movement area IAW AFI 91-202 grass height
   requirements. Vegetation management on and adjacent to the managed airfield to support
   BASH Plan objectives is a military readiness activity covered under 50 C.F.R. 21.15.
   Additionally, avoid using landscape plants around airfield infrastructure that could attracts
   birds or animals, and remove any landscape plants known to attract birds or wildlife in the
   vicinity of the airfield. (T-1).
 54                                                         AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


   15.2.2. Managing Wetlands in the Airfield Environment. Wetland areas near an airfield may
   create potential hazards to aircraft operations. Innovative techniques to manage wildlife in
   wetlands should be explored and implemented. Legally defensible actions to reduce the
   amount of wetlands on the airfield to the maximum extent possible must be explored and
   pursued when their presence conflicts with the flight mission. While “no net loss” of
   wetlands is an important AF goal, priority must be given to flight safety. (T-1).
   15.2.3. Airfield Drainage Ditches. Manage drainage ditches to reduce their attractiveness to
   wildlife. Do not locate storm water runoff retention ponds beneath the airfield approach-
   departure clearance surfaces as defined in UFC 3-260-01. Coordinate with the appropriate
   regulatory authority to determine if maintenance of airfield drainage requires a permit IAW
   Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, or qualifies under a Corps of Engineers nationwide
   permit issued IAW Title 33, C.F.R. § 330, Nationwide Permit Program. (T-1).
   15.2.4. Landscaping. Avoid using landscape plant material that could attracts birds or
   animals on and around the airfield. Remove any landscape plants in the vicinity of the
   airfield that are known to attract birds or wildlife. (T-1).
   15.2.5. Managing Agricultural Outgrants in the Airfield Environment. Agricultural and
   grazing outgrants (see Chapter 9) must be compatible with the installation BASH plan and
   INRMP. Coordinate proposals for outgrants with the BHWG to ensure that the crops grown
   and the agricultural methods used do not negatively impact flight safety. (T-1).
       15.2.5.1. Agricultural activities are not permitted within an aircraft movement area or
       within the boundaries of the airfield security fence.
       15.2.5.2. Grain crops are highly attractive to wildlife and should never be grown near the
       airfield as part of an agricultural outgrant program.
       15.2.5.3. Grazing animals can be a serious hazard if uncontrolled within the airfield.
       Ensure strict livestock control and proper fencing.
15.3. Management of Wildlife in Support of the BASH Plan. The INRMP must evaluate
both existing and potential wildlife hazards to aircraft operations. Although the Air Force Safety
Center is responsible for the overall AF BASH program, natural resources and pest management
personnel are an integral part of every installation BASH program. Natural resources managers
must share information on biological resources and habitat conditions with the installation safety
office to facilitate the development of a comprehensive BASH program. (T-1).
   15.3.1. The INRMP must identify wildlife species that may pose a hazard to aircraft
   operations, mission readiness or capability, and discuss habitat management techniques that
   can be used to mitigate the threat. Utilize Air Force Safety Center and Federal Aviation
   Administration data on wildlife-related aircraft mishaps to identify those species that are
   most often involved in aircraft mishap incidents. Perform local wildlife surveys to identify
   wildlife activity that may pose a risk to aircraft operations. (T-1).
   15.3.2. Migratory Birds. Share information on migratory bird activity with flight safety in
   order to enhance the installation’s BASH program. Coordinate with other installations
   within the same flyway to obtain information on current migratory bird populations. Refer to
   6.2. for guidance on activities that may affect migratory birds. (T-1).
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    55


  15.3.3. Watchable Wildlife Programs. Consider wildlife hazards to aircraft operations when
  developing any Watchable Wildlife programs. Coordinate all Watchable Wildlife programs
  through the Bird/wildlife Hazard Working Group prior to implementation. (T-3).
  15.3.4. Airfield Wildlife Damage Control.            The installation BASH plan details
  responsibilities for control of nuisance wildlife on the airfield. Lethal control is authorized
  only after all practical non-lethal control measures have been exhausted, provided that the
  proposed actions are reviewed in EIAP procedures as stipulated in 32 C.F.R. §989. Obtain
  depredation permits from the USFWS pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for
  intentional takes of migratory birds in support of the BASH program (also see 6.4). The
  installation BASH Plan will designate the office responsible for maintaining all applicable
  federal and state depredation permits or Migratory Bird Treaty Act permits when those
  permits are in support of the BASH program. Wildlife control methods specified in a BASH
  plan, as well as the permits required, must be referenced in the installation INRMP and
  coordinated with the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency as part of the annual INRMP
  review and update process (see 2.5). If a federally protected species is present or suspected to
  be present an acitive airfield, notify AFSEC/SEFW to identify risks to flight safety and
  mission capability and to determine acceptable mitigative actions. (T-1).

                                          Chapter 16

                          NATURAL RESOURCES BUDGETING

16.1. Funding Sources. This chapter outlines the appropriate funding sources, funding
priorities, and level of effort for AF conservation programs. Funding sources include the
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation, reimbursable conservation program accounts
for forestry, agriculture, fish and wildlife and outdoor recreation management, the DoD Legacy
Resource Management Program, and other sources such as those that may be obtained through
grants or cooperative agreements executed under authority of the Sikes Act.
16.2. Air Force Conservation Program Funding. Conservation program requirements eligible
for O&M funding are programmed as part of the Environmental Quality (EQ) Programming and
Budget process as described in AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management. Program natural
resources requirements for current year and outyears within the Automated Civil Engineer
System - Project Management (ACES-PM) system, or an approved successor database.
Headquarters United States Air Force (USAF), Director of Air Force Civil Engineers (A4C) will
annually provide additional information on programming and budgeting for environmental
quality O&M requirements in the form of the EQ Programming Matrix, EQ Standard Titles
Guidance, and EQ Scoring Model. Use the EQ Programming Matrix to determine if the
requirement is valid or not valid for EQ funding. Categorize conservation requirements as
recurring or non-recurring, and designate funding priority as Level 0, 1, 2, or 3 in accordance
with the guidance in AFI 32-7001.
   16.2.1. Level 0 Natural Resources Requirements – Maintain Compliance (Operations and
   Services). Level 0 includes recurring natural resources management requirements. Ongoing
   natural resources management activities identified in an approved INRMP are Level 0
   requirements if they are essential for the successful implementation of the goals and
   objectives stated in the plan. Level 0 requirements include funding for personnel, travel,
   training, and supply costs, as well as recurring inventories, surveys, sampling, monitoring,
   reporting and record keeping, payments, and fees required by a specific public law or
   compliance agreement (e.g. Biological Opinion for T&E species management). Always
   utilize the EQ Standard Titles list for Level 0 project titles.
   16.2.2. Level 1 Requirements – Fix Noncompliance. A Level 1 natural resources
   requirement is a non-recurring action needed to correct a non-conformance or out-of-
   compliance condition with a supported driver in the programmed year. Valid drivers include
   federal laws, regulatory mandates, and state laws applicable to federal activities. The
   principal legal drivers for natural resources requirements are the Sikes Act, Endangered
   Species Act, Clean Water Act, and National Environmental Policy Act. Level 1 includes
   projects that implement an approved INRMP if they are essential for the successful
   implementation of the goals and objectives stated in the plan, to include requirements to
   manage species and habitats to prevent the listing of a candidate species for listing under the
   auspices of the Endangered Species Act. Natural resources surveys and mitigation measures
   (e.g. T&E species surveys, jurisdictional wetland delineations) required as a prerequisite for
   regulatory approval of proposed projects must be funded as part of the proponent’s project
   cost and are not valid Level 1 environmental requirements. Refer to the EQ Programming
   Matrix for additional guidance regarding supported and non-supported Level 1 requirements.
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     57


   16.2.3. Level 2 Requirements – Prevent Noncompliance. A non-recurring natural resources
   requirement for activities and projects programmed in a fiscal year which is in advance of the
   year in which compliance is mandatory and necessary to prevent non-compliance beyond the
   program year. Legal drivers are the same as for Level 1.
   16.2.4. Level 3 Requirements – Enhance Environment. Level 3 natural resources
   requirements are activities and projects that are not explicitly required by an applicable legal
   driver, but are needed to enhance the environment beyond statutory compliance to achieve
   overall INRMP goals and objectives.
16.3. Reimbursable Conservation Program Funds. Funds generated from the sale of forest
products, agricultural products, grazing and cropland outgrants, and the collection of fees for
hunting, fishing, trapping and other outdoor recreation activities may be reimbursed to Field
Operating Agencies and installations for support of natural resources programs under certain
conditions set forth by law. AFCEC/CZ is responsible for the administration and management of
Reimbursable Conservation Program funds.
   16.3.1. Forest Management Program.
       16.3.1.1. Forest Management Revenue Collection. Record revenues collected from
       forest product sales on a DoD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. Deposit proceeds
       from forest product sales to Deposit Fund Account 57 F 3875.000* (* refers to the last
       digit of the fiscal year, e.g. 57 F 3875.0005 31FF for FY 2015). Sale contracts may
       provide for scheduled payments by the buyer. If sales are made on a unit weight basis,
       use the weight tickets from certified government or commercial scales as a basis for
       collection. Do not deposit refundable security deposits received from a buyer with forest
       product sale collections. Instead, hold security deposit payments in a temporary suspense
       account or deposit into 57X6501.SDEP until funds are either disbursed back to the buyer
       or converted to revenue collections.
       16.3.1.2. Forest Management Reimbursements.             10 U.S.C.       §2665 authorizes
       reimbursement of costs directly related to the production of forest products with proceeds
       derived from the sale of the forest products. Eligible forestry program reimbursements
       include obligations funded by O&M (appropriation 3400) or Other Procurement
       (appropriation 3080) that are directly related to the economic production and sale of
       timber, logs, pulpwood, Christmas trees, posts and poles, pine straw, stump wood, bark
       and other mulch, cones, seeds, mistletoe, firewood, and wood chips. Reimbursement of
       forest management obligations may not exceed the limit set by funding authorization
       documents. AFCEC/CZ must monitor forestry proceeds and obligations within each
       fiscal year, and reduce the forestry program funding authorizations and reimbursements
       when necessary to avoid a program deficit. Additional budget guidance and procedures
       for the forest management program are located in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget
       Guidance and Procedures. Forest management expenses authorized for reimbursement
       from forestry proceeds are:
          16.3.1.2.1. Forest Improvement. Obligations incurred for the improvement of forest
          land, to include pre-commercial tree thinning, pruning, and the control of undesirable
          vegetation.

         be used to reimburse costs of forest protection measures that are specifically
         conducted to protect and enhance a commercial forest resource.                  Obtain
         reimbursement from proponent activities for costs incurred in mission-related fire
         protection and suppression that supports military training, installation operations,
         range use, munitions testing and evaluation.
         16.3.1.2.4. Forest Access Roads.          Obligations incurred for construction,
         reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of forest access roads and trails used
         primarily for forest improvement operations and the harvest of forest products.
         16.3.1.2.5. Sales of Forest Products. Obligations incurred in the preparation for sales
         of forest products, to include marking, surveying, mapping, appraisal, marketing,
         contract preparation, contract advertising, escorting prospective bidders, contract
         administration, and enforcing compliance of forest product sales contracts.
         16.3.1.2.6. Administrative Expenses. Obligations incurred for administration of a
         commercial forest management program, to include supervising, planning,
         programming, conducting field surveys, inventories, training, and attending

         the procurement of vehicles and equipment used exclusively in support of forest
         management on AF installations. See 15.3.6 for further guidance on procurement of
         vehicles and equipment.
  16.3.2. Department of Defense Forest Reserve Account. 10 U.S.C. §2665 provides for the
  distribution of net proceeds (gross collections less the obligations incurred) from installation
  forest product sales between the state government and the DoD Forest Reserve Account.
  States in which the revenue was generated receive forty percent of net proceeds for each
  installation that registers a net gain. The remaining net proceeds are deposited to the DoD
  Forest Reserve Account and managed by the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of
  Defense (Installations and Environment), (DUSD(I&E)), according to the guidelines in DoD
  Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 16, Accounting for
  Production and Sale of Forest Products. Forest Reserve Account funds can be used to fund
  forestry programs as well as other conservation programs and projects that implement the
  goals and objectives of an approved INRMP. AFCEC/CZ reviews proposals for Forest
  Reserve Account funding and recommends projects for approval to DUSD(I&E). The
  AFCEC/CZ Natural Resources Subject Matter Expert serves as the AF representative on the
  Forestry Subcommittee of the DoD Conservation Committee (see 1.2.2.3) Forest Reserve
  account funds for approved AF projects are issued through AFCEC/CZ for further
  distribution and program oversight.

     authorizes the use of proceeds from agricultural outgrants and sales of agricultural
     products to cover the administrative expenses of agricultural leasing, and to finance
     natural resources management activities that implement an approved INRMP. These
     obligations will include costs of normal operations (appropriation 3400) or investment
     equipment (appropriation 3080). Authorized uses of cropland and grazing funds include
     (T-0):
         16.3.3.2.1. Civilian Pay - limited to persons providing direct support of agriculture
         programs and natural resources management programs on AF installations.
         16.3.3.2.2. Administrative Expenses – travel, training, attendance at professional and
         scientific meetings, administrative oversight, and supplies that are directly related to
         the management of natural resources on AF installations.
         16.3.3.2.3. Land Improvements – limited to improvements that increase the
         productivity or value of the land for outgrant purposes.
         16.3.3.2.4. Vehicles and Equipment – vehicles and equipment purchased with
         agricultural funds may only be used in support of agriculture outgrant management
         and in support of implementation of the INRMP. See 15.3.6 for further guidance on
         procurement of vehicles and equipment.
  16.3.4. Fish and Wildlife Management Reimbursements. The Sikes Act, 16 U.S.C. §
  670a(b)(3)(B), allows hunting, fishing, trapping and other outdoor recreation fees to be
  reimbursed back to the installation where they were generated. Fish and wildlife
  management fees are collected into the 57 5095 accounting classification. AFCEC/CZ
  monitors collections and facilitates disbursement of collections back to the installation in the
  57X5095 (Fund Code 74) appropriation. These fees must be used only on the installation
  where they were collected, and used only for the protection, conservation, and management
  of fish and wildlife, to include habitat improvement and related activities. Authorized uses of
  57X5095 funds include civilian pay, vehicle and equipment procurement, and other
  administrative expense directly related to the management of the fish and wildlife program
  on the installation. Vehicles and equipment procured with 57X5095 funds may only be used
  to support fish and wildlife management activities that implement the INRMP. See 15.3.6
  for further guidance on procurement of vehicles and equipment. Installations must notify
  AFCEC/CZ if they terminate hunting, fishing, or trapping programs; so that the 57X5095
  account can be closed. (T-0).
  16.3.5. Reimbursable Conservation Program Budget Process. AFCEC/CZ will manage
  reimbursable conservation program budgets. The annual reimbursable conservation program
  budget process is as follows:

     16.3.5.1. Installations prepare annual budget submissions for Reimbursable Conservation
     Program funding by 31 July each year for the upcoming fiscal year. Installation budgets
     must identify projected revenue and requested reimbursements. (T-2).
     16.3.5.2. AFCEC/CZ reviews installation budgets, and approves the final budget by 30
     September.
     16.3.5.3. AFCEC/CZ transmits the approved budget to the servicing Defense Finance
     and Accounting Service center.
     16.3.5.4. AFCEC/CZ obtains program funds and issues an operating budget authority
     document (OBAD) to installations in accordance with the approved final budget, but
     limited by the availability of program proceeds. The OBAD document imposes ceiling
     limitations on the maximum amount of obligations that can be reimbursed from program
     proceeds.
     16.3.5.5. AFCEC/CZ will monitor expenditures to ensure that total obligations for a
     fiscal year do not exceed program proceeds, and will reduce operating budget authority as
     needed to prevent program deficits.
  16.3.6. Procurement of Vehicles and Equipment with Reimbursable Conservation Program
  Funds. Appropriation 3080 may be reimbursed with funds generated from the sale of forest
  products, agricultural products, and income from livestock grazing and cropland outgrants
  for the purpose of procuring vehicles and equipment. Additionally, fish and wildlife program
  vehicles are procured under appropriation 5095 with funds generated from the collection of
  hunting, fishing, trapping and other outdoor recreation fees. Vehicles and equipment
  purchased using the 5095 appropriation, and vehicles purchased with 3080 appropriation
  funds that were reimbursed from agricultural or forestry proceeds, are reimbursable program
  assets and may not be used for other purposes. (T-0).
     16.3.6.1. Installations identify Reimbursable Conservation Program vehicle and
     equipment requirements, and will submit requests to AFCEC/CZ for replacement or new
     procurement by 31 July each year for the upcoming fiscal year. (T-2).
     16.3.6.2. AFCEC/CZ reviews vehicle and equipment requests for technical sufficiency,
     determines whether excess equipment from another installation may be available to meet
     the need, and includes vehicle and equipment procurement requests in the consolidated

                                          Chapter 17

      PUBLIC AWARENESS AND INVOLVEMENT IN NATURAL RESOURCES
                             PROGRAMS

17.1. Public Awareness and Involvement in Natural Resources Program. The installation or
AFCEC works with the installation Public Affairs office to establish an ongoing natural
resources Public Affairs program.
   17.1.1. In collaboration with the installation Public Affairs office, establish the appropriate
   venues to satisfy public notice requirements for Integrated Natural Resources Management
   Plans or other environmental documents made available for public review, and the
   appropriate timelines for receiving public comments. (T-2).
   17.1.2. The INRMP will identify appropriate public awareness programs necessary to
   achieve INRMP goals and objectives, such as the need to protect sensitive species or avoid
   dangerous human-wildlife conflicts. Incorporate essential environmental and natural
   resources awareness into newcomer’s orientation briefings and other appropriate information
   forums. The INRMP may also identify the programs and events that would be used to
   heighten public awareness of natural resources conservation, such as National Hunting and
   Fishing Day, Earth Day, or National Arbor Day. (T-3).
   17.1.3. Submit news information through the installation Public Affairs office using
   appropriate traditional and social media platforms to publicize installation efforts in
   integrated natural resources management, and outdoor recreation opportunities such as
   hunting, fishing, or a designated Watchable Wildlife Area. (T-3).
   17.1.4. Installations may develop environmental education programs in cooperation with the
   Services Directorate Outdoor Recreation program, local educational institutions,
   conservation organizations, and other public service agencies. (T-3).
17.2. Public Access to Air Force Land and Water Areas.
   17.2.1. Public Access for Outdoor Recreation. The Installation Commander, in consultation
   with Security Forces, Safety Office, and Judge Advocate, determines the extent of access on
   all areas designated in the INRMP as suitable for outdoor recreation. Allow use of outdoor
   recreation resources by the general public when such use is deemed by the commander to be
   compatible with the military mission. Access determinations should address the permissible
   types of activities, season of access, mission sensitivities, and permissible category of user
   (see 7.2.3). (T-1).
   17.2.2. Public Access to Support Natural Resources Program Goals. The Installation
   Commander, or designated representative, may grant access to federal and state officials and
   academic researchers to provide technical assistance to the AF, or to conduct academic
   research on installation natural resources. Access related to partnering efforts with other
   federal agencies, state agencies, conservation organizations, and individuals can be permitted
   under conditions where such activities adhere to pertinent mission, security, safety, and legal
   restrictions. Researchers may collect plants, animals, mineral, or fossils on installation lands
   for valid scientific purposes when compatible with the INRMP, military operations
   requirements, and with the required federal or state permits. (T-3).
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    63


17.3. Special Natural Areas. Areas on AF installations that contain natural resources that
warrant special protection efforts may, where consistent with the military mission, be designated
in the INRMP as a Special Natural Area. Special Natural Areas may include botanical areas,
ecological reserves, geological areas, riparian zones, scenic areas, and zoological reserves. The
INRMP will identify applicable access and land-use restrictions for each designated area. A
Special Natural area designation in an INRMP is a temporary status that is applicable for the
period covered by the INRMP, and can be rescinded by order of the Installation Commander at
any time. Such areas will be reassessed if the military mission requirements of the installation
change, during any installation realignment or closure action involving the property, or if the
property becomes excess and requires disposal.
17.4. Special Restrictions for Disclosing Natural Resources Information. An installation
may determine that the disclosure of information on the location or character of sensitive natural
resources may create a substantial risk of harm, theft, or destruction of such resources, an
invasion of privacy, trespass on Government property, or interfere with the military mission. In
such cases, the installation will ensure that documents and other data voluntarily provided to the
public do not disclose this information. Denial of requests for information under the Freedom of
Information Act, Title 5, U.S.C. § 552, as amended by P.L. 104-231, must meet the criteria for
appropriate exemptions stated in DoD Regulation 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act
Program, 4 September1998, and the Air Force supplement to DoD Regulation 5400.7,
Department of Defense Freedom of Information Act Program. (T-0).

Chapter 8 - Management Goals and Objectives. The emphasis of an INRMP shall be on the
achievement of certain goals for the maintenance and improvement of the natural environment at
the installation. Chapter 8 lists the goals and objectives for future natural resources management
on the installation. Also, in cases where off-installation land uses may jeopardize AF missions,
Chapter 8 may list specific goals and objectives aimed at eliminating, reducing or mitigating the
effects of encroachment on military missions. Previous chapters present the important
background information from which the goals and objectives are formed. Chapter 8 states the
natural resources management goals for the future that have been formulated by the preparers of
the INRMP from an assessment of the natural resources, current condition of those resources,
mission requirements, and management issues identified in the previous chapters. Chapter 8
shall include the integrated goals for the entire natural resources program. Consecutively
numbered goals are accompanied by supporting objectives and projects in a tiered format as
 84                                                          AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014


shown in the example below. The relationship between goals, objectives, and projects is as
follows:
Goals. Goals are the primary focal points for the implementation of the INRMP. A goal should
reflect the values of the installation by expressing a vision of a desired condition for the
installation's natural resources in the foreseeable future. The intent is determination of
approximately 4-5 over-arching programmatic goals for the entire natural resources program.
Each goal is supported by one or more objectives.
Objectives. Each goal is supported by objectives which indicate a management initiative or
strategy that will be used to achieve the stated goal. An objective specifically states what will be
done and a target date for completion.
Projects. Projects (or Tasks) are the individual component actions required to achieve an
objective. Project statements describe the specific methods and procedures that will be used (i.e.
scopes of work) to achieve the objective supported. The project statement, therefore, must
include quantifiable units for measuring results (e.g. acres treated, recurring projects should
include the specific increment within the Chapter 10 work plan for the year in which the work is
to occur). Projects are actions that become line item requirements in proposed budgets for
INRMP implementation. Projects must be achievable within the period covered by the INRMP.
Example – Goal with Supporting Objectives and Projects. In the example shown below,
note how the format (goal>objective>project) facilitates an integrated approach to natural
resource management. By using this approach, it can be shown how measurable objectives can
be used to assess the attainment of goals, and how individual work tasks support INRMP
objectives. The projects are key elements of the annual work plans and are programmed into the
conservation budget.
GOAL 1: MAXIMIZE FUNCTIONALITY OF NATIVE ECOSYSTEMS ON BASE.
OBJECTIVE 1.1: Improve and expand existing nesting habitat for deep woods and interior
neotropical migrant bird species.
PROJECT 1.1.1: Conduct avian surveys on all contiguous forested tracts greater than 500

and at least four succeeding years. For each project and activity, provide a specific timeframe
for implementation (as applicable), identify appropriate funding source, and specify priority for
implementation. The work plans should be able to provide all the necessary information for
building a budget within the AF framework. Priorities are defined as follows:
–High: Project is essential for achieving INRMP goals and objectives in the year it is
programmed. Sikes Act cooperating agencies would consider the INRMP to not be implemented
if the project is not accomplished.

–Medium: Sikes Act cooperating agencies agree project is important to achieve INRMP goals
and objectives, but project may be deferred if not completed in programmed year.
–Low: Project enhances the natural resources program and supports INRMP, but cooperating
agency partners would agree that the activity is not deemed essential to implement INRMP goals
and objectives.

 COORDINATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR INRMP DEVELOPMENT AND
                          REVISION

The following table provides the required steps for the preparation, coordination, and approval of
an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan on Air Force installations. Refer to Chapter 2
and Attachment 2 for additional guidance on INRMP development and implementation.


 STEP     ACTION
 1        Notification – Intent to Prepare/Revise an INRMP. Notify the USFWS Ecological
          Services Field Office, USFWS Regional Office, local state fish and wildlife (F&W)
          agency office, office of the state F&W agency Director, and all appropriate internal
          and external stakeholders of the intent to prepare or revise an INRMP within 30 days
          of starting such an action. Also notify the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
          Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) if the
          installation includes or is adjacent to marine environments. Develop a time schedule
          for INRMP review and coordination by cooperating agencies and the public. If formal
          consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is required, the time
          frames for that process will apply.
 2        Preliminary Draft INRMP – Internal AF Review. Distribute a Preliminary Draft
          INRMP for internal Air Force review and comment. Air Force internal review must
          include a review by the installation chain of command and by the AFCEC Installation
          Support Team. The Preliminary Draft INRMP shall include the first iteration of goal
          and objective statements for the INRMP.
 3        Preliminary Draft INRMP – External Agency Review. After incorporation of internal
          AF review comments on the Preliminary Draft INRMP, send the Preliminary Draft
          INRMP with cover letter to the appropriate USFWS Ecological Services Field Office
          (and NOAA Fisheries when appropriate), and state fish and wildlife agency for review
          and comment. In the cover letter, designate an installation point of contact, and
          request receipt of comments by a specified date (as determined in Step 1). Send a
          copy of the forwarding cover letter to the appointed Sikes Act Coordinator at the
          USFWS Regional Office (and NOAA Fisheries Regional Office when appropriate),
          and state clearing house if available, to inform them that the review process has
          begun. Ensure that copies of any external agency comments are distributed to all
          cooperating agencies.
 4        Draft INRMP. Prepare a Draft INRMP that incorporates accepted recommendations
          for improvement to the Preliminary Draft INRMP review.
 5        Draft INRMP – Public Review. New and revised INRMPs require that the public be
          given the opportunity of review and comment. Simple annual updates do not require a
          public comment period. In collaboration with the installation Public Affairs office,
          post a public notification when the draft INRMP is available for review and comment.
          In the public notice, provide an address for public response, and allow the public a
          minimum of 30 days to provide comments.
AFI32-7064 18 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 91



 6     Final Draft INRMP. Consider all comments received and incorporate them, as
       appropriate, into a Final Draft INRMP. Submit the Final Draft INRMP concurrently
       to the local USFWS Ecological Services and to the USFWS Regional Office Sikes
       Act Coordinator. Also send to the Director of the state fish and wildlife agency
       Regional Director of NOAA Fisheries when appropriate. In the submittal letter,
       document the actions taken on comments received on previous drafts. Request that
       the USFWS Regional Director and state agency Director provide consolidated written
       comments from all appropriate offices and divisions within 60 days of receipt of the
       final draft INRMP.
 7     Final Coordination Comments. The USFWS Regional Office (and NOAA Fisheries
       Regional Office when appropriate) and the Director of the state fish and wildlife
       office provides written comments on the Final Draft INRMP to the installation point
       of contact within the agreed upon timeline.
 8     Final INRMP. Consider all comments received from coordinating agencies and
       incorporate them into the Final INRMP as appropriate. If no final comments are
       received from the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries, and state after a period of 120 days, the
       installation may request expedited review of its INRMP. In such cases, the AFCEC
       Installation Support Team Office will submit a written request for expedited review to
       the USFWS Regional Director (and NOAA Fisheries Regional Director when
       appropriate) and Director of the state fish and wildlife agency, with copy furnished to
       HQ USAF/A4CF. HQ USAF/A4CF will make arrangements for representatives from
       these offices to meet within 30 days of receipt of such a request to resolve any
       outstanding coordination issues.
 9     Signatures. The Installation Commander, and the designated signatory authorities of
       the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency sign the Final INRMP. The Regional
       Director of NOAA Fisheries also signs the document when appropriate.
10     Publishing. Unclassified portions of the final INRMP will be made available
       electronically via the internet or other similar means. All draft and final INRMP
       documents should undergo appropriate security review prior to being made available
       to the public.
