                                                 Chapter 2

          IMPLEMENTING INTEGRATED NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

2.1. Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan. The INRMP is the principal tool for managing
military installation natural resources. Each military installation in the United States under the jurisdiction
of the Secretary of Defense must prepare and implement an INRMP unless a determination is made that
the absence of significant natural resources makes preparation of such a plan inappropriate (see 2.2.).
INRMPs will be prepared to assist the installation commander with the conservation and rehabilitation of
natural resources consistent with the use of the installation to ensure the readiness of the Armed Forces.
The INRMP will define natural resources management goals and objectives that are consistent with the
military mission and ensure no net loss in the capability of installation lands to support the military mis-
sion. Attachment 2 provides guidelines for INRMP preparation.

2.2. Determining the Need for an INRMP. MAJCOMs must determine the need for an INRMP based
on Category I and II criteria, as defined below. The MAJCOM makes the final decision on whether an
INRMP is required. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the state fish and wildlife
management agency should be consulted when determining if sufficient natural resources exist to warrant
an INRMP.
   2.2.1. Category I Criteria: Category I installations require an INRMP. Category I installations are
   those that have natural resources requiring protection and management, such as habitat for protected
   species, aquatic resources, or any habitat that is suitable for conserving and managing wildlife. An
   INRMP will normally be required if an installation undertakes more than one of the following activi-
   ties: threatened or endangered species protection and management; fish and wildlife management; a
   hunting and fishing program; forest management; agriculture and grazing leases; natural
   resources-based outdoor recreation; or on-the-ground military operations. Installation size (acreage)
   should not be used as the sole determining factor in deciding the need for an INRMP.
   2.2.2. Category II Criteria: Category II installations do not require an INRMP. Category II installa-
   tions are deemed exempt from the INRMP requirement because of a limited natural resources land
   base and the absence of significant natural resources. Consult with USFWS and appropriate state nat-
   ural resource management agencies when determining whether significant natural resources exist.
   Installations including or bordering marine environments must also consult with the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries). The Secre-
   tary of the Air Force, or delegated authority (MAJCOM), determines Category II status. The installa-
   tion or wing commander must request MAJCOM approval for Category II status in writing with
   supporting justification.

2.3. Cooperative INRMP Preparation. Prepare INRMPs in cooperation with the USFWS and the
appropriate state fish and wildlife agency for the state in which the military installation is located. Coor-
dination with the NOAA Fisheries is also required for installations that include or border marine environ-
ments. Invite the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries (if applicable), and the state fish and wildlife agency to
participate in the scoping, design, and preparation of the INRMP. Attachment 3 specifies the required
coordination and approval process and timeline for cooperative INRMP preparation.
   2.3.1. MAJCOM Review. MAJCOMs will be provided the opportunity to review and comment on
   draft INRMP documents prior to release for public review.
10                                                                   AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


     2.3.2. Public Review. Provide an opportunity for the public to review a draft INRMP document and
     provide comments. Public notification must be made when a draft INRMP is available for comment.
     The USFWS, NOAA Fisheries (if applicable), and state fish and wildlife agency must be given the
     opportunity to review all public comments received on an INRMP.
     2.3.3. Mutual Agreement. The INRMP will reflect the mutual agreement of the USFWS and state
     concerning the conservation, protection, and management of fish and wildlife resources and federally
     listed threatened and endangered species. Mutual agreement will be the goal with respect to the entire
     INRMP. However, mutual agreement is required only with respect to those elements of the INRMP
     that are subject to the jurisdictional authority of the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries as specified by law
     (e.g. Endangered Species Act), or the inherent rights of the state to conserve, protect, and manage fish
     and wildlife resources.
        2.3.3.1. Establishment of Mutual Agreement. Mutual agreement, with respect to those elements
        of the INRMP concerning the jurisdictional authority of the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries, and state
        will be considered attained only upon receipt of signature or written concurrence from all of the
        following persons:
            2.3.3.1.1. Installation or wing commander.
            2.3.3.1.2. Regional Director for the USFWS (Exception: California/Nevada Operations Man-
            ager for installations in those states) or NOAA Fisheries.
            2.3.3.1.3. Director of the state fish and wildlife agency.
        2.3.3.2. Failure to Reach Mutual Agreement. In cases where the USFWS or state withholds its
        agreement with an INRMP based on objections to elements of the INRMP that are clearly not
        within the scope of the particular agency's authority, an installation may, notwithstanding the
        objections, finalize the INRMP as specified in Attachment 3 and proceed to manage its natural
        resources in accordance with the terms of the plan.

2.4. INRMP Approval. The installation or wing commander approves and signs the INRMP. The
Regional Director of the USFWS and the Director of the state fish and wildlife agency sign the INRMP to
reflect mutual agreement on those portions of the INRMP within the scope of the agency’s authority. Doc-
ument on the INRMP approval page the coordination of each agency. A final copy of a completed INRMP
or revision will be sent to the USFWS, state, and NOAA Fisheries when appropriate.

2.5. INRMP Implementation. An INRMP is considered to be implemented if an installation:
     2.5.1. Actively requests, receives, and uses funds for Level 0 and Level 1 “must fund” projects and
     activities as defined by AFI 32-7001, Environmental Quality Programming and Budgeting;
     2.5.2. Executes all “must fund” projects and activities in accordance with specific timeframes identi-
     fied in the INRMP;
     2.5.3. Ensures that sufficient numbers of professionally trained natural resources management per-
     sonnel are available to perform the tasks required by the INRMP;
     2.5.4. Reviews the INRMP annually and coordinates annually with cooperating USFWS, NOAA
     Fisheries (when appropriate), and relevant state offices as outlined in 2.6.; and
     2.5.5. Documents specific INRMP accomplishments undertaken each year.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                               11


2.6. Annual INRMP Review and Coordination. Establish and maintain regular communications with
the appropriate federal, state, and installation organizations to address issues concerning implementation
of the INRMP. At a minimum, this shall include an annual review of the INRMP by the installation in
coordination with the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency. The annual review will be certified by
the installation or wing commander, or designee. The annual review will verify that:
   2.6.1. All “must fund” projects and activities have been budgeted for and implementation is on sched-
   ule.
   2.6.2. All required trained natural resources positions are filled or are in the process of being filled.
   2.6.3. Projects and activities for the upcoming year have been identified and included in the INRMP.
   An updated project list does not necessitate revising the INRMP if the goals and objectives remain
   unchanged.
   2.6.4. All required coordinations with the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency have occurred.
   2.6.5. Any significant changes to the installation’s mission requirements or its natural resources have
   been identified.

2.7. INRMP Update. Working in cooperation with the USFWS and the appropriate state fish and wild-
life agency, installations must update the INRMP at least once every five years. Interim updates at an
interval of less than five years would be required in cases where changes in the military mission, new
environmental compliance requirements, or other new information significantly affects the ability of the
installation to implement the INRMP. If the installation mission or its natural resources management
issues change significantly from those outlined in the original plan, an INRMP revision, to include coor-
dination with the USFWS and the appropriate state fish and wildlife agency, will be required. As part of
the INRMP annual review and coordination process (see 2.6.), the installation or wing commander, or
designee, will make the determination if an INRMP revision is required.

2.8. Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) and INRMP Implementation. A c t i o n s p r o -
posed in an INRMP may constitute a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act,
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. (NEPA). Major federal actions, as defined in Title 40, Code of Federal Regula-
tions, Part, 1508.18 (b) (2) Major Federal Action, must be evaluated for potential environmental effects in
accordance with Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process
(EIAP).

2.9. Ecosystem Management. The INRMP implements ecosystem management on AF installations by
setting goals for attaining a desired land condition. When preparing or revising an INRMP, consider the
ecosystem management principles and guidelines in DODI 4715.3, Environmental Conservation Pro-
gram, and the guidance provided herein.
   2.9.1. Air Force Principles for Ecosystem Management.
       2.9.1.1. Maintain or restore native ecosystem types across their natural range where practical and
       consistent with the military mission.
       2.9.1.2. Maintain or restore ecological processes such as fire and other disturbance regimes where
       practical and consistent with the military mission.
12                                                                  AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


        2.9.1.3. Maintain or restore the hydrological processes in streams, floodplains, and wetlands
        when feasible.
        2.9.1.4. Use regional approaches to implement ecosystem management on an installation by col-
        laboration with other DoD components as well as other federal, state and local agencies, and
        adjoining property owners.
        2.9.1.5. Provide for outdoor recreation, agricultural production, harvesting of forest products, and
        other practical utilization of the land and its resources, provided that such use does not inflict
        long-term ecosystem damage or negatively impact the AF mission.
     2.9.2. Biodiversity Conservation. Biodiversity conservation is an integral part of ecosystem manage-
     ment. Maintain or reestablish viable populations of all native species on AF-controlled lands when
     practical and consistent with the military mission.
     2.9.3. Exotic and Invasive Species Control. Identify the presence of exotic and invasive species, and
     implement programs to control and/or eradicate those species from AF installations. Develop joint
     control strategies with other federal, state, and local cooperating agencies and adjacent landowners to
     increase the effectiveness of control measures.
     2.9.4. Natural Heritage Program Support. Identify through surveys and/or consultation with organiza-
     tions such as The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI),
     and state Natural Heritage Program office, those natural communities and species listed in the ABI
     database (http://www.natureserve.org) as Heritage Status Rank G1 through G3, N1 through N3, and
     S1 through S3. Develop and implement management strategies oriented toward the conservation of
     those species and communities when practical and consistent with the military mission.

2.10. Staffing. Installations will use professionally trained natural resources management personnel to
develop, implement and enforce their INRMPs.
     2.10.1. Outsourcing Natural Resources Management. As stipulated in the Sikes Act, 16 U.S.C. 670 et.
     seq., the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76, Performance of Commercial Activi-
     ties, August 4, 1983 (Revised June 14, 1999) does not apply to the development, implementation and
     enforcement of INRMPs. When it is not practicable to utilize DoD personnel to perform natural
     resources management duties, priority will be given to obtaining these services from federal or state
     agencies having responsibilities for the conservation and management of natural resources. Document
     the effort to obtain federal or state services in writing before seeking non-governmental assistance.
     2.10.2. Use of Non-Appropriated Fund Personnel. Non-Appropriated Fund personnel and resources
     may be utilized to assist in the implementation of natural resources management programs. In such
     cases, supervision and control of natural resources management programs will remain under the des-
     ignated natural resources program manager for the installation.
     2.10.3. Wildland Fire and Conservation Law Enforcement. Title 10, United States Code, Section
     2465 prohibits contracts for performance of firefighting or security guard functions, with some excep-
     tions. As such, contractors will not perform firefighting or law enforcement as a primary task unless
     an exception to 10 U.S.C. 2465 applies.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                               13


2.11. Integration of Natural Resources Management with Other Air Force Programs.
   2.11.1. Integration with Other Environmental Programs. Coordinate draft INRMPs and revisions
   through the installation Environmental Protection Committee (EPC) and BASH working group.
   Ensure that the INRMP, Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan, Bird/Wildlife Strike Hazard
   (BASH) Plan, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Plan, and Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
   (AICUZ) studies are mutually supportive and not in conflict.
   2.11.2. Integration with the Comprehensive Planning Process. The INRMP is a key component plan
   of the Base Comprehensive Plan as detailed in AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning. The
   INRMP identifies natural resource features that need to be considered and incorporated into the Base
   Comprehensive Plan, General Plan, element plans, and other component plans and studies regarding
   future installation development.
   2.11.3. Integration with EIAP. The installation manager for natural resources will collaborate with the
   EIAP manager to ensure that any activities that may affect natural resources are reviewed in accor-
   dance with 32 CFR Part 989.

2.12. Preventing Natural Resources Damage from Air Force Activities. Prior to initiation of any new
construction activity, the installation proponent for natural resources will coordinate on all Certificates of
Compliance for Critical Planning Actions prepared in accordance with AFI 32-1021, Planning and Pro-
gramming of Facility Construction Projects. Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) operations con-
ducted in accordance with AFI 32-7020, The Environmental Restoration Program must include plans to
mitigate potential damage to natural resources from restoration activities.

2.13. Assessing Natural Resources Damage by Other Parties. In the event that natural resources
under AF control are damaged by another party, such as an accidental spill of a hazardous substance, the
installation incurring the damage must assess and claim damages. Refer to Title 43, Code of Federal Reg-
ulations, Part 11, Natural Resource Damage Assessments for guidance on claiming damages. Recovered
funds must be used to restore, replace, or acquire equivalent natural resources on the installation where
the damage occurred. Installations must coordinate with their MAJCOM, SAF/IE and AFLSA/JACE dur-
ing the claims process.

2.14. Natural Resources Program Assessments. Internal and external assessments of natural resources
programs will be conducted as a part of the Environmental Safety and Occupational Health Compliance
Assessment and Management Program (ESOHCAMP), as outlined in AFI 32-7045, Environmental Com-
pliance Assessment and Management Program. Assessment protocols can be found at
http://www.denix.osd.mil/cenix/DOD/Library/Assessment/tools.htm. Attachment 1 provides a list of
applicable natural resources laws and regulations.

2.15. Recognition of Outstanding Natural Resources Management. The AF General Thomas D.
White and the Secretary of Defense environmental awards program recognizes outstanding individual and

                                                  Chapter 3

                                                WETLANDS

3.1. Protection of Wetlands. In compliance with Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, May
24, 1977, the AF will seek to preserve the natural values of wetlands while carrying out its mission on
both AF lands and non-AF lands. To the maximum extent practicable, the AF will avoid actions which
would either destroy or adversely modify wetlands. The AF will fully disclose the location of wetlands,
and any land-use restrictions imposed by regulatory authority, on lands that are transferred or sold to
non-federal entities.

3.2. Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 Compliance. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Title 33,
United States Code, Section 401, establishes a program to regulate activities affecting navigable waters of
the United States. Section 10 of the Act (Title 33, United States Code, Section 403) directs that proponents
must obtain a Section 10 permit administered by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for con-
struction, excavation, or deposition of materials in, over, or under navigable waters, or for any work
which would affect the course, location, condition, or capacity of those waters. Activities requiring Sec-
tion 10 permits include structures (e.g., piers, wharves, breakwaters, bulkheads, jetties, weirs, transmis-
sion lines) and work such as dredging or disposal of dredged material, or excavation, filling, or other
modifications to the navigable waters of the United States. Contact the USACE prior to construction or
other activities that may affect open water habitats to determine if a Section 10 permit is required.

3.3. Clean Water Act (CWA) Compliance.
     3.3.1. Section 404. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (Title 33, United States Code, Section 1344)
     establishes a program to regulate all dredging and filling activities related to jurisdictional waters and
     wetlands of the United States. Actions that may impact wetlands, to include dredging, filling, and
     activities that may displace soil into a wetland, may require a 404 permit from the USACE. Submit
     USACE ENG Form 4345, Application for Department of the Army Permit to the appropriate USACE
     District Engineer prior to any land disturbance activity located in or near a wetland area. Along with
     the permit application, submit a vicinity map and site development plan that includes a cross-sectional
     view of the affected area showing limits of jurisdictional waters, the normal water level, volume of fill
     material to be discharged below ordinary high water, and the area of waters affected.
     3.3.2. Section 401. Section 401 of the CWA directs that any proponent of an action that requires a fed-
     eral license or permit (such as a Section 404 permit) must obtain a Water Quality Certificate from the
     state water pollution control agency. The Water Quality Certificate certifies that the action complies
     with state water quality criteria. State permits to undertake projects within a specified buffer zone sur-
     rounding wetlands may also be required. When applying for a permit under state wetland protection
     laws, certain information not required for an USACE permit, such as a delineation of a regulated
     buffer area, may also be required. In some cases, permit applications may be submitted concurrently
     for review by both the state and the USACE.

3.4. Baseline Wetlands Inventory. Develop and maintain current inventories of wetland areas on all
lands under AF control. At a minimum, the inventory will consist of a baseline survey that classifies and
maps wetland areas in a manner consistent with the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) program man-
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                            15


aged by the USFWS. NWI data/maps are not adequate for project-level planning and do not constitute a
boundary delineation that is adequate for obtaining a CWA section 404 permit.

3.5. Jurisdictional Wetlands Delineation. Jurisdictional wetlands are those wetlands that fulfill the
three criteria (vegetation, soils, and hydrology) as described in the Wetland Delineation Manual (USACE,
1987). The AF will refer to and accept as determinative the current USACE definitions for wetlands under
USACE jurisdiction. The proponent of any activity that may affect known or suspected wetlands is
required to conduct a jurisdictional wetland delineation. Jurisdictional wetland delineations will be per-
formed using methods approved by the USACE. Delineations are valid for a limited period of time, as
established by the USACE District Regulatory Office, or whenever a change in definition or delineation
methodology alters the demarcation. On installations with jurisdictional wetlands, the INRMP must
include long-term monitoring of trends in habitat values as well as plans for wetland restoration and
enhancement.

3.6. EIAP for Actions that May Affect Wetlands.
   3.6.1. Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA). Prior to any construction activity in a wetland
   area (as defined by E. O. 11990), proponents must first prepare a Finding of No Practicable Alterna-
   tive, which documents that there are no practicable alternatives to such construction, and that the pro-
   posed action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm to wetlands. In preparing the
   FONPA, the AF must consider the full range of practicable alternatives that will meet the proposed
   mission requirements. SAF/IE or delegated authority signs a Finding of No Practicable Alternative.
   Environmental Restoration Program projects on wetland sites that are conducted under the regulatory
   authority of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
   of 1980, as amended, (Title 42, United States Code, Sections 9601-9675) do not require a FONPA.
   3.6.2. EIAP Decision Documents. Proposed actions that could impact wetlands, even if the affected
   area is not within a jurisdictional wetland boundary, require an environmental impact analysis in
   accordance with NEPA and the Air Force EIAP at 32 CFR Part 989. A FONPA must be completed
   prior to signature on a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or Record of Decision (ROD) doc-
   ument. The proposed action must include all practicable measures to minimize harm to wetlands. The
   EIAP must document Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act compliance, permit actions, and
   any mitigation actions required as a condition of a permit.
   3.6.3. Coastal Zone Management Act Consistency. Proposed actions in wetlands may require a
   Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination. Refer to Chapter 5 for further guidance.

3.7. Wetland Mitigation Banks. A wetland mitigation bank is a wetland area that is currently being
restored, enhanced, or created, and set aside to compensate for future actions that may negatively impact
other wetlands within the same watershed and provide like (in-kind) wetland functions. Development of
wetlands mitigation banks is encouraged when practicable as a cost-effective method to reduce the uncer-
tainty and delays that may be associated with mitigation requirements for future installation development.
A wetland bank is established by means of a formal agreement with the Army Corps of Engineers or other
appropriate regulatory agency(ies) enacted prior to nomination of a wetland to the program. The value of
a bank is determined through cooperation with the regulating agency to quantify the wetland values
restored, enhanced, or created in terms of credits.

                                                 Chapter 4

                                              FLOODPLAINS

4.1. Floodplain Protection. Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, May 24, 1977, requires
all federal agencies to provide leadership and take action to reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize the
impacts of floods on human safety, health, and welfare; and restore and preserve the natural and beneficial
values of floodplains when acquiring, managing, or disposing of federal lands.

4.2. Floodplain Boundary Determination. To determine whether AF lands or a proposed action occurs
in a floodplain, use the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps distributed by the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA). If NFIP maps do not cover the affected area, ensure that the flood
plain map contours are prepared by a professional engineer. Provide a copy of new floodplain map con-
tours and associated survey data to the NFIP.

4.3. Assessment of Proposed Actions within a Floodplain.
     4.3.1. EIAP for Actions that May Affect Floodplains. Installations must evaluate the potential effects
     of any proposed actions in a floodplain. For major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of
     the human environment, the evaluation must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act.
     Refer to 32 CFR Part 989 for EIAP guidance.
     4.3.2. Actions that Alter Floodplain Hydrology. If an action is taken within a floodplain that perma-
     nently alters the flood hazard delineations on a NFIP map, the installation must submit an analysis
     reflecting those changes to FEMA. Refer to FEMA booklet MT-2, Revisions to National Flood Insur-
     ance Program Maps for further guidance.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                             17


                                                Chapter 5

                              COASTAL AND MARINE RESOURCES

5.1. Protection of Coastal and Marine Resources. The AF will conserve and protect all coastal and
marine resources whenever feasible as part of the overall natural resources management program.

5.2. Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) Compliance. The Coastal Zone Management Act (Title
16 United States Code, Sections 1451-1462) authorizes coastal states to establish a Coastal Zone Manage-
ment Program (CZMP) to coordinate state, local, and federal programs of the management of coastal
areas. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource
Management administers the program at the federal level. Once a state’s program is federally approved,
the CZMA allows participating states to set goals and procedures that control the use and development of
designated Coastal Zones.
   5.2.1. Applicability. A Coastal Zone is the area specified or delineated by a state within its federally
   approved Coastal Zone Management Program. All AF activities, operations, projects, and programs
   that affect any lands, water use or natural resources of a state’s Coastal Zone must be consistent to the
   maximum extent practicable with the state CZMP. For AF installations within a Coastal Zone man-
   agement area, the INRMP should specifically address how activities and operations will be consistent
   with the state CZMP.
   5.2.2. Federal Consistency Determination. Installation or wing commanders must prepare a Federal
   Consistency Determination for consistency with the state CZMP for any activity, regardless of loca-
   tion, that is likely to affect any land, water, or natural resource of a Coastal Zone in the reasonably
   foreseeable future. After coordination with the state CZMP agency, and making appropriate changes
   to the proposed action, the installation will submit a Federal Consistency Determination to the appro-
   priate state agency (e.g. Coastal Zone Coordination Council) at least 90 days before final approval of
   the proposed action, unless otherwise agreed upon. The state will produce a federal consistency
   review response indicating whether or not the state concurs with the determination. The state response
   will become part of the EIAP documentation for the proposed project.

5.3. Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 Compliance. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Title 16
United States Code, Sections 3501-3510) regulates the expenditure of federal funds to discourage devel-
opment within boundaries of undeveloped, unprotected coastal barriers (such as a bay barrier, barrier spit,
or barrier island) on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, as identified in the Coastal Barriers Resources System
maps established by the Act. Federal funds may be used for permissible activities listed in 16 U.S.C.
3505, which include national security related military actions and the management, protection and
enhancement of natural resources, and maintenance of existing structures for navigation and shoreline sta-
bilization. Consult with the USFWS when planning activities and operations that may impact lands iden-
tified in the Coastal Barriers Resources System.

5.4. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 Compliance. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of
1972 (Title 16, United States Code, Sections 1361 - 1421(h)) protects marine mammals, their critical hab-
itat, and migratory routes. Installations with marine resources must address the protection of marine mam-
mals in the INRMP and must submit the INRMP to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service for review. Any action undertaken by the AF, to
18                                                                    AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


include activities that generate noise, must first assess the potential impacts on marine mammals. Installa-
tions whose activities may impact marine mammals must coordinate the proposed actions with NOAA
Fisheries.

5.5. Coral Reef Protection. Executive Order 13089, Coral Reef Protection, June 11, 1998 directs the
protection of all coral reef ecosystems, to include those species, habitats, and other natural resources asso-
ciated with coral reefs within all maritime areas and zones subject to the jurisdiction or control of the
United States (e.g., federal, state, territorial, or commonwealth waters). Installations will identify all coral
reefs and related endemic mangrove and sea grass ecosystems in the INRMP. Installations with these pro-
tected ecosystems must address the conservation and management of these habitats in the INRMP.

5.6. Coastal America Initiative. The AF has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding Between the
Army, Navy, five other Federal Departments and the Council on Environmental Quality in the Executive
Office of the President to coordinate and cooperate in the restoration and protection of coastal areas.
Under the Coastal America Initiative agreement, the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence,
Eastern Regional Environmental Office (AFCEE/CCR-A) is responsible for maintaining Coastal America
program guidance for distribution and implementation. Air Force installations within coastal areas must
incorporate Coastal America goals within the Installation Natural Resources Management Plan; and must
annually report to the Regional Implementation Team on the status of projects to comply with the Coastal
America goals. Coastal America goals must be considered in the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
planning process. As part of the Coastal America Initiative, the AF will support, when feasible, regional
programs such as the Gulf of Mexico Program and the Chesapeake Bay Program.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                             19


                                                Chapter 6

                              FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

6.1. Wildlife Management Programs on Air Force Lands. The INRMP will address the management
of game and non-game fish and wildlife on AF installations. The INRMP will be prepared in cooperation
with the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries (for installations that include or are adjacent to marine environments),
and the appropriate state fish and wildlife agency. The resulting plan will reflect the mutual agreement of
the installation and the cooperating agencies for the conservation, protection, and management of wildlife
resources (see 2.3.).

6.2. Hunting, Fishing, Trapping and Outdoor Recreation Programs.
   6.2.1. Program Management. Hunting, fishing, trapping and dispersed outdoor recreation programs
   are appropriate when they are consistent with INRMP goals for natural resources management. Fish
   and game harvests must comply with all federal and state laws and regulations, and will be consistent
   with DoD principles for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. The designated instal-
   lation natural resources manager is responsible for direction and oversight of hunting and fishing pro-
   grams. Administrative and management costs associated with hunting, fishing, trapping and the
   management of outdoor recreation access must be fully reimbursed by user fees. Installations may uti-
   lize the voluntary assistance of others to help manage hunting and fishing programs, to include the Air
   Force Services Agency or non-AF affiliated clubs (e.g. Rod and Gun Club); but organizations outside
   the installation chain of command shall not direct policy on hunting, fishing, trapping and outdoor rec-
   reation. Program support provided by the Air Force Services Agency may be reimbursed from user
   fees.
   6.2.2. Fee Collection. Hunting, fishing, trapping and outdoor recreation access fees are collected by
   the installation and deposited into the AF account for fish and wildlife management (57 5095). The
   INRMP will address the installation rules and procedures for the collection of fees for hunting, fish-
   ing, trapping and access to outdoor recreation areas by class (see 10.1.). Use DoD Form 1131, Cash
   Collection Voucher to record fee collections; and submit collections to the appropriate accounting and
   finance office. If the Air Force Services Agency or other organization assists the natural resources
   management program office with the collection of user fees, any administrative fees charged must be
   accounted for separately from fees collected into the 57 5095 appropriation. In such case, the permit
   issued must identify the portion of the fee payment that represents the seller’s administrative charge.
   Upon termination of a fee collection program for hunting, fishing, trapping, or outdoor recreation,
   installations must notify the MAJCOM and the collection account will be closed.
   6.2.3. Access and Participation. The INRMP will address the specific rules and procedures for autho-
   rized participation and access to AF installations for hunting, fishing, trapping and outdoor recreation
   on unimproved lands. The INRMP will identify access areas by category and the authorized partici-
   pants for each access area using the criteria established below. A commander may restrict or exclude
   hunting, fishing and trapping if such activity is not compatible with the military mission. When access
   is denied to the general public, that determination will be explained in the INRMP.
       6.2.3.1. Access Categories. Installations with unimproved lands will identify in the INRMP the
       availability of lands, by access category, for hunting, fishing, trapping and other dispersed outdoor
       recreation activities. The INRMP will establish the criteria used to designate lands into each
20                                                                  AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


        access category, and must identify how access category designations may change with each Force
        Protection Condition (Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta) imposed on the installation. There
        are three basic access categories.
            6.2.3.1.1. Open Areas. Unrestricted areas on the installation where hunting, fishing, trapping
            and outdoor recreation are permitted to all participants.
            6.2.3.1.2. Restricted Areas. Areas designated by the commander where hunting, fishing, trap-
            ping and outdoor recreation are permitted to certain categories of participants or under special
            arrangements as defined by the commander. The INRMP must state the rationale by which
            access to an area is limited to certain categories of participants.
            6.2.3.1.3. Off Limits Areas. Areas designated by the commander as being off limits to recre-
            ational hunting, fishing, trapping and dispersed outdoor recreation by any person at any time.
            These are areas where mission security and safety concerns will not allow such use.
        6.2.3.2. Participant Categories. The INRMP will establish criteria and protocols regarding user
        access and conduct for open and restricted access areas for the following categories of partici-
        pants:
            6.2.3.2.1. Active Duty Military (includes Reserve and National Guard on active duty or full
            time manning)
            6.2.3.2.2. Department of Defense Civilians
            6.2.3.2.3. Active Duty Military Dependents and Family Members
            6.2.3.2.4. Military Retirees
            6.2.3.2.5. Department of Defense Civilian Retirees
            6.2.3.2.6. Employees of Installation Prime Contractors (defined as a contractor with a five or
            more year term contract).
            6.2.3.2.7. General Public.

6.3. Wildlife Food Plots. Cultivation of food plots for wildlife is not an appropriate activity unless spe-
cifically addressed in the INRMP as necessary to achieve stated wildlife management goals and objec-
tives. Food plots will not be used as a means to support game populations above the normal carrying
capacity of the native habitats.

6.4. Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement. Commanders are responsible for the enforcement of state
and federal fish and game laws on AF installations. Installations with a fishing and hunting program must
address the enforcement of fish and wildlife laws in the INRMP.
     6.4.1. Cooperative Law Enforcement. Commanders will provide reasonable access to federal and
     state conservation officers for the purpose of fish and wildlife law enforcement.
     6.4.2. Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement by Air Force Personnel. The commander may designate
     fish and wildlife law enforcement authority to military or civilian personnel only if the person has
     either been certified in conservation law enforcement through training at the Federal Law Enforce-
     ment Training Center or by commission as a fish and wildlife conservation officer in the state where
     the installation is located. Law enforcement personnel who do not possess either federal or state fish
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                             21


   and wildlife enforcement certification can be used to supplement fish and wildlife law enforcement
   under the supervision of certified personnel.

6.5. Protection of Migratory Birds. The Department of Defense participates in the Federal Part-
ners-in-Flight Program for the conservation of neotropical migratory birds. To the extent permitted by
law, and subject to budgetary limits and mission constraints, the AF will make lands and resources acces-
sible for furtherance of the Federal Partners-in-Flight program, and provide technical expertise for plan-
ning and implementing the program. In accordance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Executive
Order No. 13186, Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds, January 10, 2001,
avoid or minimize the negative impact of AF actions on migratory birds, and take active steps to protect
birds and restore or enhance their habitat whenever possible. This includes preventing or abating pollution
or detrimental alteration of the environment, as practicable, and incorporating migratory bird conserva-
tion into agency planning processes whenever possible. Notify the USFWS if unintentional take of migra-
tory birds, reasonably attributable to AF actions, is having, or is likely to have a measurable negative
effect on migratory bird populations, and implement conservation measures as specified in E.O. 13186,
Section 3(e)(9).

6.6. Wildlife Damage Control.
   6.6.1. Program Management. Installation pest management personnel have primary responsibility for
   the control of nuisance wildlife species, although the program can receive substantial support from
   natural resources management personnel. The installation Integrated Pest Management Plan and Bird/
   Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan will designate the responsibilities for pest management and natu-
   ral resources personnel for the control of nuisance wildlife. Wildlife control objectives and control
   techniques must be addressed in the INRMP.
   6.6.2. Migratory Birds.
       6.6.2.1. Incidental Takes During Military Readiness Activity. In accordance with the 2003
       National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 107-314), Migratory Bird Treaty Act requirements indi-
       cated in Title 16, United States Code, Section 703 shall not apply to the incidental taking of a
       migratory bird by a member of the Armed Forces during a military readiness activity. Incidental
       takes during military readiness activities must conform to the rules and limitations in forthcoming
       regulations for P.L. 107-314. Seek legal advice if uncertain whether an activity qualifies as a mili-
       tary readiness activity.
       6.6.2.2. Intentional Takes of Migratory Birds. Any proposal to intentionally kill, wound, capture,
       or collect a migratory bird requires a migratory bird depredation permit issued by the USFWS in
       accordance with Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 21.41. Depredation of migratory
       birds is also subject to NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and EIAP (32 CFR Part 989). Once a permit
       is issued, installations will maintain records as mandated under the terms of the permit. Appropri-
       ate documentation in accordance with the depredation permit or the EIAP is required.
   6.6.3. Nuisance Wildlife Control.
       6.6.3.1. Wildlife Control in Support of Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Reduction.
       The INRMP and Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan will be mutually supportive and incor-
       porate the guidance within AFI 91-202, USAF Mishap Prevention Program and Air Force Pam-
       phlet (AFPAM) 91-212, BASH Management Techniques. Coordinate draft INRMPs and updates
22                                                                  AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


        with airfield operations and flight safety personnel to ensure conformance with airfield safety cri-
        teria. Request assistance for BASH related wildlife control issues through the MAJCOM from
        BASH team personnel at Headquarters Air Force Safety Agency, Flight Safety Wildlife (AFSA/
        SEFW), 9700 Avenue G, Suite 279A, Building 24499, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5671. See Chap-
        ter 14 for additional BASH program guidance.
        6.6.3.2. Other Nuisance Wildlife Control. Contact the state fish and wildlife agency prior to
        harassing, killing, or trapping nuisance wildlife. Wildlife control activities may require a state
        depredation permit. Activities that affect migratory birds may require a federal permit (see
        6.6.2.2.). Any action that may affect a species listed for protection under the auspices of the
        Endangered Species Act will require consultation with the USFWS (see Chapter 7).
     6.6.4. Emergency Wildlife Control. Emergency wildlife control measures may be warranted if unan-
     ticipated wildlife problems endanger installation operations or threaten public health. MAJCOMs
     must authorize emergency control measures for situations that are not addressed in the INRMP, instal-
     lation Integrated Pest Management Plan or BASH Plan. In such cases, notify the state fish and wildlife
     agency, USFWS, and the Wildlife Services Division of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Ser-
     vice (APHIS) as soon as practicable.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                               23


                                                Chapter 7

                THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES MANAGEMENT

7.1. Endangered Species Act Compliance. The Endangered Species Act (ESA), (Title 16 United States
Code, Sections 1531-1544), requires protection and conservation of federally listed threatened and endan-
gered (T/E) plants and animals and their habitats. Conservation includes the use of all methods and proce-
dures which are necessary to bring any T/E species to the point where the measures pursuant to the ESA
are no longer necessary.
   7.1.1. Federally Listed Species. Installations known to sustain federally listed T/E species or their
   habitats must address T/E species conservation in the INRMP. The INRMP goals and objectives must
   provide an overall ecosystem management strategy for the protection and recovery of T/E species.
   When practical, provide similar protection to plants and animals that are candidate species for protec-
   tion by federal listing.
   7.1.2. State Listed Species. INRMPs will provide for the protection and conservation of state listed
   protected species when practicable. Although not required by the Endangered Species Act, provide
   similar conservation measures for species protected by state law when such protection is not in direct
   conflict with the military mission. When conflicts occur, consult with the appropriate state authority to
   determine if any conservation measures can be feasibly implemented to mitigate impacts.
   7.1.3. Host Nation Protected Species. For installations and AF operations outside the United States
   and its territories, responsibility for protection of host nation protected species will be as specified in
   the Final Governing Standards for the host country.

7.2. Inventory and Monitoring. All installations will conduct a basic reconnaissance survey for the
presence of federally listed T/E species. The survey methodology, scope and species considered in the
inventory will be determined after consultation with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries, depending upon
jurisdiction. Follow-up reconnaissance surveys are required if the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries deter-
mines that a new federally listed species may occur on the installation. Periodic resurveys and monitoring
of known listed species are required if they are stipulated in: (1) the ‘Terms and Conditions’ that imple-
ment the ‘Reasonable and Prudent’ conservation measures rendered in a Biological Opinion from the
USFWS or NOAA Fisheries, (2) a USFWS or NOAA Fisheries Species Recovery Plan, or (3) an INRMP,
coordinated and approved in accordance with the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a-f). All information collected
on military lands and waters that pertains to a federally listed threatened and endangered species will be
shared with the USFWS and/or NOAA Fisheries. If practical, share known information on state listed spe-
cies with the relevant state agency (e.g. state Department of Natural Resources or Natural Heritage Pro-
gram) for inclusion in their biological and conservation database.

7.3. Interagency Consultation and Coordination.
   7.3.1. Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation. When proposed or ongoing actions, including
   the preparation and implementation of an INRMP, may affect a listed species or its habitat, consulta-
   tion with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries under section 7 of the ESA must be performed (see Attach-
   ment 4). Consult with the USFWS for terrestrial species and freshwater aquatic species; and with
   NOAA Fisheries for saltwater fish and marine mammals. Installations must notify the MAJCOM
   when entering into formal consultations under the auspices of the ESA.
24                                                                   AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


     7.3.2. Marine Mammal Protection Act Consultation. Consult with NOAA Fisheries or the USFWS
     when an ongoing or proposed activity, including the preparation and implementation of an INRMP,
     has the potential to impact marine mammals protected under the authority of the Marine Mammal Pro-
     tection Act as specified in Title16, United States Code, Sections 1361-1421h. This is in addition to
     Endangered Species Act consultation requirements.
     7.3.3. INRMP Coordination. All INRMPs and revisions will be sent to the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries
     (if applicable) and to the appropriate state fish and wildlife agency for review, comment, and coordi-
     nation as specified in Attachment 3. Identify by cover letter if the plan submitted for review covers
     the protection and conservation of a federally listed species. If a Biological Opinion has been issued
     as a result of ESA Section 7 consultations, the INRMP becomes the document by which the AF will
     describe the specific programs and activities that will be implemented to satisfy the required terms and
     conditions.
     7.3.4. Environmental Impact Analysis Process Coordination. Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations,
     Chapter V, Council on Environmental Quality, requires all federal agencies to consider the environ-
     mental effects of proposed programs, projects, and actions prior to initiation. Pursuant to the 40 CFR
     Parts 1500-1508, Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and 32 CFR Part 989, proponents of AF
     actions will ensure that federally listed T/E species are fully considered. T/E species must be fully
     considered early in the planning process when preparing a CATEX, EA, or EIS. An Air Force CATEX
     may not be applied if federally listed species are potentially affected. Submit all draft EIAP docu-
     ments to the USFWS and/or NOAA Fisheries for review and comment. Any required ESA Section 7
     consultation must be completed prior to the issuance of any decision action under EIAP. Written doc-
     umentation supporting the coordination and/or consultation with the USFWS or NOAA Fisheries
     must be included in the EIAP document. Copies of the final decision documents (e.g. Record of Deci-
     sion, Finding of No Significant Impact) must be forwarded to the USFWS and NOAA Fisheries when
     federally listed species are involved.

7.4. The INRMP as a Substitute for Critical Habitat Designation. Pursuant to Title 16, United States
Code, Section 1533((1)(3)(B)(i), the Secretary of Interior “shall not designate as critical habitat any lands
or other geographical areas owned or controlled by the DoD, or designated for its use, that are subject to
an integrated natural resources management plan prepared under section 101 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C.
670a), if the Secretary determines in writing that such plan provides a benefit to the species for which crit-
ical habitat is proposed for designation.” Use the criteria presented below to show that the INRMP pro-
vides a benefit to the species and therefore provides adequate special management or protection.
     7.4.1. The INRMP provides a conservation benefit to the species. The cumulative benefits of the
     management activities identified in the INRMP, for the period covered by the INRMP, must maintain
     or provide for an increase in a species’ population, or the enhancement or restoration of its habitat
     within the area covered by the INRMP (i.e., those areas deemed essential to the conservation of the
     species). A conservation benefit may result from reducing fragmentation of habitat, maintaining or
     increasing populations, insuring against catastrophic events, enhancing and restoring habitats, buffer-
     ing protected areas, or testing and implementing new conservation strategies. INRMP imposed land
     use restrictions or other agreements to restrict land use as a condition for precluding critical habitat
     designation under the auspices of the Endangered Species Act must be coordinated with SAF/IE.
     7.4.2. The INRMP provides assurance that the management plan will be implemented. Persons
     charged with INRMP implementation are capable of accomplishing the objectives of the INRMP,
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                        25


  have adequate funding to implement the INRMP, have the authority to implement the INRMP, and
  have obtained all the necessary authorizations or approvals. The INRMP must provide an implemen-
  tation schedule (including projected completion dates) to achieve the goals and objectives identified
  in the plan.
  7.4.3. The INRMP provides assurance that the conservation effort will be effective. Use the following
  five criteria to determine if an INRMP provides an effective conservation effort:
     7.4.3.1. The INRMP includes biological goals (broad guiding principles for the program) and
     objectives (measurable targets for achieving the goals);
     7.4.3.2. The INRMP provides quantifiable, scientifically valid parameters that will demonstrate
     achievement of objectives, and standards for these parameters by which progress will be mea-
     sured;
     7.4.3.3. The INRMP includes provisions for monitoring and, where appropriate, adaptive man-
     agement;
     7.4.3.4. The INRMP includes provisions for reporting progress on implementation (based on
     compliance with the implementation schedule) and effectiveness (based on evaluation of quantifi-
     able parameters) of the conservation effort are provided; and
     7.4.3.5. The duration of the INRMP is sufficient to implement the plan and achieve the benefits of
     its goals and objectives.

                                                  Chapter 8

                                        FOREST MANAGEMENT

8.1. Forest Management Practices on Air Force Lands. The principal objective of forest management
on AF installations is to maintain and enhance the ecological integrity of forested landscapes while sup-
porting the military mission. Under the principles of ecosystem management (see 2.9.), forest treatments,
to include the harvesting of forest products, may be used to achieve installation goals for forest enhance-
ment and restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, wildfire protection, recreational development, mili-
tary training requirements, airfield safety compliance, and wood production.
     8.1.1. Commercial Activities. Commercial harvesting of forest products on AF lands is authorized,
     provided that such use is compatible with the military mission and consistent with the goals stated in
     the INRMP. The Range Operating Agency will determine the availability of lands for commercial
     activities on military training and testing ranges in accordance with guidelines in AFI 13-212, Volume
     1, Range Planning and Operations. Commercial forestry operations must also be compatible with
     INRMP goals for protection of federally listed threatened and endangered species, biodiversity con-
     servation, watershed protection, wildlife habitat enhancement, outdoor recreation, and scenic quality.
     Never harvest forest products for short-term profit at the expense of long-term sustainability of other
     ecosystem functions.
     8.1.2. Timber Harvesting Methods. Use appropriate cultural practices to maintain the forest ecosys-
     tem in a healthy condition and achieve the goals stated in the installation INRMP. The INRMP must
     state the acceptable timber harvesting practices for the installation and explain, in terms of current and
     desired future condition, how the chosen management practices achieve the INRMP goals.
     8.1.3. Best Management Practices. Implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) in forest manage-
     ment operations to minimize environmental impacts. Utilize applicable state BMPs for forest manage-
     ment operations.
     8.1.4. Reforestation. Conduct reforestation activities as detailed in the INRMP. Favor natural regen-
     eration methods to renew a timber stand if the technique can achieve the desired species composition
     and stocking rate. When considering artificial regeneration by tree planting, use only species that are
     native to the local area and specific ecosystem type. If site preparation is required prior to reforesta-
     tion, favor techniques that minimize soil disturbance and ecological impacts. Inspect natural and arti-
     ficial regeneration sites after the first, third and fifth growing season to evaluate seedling survival.
     8.1.5. Forest Road Construction and Maintenance. Installations with a commercial forest resource
     must evaluate the existing network of forest access roads and trails in the INRMP. Forest road con-
     struction and management should be consistent with the ecosystem management objectives stated in
     the INRMP. Design and maintain forest access roads in accordance with applicable state Best Man-
     agement Practices. Construct new single-purpose forest access roads only when absolutely necessary.
     Temporary roads and trails constructed solely for timber harvesting operations must be closed to
     vehicular traffic after the sale is completed, unless the road is identified in the Base Comprehensive
     Plan, INRMP, or other component plan as necessary to support the military mission or other natural
     resources goals.
     8.1.6. Forest Inventory. Installations with commercial forest land capable of producing more than 20
     cubic feet/acre/year in wood biomass must maintain a forest inventory. Update forest inventories at
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                              27


   least once every 10 years. Utilize a geographic information system to record and access forest inven-
   tory data.
   8.1.7. Airfield Safety. Installations with active airfields must manage forest areas so that trees do not
   pose a hazard to air operations. Refer to Uniform Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and
   Heliport Planning and Design for specifications on airfield flight surfaces and safety zones.

8.2. Forest Protection.
   8.2.1. Protection from Insects and Disease. To the extent practicable, and within budget limits, sup-
   port U.S. Forest Service (USFS), state, and host-nation programs for the detection, control and eradi-
   cation of epidemic forest insects and disease. Refer to AFI 32-1053, Integrated Pest Management for
   guidance on the use of pesticides for forest health protection. Public Law 95-313, Cooperative For-
   estry Assistance Act of 1978 and Title 16 United States Code, Section 2104 provide for United States
   Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service assistance for forest health problems on all federal
   lands. Contact the appropriate Forest Service, State and Private Forestry office to obtain a biological
   assessment for any forest health issues on AF installations. If a biological assessment indicates that
   funds are needed for forest insect and disease control, submit the funding request along with a copy of
   the biological opinion to HQ AFCEE/TD. HQ AFCEE/TD consolidates AF funding requests and for-
   wards them to the Armed Forces Pest Management Board for consideration and potential referral to
   the Forest Service.
   8.2.2. Forest Fire Protection. Refer to Chapter 12 for guidance on wildland fire protection.

8.3. Forest Product Sale Procedures. Do not give away, abandon or destroy forest products with mar-
ketable value. Collect payment for all forest products with economic value that are harvested on AF lands.
Forest products may not be traded for goods or services nor used to offset contract costs associated with
construction, land clearing, or other contracted activity. Make an attempt to offer for sale any forest prod-
ucts that require removal prior to initiation of construction or other land clearing operation. Prior to any
land clearing or construction activity, contact at least three buyers of forest products within the region to
determine if they are willing to make an offer on the forest products requiring disposal. These restrictions
do not apply to materials determined to have no commercial value, as determined by the HQ AFCEE For-
ester or local state forestry office.
   8.3.1. Small-Lot Sales. Forest products with an appraised value at $25,000 or less may be sold by
   means of an installation small-lot sales contract. Conduct small-lot sales only when they serve the best
   interests of the government. Do not split larger timber disposal sales into small lots to avoid formal
   bids. Installations may use a small-lot sales contract to remove timber appraised at greater than
   $25,000 when immediate tree removals are necessary to meet airfield safety requirements, as defined
   by a impending downgrade of airfield operability status. Informal bids must be solicited from at least
   three potential buyers. Document all contacts made and bids received, including contacts that respond
   with no bid. Upon official request from the installation, the AFCEE/TD Forester may conduct
   small-lot sales on behalf of the installation.
   8.3.2. Large Sales. Dispose of forest products with an appraised value at greater than $25,000 by con-
   tract sale utilizing competitive bidding procedures and the following guidelines.
       8.3.2.1. Sale Preparation. For all large forest product sales, prepare contract specifications that
       describe in detail the forest products, sale areas, allowable harvest methods and restricted activi-
28                                                                    AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


        ties. Include maps or drawings of the gross sale area and net removal area. A professional Forester
        or trained Forest Technician must perform or supervise the layout of sale area boundaries and the
        marking of trees within a timber sale area. Prior to removal of forest products, the effects of the
        proposed action must be evaluated and documented in accordance with the EIAP process defined
        in 32 CFR Part 989.
        8.3.2.2. Sale Appraisal. Obtain an appraisal of the fair market value of forest products offered for
        sale. Do not sell forest products for less than their appraised value without first preparing a written
        justification. Use regionally accepted standards for scaling, measuring, or weighing forest prod-
        ucts. Mark appraisal documents for identified sales areas with "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY," and
        release appraisal documents only on a need-to-know basis.
        8.3.2.3. Sale Marketing. For each forest product sale contract, prepare a solicitation for bid
        describing the forest products offered for sale and required harvesting specifications. Solicit bids
        either by means of lump-sum value or by scaled value per unit volume for each product class.
        Advertise forest products for sale to buyers within the region specified by the servicing contract-
        ing office.
        8.3.2.4. Sale Contract Term. Require removal of forest products within one year or less from the
        date of contract award unless a longer term is deemed to be in the best interest of the government.
        For sales extending longer than three years, include a rate predetermination clause to reflect
        changes in market value.
        8.3.2.5. Sale Inspection. Regularly inspect ongoing forest harvesting activities. The forest prod-
        ucts buyer will be responsible for executing all the terms and conditions of the contract. The con-
        tracting office will make a determination on contract completion based upon a final inspection
        report indicating that all contractual obligations have been met. Document discrepancies and
        report them to the contracting office. Make a final inspection at the conclusion of the contract.
     8.3.3. Sale Revenue Collection. Record revenues collected from forest product sales on a DoD Form
     1131, Cash Collection Voucher. Deposit proceeds from forest product sales to Deposit Fund Account
     57F3875.000* ADSN 333300 (* refers to the fiscal year, e.g. 57F3875.0004 for FY 2004). If sales are
     made on a unit weight basis, use the weight tickets from certified government or commercial scales as
     a basis for collection. Sale contracts may provide for scheduled payments by the buyer. Do not deposit
     refundable security deposits received from a buyer with forest product sale collections. Instead, hold
     security deposit payments in a temporary suspense account until funds are either disbursed back to the
     buyer or converted to revenue collections.
     8.3.4. Protection of Sensitive Natural Resources. In contracts for commercial harvesting of forest
     products, specify safeguards for protection of sensitive natural and cultural resources. Include clauses
     that identify penalties for damages incurred. Also include clauses that identify penalties for removal
     or damage or forest products not designated for disposal.

8.4. Procuring Forest Management Services
     8.4.1. Federal Assistance. The United States Forest Service (USFS) is the lead federal agency respon-
     sible for federal forest management in the United States. Under the authority of the Sikes Act, and as
     restricted by the Economy Act (Title 21, United States Code, Section 1535), Air Force installations
     may enter into Interagency Agreements that provide for the transfer of funds to the USFS for assis-
     tance in the form of personnel, agency services, or assistance with contracting actions that implement
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                         29


   forest management practices. Installations may also access the services of the USFS by means of an
   agreement between HQ AFCEE and the Forest Service for AF-wide forest management support. The
   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under authority of the Economy Act, may be used as a contracting
   agent for the disposal of forest products from AF lands.
   8.4.2. State Assistance. Under the authority of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a-f), installations may
   enter into cooperative agreements with states to execute forest management programs that implement
   the goals and objectives of the INRMP. Such agreements will provide a means by which the state will
   be reimbursed for obligations incurred in support of the forest management practices authorized by
   that agreement.
   8.4.3. Service Contracts. Use service contracts for forest management support when in-house
   resources are not available. A professional Forester must review all service contracts that implement
   forest management practices.

8.5. Financial Management. 10 U.S.C. 2665 authorizes refunding forest management obligations with
proceeds derived from the sale of forest products. DoD Financial Management Regulation Volume 11A,
Chapter 16, Accounting for Production and Sale of Forest Products, paragraph 160203 lists the appropri-
ate expenditures that can be reimbursed from forestry program funds. Refer to Chapter 15 for additional
guidance on financial management procedures for reimbursable conservation programs.
30                                                                   AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


                                                 Chapter 9

                                    AGRICULTURAL OUTGRANTS

9.1. Agriculture Outgrant Programs on Air Force Lands. Air Force lands may be outgranted in the
form of lease, license, or permit for agricultural purposes in accordance with AFI 32-9003, Granting Tem-
porary Use of Air Force Real Property, and the additional guidelines contained herein.
     9.1.1. Compatibility with the Military Mission. All agricultural outgrants must be compatible with the
     military mission of the AF, as determined by the installation or wing commander. The Range Operat-
     ing Agency will determine the availability of outgrant lands on military training and testing ranges in
     accordance with guidelines in AFI 13-212.
     9.1.2. Compatibility with INRMP. Agricultural outgrants are authorized only when the program is
     used in support of goals and objectives of the installation INRMP. Agricultural outgrants for crop pro-
     duction, livestock grazing, equestrian operations, commercial seed harvesting, apiary placement,
     maple sugar collection and any other agricultural product may be conducted where feasible and com-
     patible with the INRMP. The overriding principles of ecosystem management (see 2.9.) also apply to
     any outgrant of AF lands for agricultural uses.

9.2. Agricultural Outgrant Program Management.
     9.2.1. Administration. The installation Real Estate Office and/or the Real Estate Division of the local
     U.S Army Corps of Engineers District are responsible for administrating agricultural outgrants on AF
     lands. Installation natural resources managers and real estate personnel will collaborate in developing
     agricultural outgrant documents. Outgrant renewal actions should begin at least nine months prior to
     expiration. The installation Real Estate Office and/or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will bill out-
     grantees in accordance with the terms of the outgrant.
     9.2.2. Outgrant Instruments. Agricultural use of AF property requires a lease, license, or permit pre-
     pared, awarded, and executed in accordance with AFI 32-9003. All agricultural leases must require
     the outgrantee to pay cash, provide services, and/or make improvements to the extent that the govern-
     ment is receiving a fair market value for interest in the land. Government-owned livestock are exempt
     from the fee collection requirement. Licenses and permits for agricultural uses at less than fair market
     value are not allowed unless the licensee or permittee is eligible for an exception from the consider-
     ation requirements under AFI 32-9003.
     9.2.3. Outgrant Revenue Collection. Record revenues collected from agricultural outgrants on a DoD
     Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. Deposit proceeds from forest product sales to Deposit Fund
     Account 57F3875.00AG ADSN 454545.
     9.2.4. Land Use Regulations. All agriculture outgrants, to include grazing/cropland leases, licenses,
     and permits, require written land use regulations designed to insure the compatibility of outgrant
     activities with the military mission as well as to conserve the soil, water, and other natural resources
     within the areas included in the outgrant. Land use regulations will implement the appropriate Best
     Management Practices for erosion and sedimentation control as established by the USDA Natural
     Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and state guidelines. Land use regulations must also be writ-
     ten to support the natural resources management goals and objectives in the INRMP. Develop a com-
     pliance checklist from the land use regulations that can be used to perform objective inspections of
     outgrant operations to monitor compliance.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                            31


   9.2.5. Technical Oversight. Agricultural outgrant documents and their associated land use regulations
   must be reviewed and approved by the designated installation natural resources management special-
   ist, the Flight Safety office, and local NRCS District Conservationist (or other cooperating agency
   agricultural specialist). When appropriate, enter into cooperative agreements to access technical assis-
   tance from the NRCS, USFS, Bureau of Land Management, state cooperative extension service, local
   soil and water conservation district, or other agency experienced in the management of agricultural
   and grazing lands.
   9.2.6. Compliance Inspection. The installation natural resources management office and real estate
   management office jointly share responsibility for outgrant compliance inspection, except in cases
   where the outgrant is managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. Schedule inspections of agricultural
   outgrant operations in accordance with guidelines stated in AFI 32-9003. A qualified agronomist,
   livestock grazing specialist, or natural resources management specialist must periodically inspect out-
   grant sites to ensure that the outgrantee complies with the technical terms of the outgrant and associ-
   ated land use regulations. Cooperating agency personnel can make periodic on-site reviews of the
   outgrant program to assess crop and grazing land conditions and outgrant compliance on behalf of the
   AF. The inspector will complete the land use regulations compliance checklist at each review. All
   inspection reports will be delivered to the administering real estate office for further action.
   9.2.7. Improvements and Services. Agricultural outgrants may require the outgrantee to provide agri-
   cultural land improvements, services and other in-kind consideration in lieu of a portion or all of the
   cash payment due the United States Government for the grant of the interest in the land. The admin-
   istering real property office will calculate the fair market value of any such improvements and ser-
   vices and deduct the amount calculated from the cash rent or payment due the United States
   Government. Outgrant instruments will provide that all such improvements become the property of
   the United States Government. Installations with outgrants that allow improvements, services and
   other in-kind consideration in lieu of a portion or all of the cash payment must provide a justification
   for the substitution of in-kind consideration for the cash payment in the INRMP. The INRMP justifi-
   cation must evaluate the impact of improvements, services, and other in-kind consideration to the eco-
   nomic sustainability of the program, to the military mission, and to the achievement of INRMP goals
   and objectives.

9.3. Guidelines for Livestock Grazing. Livestock grazing programs must adhere to the following
guidelines:
   9.3.1. Livestock grazing programs must be consistent with the use of the installation to support mili-
   tary readiness.
   9.3.2. Livestock grazing programs must support the goals and objectives of the installation INRMP.
   Grazing will not be authorized unless such use is documented in the INRMP as essential to achieve
   land management goals.
   9.3.3. Livestock grazing programs must not degrade the natural ecological integrity of the landscape.
   Do not allow grazing within native plant communities where it has been determined that such use is
   inappropriate for the plant community type. Suspend grazing on lands where historic overgrazing and
   other abusive grazing practices have limited the ability of the plant community to recover.

9.4. Guidelines for Agricultural Crop Production. Crop production programs must support the goals
and objectives of the installation INRMP and Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan. Installations with

active runways must coordinate any new cropland outgrant proposals with the installation Safety Office
and Airfield Manager.

9.5. Monitoring Outgrant Lands for Compliance with the INRMP. Monitor outgranted lands to
ensure that land use is in compliance with the applicable land use regulations and the land stewardship
goals, objectives, and implementing guidelines stated in the INRMP. Installations with agricultural out-
grants will include a description of the monitoring program in the INRMP. Monitoring programs will
adhere to the guidelines listed below.
     9.5.1. Monitor cropland outgrants annually to ensure that they do not create unacceptable soil losses
     from erosion or cause point-source or non-point pollution to any natural water body. Also monitor
     other direct and indirect impacts of agriculture outgrant activities on surrounding land and water
     resources.
     9.5.2. Monitor water runoff from cropland outgrants for levels of pesticides or fertilizer that exceed
     state regulatory requirements. The location, method and frequency of water samples will be deter-
     mined through consultation with the appropriate state agency.
     9.5.3. Monitor livestock grazing outgrants using sample plots, photo points, permanent grazing exclo-
     sures, and other acceptable means to evaluate forage condition, trend, and utilization, and determine if
     the overall health of the rangeland resources are being sustained. Also note the presence and extent of
     invasive plant species (see Chapter 13).

9.6. Pest Management on Outgranted Lands.
     9.6.1. Use of Pesticides by Outgrantee. Any application of pesticides on AF lands must comply with
     AFI 32-1053, Pest Management Program. Outgrantees performing pesticide application on AF lands
     must maintain the certification requirements of the state, territory, or host nation in which the installa-
     tion lies. Outgrant instruments must require that the outgrantee obtain the approval of the installation
     pest management point of contact prior to any pesticide application, and report all actual pesticide
     usage (in pounds of active ingredient) to the pest management point of contact.
     9.6.2. Control of Noxious, Exotic, and Invasive Species. Air Force agricultural outgrant programs
     must comply with the requirements of the Federal Noxious Weed Control Act. Outgrant programs
     will, to the extent practicable and within the limits of available funds, support state and federal pro-
     grams for the control of noxious, exotic, and invasive plant species. Installations may enter into coop-
     erative agreements with local area government entities that establish integrated pest management
     principles for the control of undesirable plant species. Expenditure of agricultural program funds to
     control noxious, exotic and invasive species will be consistent with the level of effort exhibited on
     similar federal, state or private agriculture and grazing lands in the vicinity of the installation.

9.7. Financial Management. 10 U.S.C. 2667 authorizes the use of revenues from agricultural outgrants
for agriculture program operating expenses as well as to support other natural resources program initia-
tives AF-wide. DODI 4715.3 defines the authorized uses of agriculture program funds. Refer to Chapter
15 for guidance on financial management procedures for AF reimbursable conservation programs.

                                       OUTDOOR RECREATION

10.1. Outdoor Recreation Planning. Natural resources managers must collaborate with the installation
Community Planner, Range Operating Agency, Air Force Services and other offices in the planning and
development of outdoor recreation areas. The Installation Natural Resources Management Plan will
address outdoor recreation programs and management procedures. The INRMP will identify the areas on
the installation where outdoor recreation activities and developments are appropriate, and discuss the
compatibility of outdoor recreation programs with the military mission. Classify areas suitable for out-
door recreation into three classes of use based on outdoor recreation potential and ecosystem sustainabil-
ity.
   10.1.1. Class I areas (developed recreation areas) contain facilities designed to accommodate inten-
   sive recreational activities such as sports fields, campgrounds, picnic areas, paved walking/jogging/
   cycling trails, winter sports areas, marinas, developed swimming beaches, and other water sports
   areas.
   10.1.2. Class II areas (dispersed recreation areas) are areas that are suitable to support dispersed rec-
   reational activities such as hunting, fishing, primitive camping, bird watching, boating, hiking, and
   sightseeing.
   10.1.3. Class III areas (special interest areas) are recreation areas that contain valuable archeological,
   botanical, ecological, geological, historic, zoological, scenic, or other features that warrant special
   protection and access control. Class III areas will emphasize the protection of the unique resources.
   Public use, to include interpretive displays and education programs, may be permitted as specified in
   the INRMP.

10.2. Public Access for Outdoor Recreation. The INRMP will address the specific rules and proce-
dures for outdoor recreation access on Class I, II, and III recreation areas that are not under the direct con-
trol of Air Force Services Agency. Allow use of outdoor recreation resources by the general public when
such use is deemed by the commander to be compatible with the military mission and does not exceed the
recreational carrying capacity of the land. See 6.2.3. for guidelines on establishing access and participant
criteria in the INRMP.

10.3. Off-Road Vehicle (ORV) Use. The INRMP will include installation policy on the use of off-road
vehicles, to include mountain bikes. Allow use of off-road vehicles only after thoroughly analyzing the
impact of such use on soils, archeological sites, wildlife, water quality, and other ecosystem attributes.
Periodically monitor and evaluate for damage any areas designated for ORV use. Refer to Executive
Order No. 11989, Off-road Vehicles on Public Lands, May 24, 1977.
   10.3.1. Restrict use of off-road vehicles, including mountain bikes and other all terrain vehicles, to
   areas that can sustain their use without damage to natural or cultural resources. Require that all motor-
   ized off-road vehicles are licensed and insured.
   10.3.2. Areas that are damaged from off-road vehicle use should be closed to prevent further damage.
   Undertake rehabilitation projects to restore the damage.
34                                                                   AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


10.4. Watchable Wildlife Programs. The AF participates with other federal and state agencies and pri-
vate conservation organizations in the Watchable Wildlife Program. The purpose of the program is to
increase opportunities for people to observe native wildlife in their natural habitats and to support wildlife
habitat preservation. When compatible with the installation mission, designate Watchable Wildlife Areas
in the INRMP planning process. If access by the general public is permissible, submit information on the
Watchable Wildlife site for inclusion in the state Nature Watch guide book. Installations with a Watchable
Wildlife Program must provide an annual summary of program accomplishments to the MAJCOM.

                                        LAND MANAGEMENT

11.1. Land Management Programs. Air Force land management activities must consider the protection
and enhancement of desirable natural and man-made features in the landscape. AF land management pro-
grams include landscape design, grounds maintenance, urban forest management, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft
Strike Hazard reduction, irrigation and water management, pest management, invasive species manage-
ment, control of non-point source pollution, and soil erosion control.

11.2. Grounds Maintenance Categories. For purposes of designating the intensity of grounds mainte-
nance, the INRMP will delineate and map installation grounds into categories of ‘improved’,
‘semi-improved’, and ‘unimproved’ as defined in Attachment 1. The INRMP will describe the type of
ground maintenance activities that will take place within each category.

11.3. Designing and Maintaining Landscapes. Landscape design and maintenance activities must
comply with the land management goals of the INRMP.
   11.3.1. Landscape Design. To the maximum extent possible, utilize regionally native plants in land-
   scape designs for improved and semi-improved grounds. Do not utilize non-native species that tend to
   be invasive (reproduce outside the intended growing area). Design landscapes that minimize adverse
   effects on natural habitats and reduce maintenance inputs in terms of energy, water, manpower, and
   equipment. Choose plant materials adapted to local environmental conditions that have the potential
   to reduce the need for irrigation, fertilization or pesticides to maintain a healthy condition. Consult the
   USAF Landscape Design Guide for technical guidance in landscape design and implementation
   (http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/dc/dcd/land/ldg/index.html).
   11.3.2. Grounds Maintenance. Establish grounds maintenance practices according to grounds mainte-
   nance category delineations. For improved and semi-improved grounds, employ the following
   grounds maintenance standards:
       11.3.2.1. Implement maintenance practices in accordance with the landscape designer’s intent;
       11.3.2.2. Eliminate unnecessary pruning of trees and shrubs;
       11.3.2.3. Where practicable, convert improved grounds to semi-improved or unimproved
       grounds, and convert semi-improved grounds to unimproved grounds;
       11.3.2.4. When feasible, convert landscapes dominated by non-native plants to native trees,
       shrubs, or grasses;
       11.3.2.5. Irrigate installation grounds only when necessary to fulfill justifiable aesthetic or func-
       tional user requirements;
       11.3.2.6. Use the HQ AFCESA Civil Engineer Service Contract Templates to formulate grounds
       maintenance contracts.

11.4. Golf Course Environmental Management. Golf course management activities must comply with
the land management goals of the INRMP and the golf course environmental management (GEM) plan.
36                                                                    AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


     11.4.1. GEM Program. The goals of the GEM Program are to minimize or eliminate potential nega-
     tive environmental impacts, attain and maintain compliance with all appropriate regulations, and con-
     stantly examine all aspects of golf course management to achieve the highest standards of
     environmental excellence.
     11.4.2. GEM Planning Process. The GEM planning process includes an initial analysis, or golf course
     environmental baseline assessment (GCEBA), of all aspects of the golf course facility in order to pro-
     vide a summary of the identified environmental issues facing the golf course manager and staff. From
     these issues, a GEM Plan is compiled that satisfies the specialized needs of the golf course manager
     with AF goals and objectives for environmental management. Consult the U. S. Air Force Golf Course
     Environmental Management Program web site for technical guidance on GEM program requirements
     (http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/ec/golf/).

11.5. Urban Forestry.
     11.5.1. Urban Forestry Program Management. The INRMP will state long-term goals and objectives
     to achieve a desired future condition for installation landscape trees (i.e. urban forest). The urban for-
     est management goals and objectives should be based upon data from an urban forest survey that iden-
     tifies the current species, size, and condition of landscape trees, and any necessary tree maintenance
     requirements. The INRMP will include a list of recommended landscape trees and shrubs that is based
     upon site compatibility, life expectancy, maintenance requirements, and compatibility with BASH
     safety guidelines. Replacement plantings will favor native trees and shrubs or other species that are
     able to survive with minimal maintenance requirements. Do not plant trees or shrubs that will require
     irrigation for survival beyond an initial two-year establishment period. Ensure that tree plantings will
     not create a future hazard for aircraft and flight operations.
     11.5.2. Tree City USA. Urban forestry programs at AF installations in the United States and U.S. ter-
     ritories must satisfy the criteria for a Tree City USA designation from the National Arbor Day Foun-
     dation. Submit Tree City USA applications to the appropriate State Forester’s office in accordance
     with MAJCOM guidelines. Installations outside the United States and its territories may voluntarily
     participate by submitting Tree City applications to HQ AFCEE/TD.

11.6. Pest Management. In accordance with AFI 32-1053, Pest Management Program, the installation
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Plan must address all strategies for managing pests. Natural resources
managers will coordinate with pest management personnel to ensure that the IPM Plan and INRMP are
mutually supportive and not in conflict.

11.7. Non-point Source Pollution Prevention.
     11.7.1. Use applicable Best Management Practices to minimize non-point sources of water pollution.
     To determine appropriate BMPs, consult the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, local soil
     and water conservation district, state agricultural extension office, or state water quality office.
     11.7.2. The non-point source pollution control program and BMPs for specific projects should be
     consistent with the state non-point source pollution management program as well as any enforceable
     requirements of the state Coastal Zone Management Programs.
     11.7.3. Before using treated sewage effluent in irrigation systems, coordinate with the Air Force
     Regional Environmental Office to determine whether federal or state water quality requirements exist.

11.8. Mineral Leasing. The Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) is the contact for all mineral
exploration and mining on land controlled by the AF. Refer to AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of
Air Force Real Property for guidelines on leasing AF controlled lands for mineral exploration and min-
ing.

                                 WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT

12.1. Wildland Fire Management Policy. The Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and Program
Review of 1995 (as updated), the National Wildland Fire Coordinating Group (NWCG) Wildland Fire
Qualification Subsystem Guide (PMS 310-1/NFES 1414), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
Standard 295 – Standard for Wildfire Control, NFPA Standard 1051 – Standard for Wildland Firefighter
Professional Qualifications, NFPA Standard 1143 – Standard for Wildland Fire Management, and NFPA
Standard 1144 – Standard for Protection of Life and Property from Wildfire establish the accepted profes-
sional standards for AF wildland fire management policy. Installations with unimproved lands that
present a wildfire hazard, and installations which utilize prescribed burns as a land management tool, will
develop and implement a Wildland Fire Management Plan (WFMP). The WFMP will be incorporated
into or consistent with the INRMP as a component plan.

12.2. Program Authority.
     12.2.1. The installation or wing commander, or appropriate designee, defines the roles and responsi-
     bilities for wildland fire management on the installation and will designate an installation Wildland
     Fire Program Manager.
     12.2.2. The installation or wing commander, or appropriate designee, approves the installation
     WFMP.
     12.2.3. The installation Wildland Fire Program Manager is responsible for development of the
     WFMP. Additionally, the Wildland Fire Program Manager reviews and approves burn plans for pre-
     scribed fires consistent with the WFMP, the INRMP, and other applicable operating instructions.

12.3. Wildland Fire Organization Standards. Air Force organizations involved in wildland fire activi-
ties will incorporate NWCG standards into their organizational structure when necessary to accommodate
cooperation and integration with other federal and state wildland fire organizations across jurisdictional
boundaries.

12.4. Certification, Training, and Fitness Standards for Wildland Fire Management Personnel.
     12.4.1. Certification Standards. All military, civilian, contractor and emergency services personnel
     involved in wildland fire management must possess certifications appropriate for their expected level
     of involvement in the wildland fire organization. All AF personnel must meet the applicable NFPA
     Standards for wildland fire activities.
        12.4.1.1. Personnel in the GS-081 job series, 3E7X1 career paths, and contractors will meet the
        certification standards specified in NFPA 1051 – Standard for Wildland Fire Fighter Professional
        Qualifications and NFPA 1002 – Standard for Fire Apparatus Driver/Operator Professional
        Qualifications.
        12.4.1.2. Personnel in the natural resources job series (GS-401 thru GS-499) must also meet
        NFPA 1051 and NFPA 1002 certification standards, but may use training criteria in the NWCG
        Wildland Fire Qualification Subsystem Guide (PMS 310-1/NFES 1414) to attain equivalent NFPA
        certifications. Table 12.1. establishes the correlation between NFPA and NWCG certification lev-
        els, and the corresponding NWCG training requirements for attaining each certification.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                              39


     12.4.1.3. Personnel mobilized to participate in wildland fire management activities on federal
     properties not under DoD jurisdiction, either through mutual aid agreement or other means, must
     be certified for the expected level of involvement under NWCG standards. GS-081 job series,
     DoD contractor, and 3E7X1 personnel that seek wildland fire certifications other than the NFPA
     Job Levels listed in Table 12.1. must comply with the appropriate NWCG criteria.
     12.4.1.4. Position descriptions for new hires that will participate in wildland fire activities will
     reflect the expected level of involvement and required certifications. Position descriptions for nat-
     ural resources managers with wildland fire management duties must state if the position qualifies
     the position holder as a primary or secondary wildland firefighter, as described in Chapter 46 of
     the Office of Personnel Management CRCS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll
     Offices. Natural resources management personnel not classified as a primary or secondary wild-
     land firefighter may perform collateral duty in wildland fire management activities as qualified.
     12.4.1.5. Primary and secondary wildland firefighters in the natural resources management job
     series (401 thru 499) will be certified, as a minimum requirement, in Cardio-Pulmonary Resusci-
     tation (CPR) and Standard First Aid by the American Red Cross or comparable certification
     authority.
     12.4.1.6. HQ AFCESA/CEXF is the executive agent for the DoD Fire Fighter Certification Pro-
     gram (FFCP) and will be responsible for issuing, maintaining, and tracking of NFPA wildland
     firefighter certifications for levels identified in Table 12.1.
  12.4.2. Physical Fitness Standards.
     12.4.2.1. The installation WFMP will describe a measurable and objective evaluation test (medi-
     cal exam, step-test, pack test, etc.) that will be used to establish physical fitness standards for per-
     sonnel that participate in wildland fire management activities. NWCG publications PMS 310-1/
     NFES 1414 – Wildland Fire Qualification Subsystem Guide, NFES 1596 – Fitness and Work
     Capacity, and NFES 2071 – Fit to Work, Fatigue and the Firefighter provide guidance for estab-
     lishing physical fitness standards for wildland fire management activities.
     12.4.2.2. Personnel whose job description requires participation in wildland fire management
     activities as a primary or secondary firefighter on AF installations will meet the pre-employment
     medical and physical examination criteria contained in NFPA 1582 – Standard on Comprehensive
     Occupational Medical Program for Fire Departments.

12.5. Wildland Fire Management Plan (WFMP) Components. The purpose of the installation Wild-
land Fire Management Plan is to reduce wildfire potential, protect and enhance valuable natural resources,
and implement ecosystem management goals and objectives on AF installations. The WFMP will directly
support the AF mission and be consistent with installation emergency operations plans. As a minimum,
the installation WFMP will include the following components:
     12.5.1. Goals and Objectives. The WFMP shall establish goals and objectives for the wildland fire
     management program on the installation.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                             41


  12.5.2. Organizational Structure. The Wildland Fire Management Plan will describe the wildland fire
  management organizational structure, and will indicate its position within the installation command
  structure. The organizational structure for wildland fire activities will be consistent with NWCG Inci-
  dent Command System standards.
  12.5.3. Interagency Cooperation and Mutual Aid Agreements. Installations are encouraged to
  develop regional partnerships for wildland fire management support by means of reciprocal agree-
  ments with other federal, state, local and private entities to share human, logistical, and operational
  resources. Emergency assistance and mutual aid agreements will conform to the guidelines stated in
  DODI 6055.6 – DoD Fire and Emergency Services Program, and AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection
  Operations and Fire Prevention Program. Include interagency agreements and mutual assistance
  agreements in the WFMP as references or appendices.
  12.5.4. Smoke Management and Air Quality. Describe the mission, environmental, human health and
  safety factors specific to the installation and region that affect smoke management and identify neces-
  sary mitigation practices. Refer to NWCG publication PMS 420-2/NFES 1279 - Prescribed Fire
  Smoke Management Guide for guidance on factors to consider.
  12.5.5. Safety and Emergency Operations. The Wildland Fire Management Plan must reflect that fire-
  fighter and public safety is the first priority in every wildland fire management activity. The WFMP
  will identify installation-specific safety and emergency operations protocols. NFPA 1977 – Standard
  on Protective Clothing and Equipment for Wildland Fire Fighting establishes the requirements for
  protective clothing.
  12.5.6. Risk Assessment/Decision Analysis Processes. Sound operational risk management will be
  the foundation of the Wildland Fire Management Plan. Identify the indices and/or fire danger rating
  system that will be used to assess wildfire risk and potential fire behavior. The indices and/or fire dan-
  ger rating system must adequately describe fire hazard, severity, intensity, and other significant factors
  affecting the protection of life and property. Identify the environmental factors that will be measured
  prior to ignition of a prescribed fire treatment. Identify normal and unique weather patterns that affect
  fire behavior on the installation.
  12.5.7. Wildland Fire History. Include in the WFMP an analysis of both recent and long-term wild-
  land fire history on the installation and in the region.
  12.5.8. Natural and Cultural Resources Considerations Checklist. Provide a checklist in the WFMP
  that can be used to identify sensitive natural and cultural resources that should be given consideration
  before conducting any wildland fire management activity.
  12.5.9. Mission Impact Considerations. Identify the potential impacts to the installation mission (pos-
  itive and negative) that may occur as a result of implementation of the WFMP.
  12.5.10. Wildland Fuel Factors. Identify the effects of installation fuel types and fuel loads on fire
  behavior. Display data on fuel types and fuel loading by maps or other means. Conduct fuel surveys to
  collect wildland fire fuels data if necessary.
  12.5.11. Monitoring Requirements. Identify the environmental factors that will be monitored and the
  frequency of monitoring required for both a wildfire and prescribed fire. Identify post-fire assessment
  protocols for both wildfire and prescribed fires.
  12.5.12. Public Relations. Identify a protocol for notifying the media and affected persons for wildfire
  incidents and prescribed burning activities.
42                                                                   AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


     12.5.13. Funding Requirements. Identify the funding requirements to train and equip wildland fire
     management personnel to ensure safe, effective, and cost-efficient operations in support of the Wild-
     land Fire Management Plan. Identify the appropriate sources of funding for wildland fire activities.
        12.5.13.1. Wildland fire management activities that are conducted for the purpose of compliance
        with environmental laws and regulations will be supported by conservation funds.
        12.5.13.2. Wildfire suppression, prescribed burning and other wildland fire management activi-
        ties to support training, range use, munitions testing and evaluation, or other mission activity will
        be supported by the responsible activity through direct funding or reimbursement.
        12.5.13.3. Funding for wildfire prevention and fuels management for hazard reduction is an
        installation operations and maintenance responsibility.
        12.5.13.4. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2665, expenditures for the protection and maintenance of
        commercial forests can be reimbursed by proceeds derived from the sale of forest products; how-
        ever, the total reimbursement for forest management obligations related to wildland fire suppres-
        sion cannot exceed the forest management program proceeds in a given fiscal year on the
        installation.
     12.5.14. Personnel Training and Certification Standards and Records. The WFMP will identify the
     staffing requirements, according to specific certification and training requirements, for the tasks asso-
     ciated with wildland fire management activities on the installation. Current training and qualification
     records will be maintained for all personnel involved in wildland fire management activities.
     12.5.15. Environmental Impact Analysis Process for WFMP Implementation. Actions proposed in an
     WFMP may constitute a major federal action as defined in 40 CFR Part 1508.18 (b) (2). Major federal
     actions must be evaluated for potential environmental effects in accordance with 32 CFR Part 989.

12.6. Prescribed Fires.
     12.6.1. Use of Prescribed Fire on Air Force Installations. Prescribed fire can be used as a management
     tool to attain the goals and objectives of the INRMP and to support other AF mission needs. Two types
     of prescribed fires are recognized: 1) those ignited by qualified personnel in accordance with an
     approved site-specific burn plan, and 2) wildfires managed under prescribed conditions as addressed
     in an approved Wildland Fire Management Plan.
     12.6.2. Site-Specific Burn Plans. A site-specific burn plan will be developed for each prescribed burn
     conducted on AF property. The installation Wildland Fire Management Plan will identify the required
     components for site-specific burn plans. At a minimum, burn plans will include the following:
        12.6.2.1. Burn objectives
        12.6.2.2. Acceptable weather and fuel moisture parameters
        12.6.2.3. Required personnel and equipment resources
        12.6.2.4. Burn area map
        12.6.2.5. Smoke management plan
        12.6.2.6. Safety considerations
        12.6.2.7. Pre-burn authorization/notification checklist
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                         43


12.7. Use of Fire Breaks. When planning for prescribed fires, and when suppressing wildfire, utilize
natural and existing man-made features whenever possible. Fire breaks, if required, must be constructed,
maintained, or rehabilitated to prevent erosion.
44                                                                     AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


                                                  Chapter 13

                                 INVASIVE SPECIES MANAGEMENT

13.1. Invasive Species Management Policy. Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species, February 3,
1999 requires all federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species, provide for their control
and minimize their economic, ecological, and human health impacts. Under Executive Order 13112, Inva-
sive Species, February 3, 1999, installations will, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, not
authorize, fund, or carry out management actions that are likely to cause the introduction or spread of
invasive species. Address invasive species management in the INRMP. Formulate and implement INRMP
goals and objectives to detect, respond rapidly to, and control populations of invasive species in a
cost-effective and environmentally sound manner whenever and wherever practical. Promote native hab-
itats and the restoration of native species in ecosystems that have been invaded. INRMP goals should also
comply with the Federal Invasive Species Management Plan and other guidelines promulgated by the
Federal Invasive Species Council. The invasive species management element of the INRMP will provide
specific information on species to be controlled and recommended control methods.

13.2. Invasive Species Detection and Monitoring. The INRMP will include a current assessment of the
presence and extent of invasive species on the installation. Conduct a survey to detect and map invasive
species. Monitor invasive species populations and update inventory information as new species are dis-
covered.

13.3. Invasive Species Control on Agricultural Outgrants. Cropland and grazing outgrants of AF
properties will include requirements for the outgrantee to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive
species. Outgrant agreements will include requirements to implement control measures for invasive spe-
cies that are identified in the INRMP for control.

13.4. Control of Feral Animals. Installations will, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, not
authorize, fund, or carry out activities that are likely to cause the introduction or spread of feral dogs, cats,
pigs, goats or other non-native domesticated animals on AF-controlled lands. The INRMP will address
the specific policies, programs and methods used to control feral animals on AF installations. Feeding or
harboring of feral domesticated species is prohibited unless justified in the INRMP as necessary to
achieve a specified natural resources management objective.

13.5. Interagency Cooperation. Installations will implement cooperative agreements, when practicable,
with other federal, state and local government agencies to collaborate efforts for the control of undesirable
plant species. Installations are encouraged to participate in state or regional Exotic Pest Plant Councils.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                            45


                                              Chapter 14

                         BIRD/WILDLIFE AIRCRAFT STRIKE HAZARD

14.1. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. The focus of the BASH program is to
prevent wildlife-related aircraft mishaps and reduce the potential for wildlife hazards to aircraft opera-
tions. Accomplishing this goal requires knowledgeable natural resources management on and adjacent to
installation airfields. INRMPs must support the installation’s BASH Plan and the requirements of AFI
91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports,
and AFPAM 91-212, BASH Management Techniques. HQ AFSC/SEFW provides technical assistance to
installations on BASH issues.
   14.1.1. Natural resources personnel will assist the installation flight safety office and others in the
   development and implementation of the BASH Plan.
   14.1.2. Natural Resources personnel should be active members of the installation Bird/Wildlife Haz-
   ard Working Group (BHWG), consisting of organizations involved in airfield bird control, habitat
   management, operations and safety.
   14.1.3. Installations will establish procedures for coordination and review for installation construc-
   tion and improvement projects (e.g. beautification, waste water treatment, golf courses etc.) to ensure
   that any BASH related impacts are considered.

14.2. Natural Resources Management Restrictions in the Airfield Environment. A l l a s p e c t s o f
installation natural resources management must be reviewed for potential wildlife hazards to aircraft
operations. The land adjacent to aircraft operations areas must be managed to minimize attractions to
wildlife. Surveillance of the land surrounding the airfield and coordination with adjacent landowners to
reduce strike hazards are recommended.
   14.2.1. Airfield Grass Height. On airfields where grass is the primary ground cover, mow airfield to
   maintain a uniform grass height between 7 and 14 inches. In arid climates, or in circumstances where
   the 7 to 14 inch grass height does not satisfy the wildlife abatement objectives, consider alternative
   ground cover vegetation that reduces the attractiveness of the airfield to wildlife. Waivers to the 7-14
   inch grass height restriction are processed in accordance with AFI 91-202, The US AF Mishap Preven-
   tion Program.
   14.2.2. Managing Wetlands in the Airfield Environment. Wetland areas provide the basic needs for
   many wildlife species and thus create potential hazards to aircraft operations. Innovative techniques to
   manage wildlife in wetlands should be explored and implemented. Legally defensible actions to
   reduce the amount of wetlands on the airfield to the maximum extent possible should be explored and
   pursued when their presence conflicts with the flight mission. While “no net loss” of wetlands is an
   important AF goal, priority must be given to flight safety.
       14.2.2.1. Airfield Drainage Ditches. Manage drainage ditches to reduce their attractiveness to
       wildlife. According to the preamble to “Final Rule for Regulatory Programs of the Corps of Engi-
       neers,” 51 Federal Register 41206-41217 (November 13, 1986), and reaffirmed in the preamble to
       “Final Notice of Issuance and Modification of Nationwide Permits,” 65 Federal Register 12,818,
       12,823-24 (March 9, 2000), non-tidal drainage and irrigation ditches excavated on dry land might
       not be considered as “Waters of the United States.” However, coordination with appropriate regu-
       lators is necessary to determine the legal status of such areas.
46                                                                   AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


        14.2.2.2. Mitigation. Mitigate wetlands as far from the active airfield as possible. A wetland mit-
        igation bank may present an opportunity to exchange marginal habitat near the runway for more
        pristine conditions where wildlife may thrive unencumbered by BASH initiatives.
     14.2.3. Managing Agricultural Outgrants in the Airfield Environment. Agricultural and grazing out-
     grants (see Chapter 9) must be compatible with the installation BASH plan. Coordinate proposals for
     outgrants with the BHWG to insure that the crops grown and the agricultural methods used do not
     negatively impact flight safety.
        14.2.3.1. Grain crops are highly attractive to wildlife and should never be grown near the airfield
        as part of an agricultural outgrant program.
        14.2.3.2. Grazing animals can be a serious hazard if uncontrolled within the airfield. Ensure strict
        livestock control and proper fencing.
     14.2.4. Land Management.
        14.2.4.1. Urban Forestry. Avoid planting tree species near the airfield that attract wildlife by pro-
        viding food or cover.
        14.2.4.2. Non-point Source Pollution. Do not locate stormwater runoff retention ponds on the air-
        field.
        14.2.4.3. Irrigation and Water Management. Do not use the airfield for gray water or sludge dis-
        posal.
        14.2.4.4. Landscaping. Avoid using landscape plant material that attracts birds or animals for new
        construction projects around the airfield. Remove any landscape plants known to attract birds or
        wildlife in the vicinity of the airfield.
        14.2.4.5. Landfills.
            14.2.4.5.1. Installation Landfills. Landfills are a significant attractant to birds. Operate dis-
            posal sites according to state and federal laws. When siting new municipal solid waste disposal
            operations, follow Federal Aviation Administration and EPA siting criteria.
            14.2.4.5.2. Off-installation Landfills. The AF cannot control land use off-installation; how-
            ever, before landfills can be opened, the operator must obtain a state permit. Air Force con-
            cerns about potential bird hazards should be expertly presented at hearings held about the
            potential environmental impact of a planned landfill.

14.3. Management of Wildlife in Support of the BASH Plan. The INRMP must evaluate both exist-
ing and potential wildlife hazards to aircraft operations. Although the Air Force Safety Center is respon-
sible for the overall AF BASH program, natural resources and pest management personnel are an integral
part of every installation BASH program. The natural resources manager must share information on bio-
logical species and habitat diversity with the installation safety office to facilitate the development of a
comprehensive BASH database.
     14.3.1. Neotropical Birds. Share information on neotropical migratory birds activity with flight safety
     in order to enhance the installation’s BASH program. An affiliation with Partners in Flight Agreement
     is one source for this information. Coordinate with other installations within the same flyway to obtain
     information on current migratory bird populations.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                         47


  14.3.2. Watchable Wildlife. Consider wildlife hazards to aircraft operations when developing any
  Watchable Wildlife programs. Coordinate all Watchable Wildlife programs through the Bird/Wildlife
  Hazard Working Group and include these programs in the installation’s BASH plan.
  14.3.3. Airfield Wildlife Damage Control. The installation BASH plan details responsibilities for
  control of nuisance wildlife on the airfield. Lethal control is authorized only after all practical
  non-lethal control measures have been exhausted, provided that the proposed actions are reviewed in
  EIAP procedures as stipulated in 32 CFR Part 989. Obtain depredation permits from the USFWS pur-
  suant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for intentional takes of migratory birds in support of the BASH
  program (also see 6.6.2.). The installation BASH plan will designate the office responsible for main-
  taining all applicable federal and state depredation permits or Migratory Bird Treaty Act permits.

                                                Chapter 15

                                NATURAL RESOURCES BUDGETING

15.1. Funding Sources. This chapter outlines the appropriate funding sources, funding priorities, and
level of effort for AF conservation programs. Funding sources include the operations and maintenance
(O&M) appropriation, reimbursable conservation program accounts for forestry, agriculture, fish and
wildlife and outdoor recreation management, the DoD Legacy Resource Management Program, the Stra-
tegic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), and other sources such as those that
may be obtained through cooperative agreement under authority of the Sikes Act.

15.2. Operations and Maintenance Funds. Conservation program requirements eligible for O&M
funding are programmed through the Automated Civil Engineer System - Project Management
(ACES-PM). Categorize conservation requirements as recurring or non-recurring, and designate funding
priority as Level 0, 1, 2, or 3. See AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting for complete Level definitions
and for additional information on programming and budgeting for environmental quality O&M require-
ments.
     15.2.1. Level 0 Requirements. Natural resources management requirements recurring on an annual or
     more frequent basis that are “must do” activities. Ongoing natural resources management activities
     identified in an approved INRMP are Level 0 requirements if they are essential for the successful
     implementation of the goals and objectives stated in the plan. Level 0 also includes any INRMP
     actions necessary to prevent natural resource degradation that may affect military readiness. Level 0
     requirements include funding for personnel, travel, training, and supply costs, as well as recurring
     inventories, surveys, sampling, monitoring, reporting and record keeping, payments, and fees required
     by a specific public law or compliance agreement (e.g. special management criteria for T/E species
     management).
     15.2.2. Level 1 Requirements. A non-recurring requirement, occurring only one time or less fre-
     quently than once a year, that corrects an out-of-compliance condition and references a valid statutory
     driver in the year programmed. Valid drivers include federal laws, regulatory mandates, and state laws
     applicable to federal activities. The principal legal drivers for natural resources requirements are the
     Sikes Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and National Environmental Policy Act. For
     installations on foreign property, the principal drivers are the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guid-
     ance Document (OEBGD) and the country-specific Final Governing Standards (FGS). Level 1
     projects include the initial preparation and five-year revisions of an INRMP. Projects that implement
     an approved INRMP, to include requirements to manage species and habitats to prevent a listing of a
     candidate species (under authority of the Endangered Species Act), are Level 1 requirements if they
     are essential for the successful implementation of the goals and objectives stated in the plan. Mitiga-
     tion measures required as a prerequisite for regulatory approval of proposed projects (e.g. T/E species
     surveys, jurisdictional wetland delineations) must be funded as part of the proponent’s project cost
     and are not Level 1 environmental requirements.
     15.2.3. Level 2 Requirements. A non-recurring requirement for activities and projects programmed in
     a fiscal year which is in advance of the year in which compliance is mandatory and necessary to pre-
     vent non-compliance beyond the program year. Legal drivers are the same as for Level 1.
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                              49


   15.2.4. Level 3 Requirements. Non-recurring activities and projects that are not explicitly required by
   an applicable legal driver, but are needed to enhance the environment beyond statutory compliance.

15.3. Reimbursable Conservation Program Funds. Funds generated from the sale of forest products,
agricultural products, grazing and cropland outgrants, and the collection of fees for hunting, fishing, trap-
ping and other outdoor recreation activities may be reimbursed to commands and installations for support
of natural resources programs under certain conditions set forth by law. HQ AFCEE/TD is responsible for
the administration and management of reimbursable conservation program funds.
   15.3.1. Forest Management Reimbursements. 10 U.S.C. 2665 authorizes reimbursement of costs
   directly related to the production of forest products with proceeds derived from the sale of the forest
   products. Eligible forestry program reimbursements include obligations funded by O&M (appropria-
   tion 3400) or Other Procurement (appropriation 3080) that are directly related to the economic pro-
   duction and sale of timber, logs, pulpwood, Christmas trees, posts and poles, pine straw, stump wood,
   bark and other mulch, cones, seeds, mistletoe, firewood, and wood chips. Reimbursement of forest
   management obligations to a MAJCOM may not exceed the limit set by funding authorization docu-
   ments, and may not exceed the actual proceeds generated by the MAJCOM in a fiscal year. MAJ-
   COMs must monitor forestry proceeds and obligations within each fiscal year; and reduce the forestry
   program obligations submitted for reimbursement when necessary to avoid a program deficit. Addi-
   tional budget guidance and procedures for the forest management program are located in AFI 65-601,
   Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures. Forest management expenses authorized for reimburse-
   ment from forestry proceeds are:
       15.3.1.1. Forest Improvement. Obligations incurred for the improvement of forest land, to include
       pre-commercial tree thinning, pruning, and the control of undesirable vegetation.
       15.3.1.2. Reforestation. Obligations incurred for establishment and regeneration of forest stands,
       to include preparing sites, planting trees, and controlling insects, disease, and unwanted vegetation
       during the establishment period (3 years).
       15.3.1.3. Forest Protection. Obligations incurred for the protection of forest land capable of the
       economic production of forest products, to include protection from fire, insects, diseases, animals,
       and erosion. Forest management program funds may only be used to reimburse costs of forest pro-
       tection measures that are specifically conducted to protect and enhance a commercial forest
       resource. Obtain reimbursement from proponent activities for costs incurred in mission-related
       fire protection and suppression that supports military training, installation operations, range use,
       munitions testing and evaluation.
       15.3.1.4. Forest Access Roads. Obligations incurred for construction, reconstruction, repair, and
       maintenance of forest access roads and trails used primarily for forest improvement operations
       and the harvest of forest products.
       15.3.1.5. Sales of Forest Products. Obligations incurred in the preparation for sales of forest prod-
       ucts, to include marking, surveying, mapping, appraisal, marketing, contract preparation, contract
       advertising, escorting prospective bidders, contract administration, and enforcing compliance with
       forest product sales contracts.
       15.3.1.6. Administrative Expenses. Obligations incurred for administration of a commercial for-
       est management program, to include supervising, planning, programming, conducting field sur-
       veys, inventories, training, and attending professional forestry meetings.
50                                                                   AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


        15.3.1.7. Forest Management Vehicles and Equipment. Obligations incurred for the procurement
        of vehicles and equipment used exclusively in support of forest management on AF installations.
        See 15.3.6. for further guidance on procurement of vehicles and equipment.
     15.3.2. Department of Defense Forest Reserve Account. 10 U.S.C. 2665, as amended by P.L. 98-407
     and P.L. 99-561, provides for the distribution of net proceeds (gross collections less the obligations
     incurred) from installation forest product sales between the state government and the DoD Forest
     Reserve Account. States in which the revenue was generated receive forty percent of net proceeds for
     each installation that registers a net gain. The remaining net proceeds are deposited to the DoD Forest
     Reserve Account and managed by the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations
     and Environment), (DUSD(I&E)), according to the guidelines in DoD Financial Management Regu-
     lation 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 16, Accounting for Production and Sale of Forest Products.
     Forest Reserve Account funds can be used to fund forestry programs as well as other conservation
     programs and projects that implement the goals and objectives of an approved INRMP. The Forestry
     Subcommittee of the Department of Defense Conservation Committee (see 1.2.2.3.) reviews propos-
     als for Forest Reserve Account funding and recommends projects for approval to DUSD(I&E). The
     HQ AFCEE/TD Forester serves as the AF representative on the Forestry Subcommittee of the DoD
     Conservation Committee. Forest Reserve account funds for approved AF projects are issued through
     HQ AFCEE for further distribution and program oversight.
     15.3.3. Agriculture Program Reimbursements. 10 U.S.C. 2667(d)(4) authorizes the use of proceeds
     from agricultural outgrants and sales of agricultural products to cover the administrative expenses of
     agricultural leasing, and to finance natural resources management activities that implement an
     approved INRMP. These obligations may include costs of normal operations (appropriation 3400) or
     investment equipment (appropriation 3080). Authorized uses of cropland and grazing funds include:
        15.3.3.1. Civilian Pay - limited to persons providing direct support of agriculture programs and
        natural resources management programs on AF installations.
        15.3.3.2. Administrative Expenses – travel, training, attendance at professional and scientific
        meetings, administrative oversight, and supplies that are directly related to the management of
        natural resources on AF installations.
        15.3.3.3. Land Improvements – limited to improvements that increase the productivity or value of
        to land for outgrant purposes.
        15.3.3.4. Vehicles and Equipment – vehicles and equipment purchased with agricultural funds
        may only be used in support of agriculture outgrant management and in support of implementation
        of the INRMP. See 15.3.6. for further guidance on procurement of vehicles and equipment.
     15.3.4. Fish and Wildlife Management Reimbursements. The Sikes Act, 16 U.S.C. 670a(b) (3)(B),
     allows hunting, fishing, trapping and other outdoor recreation fees to be reimbursed back to the instal-
     lation where they were generated. Fish and wildlife management fees are collected into the 57R5095
     accounting classification and, upon approval, are disbursed back to the installation in the 57X5095
     appropriation. These fees must be used only on the installation where they were collected, and used
     only for the protection, conservation, and management of fish and wildlife, to include habitat
     improvement and related activities. Authorized uses of 57X5095 appropriation funds include civilian
     pay, vehicle and equipment procurement, and other administrative expense directly related to the
     management of the fish and wildlife program on the installation. Vehicles and equipment procured
     with 57X5095 funds may only be used to support fish and wildlife management activities that imple-
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                           51


  ment the INRMP. See 15.3.6. for further guidance on procurement of vehicles and equipment. Instal-
  lations must notify their MAJCOM if they terminate hunting, fishing, or trapping programs; so that
  the 57X5095 account can be closed.
  15.3.5. Reimbursable Conservation Program Budget Process. HQ AFCEE/TD will maintain the data-
  base used by MAJCOMs and installations to prepare, authorize, and track reimbursable conservation
  program budgets. Reimbursable conservation program budgets must adhere to the following timeline:
     15.3.5.1. Installations use the reimbursable conservation budget database to prepare annual sub-
     missions for reimbursable conservation program funding by 31 March each year for the upcoming
     fiscal year.
     15.3.5.2. MAJCOMs review, edit and approve installation budget requests by 30 June prior to the
     upcoming fiscal year. MAJCOMs must insure that projected incomes are reasonable and in line
     with program obligations.
     15.3.5.3. HQ AFCEE/TD reviews and consolidates budgets and recommends a final budget to
     HQ USAF/ILEV by 31 August.
     15.3.5.4. HQ USAF/ILEV reviews and approves the final budget by 30 September.
     15.3.5.5. HQ AFCEE/TD transmits the approved budget to SAF/FMB with an information copy
     to the MAJCOMs.
     15.3.5.6. SAF/FMBO issues an operating budget authority (OBA) document as instructed by HQ
     AFCEE/TD in accordance with the approved final budget. The OBA document imposes ceiling
     limitations on the maximum amount of obligations that can be reimbursed to MAJCOMs from
     program proceeds.
     15.3.5.7. HQ AFCEE oversees the distribution of reimbursable conservation funds in accordance
     with the OBA document, and limited by the availability of program proceeds.
     15.3.5.8. MAJCOMs distribute applicable portions of reimbursable conservation program funds
     to their installations, and will monitor expenditures to insure that total MAJCOM obligations for a
     fiscal year do not exceed program proceeds.
  15.3.6. Procurement of Vehicles and Equipment with Reimbursable Conservation Program Funds.
  Authorized obligations under appropriation 3080 for the procurement of reimbursable conservation
  program vehicles and other equipment may be reimbursed with funds generated from the sale of forest
  products, agricultural products, and income from livestock grazing and cropland outgrants. Fish and
  wildlife program vehicles are procured under appropriation 5095 with funds generated from the col-
  lection of hunting, fishing, trapping and other outdoor recreation fees. Use the following procedures to
  procure reimbursable conservation program vehicles and equipment:
     15.3.6.1. Installations identify reimbursable conservation program vehicle and equipment
     requirements in the annual budget submittal by 31 March each year for the upcoming fiscal year.
     Requests for reimbursable conservation program vehicles and equipment are denoted in the bud-
     get submittal under appropriation 3080 for forestry and agricultural vehicles, and appropriation
     5095 for fish and wildlife program vehicles. Include with the budget submittal a report of any
     excess equipment in good condition that is available for trade-in or lateral distribution.
     15.3.6.2. AFCEE/TD reviews vehicle and equipment requirements for technical sufficiency,
     determines whether excess equipment from another installation may be available to meet the need,
52                                                                    AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004


        and submits vehicle and equipment procurement requests in the consolidated program budget to
        HQ USAF/ILEV by 31 August.
        15.3.6.3. HQ USAF/ILEV issues an approved budget to SAF/FMBI, which issues 3080 or 5095
        appropriation funding authority to the MAJCOM.
        15.3.6.4. Upon receipt of approved funding for new or replacement equipment from the MAJ-
        COM, the installation Custodian Account/Custodian Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) custodian submits
        a Table of Allowance Change Request (TACR) to the Supply (LGS) office using the automated
        AF Form 601 in the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS). All AF Forms 601 for
        Integrated Natural Resources Program vehicles/equipment will contain the statement “This
        requirement is approved IAW the provisions of AFI 32-7064 and AFMAN 23-110, Vol. ll, Part
        Two, Chap 22, Section K, paragraph 22.191.”
        15.3.6.5. The installation Supply office validates the vehicle authorization and coordinates the
        approval with the Transportation (LGT) office.
        15.3.6.6. Upon approval and certification from the Supply and Transportation offices, the CA/
        CRL custodian requests an equipment procurement by the appropriate contracting office. The
        request will identify the specifications and value of any vehicle that is available for trade-in to the
        vendor.
        15.3.6.7. The installation Chief of Transportation assigns a local registration number to new vehi-
        cles to track operations and maintenance costs. Vehicles and equipment purchased using the 5095
        appropriation, and vehicles purchased with 3080 appropriation funds that were reimbursed from
        agricultural or forestry proceeds, are reimbursable program assets and may not be used for other
        purposes.
     15.3.7. Reimbursable Conservation Program Vehicle and Equipment Management and Maintenance
     Procedures. The installation natural resources program manager accounts for, inventories, and docu-
     ments all equipment purchase and maintenance costs for vehicles purchased with Reimbursable Con-
     servation Program funds using the following procedures:
        15.3.7.1. Account for Reimbursable Conservation Program vehicles and equipment on a CA/
        CRL, similar to other tools and equipment, using Allowance Source Code “041.” Vehicles and
        equipment purchased with Reimbursable Conservation Program funds are not accounted for on
        the Civil Engineer Vehicle Master Listing.
        15.3.7.2. Maintain a vehicle maintenance log of maintenance operations and costs.
        15.3.7.3. Take inventory of vehicles and equipment during the first month of each fiscal year.
        15.3.7.4. Notify HQ AFCEE of any excess vehicles and equipment available for redistribution.
        Excess vehicles and equipment that were purchased with reimbursable conservation program
        funds will be redistributed to other installations at the direction of the HQ AFCEE program man-
        ager.
        15.3.7.5. Turn in irreparable excess equipment to the nearest Defense Marketing and Reutilization
        Office.

15.4. Legacy Resources Management Program. DoD Legacy Resources Management Program funds
are managed by the DUSD(I&E). Submit pre-proposals and proposals for Legacy funds via the Legacy

                                                Chapter 16

                PUBLIC RELATIONS FOR NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAMS

16.1. Overview.
The public has a vested interest in installation natural resources management. As taxpayers, they provide
the funding of the various programs and, in some cases, they are users of the resources. Members of the
public often serve as volunteers to support natural resources programs where they have a personal inter-
est, and they review environmental documents and management plans affecting these programs when
appropriate.

16.2. Public Relations Program. The installation natural resources manager works with the installation
public affairs office to establish an ongoing natural resources public relations program.
     16.2.1. Heighten public awareness through existing programs such as Coastal America, Watchable
     Wildlife and Tree City USA.
     16.2.2. Use programs, events, and news releases to publicize installation efforts in integrated natural
     resources management.
     16.2.3. Sponsor public events associated with commemorative days such as National Hunting and
     Fishing Day, Earth Day, and National Arbor Day.
     16.2.4. Develop environmental education programs in cooperation with local educational institutions,
     conservation organizations, and public service agencies.
     16.2.5. Regularly issue news releases announcing upcoming events and accomplishments in installa-
     tion natural resources management.

16.3. Public Access to Air Force Land and Water Areas.
     16.3.1. Access for Outdoor Recreation. The installation or wing commander, in consultation with
     Security Forces, Safety Office, and Judge Advocate, determines the extent of access on all areas des-
     ignated in the INRMP as suitable for outdoor recreation. Allow use of outdoor recreation resources by
     the general public when such use is deemed by the commander to be compatible with the military mis-
     sion. Access determinations should address the permissible types of activities, season of access, mis-
     sion sensitivities, and permissible category of user (see 6.2.3.).
     16.3.2. Access to Support Natural Resources Program Goals. Access may be granted to federal and
     state officials who furnish professional advice and technical assistance, and individuals who conduct
     academic research on natural resources. Researchers may collect plants, animals, mineral, or fossils
     on installation lands for valid scientific purposes when compatible with the mission, approved by the
     installation or wing commander or designated representative, and the required federal or state permits
     have been obtained. Access related to partnering efforts with other federal agencies, state agencies and
     institutions, or other conservation organizations is encouraged under conditions where such activities
     adhere to pertinent mission, security, safety, and legal restrictions.

16.4. Special Natural Areas. Areas on AF installations that contain natural resources that warrant spe-
cial protection efforts may, where consistent with the military mission, be designated in the INRMP as a
Special Natural Area. Special Natural Areas may include botanical areas, ecological reserves, geological
AFI32-7064 17 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                              55


areas, riparian zones, scenic areas, and zoological reserves. The INRMP will identify applicable access
and land-use restrictions for each designated area. A Special Natural area designation in an INRMP is a
temporary status that is applicable for the period covered by the INRMP, and can be rescinded by order of
the Installation or Wing Commander. Such areas will be reassessed if the military mission requirements of
the installation change, during any installation realignment or closure action involving the property, or if
the property becomes excess and requires disposal.

16.5. Special Restrictions for Disclosing Natural Resources Information. An installation may deter-
mine that the disclosure of information on the location or character of sensitive natural resources may cre-
ate a substantial risk of harm, theft, or destruction of such resources, an invasion of privacy, trespass on
Government property, or interfere with the military mission. In such cases, the installation will ensure that
documents and other data voluntarily provided to the public do not disclose this information. Denial of
requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act, Title 5, United States Code, Section 552,
as amended by P.L. 104-231, must meet the criteria for appropriate exemptions stated in DoD Regulation
5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, 4 September1998, and the Air Force supplement to
DoD Regulation 5400.7, Department of Defense Freedom of Information Act Program.

                        NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT TRAINING

17.1. Natural Resources Awareness Training. Encourage individuals living or working on AF installa-
tions to demonstrate good environmental stewardship. Incorporate environmental and natural resources
awareness training into newcomer’s orientation briefings and information forums at all levels. The
INRMP will identify the appropriate natural resources awareness training goals for the installation.

17.2. Commander Awareness. The DoD Commander’s Guide to Biodiversity provides basic natural
resources management guidance for installation or wing commanders. The Executive Summary of the
INRMP will make the installation and wing commanders, installation civil engineers, and other senior
officers aware of installation natural resources and inform them of how the natural resources management
program supports mission objectives.

17.3. Training Professional Natural Resources Managers.
     17.3.1. Natural resources managers at Category I installations (see 2.2.1.) must take the course, DoD
     Natural Resources Compliance, developed by the DoD Interservice Environmental Education Review
     Board (ISEERB) and offered for all DoD Components by the Naval School, Civil Engineer Corps
     Officers School (CECOS). See the CECOS website https://www.cecos.navy.mil for schedules and
     registration information. Other DoD environmental management courses can be found at the Army
     Logistics Management College (http://www.almc.army.mil/catalog/coursedescriptions.html) and
     Air Force Institute of Technology (http://cess.afit.af.mil).
     17.3.2. Encourage installation natural resources managers to attend appropriate national, regional,
     and state conferences and training courses. The National Conservation Training Center managed by
     the USFWS (http://www.nctc.fws.gov/) and the Bureau of Land Management Training Center
     (http://www.ntc.blm.gov/) offer a wide range of appropriate natural resources professional courses
     suitable for AF natural resources managers. Encourage natural resource management personnel to
     attain professional registration, certification, or licensing for their related fields.
     17.3.3. All individuals enforcing fish, wildlife and natural resources laws on AF lands must receive
     specialized, professional training on the enforcement of fish, wildlife and natural resources in compli-
     ance with the Sikes Act. This training may be obtained by acquiring certification as a state fish and
     wildlife conservation law officer or by successfully completing the Natural Resources Police Training
     Program course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (http://www.fletc.gov/). Tribal law
     enforcement certification is also appropriate within tribal jurisdiction. Correspondence courses and
     standard Security Forces training do not meet the requirements of the Sikes Act.
     17.3.4. Individuals participating in the capture and handling of sick, injured, or nuisance wildlife
     should receive appropriate training.
     17.3.5. Natural resources personnel supporting the BASH program should receive flight line drivers
     training, training in identification of bird species occurring on airfields, and specialized training in the
     use of firearms and pyrotechnics as appropriate for their expected level of involvement.

Chapter 8 - Management Goals and Objectives. The emphasis of an INRMP using the format
described herein is the achievement of certain goals for the maintenance and improvement of the natural
environment at the installation. Chapter 8 lists the goals and objectives for future natural resources man-
agement on the installation. Also, in cases where off-installation land uses may jeopardize AF missions,
Chapter 8 may list specific goals and objectives aimed at eliminating, reducing or mitigating the affects of
encroachment on military missions. Previous chapters present the important background information
from with the goals and objectives are formed. Chapter 8 states the natural resources management goals
formulated by the preparers of the INRMP from an assessment of the resources, current conditions, and
management issues identified in the previous chapters. Consecutively numbered goals are accompanied
by supporting objectives and projects in a tiered format as shown in the example below. The relationship
between goals, objectives, and projects is as follows:


Goals. Goals are the primary focal points for the implementation of the INRMP over the five years cov-
ered by the plan. A goal should reflect the values of the installation by expressing a vision of a desired
condition for the installation's natural resources in the foreseeable future. Each goal is supported by one or
more objectives.


Objectives. Each goals is supported by objectives which indicate a management initiative or strategy that
will be used to achieve the stated goal. An objective specifically states what will be done and how it will
be done. An objective must be time-bound and measurable. The objective statement, therefore, should
include timelines for completion and quantifiable units for measuring results (e.g. acres treated) so that
you are able to determine exactly when the objective is completed. Briefly explain the performance mea-
sures that will be used to monitor the success or failure in achieving each objective.


Projects. Projects (or Tasks) are the individual component actions required to achieve an objective.
Projects statements describe the specific methods and procedures that will be used (i.e. scopes of work) to
achieve the objective supported. Projects are actions that become line items in the proposed budgets (e.g.
ACES-PM) for INRMP implementation. Projects must be achievable within the period covered by the
INRMP.


Example – Goal with Supporting Objectives and Projects. In the example shown below, note how the
format (goal>objective>project) facilitates an integrated approach to natural resource management. By
using this approach, work tasks such as tree planting or vegetation control support a goal associated with
the principle of ecosystem management, and thus cannot be considered strictly as a "forest management"
program element.

        PROJECT 1.2.3: Apply herbicide release treatments for trees planted in Agriculture tracts 25 and
        101 by June 2005.


Chapter 9 - Implementation. Individual programs and their associated budgets implement the INRMP.
Chapter 10 elaborates more fully on exactly what is going to be done to implement the goals, objectives
and projects listed in Chapter 9.


9.1. Work Plans. List INRMP implementation projects in annual work plans in Chapter 9, or as refer-
enced attachments in the appendix, for the five years covered by the INRMP. For each project and activity
related to the INRMP, provide a specific timeframe for implementation. Identify funding requirements,
appropriate funding source, and priority for implementation. Indicate which projects are “must fund”
requirements, as defined by AFI 32-7001, Environmental Quality Programming and Budgeting. The
work plans should be able to provide all the necessary information for building a budget within the AF
framework.

 STEP                                         ACTION
   1  Notification – Intent to Prepare/Revise an INRMP. Notify the USFWS Ecological
      Services Field Office, USFWS Regional Office, local state fish and wildlife (F&W)
      agency office, office of the state F&W agency Director, and all appropriate internal and
      external stakeholders of the intent to prepare or revise an INRMP within 30 days of
      starting such an action. Also notify the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) if the installation
      includes or is adjacent to marine environments. Develop the framework and schedule for
      a working partnership with cooperating agencies for INRMP development. If formal
      consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is required, the time frames
      for that process will apply.
   2  Preliminary Draft INRMP – Internal AF Review. Distribute a Preliminary Draft INRMP
      for internal Air Force review and comment. Air Force internal review must include a
      MAJCOM review (to include a MAJCOM legal review), and a review by the installation
      Environmental Protection Committee member organizations. The Preliminary Draft
      INRMP shall include the first iteration of goal and objective statements for the INRMP.
   3  Preliminary Draft INRMP – External Agency Review. After incorporation of internal AF
      review comments on the Preliminary Draft INRMP, send the Preliminary Draft INRMP
      with cover letter to the appropriate USFWS Ecological Services Field Office (NOAA
      Fisheries when appropriate) and state fish and wildlife agency for review and comment.
      In the cover letter, designate an installation point of contact, and request receipt of
      comments by a specified date (as determined in Step 1). Send a copy of the forwarding
      cover letter to the appointed Sikes Act Coordinator for the USFWS Regional Office (and
      NOAA Fisheries Regional Office when appropriate) and state F&W agency Director’s
      office to inform them that the review process has begun. Insure that copies of any
      external agency comments are distributed to all cooperating agencies.
   4  Draft INRMP. Prepare a Draft INRMP that incorporates, when appropriate,
      recommendations for improvement to the Preliminary Draft INRMP received during the
      comment period.
    5     Draft INRMP – Public Review. Post a public notification when the draft INRMP is
          available for review and comment. In the public notice, provide an address for public
          response, and allow the public a minimum of 30 days to provide comments.

 STEP                                          ACTION
   6  Final Draft INRMP. Consider all comments received and incorporate them, as
      appropriate, into a Final Draft INRMP. Submit the Final Draft INRMP to the Regional
      Director, USFWS Regional Office (and NOAA Fisheries when appropriate), and to the
      office of the Director of the state fish and wildlife agency. In the submittal letter,
      document the actions taken on comments received on previous drafts. Request that the
      USFWS Regional Director and state Director provide consolidated written comments
      from all appropriate offices and divisions within 60 days of receipt of the final draft
      INRMP. Furnish a copy of this letter to the local USFWS Ecological Services Field
      Office and NOAA Fisheries (when appropriate) and the local state fish and wildlife
      office. Offer to brief the coordinating agencies on the Final Draft INRMP.
   7  Final Coordination Comments. The USFWS Regional Office (and NOAA Fisheries
      Regional Office when appropriate) and the Director of the state fish and wildlife office
      provides written comments on the Final Draft INRMP to the installation point of contact
      within the agreed upon timeline.
   8  Final INRMP. Consider all comments received from coordinating agencies and
      incorporate them into the Final INRMP as appropriate. If no final comments are received
      from the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries, and state after a period of 120 days, the installation
      may request expedited review of its INRMP. In such cases, the MAJCOM will submit a
      written request for expedited review to HQ USAF/ILEV, with copy furnished to the
      USFWS Regional Director (and NOAA Fisheries Regional Director when appropriate)
      and Director of the state fish and wildlife agency. HQ USAF/ILEV will make
      arrangements for representatives from these offices to meet within 30 days of receipt of
      such a request to resolve any outstanding coordination issues.
   9  Signatures. The Installation or Wing Commander (after appropriate legal review), the
      Regional Director of the USFWS, and the Director of the state fish and wildlife agency
      sign the Final INRMP. The Regional Director of NOAA Fisheries also signs the
      document when appropriate.
  10  Publishing. Unclassified portions of the final INRMP will be made available
      electronically via the World Wide Web, CD-ROM, or other similar means. All draft and
      final INRMP documents should undergo appropriate security review prior to being made
      available to the public.
