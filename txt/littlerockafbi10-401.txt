1. Purpose. This document provides guidance for the development and maintenance of locally
produced plans and the plans program. Most LRAFB organizations do not write plans on a
regular basis and are unfamiliar with the format. This guide ensures standardization and the
production of a professional product. In the absence of higher-level directives, this instruction
shall be used for all 19 AW plans.
2. Reference. AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Annex C, provides the source information for this
guide. Although the referenced manual specifically addresses operations plans (OPLANS),
concept plans (CONPLANS) and functional plans (FUNCPLANS); it includes provisions to use
the suggested format in the absence of any other directives for Base Level Plans. An example
standard plan is in Attachment 4. This instruction provides guidance for the development and
maintenance of plans at the unit level.
3. Plan Format. Wing plans are written in the format of the plan, instruction supported and/or
as prescribed in a higher headquarters directive. If no prescribed format exists when developing
a plan, use the format in Attachment 4, this instruction, for locally developed plans. For plans
supporting higher headquarters OPLANS, CONPLANS, and FUNCPLANS the format can be
found in AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2 as a guide. Annex designations for local plans may be
realigned as required. Normally, all plans, unless otherwise directed by an instruction will have
the following elements in the order listed: Cover, Letter of Transmittal, Security Instructions &
Record of Changes and Annual Review, Plan Summary, Classification Guidance (as required),
Table of Contents, Basic Plan, Annexes, Appendices, Tabs, Exhibits or maps, Execution
Checklist (Annex X), Acronyms (Annex Y), Distribution List (Annex Z) and Distribution
Change Memorandum. The following paragraphs discuss each element, accompanied by
detailed examples of the accepted format for each.
     3.1. Plan Cover. The cover must show the date of the basic plan, the overall classification of
     the plan, the issuing Headquarters, the short title and Plan Identification Number (PID) of the
     supported OPLAN/CONPLAN, if any, or name of the supported plan if HQ USAF
     originated. Locally produced plans that do not support HHQ plans will use their unit
     designator, plus a three-digit number and the calendar year, e.g., 19 AW 001-08. Restricted
LITTLEROCKAFBI10-401 26 APRIL 2012                                                                 3


  data or formerly restricted data when required, downgrading/declassification instructions and
  ―CLASSIFIED BY:‖ lines are shown on the lower portion of the cover if the plan is
  classified. Covers will not contain any classified information (Attachment 4).
     3.1.1. Classification. Most local plans are not classified, but are ―FOR OFFICIAL USE
     ONLY.‖ Mark classified plans IAW DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to Marking Classified
     Documents and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Stamp
     applicable plans ―FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY‖ on the bottom of each page to include
     the front and back covers IAW AFI 33-332, Freedom of Information Act Program.
     Classified plans must be red and stamped on the top and bottom, front and back of each
     page to include the front and back cover; appropriate classification are either
     ―Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret.‖ At a minimum plans will be marked as ―FOR
     OFFICIAL USE ONLY.‖
     3.1.2. Header. The header on the front cover for 19 AW plans and LRAFB plans
     follows:
  DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
  HEADQUARTERS 19TH AIRLIFT WING

  LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE, ARKANSAS 72099-5000
         3.1.2.1. Use Times New Roman font, 14 pitch, bold print. Refer to Attachment 4.
     3.1.3. Unit Shields. Place the wing shield (2.5 x 2.3) on the front cover (Attachment 4).
     3.1.4. Designation and Title. All plans (i.e., OPLAN, CONPLAN, etc) that follow
     standard (annex) formatting shall be designated as a ―PLAN.‖ If the plan originates
     within the 19 AW and tasks other units subordinate to the wing, then the plan should be a
     19 AW plan because it does not affect tenant units. If numerous associate organizations
     to include tenant units are involved, or if the scope of the plan encompasses a majority of
     the base populace, designate the plan as a LRAFB plan. The designation of the plan is
     left to the discretion of the originator. Plans have two titles: a long title (e.g., Little Rock
     Air Force Base (LRAFB) Plan 001-11) and a short title (e.g., LRAFB PLAN 001-11).
     Annotate the front cover with the short title of the plan. Locally produced plans that do
     not support HHQ plans will use their unit designator, plus a three-digit number and the
     calendar year as identified in this paragraph, line eight.
     3.1.5. Date: The date on the front cover of the plan corresponds to a date of when the19
     AW/CC signs the letter of transmittal of the applicable plan. Date the front cover of the
     plan, as well as all of the sections of the body of the plan as follows: DD (FULL
     MONTH) YYYY.
     3.1.6. Plan Identification Number (PID). Supporting plans written by LRAFB units
     should follow the plan designator guidance provided by HHQ. Locally produced plans
     that do not support HHQ plans will use their unit designator, plus a three-digit number
     and the calendar year (i.e., 19 AW 001-11).
     3.1.7. Classification Information. If the plan is classified, include the ―CLASSIFIED
     BY:‖ and ―DECLASSIFY ON:‖ entries on the front cover.
 4                                                 LITTLEROCKAFBI10-401 26 APRIL 2012


        3.1.8. Headquarters address (upper right corner) for all 19 AW and LRAFB plans and
        plan subdivisions (Annexes, Appendices, Tabs, and Exhibits) will use the following
        format. Use Times New Roman font, 8 pitch, bold in the header:

           HQ 19 AW
           LITTLE ROCK AFB AR 72099-5000
           (31 AUGUST 2011)
     3.2. Letter of Transmittal. The Letter of Transmittal implements the plan and supersedes the
     previous plan. It briefly tells with whom the plan was coordinated, identifies the OPR,
     instructs the recipient to respond to the OPR within 60 days with any problems encountered
     with the plan, and provides disposition instructions for the superseded plan. The 19 AW/CC
     and the appropriate associate agency commander, if required, will sign the letter (See Atch 4
     for sample).
     3.3. Security Instructions, Annual Review and Record of Changes. The security instructions
     must include the long and short titles of the plan and must be the first page (i) following the
     letter of transmittal. The Annual Review and Record of Changes for the plan may be
     included on the same page. The instructions must contain:
        3.3.1. Classification for supporting plan development or plan execution, which:
            3.3.1.1. Precisely identifies informational elements to be protected, using
            categorization to the extent necessary.
            3.3.1.2. States which classification designation applies (Top Secret, Secret, or
            Confidential) to each element or category of information.
States declassification instructions for each element or category of information.
        3.3.2. Any special access program requirements, such as:
     Briefing and debriefing requirements.
            3.3.2.1. Dissemination instructions.
            3.3.2.2. Reproduction limitations.
            3.3.2.3. Use of ―Nicknames, Code Words, and Exercise Terms.‖
        3.3.3. Classification: If the plan is classified, mark the top and bottom of the page
        accordingly (refer to paragraph 3.1.1.) Annotate the bottom right of the page with the
        ―CLASSIFIED BY:‖ and ―DECLASSIFY ON:‖ statements.
     3.4. Plan Summary. The plan summary is used to provide a brief recapitulation of the
     mission, general situation, concept of operations, major force requirements, command
     arrangements, and commander’s appraisal of the logistics feasibility and transportability of
     the plan. Attachment 4 illustrates the format for the plan summary. If the plan is
     CLASSIFIED, include portion markings and page classification markings.
     3.5. Classification Guidance. For classified plans, insert a Classification Guidance page
     after the Plan Summary to identify the required level and the established duration of
     protection for specific subjects connected with the plan.
LITTLEROCKAFBI10-401 26 APRIL 2012                                                              5


  3.6. Table of Contents. Prepare the Table of Contents as shown in Attachment 4. Annexes,
  Appendices, Tabs, and Exhibits will be assigned appropriate designations as shown in the
  example. If a designated Annex, Appendix, Tab, or Exhibit is not used, state so in the Table
  of Contents. The remaining elements will retain the prescribed designators.
  Note: Annex designations for local plans will be realigned as required.
  3.7. Basic Plan. Attachment 4 contains an example format and suggested content of the
  basic plan. It includes the following five main paragraphs: Situation, Mission, Execution,
  Logistics and Administration, and Command and Control (C2). The basic plan will be
  signed by the wing commander or designated representative. Include a list of references as
  described in the example in Attachment 4.
  3.8. Tasked Organization(s) - Annex A.        Tasked Organization lists all major elements
  directly tasked under the specific plan.
  3.9. Classification of Elements. Mark each individual element (paragraph, figure, diagram,
  map, picture, etc.) within a classified plan with the appropriate classification level. Mark the
  top and bottom of a classified page with the highest classification level of its content.
  Classification markings within the plan must conform to the format prescribed in this
  paragraph and in the example in Attachment 4 regardless of classification level. At a
  minimum plans will be marked as ―FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.‖
  3.10. Annexes, Appendices, Tabs, and Exhibits. List annexes used for the plan on the final
  page of the basic plan. List other attachments (appendices, tabs, exhibits, or maps) on the
  final page of any attachment that has further attachments. The basic plan should refer to each
  annex that has been prepared; however, information provided in the basic plan is not
  normally repeated in the attachments. If the plan is short, annexes (except for Annex A and
  Annex Z) do not have to be included if all the pertinent information is included in the basic
  plan.
     3.10.1. Operations Security (OPSEC). Contact your unit OPSEC Program Manager or
     coordinator in developing your plan. An OPSEC section must be included in each
     respective annex in all plans (IAW AFI 10-701, para. 3.1.3).
     3.10.2. Annex Signature Blocks: The annex will be signed by the appropriate annex
     OPR (for example, group or squadron commander, agency chiefs, etc.). Hard copy
     signatures are not required on each annex; it is acceptable to use
     //Signed//initials/rank/date//. Supporting documentation for signatures must be available
     (i.e., ESSS, SSS, etc)
     3.10.3. Appendices, Tabs, and Exhibits Signature Blocks: Appendices, tabs, exhibits,
     and maps do not require signature or authentication except when distributed separately
     from the basic plan or if the appendix, tab, exhibit or map is the responsibility of another
     organization.
  3.11. Execution Checklist. Some plans may require an execution checklist (depending on
  the complexity, number of organizations involved, time criticality, etc.) of implementation
  actions. All units impacted by a plan will develop a checklist to indicated appropriate actions
  for their group or squadron; these checklist must be briefed to Key Personnel designated by
  their commander within 60 days of assignment and then annually as a refresher.
 6                                                 LITTLEROCKAFBI10-401 26 APRIL 2012


     This annex specifies actions, organizations involved, and the timing for required actions in a
     checklist form (Attachment 4).
     3.12. Acronyms: Annex Y. For quick reference, a consolidated list of all acronyms used
     throughout the plan will be identified.
     3.13. Distribution: Annex Z. The distribution list accounts for all copies of the plan and
     informs users which agencies and headquarters maintain copies of the plan. It is imperative
     each organization tasked in the plan (to include the OPR and support organizations) is on the
     distribution list (Attachment 4). Also, all base agencies that develop plans are required by
     this instruction to comply with the development process outlined in Attachment 3 and must
     provide a disk copy of the plan in addition to the hard copy(ies) for XP. The right column of
     Annex Z, (Attachment 4), COPY NO, is only required for classified plans.
4. Administrative Instructions. Refer to AFMAN 10-401 v2, Annex C, for guidance
concerning the planning of annexes and administrative policy and procedures that affect the
content and organization of annexes. The five major paragraphs of each plan (see paragraph.
3.7.) must be listed in each plan developed with the designated headings, even if they are not
applicable to the plan written. If they are not applicable, ―Not Applicable‖ should be inserted
after the paragraph title (for example, ―4. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS. Not
Applicable.‖) This method permits standardization and enables immediate reference to a
standard paragraph when seeking specific information. The subparagraphs shown in Attachment
4 only provide suggested areas for coverage. These do not specify mandatory subparagraphs.
     4.1. Paragraph and Subparagraph Designations. Designations for subdividing, numbering,
     and lettering paragraphs are: 1., a., (1), (a), 1., a., (1), and (a) respectively.
     4.2. Subparagraph Indentation. When a paragraph is subdivided, it must have at least two
     subdivisions. Each progressive subdivision of a paragraph is initially indented an additional
     five spaces.
     4.3. Page Numbers. Pages are numbered at the bottom center to indicate the page order
     within each element of the plan. Thus, page C-1-A-3 denotes page 3 of Tab A to Appendix 1
     to Annex C. The text of the plan is single-spaced.
     4.4. Dates for Plans Elements. Each separate element of a plan must bear the date of issue or
     revision. Until a plan is revised, all elements should bear the same date of issue.
Rules for Capitalizing and Underlining.
        4.5.1. Use the following format to refer to specific annexes and other attachments:
        Initial Capitals.
        4.5.2. Capitalize and underline paragraph titles as follows: SOLID CAPITALS.
        4.5.3. Designate subparagraph titles in the following format: Initial Capitals.
5. Changes. A plan should be changed, rather than revised if the total adjustments (new or
changed material) affect less than 30 percent of the basic plan, including all attachments. If the
plan needs revision, follow the recommended process as identified in Attachments 3, 5, and 6.
Immediately after the plan has been reviewed forward the results of the review to the plan OPR.
If you are the plan OPR, forward the results of the complete review to             19 XP/XPP no-
later-than 30 days after the anniversary month of the plan. See attachment 7 for format of the
LITTLEROCKAFBI10-401 26 APRIL 2012                                                               7


Review Letter. Changes to the plan will be electronically completed by each plan OPR and the
final updated plan provide to 19 XP/XPP who in turn will post the updated plan to the 19
AW/XP CoP.
   5.1. Identifying Changes:
       5.1.1. All changes must include the date and classification of the basic plan. This
       information must be included in the letter of transmittal accompanying the change.
       5.1.2. The change number and date of the change shall be written in parenthesis below
       the page number for all page changes.
   5.2. Change Methods (for classified plans only).
       5.2.1. The preferred method of change is the page change. Page changes re-issue all
       pages containing changes. A vertical line placed in the margin indicates new or changed
       material.
       5.2.2. Pen and Ink changes are permissible but should be used only for minor
       corrections, such as changes to numbers, dates, single words, short phrases, etc. If page
       changes are also being made, the pen and ink changes are listed on the change letter of
       transmittal or on the AF Form 1565, Entry, Receipt and Destruction Certificate, if
       required.
   5.3. Classification. If the changes affect classified portions, follow the guidelines in AFI 31-
   401 for marking the changes and preparing the AF Form 1565.
6. Responsibilities.
   6.1. Responsibilities. This section spells out specific responsibilities of each agency in the
   planning process.

     19 AW PLAN XXX-XX (OPR: 19 XXX/XXX)
     SECURITY INSTRUCTIONS/RECORD OF CHANGES

1.     The long title of this plan is 19th Airlift Wing Plan XXX-XX, (e.g., Little Rock Air Force
Base Plan 001-12, Air Operations Security). The short title is 19 AW PLAN XXX-XX.

2.    List overall classification required by the plan (at the least the plan should be ―For Official
Use Only‖). Provide guidance for dissemination if the plan is classified.

3.       Provide references for classification guidance if the plan is classified.

     4. The security provisions of AFI 31-401 and AFI 10-701 have been considered in the
     preparation of this plan. Every effort will be made to ensure all subsequent planning,
     preparation, and execution actions pertinent to this plan meet the requirements of these directives.
     OPSEC is an analytical process used to deny an adversary critical information about our planning
     process and operations. During all phases of planning and execution of this plan, ensure the 5-
     step OPSEC process is applied; identify critical information (what to protect), analyze the threat
     (who wants to gain this information), analyze the vulnerability, assess the risk (what risks are you
     willing to accept), and apply countermeasures. Every effort must be made to protect critical
     information during all phases of planning and operations. Review the 19 AW Critical

19 AW PLAN XXX-XX (OPR: 19 XX/XXX)
  BASIC PLAN


         REFERENCES: a. List any maps, charts, or documents needed to understand the basic
                              plan, i.e., AFI XXX, date of document, Title of document, italicized.

                              b. Try to avoid listing documents not generally available to task
                              organizations or that are common knowledge to normal operations.
                              (However, HHQ plans supported must be listed.)

       TASKED ORGANIZATIONS: As required. If listed in a separate chapter or
  appendix, provide reference.

  1. SITUATION

      a. General. Describe the general environment that would establish the probable
  preconditions for execution of the plan.

      b. Support Agencies

         (1) Describe the operations of external units, other than those tasked to support this
  operation, which could have a direct significant influence on the operations envisaged in this
  plan.

         (2) List the specific tasks of supporting units, commands, or governmental agencies
  that will directly support the execution of this plan.

      c. Assumptions. List the assumptions on which the plan is based to include the
  conditions most likely to exist, or other conditions that are likely to have a significant impact
  on this plan or supporting plans. Assumptions should describe the conditions expected over
  which the commander has no control. These assumptions must be directly relevant to the
  development of this plan and supporting plans, and should express conditions that (if they do
  not occur as expected) would invalidate assumptions about specific aspects of the operation.

  2. MISSION. State concisely the task and purpose to be carried out by executing this plan.
  This stated mission should be that of the commander originating the plan.

  3. EXECUTION
     a. Concept of Operations. Although the entire concept of operations should be included in the basic plan,
  some plans must cover alternative courses of action for carrying out the mission. Others will require
  considerable detail to convey adequate guidance for the development of supporting plans. Accordingly, the
  entire concept may be placed in Annex C.
LITTLEROCKAFBI10-401 26 APRIL 2012                                                               25

                                                                       LITTLE ROCK AFB AR 72099-5000
                                                                                             (DATE)

      b. General. The concept of operations is derived from the commander's decision that was
  arrived at through an estimate of the situation. The estimate states how the commander
  intends to carry out the mission.

         (1) It should tell which units are involved, the schedule of operations, the general
  nature and purpose of operations to be conducted, and the interrelated or cross-service
  support, coordination, and cooperation necessary to execute the operations successfully.

        (2) This concept should be sufficiently developed to show an estimate of the level of
  involvement.

      c. Employment. The concept describes how the units are to be employed. It should
  outline plans for the use of any special equipment.

      d. Tasks. In a separate lettered subparagraph, list each task assigned to each supporting
  unit. Each task should be a concise statement of a mission to be performed, either in further
  planning for the operation or in executing the plan. The task assignments should outline all
  of the actions that subordinate elements must perform to fulfill the concept of operations.

      e. Coordinating Instructions. In the final subparagraph, list the instructions that apply to
  two or more elements of the command that are necessary to coordinate the operation, but do
  not belong in any specific Annex. Explain any terms that concern the timing of execution, as
  well as other operational terms that appear in the plan that are not defined elsewhere.

  4. LOGISTICS AND ADMINISTRATION

      a. Concept of Logistics Support. Provide broad guidance on how logistics support will
  be furnished. Provide a general understanding of logistics support requirements and supply
  and sustainment plans. Use additional subparagraphs, as required, to describe the annexes
  for each major aspect of support (Logistics; Civil Affairs; Meteorological and Oceanographic
  Services; Mapping, Charting, and Geodesy; Wartime Host Nation Support; Medical Services;
  Engineering; Services; Force Protection).

     b. Concept of Administrative Support. Provide broad guidance on how administrative
  support and information management will be conducted. Use additional subparagraphs, as
  required, to describe the annexes for each major aspect of administration and information
  management (Intelligence, Personnel, Public Affairs, Safety, Chaplain, Information
  Management, Reports, etc.).

  5. COMMAND AND CONTROL

      a. Command Relationships. Identify the command and control relationships between
  participating units and commands and related items during plan execution. This information
  may be presented in Annex J; in that case, refer to this Annex.

      b. Command Posts. List the designations and locations of each unit involved in
  executing the plan, if applicable. Give the location of any non-local C2 center involved and
  the time it opens and closes.

      c. Succession to Command. Designate in order of succession the unit responsible for
  assuming command of the operation in specific applicable circumstances.

     d. Command, Control and Communications Systems. Give a general statement of the
  scope and type of communications for the operation; refer to Annex K for details.

  Appendices:

  List Appendices to the annex as required. Follow this same listing format for Appendices
  that have Tabs, Tabs that have Exhibits, and Maps.


  NOTE: The five paragraphs outlined above are suggested as the standard for preparing
  functional area annexes, appendices, tabs or exhibits. Although tailoring to specific
  requirements is allowed, these paragraphs should be included to the maximum extent
  possible. The OPR should determine the applicability of this format and reference the
  appropriate chapters of AFMAN 10-401V2 before drafting the annex, etc. The
  subparagraphs serve the needs of the functional area and are not mandatory designations as
  described above.

                   PLAN REVIEW CHECKLIST

     Plan:
     Checklist run by:

        ACTION ITEM                                                Yes   No

        INITIAL:

        1. Review the plan/change upon receipt. Annotate
        ―INITIAL REVIEW‖ or
        ―CHANGE (#) REVIEWED‖.

        2. If a supplement/supporting plan is required,
        initiate the development
        of the plan.

        3. If the plan affects lateral units who are not on
        distribution or
        subordinate units; notify them of the
        plan/requirements.

        4. Notify the OPR of errors / changes.

        ANNUAL OPR REVIEW:

        1. Estimate the necessary time for review,
        coordination, and issuance of
        a change/revision.

        2. Issue a review letter to organizations who are
        tasked, or otherwise
        have an interest (usually all of the distribution list).

        3. Review the contents and mark required changes
        on a working copy.

        4. Review comments / recommendations from
        other units. Ensure comments are received from
        all interested organizations.

               5. Produce change / revision if necessary.

               When to revise a plan. If the number of changes
               is less than 30% then an official change will be
               issued instead of a revision. Do not revise (i.e.
               rewrite) a plan merely to update organizational
               titles, distribution lists, series numbers and titles,
               signature elements, or references (unless these
               items cause significant problems or cause
               confusion).

               6. Annotate review completion. Forward letter
               signed by your Unit Commander to 19 AW/XPP
               NLT the end of the anniversary month of the
               effective date of the plan. Failure to do so will
               result in ―no annual review‖ status.

               COMMANDER'S BRIEFING: Ensure that the
               commander and key positions/personnel are
               briefed on all plans annually and within 60 days of
               taking command. Ensure changes are briefed
               immediately.

     Checklist run by:

        ACTION ITEM                                          Yes   No

        GENERAL:

        1. Is a page change used whenever extensive
        changes are involved,
        when charts are involved, or any time confusion
        could exist as to what
        needs to be changed?

        2. Is a distribution list attached?

        3. When one item is changes, are all related
        actions/items changed
        accordingly?

        4. Has the appropriate coordination been done?

        CHANGE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL:

        1. Is the change properly sequenced?

        2. Is the change dated?

        3. Does the letter contain the required
        information? Does it explain, in
        brief terms, what has changed?

        4. Are pen-an-ink changes clear as to exactly what
        is changed to what?

        5. Are the pages to be changed accurately
        reflected and all attached,
        including reverses?
LITTLEROCKAFBI10-401 26 APRIL 2012                                   41



               PAGE CHANGES:

               1, Are the change number and date of the change
               listed under the page
               number?

               2. Is the date of the plan maintained (i.e., under
               the header)?

               3. Are changes highlighted with a vertical line in
               the left (or outside)
               margin? Are the markings consistent with past
               changes (left side vs.
               outside)?


               When to revise a plan. If the number of changes
               is greater than 30% then a revision will be issued
               instead of a change. Do not revise (i.e. rewrite) a
               plan merely to update organizational titles,
               distribution lists, series numbers and titles,
               signature elements, or references (unless these
               items cause significant problems or cause
               confusion).
