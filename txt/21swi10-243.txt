1. Program Mission:
     1.1. Definition. The Augmentation Program provides an installation wide pool of personnel
     to meet three distinct missions–traditional augmentation requirements and sourcing of
     personnel to support the Peterson Gate Entry Control and Honor Guard programs.
     Traditional Augmentation refers to the need to provide trained personnel to meet short-term
     augmentation needs due to contingencies, wartime, emergency situations, exercises and surge
     deployment shortfalls. The Gate Entrance Control program is commonly referred to as the
     ID Checker Program and provides additional personnel at all gates in the morning to
     facilitate timely entrance to the base during peak morning hours. The Honor Guard provides
     military personnel to support official ceremonies and to honor deceased Veterans. The term,
     augmentation, means that personnel will be utilized in areas other than their assigned duties.
     Augmentation, in this respect, is not justification for requesting changes to the Unit
     Manpower Document (UMD), reclama of an operations plan, or a deployment tasking.
     1.2. Functions. The Augmentation Program is in place to manage augmentation of the
     following units at Peterson AFB (PAFB) and Cheyenne Mountain AFS (CMAFS).
21SWI10-243 9 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    3

21SWI10-243 9 DECEMBER 2010                                                                  5


     2.7.7. Make every effort to forecast requirements for augmentation based on known
     schedules for upcoming exercises and deployment surge manning needs.
     2.7.8. Additional responsibilities for the Security Forces Functional Managers are listed
     in Paragraph 4 of this instruction.
  2.8. Group and Mission Partner Managers (Group Superintendents or designated personnel)
  will be appointed, in writing, by their respective commanders, with a letter forwarded to the
  Program Manager. An alternate for this position will be required as this position is critical
  for activation of the augmentation personnel. Group and Mission Partner Managers will:
     2.8.1. Appoint, in writing and in conjunction with Squadron Commander’s approval,
     Managers in units tasked to supply personnel to meet augmentation allocations.
     2.8.2. Upon notification from 21 SW/CCC, Group and Mission Partner Managers will

     their respective augmented work centers.
     2.8.5. Determine and execute distribution of augmentation taskings among their units.
     Groups and Squadrons must be capable of filling assigned Fair Share allocations. They
     are encouraged to train and appoint at least 150% percent of their allocation in order to
     provide for leaves, deployments, sick call, etc.
     2.8.6. Functional Manager’s will maintain a database to track all assigned augmentees, to

     2.9.4. Functional Managers ensure substitutions are made to replace primary augmentees
     who will be PCSing, separating, or who have otherwise been determined unavailable for
     augmentee duty. This should be accomplished 60 days prior to unavailability. If
 6                                                            21SWI10-243 9 DECEMBER 2010


        substitutions are not possible, units should notify their group/Mission Partner Manager 60
        days prior to unavailability.
        2.9.5. Functional Managers ensure weapons qualifications (Cat A) are maintained for
        personnel assigned to the Security Forces teams.
        2.9.6. Ensure all personnel assigned to a Security Forces team possess a secure area
        badge for CMAFB (area 20).
        2.9.7. Only appoint personnel who possess a SECRET clearance to the SF augmentation
        team.
        2.9.8. Ensure personnel assigned to SF augmentation duty are physically fit. Due to the
        nature of SF tasks, augmentees cannot be on a medical profile that prohibits them from
        physical activities.
        2.9.9. Create and maintain a recall roster for all augmentees in their unit and upon
        direction begin recall of personnel.
     2.10. Augmentees will adhere to the following:
        2.10.1. Unit/Det Manager will coordinate for all leave, TDY, or other situations
        rendering augmentees unavailable to perform duties. Unit Managers will coordinate with
        Functional Managers in turn.
        2.10.2. Attend required training and complete training requirements as outlined by the
        Functional Manager. Immediately notify Unit and Group/Det Managers of all training
        issues.
        2.10.3. Respond to activation recalls in a timely manner. See Paragraph 3.2.4 of this
        instruction.
3. Using the Augmentation Program:
     3.1. Administration:
        3.1.1. Augmentation taskings will be equitable. 21 SW Groups will receive their
        taskings via a fair-share allocation process that ensures no single unit is unfairly taxed to
        support the program.
            3.1.1.1. Mission Partner Organizations on both Peterson AFB and Cheyenne
            Mountain AFB are required to support the program through approved Host Mission
            Support Agreements (HTSA). Augmentation support levels may be identified in
            those documents. If specific requirements are not identified in a HTSA, then two
            methods can be used to establish support levels; calculations described in Paragraph
            3.1.2.1 of this instruction or a negotiated support level.
            3.1.1.2. For units where HTSAs do not require support of the program, voluntary
            participation is highly encouraged.
        3.1.2. Fair Share Calculation
            3.1.2.1. Fair Share Calculations will be re-accomplished at least annually, NLT 30
            Sep, to verify that manning numbers are still relevant. Should any major mission or
21SWI10-243 9 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    7


          manning changes occur, a new Fair Share can be recalculated at the direction of the
          ARB.
          3.1.2.2. Total authorized (funded) manpower end-strengths from 4th quarter data will
          be used to establish an available pool for each Group or Mission Partner. All Field
          Grade Officers, Company Grade Officers, Senior NCO’s, First Sergeants, and Civil
          Service positions will be removed from the initial baseline. The resulting pool
          numbers will be multiplied by 85% to account for fluctuations in assigned personnel.
          Potential worse-case AEF deployments will be accounted for by further reducing the
          pool by 50%. The net reductions for personnel manning and AEF worse-case
          deployments will result in a reduction of the initial baseline pool to 42.5%.
          EXAMPLE:
UMD Funded Authorization                       175
FGOs, CGOs, Sr. NCO’s, 1st Shirt (5)             -5
Civilians (12)                                  -12
Initial Pool                                   158
Personnel Manning (85%)                       x .85
                                               134
AEF Worse-Case (50%)                          x .50
Final Available Pool                             67
          3.1.2.3. The final available pool figures for units/groups will be added together and
          divided by the total validated augmentation requirements for the program. This
          number will be used as a Fair Share Percentage and applied against each unit/group’s
          available pool. The resultant figure will be that organization’s Fair Share Allocation.
          The following example illustrates the Fair Share Allocation process. EXAMPLE:
Group X available pool                         154
Group Y available pool                         125
Group Z available pool                          67
Total Avalable                                 346

Total Augmentation Requirements                  55

Fair Share Percentage = 55/346 = 15.9%
Group X available pool              154 x 15.9% = 24.49 = 24 (Fair Share Allocation)
Group Y available pool              125 x 15.9% = 19.88 = 20
Group Z available pool               67 x 15.9% = 10.65 = 11
Total Augmentation Requirement                            55
          3.1.2.4. Except under real-world emergencies, no group will be tasked to provide
          more than their Fair Share Allocation without ARB approval.
       3.1.3. Augmentation requirements will be based on an established and validated need,
       coordinated by 21 SW/CCC and approved by 21 SW/CV.
          3.1.3.1. Functional Managers will establish the need for augmentation requirements
          IAW Attachment 2. Requests will be submitted to 21 FSS/FSMM for validation.
8                                                          21SWI10-243 9 DECEMBER 2010


           3.1.3.2. All augmentation requirements will be validated by the Manpower Office.
           Once a request is finalized, Manpower will forward the request to the Program OPR
           through the Program Manager. The Program OPR will coordinate with 21 SW/CCC
           and the Augmentation Working Group to determine whether the request should be
           presented to the ARB for approval or disapproval.
       3.1.4. Changes in team requirements or addition/deletion of an augmentation team will
       require establishment of a new fair share allocation.
       3.1.5. Augmentees will not be removed from the program without squadron commander
       approval and group manager coordination. Tasked units will provide a replacement when
       an augmentee is within two months of separation, retirement, or PCS, and will provide
       appointments letters for replacements 60 days prior. Variations will be worked on a case
       by case basis. It is highly encouraged to add augmentation membership to all out
       processing checklists.
       3.1.6. Augmentees may be used during local exercises, contingency/wartime operations,
       or surge manning requirements due to deployments. Call-ups may be determined and
       pre-approved by the Program OPR. Length of augmentation will not exceed the length of
       the temporary situation.
    3.2. Call-up/recall procedures are as follows:
       3.2.1. Functional Managers will flow augmentation call-up requests through their chain
       of command to the 21 SW/CV (OPR). Call Up’s should automatically be made in
       BRAVO, then released on 6 ring by 21 SFS/S3T.           Short notice activations may
       necessitate verbal approval from 21 SW/CV.
       3.2.2. 21 SW/CV will review request for augmentation and once approved notify 21
       SW/CCC to contact Group Managers and Mission Partner POCs to begin recall of
       required teams.
       3.2.3. Group and Mission Partner Managers will direct Unit Managers to implement
       recall of assigned Augmentation Team personnel. During activation of SF augmentees,
       units will direct the recall of all primary SF augmentees who will immediately report to
       21 SF. 21 SF will review current qualifications of personnel and only arm qualified
       individuals. Excess or personnel not fully certified will be released to their unit for
       normal duty.
       3.2.4. Recalling augmentees for training purposes must be pre-scheduled through the
       owning Group/Unit Managers.
       3.2.5. When performing augmentee duties for standard wing/unit recalls, personnel will
       report first to their respective squadrons for strength reporting and then immediately
       report to their augmentee work centers. Once personnel arrive at their augmentee work
       centers, they will sign in on a work center roster and await instructions regarding shift
       assignment and duty hours. Functional Managers may coordinate separate reporting
       instructions with owning units and augmentees prior to use.
       3.2.6. During an exercise or real-world situation, shortfalls will be directly reported to
       the Group/Mission Partner Manager and the 21 SW/CCC.
