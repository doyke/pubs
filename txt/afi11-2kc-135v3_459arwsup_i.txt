                                            Chapter 2

                                 COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC) Global Cell, Pacific
Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air Operations Center
(AOC), Air National Guard Readiness Center (ANGRC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
Command Center, theater Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC), Air Mobility Division
(AMD), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility
Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), and Special Tactics Teams
(STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF commander with execution authority
(operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The pilot in
command will execute missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last
known mission orders or best course of action).
2.2. (459ARW)Execution Authority. The 459 OG/CC has final authority for cancellation,
early termination, or extension of local training missions. Obtain approval to deviate from the
published schedule through 459 ARW Command Post (459 ARW CP). While coordinating
approval from the OG/CC, command post will confirm with MOC that a later landing time will
not affect the aircraft‘s turn time to a subsequent sortie. In the event one or the other sortie will
be lost, the OG/CC will determine which sortie has priority.
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for
   procedures and requirements governing OSTs.
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/DOOM) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights on
a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. An unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs
are:
2.3. (459ARW)Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. An Orders
Authenticating Official is the only person authorized to add a crewmember to a 459 ARW Flight
Authorization at home station. If one of those individuals is not available to add a crewmember
to flight orders, then that crewmember may not fly.
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC‘s judgment, an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events [for example, air refueling
   (AR) or transition training] after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                         19


   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents. If on an
   Integrated Flight Management (IFM) sortie, contact the flight manager before signing the
   flight plan, if time and circumstances permit.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC‘s behalf.
   2.3.6. (459ARW) The AC is charged with keeping applicable C2 agencies informed
   concerning mission progress. The boom operator will normally monitor the appropriate
   command post frequency on the ground and during inflight ops when within radio range of
   the 459 ARW Command Post (CP). The crew will keep 459 ARW CP informed of all delays;
   especially those problems that may result in a late takeoff or require further coordination with
   the receiver unit.
       2.3.6.1. (Added-459ARW) At the last enroute stop of each day on an off-station
       mission, ACs will contact 459 ARW CP directly to relay sortie information. As a
       minimum, pass takeoff and landing times, duration, maintenance status, and any changes
       to itinerary.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Ground Personnel
   (MEGP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required by en route or terminal weather conditions.
   2.4.1. (459ARW) The term ―Home Run‖ will be used to recall aircraft on local missions.
   When directed to execute ―Home Run‖ the AC will confirm (if passed from an ATC facility)
   and immediately return to KADW for termination.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR) are suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority

    for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate ground
    service agencies to prepare for arrival.
2.5.   Operational C2 Reporting.
2.5. (459ARW)Operational C2 Reporting. The 459 ARW CP maintains flexible operating
hours which vary according to local unit requirements. The 459 ARW CP will operate on
reduced hours (on an as-needed basis) for all departures and recoveries on non-UTA weekends.
After duty hours, the 459 ARW CP Duty Officer can be reached by calling 240-857-5556 (DSN
857-5556) and reviewing the recorded message. The 316 AW Command Post (call sign ―Griffin
Control‖) can be reached by calling 301-981-5058 (DSN 858-5058) and operates on UHF 378.1
or VHF 141.55. The 459 ARW CP (call sign ―Liberator‖) operates on VHF 143.8 and UHF
351.2, which is a shared frequency with 756 ARS Operations (call sign ―Tiger Ops‖). When
there is an Operation Supervisor (Ops Sup) on duty, they will be available via Tiger Ops
frequency.
    2.5.1. Stations with MAF C2 agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data (arrival,
    departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
    2.5.2. Stations without MAF C2 agency. Transmit mission data to the controlling C2 agency
    by any means available (i.e., DSN, HF, Data Link, SATCOM, iridium phone, etc.). For
    critical C2 communications (i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc.), voice
    communications are the primary method.
    2.5.3. En route Reporting.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to 618 TACC:
           2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
           2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
           2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, when patient condition changes or
           arrival time is greater than plus or minus 30 minutes from scheduled. This call must
           be made no later than 1 hour prior to landing, to update arrival time.
           2.5.3.1.4. Uncoordinated aircraft interceptions via the most expeditious means
           available, after complying with guidance in the flight information handbook.
           Consideration will be given to the phase of flight and aircraft emergencies. When an
           airborne report is not accomplished, PICs must directly notify 618 TACC upon
           landing. In all cases ensure local C2 and Intel agencies are informed.
       2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions are not required; however,
       the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
       2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
       through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
       FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
       plan within aircraft equipment capabilities.
    2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting PICs shall report aircraft system
    malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible.
    Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.

  2.5.5. Air Refueling Mission Reports.
     2.5.5.1. Tanker AR Report. On operational missions, pilots will provide the following
     information after a tanker AR. Under normal circumstances, send only one offload
     message, completed after the final AR for the mission. Under abnormal circumstances
     such as receiver diverts, unsuccessful AR, insufficient offload, or anything else that
     impacts the overall success of the mission, send a report as soon as practical.
         2.5.5.1.1. Call Sign.
         2.5.5.1.2. Fuel offloaded.
         2.5.5.1.3. Mission status.
         2.5.5.1.4. Next station.
         2.5.5.1.5. ETA.
     2.5.5.2. Receiver AR Report. On operational missions, report the following AR
     information to the destination C2 agency after landing. C2 agencies will enter the
     information in the MAF C2 system for missions under their control. The MAJCOM C2
     agency will enter the data for all missions. Include all scheduled ARs not accomplished.
         2.5.5.2.1. AR track.
         2.5.5.2.2. Scheduled Onload.
         2.5.5.2.3. Actual Onload.
         2.5.5.2.4. Reason Code.
         2.5.5.2.5. Additional Comments.
     2.5.5.3. Reason Codes. Reason codes indicate the outcome of air refueling activity.
     Codes are normally used when a problem or situation affects the successful
     accomplishment of the air refueling. The Reason Code ―AC‖ will be used when air
     refueling was complete without delay or mission impact. Additional comments are
     mandatory for all reason codes except AT, WX, and AC.
         2.5.5.3.1. RO-Receiver Operations.
         2.5.5.3.2. RM-Receiver Maintenance.

   2.5.6. ―Thirty Minute‖ Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
   C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
   (ETB).
   2.5.6. (459ARW) During mission recovery, the boom operator will normally make a 30-
   minute out call to 459 ARW CP with the projected landing time, maintenance status, and any
   passenger service requirements. After landing the boom operator will call 459 ARW CP to
   report landing and pickup time at the aircraft. The ops sup coordinator should monitor the
   appropriate frequency to stay abreast of this information.
   2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) sorties. On IFM sorties, the flight managers
   (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aviators. For critical C2 communications, voice
   communications (HF, DSN, SATCOM, iridium phone etc.) are the primary method.
      2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM sorties. IFM sorties transiting oceanic flight
      information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase ―Pass to Hilda‖ to ATC voice position
      reports (N/A for datalink sorties). Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in
      the aircrew flimsy for C2 phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after
      exhausting normal communication methods.
   2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of voice access to
   the worldwide C2 network. If secure global communications are required, use secure UHF
   SATCOM or Iridium satellite phone with secure sleeve.
      2.5.8.1. The secondary HF radio (if equipped) should be operated to the max extent
      possible in Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) mode to support voice contacts between
      the PIC and MAJCOM C2.
   2.5.9. SATCOM System (SAT-2000). SATCOM telephone calls are ―FOR OFFICIAL USE
   ONLY‖ and calls will only be made when other means of communications have been
   exhausted and an urgent operational need exists. For more information, refer to the AMC
   Aircraft                 Voice                   INMARSAT                      CONOPS,
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a33/A33O/Publications%20-%20Main.htm.
   2.5.10. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
   transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
   2.5.11. Iridium Phone. Iridium phones may be used for communications between aircrews
   and command and control agencies when beyond-line of sight C2 is required and other line
   of sight communications, HF or SAT-2000, do not provide proper security or timeliness. For
   more information, refer to AMC Iridium Satellite Phone CONOPS for Aircrews,
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a33/A33O/Publications%20-%20Main.htm.
      2.5.11.1. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
      2.5.11.2. Turn off Iridium phones during takeoff, receiver air refueling, approach, and
      landing. At the discretion of the PIC, the Iridium phone may be left on during tanker air
      refueling operations.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
2.6. (459ARW)Mission Commander (MC). The Sq/CC or Operations Officer will designate a
Mission Commander when more than two aircraft are assembled to perform missions away from
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                     23


home station. The Mission Commander will be designated with code ―Z‖ on the 459 ARW Flight
Authorizations.
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to
   perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a
   MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For IFM sorties, MC shall coordinate any special
   mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24 hours prior to
   mission execution.
      2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
      designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an operation.
      For AMC-tasked missions this responsibility falls to 618 TACC. The OG/CC or
      equivalent for the lead planning agency will designate a MC. The MC will be a rated
      (normally field grade) officer qualified in the type mission.
      2.6.1.2. For fighter moves, a planner in the tasked unit(s) will coordinate tanker support
      with Air Combat Command (ACC) Air Operations Squadron (AOS) and provide tanker
      flight planning based on ACC AOS/AODX produced profile.
   2.6.2. During MAJCOM AOS planned moves, the tanker MC is the final authority and shall
   ensure tanker aircrew members have properly coordinated mission details for the deployment
   IAW AFI 11-207, Combat Aircraft Delivery.
      2.6.2.1. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
      The MC and all tanker aircrew members will attend the appropriate MAJCOM
      AOS/Delivery Control Officer (DCO) pre-takeoff briefing. The PIC may excuse boom
      operators from required briefings to accomplish preflight duties. Cover tanker specific
      information in the pre-takeoff briefing to coordinate all takeoff, formation, en route, AR,
      and recovery requirements between tanker and receiver aircraft.
      2.6.2.2. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
      will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
      rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures.
2.7. DUAL ROLE Procedures
   2.7.1. A valid DUAL ROLE contains the following:
      2.7.1.1. A MAJCOM-validated AR requirement. 618 TACC/XOOK must receive
      validated requirement NLT 14 days before mission start date to ensure proper mission
      support.
      2.7.1.2. A MAJCOM validated and 618 TACC/XOOKP approved user cargo
      requirement of at least two pallets of cargo, not including baggage.
   2.7.2. Since DUAL ROLE is primarily an AR mission, the tanker must first meet the AR
   requirement without regard to protecting ancillary cargo capability.
   2.7.3. AMC does not guarantee DUAL ROLE ancillary cargo movements and will not
   expend additional tanker sorties or hours for the purpose of moving ancillary cargo.
 24                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   2.7.4. 618 TACC will normally refuse DUAL ROLE requests that require excessive KC-135
   positioning or de-positioning time unless KC-135 aircrew members will receive effective
   training on positioning and de-positioning legs.
NOTE:
 MAJCOM/A3/DO may grant exceptions for missions that do not meet these criteria but reduce
total fiscal cost, do not impact other tanker requirements, and present the most practical means
available to move cargo. For AFRC and ANG missions, consider unit identified training needs
to justify positioning and de-positioning time.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Table 2.1 contains a list of 618 TACC phone numbers.
Crewmembers may also use the 618 TACC toll-free number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL, to contact other
offices within the 618 TACC, including flight managers.
2.8. (459ARW)C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. The unit listing of key telephone numbers
(459 ARW CP, AFRC CP, etc.) is maintained in the aircraft commander‘s mission package
which is issued by 459 OSF Current Operations for each sortie.

2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and Rescue
(CSAR); Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention.
PICs will promptly notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-
time departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned ETD,
and estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures
service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities‘ requests for assistance through
appropriate C2 channels.
2.11. Enroute Maintenance Support. 618 TACC/XOCL will support all mobility aircraft
requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance regardless of type of mission or component.
Refer to paragraph 2.8 for 618 TACC telephone numbers.

                                         Chapter 3

                      AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, Operational Risk Management considerations, and other constraints to safely
accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1 summarizes crew position requirements for different
crew types.
   3.2.1. The minimum crew member complement for a local training flight is an aircraft
   commander and a pilot/copilot, plus one crew member trained in additional required
   checklist duties (e.g. alternate gear and flap lowering, downlock removal, etc.).
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
   basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
   (MR) IAW AFI 11-2KC-135, Vol 1. EXCEPTIONS: A Non-Mission Ready (NMR) pilot
   may augment provided the other two pilots are MR IPs. A NMR BO may be used as an
   augmentee if accompanied by a MR instructor BO. The NMR BO must be qualified to
   perform the required mission (i.e., cargo qualified, fighter qualified, etc.) or else be
   supervised by the instructor BO during all portions of the mission for which he/she is not
   fully qualified. SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the full Flight Duty Period (FDP). The
   MAJCOM/A3/DO may augment aircrews while the flight is underway (see paragraph 3.11
   for more on CDT/FDP).

Table 3.1. Aircrew Complement.

NOTE:
   1. An additional BO should be included for scheduled cargo operations.
   2. An additional crew member certified by SQ/CC in passenger handling, must be assigned
   to the mission when more than 10 passengers (Space A/MEGP/Duty Pax) are carried. Up to
   three dedicated crew chiefs do not count against the number of passengers.
 26                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   3. A basic navigator may be added to an augmented crew (non-SOAR mission) (N/A ANG).
   In this case, the PIC will determine a work/rest plan that affords the navigator sufficient rest
   periods during the mission.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification
training, to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form
   8) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary crew position
   when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, for
   procedures and requirements governing senior leader flying.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Staff Course will log ―FP/FN‖ for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log ―OP/ON‖
   for Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
   Flight Data Document.
3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining
currency or qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall augment the PIC for missions over 16 hours Flight Duty Period (FDP)
   and designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The PIC shall brief
   the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.2. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF Form
   8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board.
       3.4.2.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under
       direct IP supervision.
       3.4.2.2. Pilots shall not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers or hazardous cargo on
       board. Touch-and-go landings and stop-and-go landings are authorized with Mission
       Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP) on board.
   3.4.3. ACs may perform receiver AR from the right seat when authorized by SQ/CC and
   while under direct IP supervision.
3.5. Navigators. A non-current or unqualified navigator may serve as a primary aircrew
member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor navigator (N/A ANG). An IP
may supervise navigators regaining currency on non-SOAR missions (NA/ANG).
3.6. Boom Operators. A non-current or unqualified BO may serve as a primary aircrew
member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor BO (direct supervision for
critical phases of flight).
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                  27


  route, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
  Reduce FDP when the autopilot altitude hold fails or FMS cannot be coupled to the autopilot
  after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot fails after departure, consider
  mission requirements and determine the best course of action to preclude further mission
  delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include diverting to an airfield
  with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and comply with limitations.
     3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
     when the autopilot altitude hold is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be coupled to the
     FMS). Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend to
     augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall augment
     basic crew to extend FDP).
         3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
         weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
         augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
         long as:
             3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
             the first takeoff of the day.
             3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
             rest en route.
         3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
         authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
         mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
         delays. C2 agents shall not ask a PIC to exercise this option.
     3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24 hours
     (16 hours when the autopilot altitude hold is inoperative or the autopilot cannot be
     coupled to the FMS).
         3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the
         mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en
         route. As a minimum, the mission profile must provide the following:
             3.7.1.2.1.1. No more than 4 intermediate stops total.         No more than 2
             intermediate stops after 16 hours of FDP.
             3.7.1.2.1.2. Mission profile shall include at least one 6 hour leg or two 4 hour
             legs.
             3.7.1.2.1.3. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions.
             PICs may swap an extended ground time (4 hours) for a mission leg when
             conditions afford aircrew members a chance for rest.
     3.7.1.3. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.4. Training and Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs)
     FDP:
 28                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


          3.7.1.4.1. Maximum FDP for training and FCF/ACF missions is 16 hours (12 hours
          when the autopilot altitude hold is inoperative or the FMS cannot be coupled to the
          autopilot).
          3.7.1.4.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, air refueling
          events, transition events, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
          3.7.1.4.3. ANG and AFRC crewmembers may perform mission-related events on
          local training missions provided their time from start of duty does not exceed 16
          hours and actual flight duty does not exceed 12 hours.
             3.7.1.4.3.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and
             civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first duty
             period (military or civilian).
   3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
   combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
   mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
   duties for other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
   Maximum CDT is 18 hours for a basic aircrew and 24+45 hours for an augmented aircrew.
   3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
   SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
   flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
   member early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
      3.7.3.1. For self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report
      times with C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
      3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Deadhead Time. IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, deadhead time is the time
   computed traveling in passenger status. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the
   purpose of positioning or de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support
   function. Crewmembers may deadhead for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent
   may approve crewmembers to deadhead in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      deadheading, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report time for
      deadhead flight).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties, for a
      maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-
   /offload, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 9. The
   duty day begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. In accordance with Chapter 9 of AFI 11-202V3, SQ/CCs shall
not schedule an aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    29


   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.
3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
   3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following
   ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section
   provides AMC/A3/DO guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that
   help aircrew initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew rest
   periods. Fliers on augmented aircrews shall not use no-go pills in flight.
   3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
   fatigue management tool.
   3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
   with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CC (may delegate to but no lower than
   squadron commander), and with each individual aircrew member. During extended
   deployments, aircrew members will only obtain no-go pills from a deployed USAF FS. The
   deployed flight surgeon shall consult with the home unit medical team prior to dispensing no-
   go pills to deployed fliers.
   3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
   medication with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter fatigue ORM model is available
   for mission planners, OG/CC, crew, and FS on the AMC/A3V website.
   3.9.5. Home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
   counter fatigue program is the point of contact for no-go prescription. Upon request, the FS
   will advise/assist the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by
   duty day length, departure and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
   3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
   notification procedures if prescribed no-go pills.
   3.9.7. (N/A ANG/AFRC)The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when
   missions fall into any of the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are
   therefore candidates for no-go medications):
      3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
      3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, cooled, and
      darkened).
      3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
      3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules with greater then 6-hour flight time duration.
      3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
   3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
   of consuming no-go pills (consider DNIF). Exception: commanders may reduce the 12-hour
 30                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   timeline after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short
   duration effect. In no case will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a timeline where they
   would be under the effect of the medication while they perform aircrew duties (use mission
   report or legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go medication).
   3.9.9. Aircrew member‘s responsibilities:
      3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive FS
      clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
      3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within 12-hours after consuming
      a no-go pill.
      3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go pills within 12 hours of consuming
      alcohol.
      3.9.9.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
      supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
      potential interactions.
      3.9.9.5. Limit use of Restoril (Temazepam) and Ambien (Zolpidem) to a maximum of
      seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in a 60-day period.
      3.9.9.6. Limit use of Sonata (Pyrazolopyrimidine) to a maximum of 10 consecutive days
      and no more than 28 days in a 60-day period.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead
   aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time.
   Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the
   first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12
   hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers
   to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC, ANG, and AETC in accordance
   with AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
      shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
      members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
      rest period after they complete official duties.
      3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
      flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-
      /offload, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
   17 hours ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
      3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    31


         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
         the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
         to complete mission planning, cargo up-/offload, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 17 hours ground time.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 17 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
     cumulative affects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods will be of minimum duration.
  Tasking authorities will approve requests to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle
  or increase messing options when mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2
  agent will inform the PIC of the reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A ANG, AFRC and AETC).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Crew Chief (CC) Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed
  FCC or MEGP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with
  enroute/transient maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief
  can safely perform aircraft maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the CC has sufficient
  time in each 24-hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101,
  Maintenance Operations and Management Policy, for detailed guidance.
  3.10.6. (459ARW) ACs will brief crew chiefs on preflight/postflight duties, transportation
  arrangements, and any other coordination of duties for the mission.
  3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
  criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
  or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
  3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
  parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
  accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
 32                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
       the departing aircrew‘s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest
       location‘s Prime Knight function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
       rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
       advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
       reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
3.11. (459ARW)Alerting Procedures. Crew show/brief time for local missions will be
annotated on the flying schedule and may vary based on mission requirements. During off-
station AE missions the AC will coordinate alert times with the MCD and pass requirements to
the controlling agency if the alert time for the medical crew differs from that of the primary
flight crew.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 4+l5 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
   hour for reporting and 3+l5 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations may
   increase or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish
   self-alert procedures for local training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
       alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
       may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
       cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
       agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants, C2 agents may alert boom
       operators up to 2 hours before normal alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the
       PIC and C2 agent must notify the BO before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the BO
       more than 1 hour before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the BO‘s
       show time.
       3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
       is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
       aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
       3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
       3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
       aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
       coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       33


      missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
      avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
      3.11.2.1. On the aircrew‘s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
      agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
      3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
      alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
      12 hours when deadheading. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept
      more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as
      necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT).
      3.11.2.2. (459ARW) Schedulers and crew members will provide availability for 24
      hours beyond the mission‘s scheduled return time (SRT). While TACC will make every
      attempt to return a crew to home station on the SRT, it is legal to extend AFRC crews for
      an additional 24 hours (Firm Scheduled Return Time) on operational missions.
      Reference AMCI 11-206, Mobility Force Management, for further detail.
      3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
      during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
      the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
      from the time of notification.
      3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if the mission risk becomes elevated
      and the aircraft commander determines the overall risk of the mission prohibits safe
      continuation, he/she will contact a C2 agent and establish a new expected alert time.
3.12. Stage Management
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
      3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
      3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
      3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
      3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
      mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew‘s FDP expires. Aircrews in a
   mechanical stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location
   while they are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to
   complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not
   normally establish a mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped
   aircraft.
   3.12.2. (459ARW) AFRC crews flying unit-equipped aircraft should not normally be
   mechanically staged. Contact 459 ARW CP and AFRC Command Post if necessary.
 34                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in
ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for
contingencies. After 48 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure
crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force
Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be
   placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest.
   Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. Close the crew entrance door and
   seal in a manner which will prevent entry without damage to the seal. The aircrew preflight
   portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another
   crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be accomplished
   on a case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must be present if
   access to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and control and the controlling agency
   are notified when uncocking and recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done
   during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent
   directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP
   when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if
   required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter
   them into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby
   force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a
   12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be
   able to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12
   hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      35


   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another model design series (MDS). AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit
OG/CCs for active duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly. Units utilizing
this authority will inform AFRC/A3V. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing
Commanders for active duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG
to ANG interfly. ANG units will ensure appropriate active duty General Officer support staff
has notified the Air Force Directorate of Personnel General Officer Management Office
(AF/DPG) prior to any active duty General Officer flying with their unit. Participating aircrews
will use guidelines established by the host command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements. Conduct interfly
operations as follows:
3.15. (459ARW)Interfly. Interfly of crews or aircraft must be approved by AFRC/DO.
Contact 459 OG/CC to initiate the request.
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS, as well as unique
   systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
   3.15.2. Each affected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.3. MDS conversion training.
       3.15.3.1. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion.
       OG/CCs will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will
       include as a minimum a list of effected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.
3.16. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are
authorized ACM status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility
operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany
the normal crew compliment are allowed ACM status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in ACM status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
 36                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave.
EXCEPTION:
 ANG/AFRC Air Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to
perform in a military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive (Form 59).
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All ACMs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing ACM
   status. OG/CCs may authorize ACM status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other ACM. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. ACMs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of ACMs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for ACMs.
   3.16.5. The PIC or designated representative, will brief ACMs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an ACM aircrew-related duties for which the ACM is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. ACMs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). Procedures and policies regarding
MEGP are contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in
this status are properly authorized.
3.17. (459ARW)Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). The OG/CC may approve
MEP travel. Touch and go landings with MEPs onboard should be limited to essential training
requirements. Practice Emergency Procedures (EPs) are not authorized. Reference AMCI 11-
206, Mobility Force Management, for further guidance.
3.18. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                   37


                                          Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
Document; include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft
status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items
without proper waiver authority.      A PIC who accepts an aircraft with degraded
equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent operations with the same degraded
equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with degraded equipment accepted by another
PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the
   governing directive(s) of waiver request to include volume, chapter, or paragraph. Initiate
   waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
 38                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through channels
   to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background information and
   submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
4.3. (459ARW)Waiver Protocol. Waiver authority is based on ―who‖ has operational control
and execution of the aircraft performing a specific mission. The aircraft commander determines
the need for a waiver and initiates the request. The diversity of KC-135 operations on various
worldwide missions complicates the task of balancing operational reliability with safe mission
completion. The 459 OG/OGV is always available (through 459 ARW CP if necessaary) for
advice, no matter which agency is controlling the mission.
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority
   for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes
   Operational Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. For
   AMC-directed missions contact HQ AMC/A3V through 618 TACC.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization. NGB/A3 delegates waiver
   authority to the unit OG/CC.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting EDs. Most EDs allow
   maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted status; dispositions of this
   nature do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew operations require MEL
   waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior
       to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority.
       The waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue.
NOTE:
Deviations from the flight manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      39


4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are
listed by number installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements for home station
TDY departure (operational or training missions) are defined in Column A. All other missions
fall under Column B. An asterisk (*) in the Required column indicates the number required is
situation dependent; refer to the Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
       4.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: A Red X discrepancy must be downgraded
       through maintenance channels prior to flight. MEL waiver may still be required. This
       condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers. The priority is to move the
       airplane to a repair capable facility. PICs must coordinate with appropriate agencies to
       ensure repair capability exists at the destination. One-time flights may include en route
       stops only when necessary to recover the airplane. Example: An airplane departs on a
       gear-down flight from Djibouti IAP and requires an en route fuel stop (Cairo) before
       landing at the nearest repair capable facility, Sigonella NAS.
          4.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the
          nearest (shortest en route time) repair capable base.
          4.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the
          nearest repair capable facility.
       4.5.1.2. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
          4.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
          scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate
          item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
          determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action
          with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
          4.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile,
          not just the next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an en route station with
          repair capability, after engine start the PIC discovers the #1 engine anti-ice is
          inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next leg. However, because
          the mission spans several days and repair capability does not exist at the scheduled en
          route stops, the PIC elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.
   4.5.2. Aircraft Model Identification. The tables apply to KC-135 D/E/R/T model aircraft.
   Specific aircraft information is identified with (E) to indicate KC-135 D/E model aircraft and
   (R) to indicate KC-135 R/T model aircraft. Specific information for aircraft modified with
   TCTO 628, Multi Point Refueling System (MPRS), is listed in Table 4.19 through Table
   4.26

4.6. Not Used.
4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).
4.8. One Engine Inoperative Ferry Operations. PICs will only conduct 3-engine ferry
operations after exhausting all other avenues to return an aircraft with an inoperative engine to
MC status. Each three-engine ferry sortie must be approved by MAJCOM/A3/DO. The owning
MAJCOM will provide execution authority for these sorties. As directed by the appropriate
MAJCOM only highly qualified crewmembers from MAJCOM/A3/A3V, NAF/DOV or unit
OG/OGV will conduct three-engine ferry flights. The following procedures apply:
   4.8.1. Plan ferry operations well ahead to allow sufficient time for completion of
   maintenance preparation actions.
   4.8.2. Plan the flight to the nearest destination possessing a usable maintenance support
   capability. Obtain clearances and alert all en route, alternate, and abort bases along the
   intended route of flight.

   4.8.3. Use the minimum crew necessary for the ferry operation. A qualified BO and a
   maximum of two crew chiefs (one 7-skill level) may be added. Do not carry passengers or
   other non-essential personnel. Observe aircraft flight manual limitations.
   4.8.4. All primary aircraft systems not associated with the failed engine must be fully
   operational.
   4.8.5. Performance data must satisfy takeoff field length requirements, gear down 3-engine
   climb performance, and final segment two-engine asymmetric go-around capability.
   4.8.6. Download cargo (including mission support kits) prior to ferry operations. Return all
   cargo and support equipment to the main operating base of assignment via organic support
   aircraft or other airlift means.
4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC
exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
   4.9.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-135(K)R-1-1 and T.O. 1C-135(K)E-
   1-1 do not account for a gear-down configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until
   there is reasonable assurance that they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to
   include en route stops and alternates).
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with MAJCOM
   Stan/Eval or unit OG/OGV.
4.10. Power Management Control (PMC) Operations. The PIC may (authorize) takeoff with
one PMC inoperative. Do not turn off an operational PMC to practice a PMC inoperative
takeoff. Simulated three-engine approaches and touch-and-go landings are not authorized with a
PMC inoperative.

                               OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, Red Ball MX, ATC interruptions and deviations
specified in the flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or
limitations may be added to the checklists. Currency of notes is a crewmember‘s responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM Stan/Evals shall approve the use of checklist inserts
   IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Program (FMP). For AMC and AMC-gained units,
   AMC/A3V is the checklist insert approval authority. The inserts should be placed at the end
   of the appropriate checklist or in an in-flight guide. All checklist inserts must have a POC.
   OGVs shall approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and
   procedures.
   5.1.2. Abbreviated checklists items that do not apply to the unit‘s aircraft or mission may be
   lined out.
   5.1.3. Crewmembers may use the most current version of applicable fanfold checklists in
   lieu of abbreviated checklists. Fanfold checklists must be current and contain all applicable
   basic flight manual supplement information.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be out
of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both pilots in their seats, PICs
may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-critical
phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). The PIC, pilot/copilot, BO and
navigator (if applicable) will be at their duty stations during all critical phases of flight.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight; the total number of persons permitted is limited to the number
of seats with operable seat belts and oxygen. Passengers and observers will not be permitted
access to pilot or co-pilot positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all takeoffs and landings during emergencies and on OPLAN
   8044 missions, unless conditions prevent compliance.
   5.4.2. For the first 100 hours after AC certification, if the pilot in the other seat is not an AC
   or above, the new AC will make all takeoffs and landings under any of the following
   conditions:
       5.4.2.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 4000 (3/4 SM visibility).
       5.4.2.2. RCR equivalent to less than a wet runway.
       5.4.2.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.

5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
configuration changes. The pilot not flying (PNF) will verify appropriate airspeed and
configuration prior to actuating the gear or flaps.
   5.5.1. (Added-459ARW) When hot brakes are encountered the AC will be instructed by
   tower or ground control to taxi the aircraft to the hot brake area (between the runways on
   either taxiway N or taxiway S). Any time the primary crash net is activated by the AC or
   tower, the senior fire official is the governing authority who decides when the emergency is
   terminated (not the AC).
5.6. Outside Observer/Jump Seat Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing
during taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet AGL.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt.
   5.7.2. Crewmembers will have seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless
   crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.3. All crewmembers will have seat belts and shoulder harnesses fastened during takeoff
   and landing. For air refueling and tactical operations, all crewmembers and passengers will
   have seat belts and shoulder harness fastened, if accessible (unless authorized by the PIC or
   crew duties dictate otherwise). Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties
   are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however,
   they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
   5.7.4. Litter patients, actual or simulated, must remain secured on litters for taxi, takeoff,
   AR, landing and when directed.
   5.7.5. Crew bunks will not be occupied during taxi, takeoff, landing, air refueling operations,
   or when directed by the PIC.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system. Approved vacuum cleaners are authorized for ground
   use.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on aircraft carrying hazard class 1
   explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited in-flight use of devices includes cellular phones and
   laptop computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Boom operators
   will ensure passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE
   such as PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
   5.9.3. The following handheld (HH) GPS units meet the requirements of AFI 11-202V3 and
   may be used with approved laptop computers in flight: Bendix King KLX100, Garmin GPS
   35-USB, and Hiacom HI-303III.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      75


        5.9.3.1. The use of HH GPS for moving map display (MMD) is designed as a situational
        awareness tool and its use is voluntary.
   5.9.4. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
   5.9.5. Turn off Iridium phones during takeoff, receiver air refueling, approach, and landing.
   At the discretion of the PIC, the Iridium phone may be left on during tanker air refueling
   operations.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying (PF) will periodically announce intentions during
departures, arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal
procedures. Table 5.1 through Table 5.4 depict mandatory calls for nonprecision approaches,
precision approaches, climbout and descent, respectively. PNF will initiate all interphone calls
unless accomplished by alerting equipment. PF must acknowledge all calls, including those
made by the EGPWS/Altitude Alerter.

NOTE:
   1. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
   environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go
   around will be made.
   2. With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
   environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights will be visible. The
   pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights. The pilot may not
   descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as
   reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and
   identifiable.
   3. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around.
   4. Both pilots will state the altimeter setting.
   5.11.1. Deviations.
       5.11.1.1. The PNF will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed,
       or when the altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired, and no attempt is being made
       to correct the deviation.
       5.11.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in
       airspeed, or a potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF.
       Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be
       announced.
5.12. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
   mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, air refueling, approach, landing, and any flight
   below 10,000 feet AGL.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       77


   5.12.2. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance, are cleared
   prior to discussing classified information over interphone. Use the erase function of the CVR
   after classified discussions.
   5.12.3. Command Radios.
      5.12.3.1. The PNF normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
      5.12.3.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the ATC frequency
      unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
      on the inbound and outbound legs.
      5.12.3.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary ATC,
      and update the crew when the primary ATC radio changes.
      5.12.3.4. One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances; the navigator or
      boom operator (if applicable/available) will monitor the read back and will ensure
      compliance with all clearances.
      5.12.3.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
      maximum extent possible.
EXCEPTION:
 Only one crewmember is required to monitor guard frequencies during tanker or receiver
rendezvous and AR.
      5.12.3.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
      unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
   5.12.4. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement ―Time Out":
      5.12.4.1. ―Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers.
      The use of "Time Out" will:
          5.12.4.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational
          awareness.
          5.12.4.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
          5.12.4.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew
          departing from established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply
          uncomfortable with the developing conditions.
      5.12.4.2. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
      the following actions:
          5.12.4.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
          5.12.4.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
          5.12.4.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
          inputs relative to the stated concerns.
          5.12.4.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
          current course of action or direct a new course of action.

5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R.
5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic
beverages.
5.15. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
5.15. (459ARW)Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements. rcrews are reminded that
rubber deposits at each end of KADW runways will greatly decrease braking effectiveness,
especially when wet. After considering brake limitations, aircrews should attempt to slow the
aircraft as much as possible before reaching the rubber deposits.
   5.15.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Minimum runway length is 7,000
   feet. Minimum runway width is 147 feet. Minimum taxiway width is 74 feet.
   5.15.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Do not takeoff if computed critical field
   length exceeds runway available. Minimum runway for a normal landing is landing distance
   based on a threshold crossing height of 50 feet.
       5.15.2.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will initiate takeoffs from the
       beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The decision to make
       intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
       5.15.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
       environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
       takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
       from the point at which the takeoff is initiated. In no case will a takeoff be made from a
       position where less than 7000 feet of runway remains.
       5.15.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
       computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or RCR for the cleared
       portion of the runway. A minimum of 50 feet either side of centerline should be cleared.
       If 50 feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the un-
       cleared portion up to 50 feet either side of centerline.
       5.15.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are stressed and authorized for
       normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff.
       Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if
       needed.
       5.15.2.5. Crews will normally use 0.80 delayed braking factor (DBF) for computing
       landing distance. PIC‘s may direct using up to 0.90 DBF as an exception on a case by
       case basis, but must be aware of the resultant increase in brake wear. OG/CC or
       equivalent approval is required for landings with greater than a 0.90 DBF. When using
       greater than 0.80 DBF crews will brief the planned braking speed.
   5.15.3. Arresting Cables.
       5.15.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
       recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
       to have the cable inspected.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                   79


      5.15.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
      (ATIS), or ATC.
      5.15.3.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems with an eight-
      point cable tie-down system is installed. When operating from runways equipped with
      other types of systems, or if it is unknown whether the BAK-12 system includes eight-
      point tie-downs, aircrews should recognize the increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
   5.15.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
      5.15.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
      guidance. Once a mission is executed, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield
      suitability based upon operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed
      in the ASRR.
      5.15.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
      pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2(when
      available)/ASRR before all off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority
      for the restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained
      aircraft. Direct GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ
      AMC/A3VK. HQ AMC/A3VK is the OPR for waivers to airfield restrictions.
      MAJCOM/A3/DO is the waiver authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is
      responsible for waiver compliance. Crews that have access to the World Wide Web will
      review airfield suitability in the airfield data base via the HQ AMC Aircrew Portal.
      Consult the ASRR for airfield certification requirements.
      5.15.4.3. Operations from RAF Fairford and RAF Mildenhall. An RCR 15 may be used
      for computing takeoff performance for all operational and training missions when wet
      runway conditions exist. This authorization does not apply to landing data computations
      or when standing water is on the runway. Determination of standing water versus wet
      runway conditions will be made by the 100 OG/CC.
5.16. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
5.16. (459ARW)Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign
Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. Snow removal operations on the east ramp and parallel
taxiway at KADW may result in a large snow berm being created along the taxiway edge. This
is particularly hazardous to KC-135 outboard engines on taxiways N, S, and the portion of
taxiway E which is less than 75‘ wide (see AFRC/DO waiver dated 30 Oct 2003). Crews should
proceed cautiously under these conditions and may need to deplane a wing walker or obtain
maintenance support to recover the aircraft.
   5.16.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring clearance between aircraft and obstructions. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet from any obstruction.
EXCEPTION:
 80                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


 IAW AFI 11-218, aircraft may taxi without marshallers/wing walkers at home station along
locally established taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet
clearance from any obstruction and the obstruction is permanent.
   5.16.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or
   a crewmember on interphone to act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways.
   During night taxi operations, marshallers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing
   walkers are only required to have one illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to
   see wing walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.16.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
       5.16.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
       requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
       5.16.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
       5.16.3.3. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an
       unprepared or un-swept surface. If unavoidable, leave the engine in idle (to the
       maximum extent possible) until the engine is over an improved surface.
5.17. Not Used.
5.18. Fuel Jettison Procedures. MAF policy is to avoid fuel jettisons, unless safety of flight
dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). In non-emergency
situations, emphasis should be placed on finding a constructive use of the fuel onboard before
resorting to fuel jettison.
5.18. (459ARW)Fuel Jettison Procedures. Except during emergencies, obtain OG/CC
approval prior to fuel jettison. Notify KADW Tower or Potomac Approach/Departure Control of
the need to jettison and obtain clearance to proceed to the jettison area.
   5.18.1. For missions tasked by higher headquarters C2 agencies, the tasking C2 agency may
   authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate recovery
   and reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide fuel
   jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.18.2. For missions executed from home station, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettisoning
   when an urgent operational requirement exists to expedite recovery/reconstitution of an
   aircraft and/or aircrew. In rare circumstances, it may be reasonable to jettison fuel during
   rapidly deteriorating weather conditions.
   5.18.3. For training missions not involving emergency situations or operational necessity,
   the following courses of action will be taken when aircraft gross weight exceeds normal
   landing gross weight limits established in technical orders or command directives:
       5.18.3.1. Accomplish continuation training events.
       5.18.3.2. Seek additional receivers through C2 agencies (if applicable).
       5.18.3.3. Seek approval for landing above 200,000 lbs IAW para. 9.10.7.3.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                        81


       5.18.3.4. After exhausting all alternatives, the pilot in command will obtain approval
       from tasking C2 agency (OG/CC for all missions recovering at home station) to jettison
       the minimum amount of fuel required to land.
   5.18.4. All fuel jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the PIC
   immediately after landing (utilize AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual
   Occurrence Worksheet). Submit AMC Form 97 through unit OGV to AMC/A3V. Unit
   OGV will retain AMC Form 97 for 6 months. Document all pertinent information, including
   the following items:
   5.18.4. (459ARW) Record all pertinent fuel jettison data on an AMC Form 97 and forward
   to 459 OG/OGV. Stan/Eval will retain the form for a minimum of 6 months, as
   documentation in the event of a claim against the government.
       5.18.4.1. Scheduled duration.
       5.18.4.2. Actual duration.
       5.18.4.3. Landing gross weight.
       5.18.4.4. Computed stopping distance.
       5.18.4.5. Recovery field.
       5.18.4.6. Runway available.
       5.18.4.7. Jettison altitude/location.
       5.18.4.8. Jettison amount.
       5.18.4.9. Reason for jettison.
       5.18.4.10. Approval authority.
   5.18.5. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
   5.18.5. (459ARW) The primary fuel jettison area is designated as a point overhead the
   ADW R-125/025. Start jettison at the fix while proceeding outbound from the ADW
   VORTAC.
       5.18.5.1. (Added-459ARW) Altitude will be assigned by the controlling agency, but
       every attempt should be made to jettison above 20,000‘ MSL. Extremely high traffic
       density, coupled with unique security requirements in the Washington area may mean a
       lower altitude is assigned.
5.19. Aircraft Speed. Comply with requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. IAW
applicable tech orders, aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS or in-flight minimum maneuver speed
below 10,000 feet to safely accomplish formation departure rejoins. Once rejoined, all formation
aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet only to accommodate the minimum maneuver
speed of the heaviest formation aircraft.
5.20. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
 82                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
5.20. (459ARW)Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. There are two
phases of the BASH program. Phase I period indicates lighter bird activity. Phase II indicates
heavy activity, normally associated with migratory seasons, or based on observed bird activity.
   5.20.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
       5.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
       5.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
       only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
       pattern activity is prohibited.
       5.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
       Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
       required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
   5.20.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs and
   landings from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period.
   Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along
   with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
   5.20.2. (459ARW) The 316 AW sets specific Phase I and Phase II dates locally based on
   inputs from the Bird Hazard Working Group. Flying squadrons should make every effort to
   schedule local training mission departures/arrivals to avoid periods of peak bird activity (+/-
   one hour from sunrise and sunset) during Phase II periods. Any deviation from this policy
   requires OG/CC approval. Aircrews will not take off early or late if doing so would place
   them inside the BASH II window unless approval is received from the OG/CC.
       5.20.2.1. (Added-459ARW) AFRC policy requires tenant organization compliance with
       the host base BASH program. 459 ARW/SE monitors the bird phase conditions and
       notifies 459 OSF Current Operations and the 756 ARS when conditions change. BASH
       information may be released by 459 OG/OGV via FCIF, added to the Flight Crew
       Bulletin (FCB), or posted in the mission briefing room.
   5.20.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.20.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
   States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
   overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another
   source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC
   aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
   (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.20.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       83


   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
   make reliable damage assessments.
   5.20.5. (459ARW) Any aircraft experiencing a bird strike will land as soon as practical to
   conduct an accurate damage assessment. This applies to all missions, including transition
   training at airfields other than KADW. EXCEPTION: At the discretion of the aircraft
   commander, the aircraft may abandon the planned touch-and-go or landing at the transition
   base and return to KADW for one approach to a full stop landing, if in the aircraft
   commander‘s opinion it is safe to do so. No further training will be attempted prior to
   inspecting the aircraft for damage. If a full stop landing is conducted off-station, the aircrew
   will relay the extent of the damage to the OG/CC. The OG/CC, aircraft commander, and
   maintenance will determine appropriate action.
5.21. Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and Operational
Check Flights (OCFs). Check flights will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1C-135-6, Aircraft
Scheduled Inspections and Maintenance Requirements, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
Maintenance Management, T.O. 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and Maintenance
Operational Checks, and T.O. 1C-135-6CF-1, Acceptance and/or Functional Check Procedures
Manual. Crews should only perform tasks or functions contained in specific Technical Order
guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to
see if an FCF applies.
5.21. (459ARW)Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and
Operational Check Flights (OCFs). Reference 459 ARWI 21-101 Supplement for local
FCF/OCF guidance. In the absence of the OG/CC, the flight authorization may be signed by a
designated representative.
   5.21.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300.
       5.21.1.1. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
       procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
       require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
       5.21.1.2. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional
       guidance in local supplement to this instruction.
       5.21.1.2. (459ARW) Only crews designated by the OG/CC may fly FCF/OCF sorties.
       As a minimum, crew members will be instructor-qualified and highly experienced. The
       FCF/OCF appointment letter is maintained by 459 OG/OGV.
       5.21.1.3. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base
       from which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under
       specific conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
       5.21.1.4. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility
       of the MAJCOM/A3/DO.
       5.21.1.5. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF
       crewmembers. The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM
       assessment for that specific FCF flight.
 84                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       5.21.1.6. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under
       a combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all
       systems are operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to ―VFR
       on Top‖ for the altitude phase of the flight.
       5.21.1.7. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release
       the aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating
       the FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
       5.21.1.8. Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks. Perform checks IAW
       the flight manual and maintenance technical orders. Prepare the aircraft with minimum
       fuel necessary to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will
       permit a safe return to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn
       on the anti-skid system. The PIC will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned
       and ensure runway available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions
       without exceeding normal brake energy limits.
5.22. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial
Events, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
5.23. Not Used.
5.24. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
   5.24.1. Operate the TCAS with sensitivity set to Traffic Advisory/Resolution Advisory
   (TA/RA) at all times except when in cell formation, during air refueling, or when operational
   necessity dictates.
5.25. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities
through 618 TACC, or appropriate C2 agency.

KC-135 Aircrew Briefing Guide to the maximum extent possible.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
   mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
   special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
   activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                     91


  hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
  manuals, and OPORD procedure.
  6.12.2. Pilot in Command Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the operations briefing,
  including MAJCOM, NAF, and unit special interest items (SII). Brief crewmembers on the
  specific mission details if not previously accomplished. Use a MAJCOM approved briefing
  guide.
     6.12.2.1. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted
     prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission
     details for that day‘s sortie(s) and the ORM level for the mission. Complete this briefing
     prior to engine start.
  6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
  peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
  Specialized briefings review formation tactics and procedures, AR information, and technical
  instructions for specialized equipment operations. All crewmembers should attend each
  briefing. Crewmembers may only be excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight duties;
  however the PIC will back brief all appropriate items.
  6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
  forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
  crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
     6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
     with the IFM aircrew departure papers. This weather briefing satisfies requirement for
     6.12.4. Local weather flights/agencies may update local takeoff weather data, but
     aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will use 618 TACC weather
     operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) supporting the theater C2
     agency) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and further updates.
     6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
     information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
     their location.
     6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
     weather flight, OWS, or 618 TACC weather operations, obtain weather through any
     means available prior to mission accomplishment.
     6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
     FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
     6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
     are not required.
  6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within or adjacent to an established buffer
  zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
  procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
  6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
  peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
 92                                        AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided
   for IFM sorties. When time and circumstances permit, the PIC, or designated representative,
   will contact the flight manager before signing the flight plan.
   6.12.8. Training/Evaluation       Briefing. Before     all    training/evaluation missions,
   instructors/flight examiners should brief their crew on the following additional item:
   instructors/evaluators (for each crew position) will outline requirements and objectives for
   each student or examinee.
6.13. Call Signs
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.13.1. (459ARW) The local call sign for 459 ARW aircraft will be ―DECEE‖ plus a 2-digit
   number as assigned by 459 OSF Current Operations.
       6.13.1.1. (Added-459ARW) For AFRC CONUS missions, 459 ARW aircraft may use
       ―DECEE‖ plus 9X-digit number as assigned by 459 OSF Current Operations.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   channel missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the ―REACH‖ call sign
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters
   "RCH" followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the
   aircraft tail number.
   6.13.2. (459ARW) All other operational missions should use the specified REACH call
   sign unless otherwise assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic clearance. AMC missions
   should reference the AMC Form 59 remarks to determine whether the mission has a
   diplomatically cleared call sign for a specific route segment.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call sign are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign ―Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared
   call signs when required.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.15. Flight Plan Verification
6.15. (459ARW)Flight Plan Verification. KADW flight plan filing procedures require the AC
to Fax the completed DD175 or DD1801 to 316 AW Base Operations. For security reasons, the
AC needs to call Base Operations and confirm receipt after faxing the flight plan.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   command validated (HQ/AMC/A3V) CFPs.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      93


       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 Flight Planning Office. On IFM sorties,
       promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the correct
       route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to 618
       TACC/XOCZF if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in
       direction or 25 knots in speed.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, this chapter, and
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach
procedures, NOTAMS, GDSS, Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. All performance data
computations will be reviewed by both pilots. Ensure that the DAFIF image file on FMS
PCMCIA card is current for date(s) of flight.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures.
NOTE:
VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle clearance planning.
       6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
       VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
       high terrain are avoided.
       6.16.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
       ensuring all the following conditions are met:
           6.16.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
           departure route.
           6.16.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
           emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance.
NOTE:
 If unable to comply with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until
conditions that are more favorable exist.
       6.16.1.3. Pilots will refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR
       outside of CONUS.
       6.16.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
       clearance or reaching the IFR MEA.
   6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
   in AFI 11-202V3, and AFMAN 11-217V1.
 94                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       6.16.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR
       IAW paragraph 6.16.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an
       instrument approach.
       6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
       are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
       IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1).
NOTE:
 Screen height requirements for departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or
the airfield where the departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to
determine screen height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed
below, or when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35
feet (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
appropriate authority.
          6.16.2.2.1. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
          6.16.2.2.2. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet unless
          published.
          6.16.2.2.3. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
          6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as
          published.
          6.16.2.2.5. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
          6.16.2.2.6. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
          6.16.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
       6.16.2.3. Aircraft must be able to meet the published climb gradient for the departure
       runway with all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm
       will be used.
NOTE:
 In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb gradient, download
cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that are more favorable exist.
       6.16.2.4. The following methods are provided to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear
       all obstacles along the planned departure route with One-Engine Inoperative (OEI):
          6.16.2.4.1. Published climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
          is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
          ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. Crews must ensure
          compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb gradients for the selected
          departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb gradients may be published
          as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off Minimums section of FLIP or on a
          SID.
              6.16.2.4.1.1. When mission priority justifies the increased risk, crews may
              subtract 48‘/nm from published climb gradient before computing engine-out
              takeoff data. This number will never be below 152 ft/nm. Refer to AFI 11-
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      95


                202V3 for further decision making guidance.
             6.16.2.4.2. KC-135R/T. Special Departure Procedures (SDP) are MDS-specific,
             OEI, airfield specific escape procedures and where available, will be used for one
             engine-out departure planning. Retrieve current KC-135 SDPs from the Jeppesen AF
             Opsdata website: https://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/commerce/login.jsp, username is
             ―usafsdp‖ and password is ―aircrews‖. ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not currently
             listed may be requested through OGV/OSO NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure.
             Ad Hoc SDPs are valid while they remain on the Jeppesen Opsdata website. The
             SDP analysis date is located in the upper left-hand corner of the SDP takeoff
             performance sheet. PICs must ensure that the most current SDP is used.
             6.16.2.4.3. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in obstacles
             (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be published as a
             NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T).
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff

Table 6.3. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.

MISSION         VIS        REMARKS
Operational                 When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000, the
                1000
                           crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the runway has
                RVR
                           dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and
                (305       runway centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below 1600
                meters)    RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.




All others       1600       For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must
                           read 1600 minimum on all.
                 RVR
                (488
                meters)

NOTE:
If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
mile (800 meters).
When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility) a takeoff alternate
is required (See paragraph 6.19)
6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
 96                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced. See Chapter 14 for specific fuel
planning requirements.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for the
   lowest suitable approach (at departure aerodrome). If planning an ILS approach, CAT 1
   minimums will be used.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
       least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
       600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
       remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be
according to AFI 11-202V3, and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach.
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not
   exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use 2+00 holding fuel (in
   lieu of an alternate). A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due
   to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours
   flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following
   criteria:
       6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       97


       6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
       minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
       precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
       precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
       minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours).
NOTE:
See Chapter 14 for fuel planning considerations to a remote or island destination.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
       6.21.1.1. The KC-135 is a category II aircraft for turbulence. Crews should confirm the
       type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what type of aircraft reported the
       encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of flight. Turbulence category
       charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002,
       Meteorological Techniques.
       6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
       fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
WARNING:
 Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened and the aircraft
encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
NOTE:
 Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological Techniques, states
that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is equivalent to severe
icing.
       6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
       conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
       IAW flight manual procedures.
       6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
       ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
       icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
           6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
           flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
           associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
           times.
           6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
           icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved
           anti-icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-
           2, Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the HQ
           AFFSA website. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and
 98                                        AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


           the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times
           are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
           6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
           completed within 5 minutes of departure.
   6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
   If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
   avoid them by at least:
       6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level (FL) 230.
       6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230
CAUTION:
 Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize
themselves with information on thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203,
Weather for Aircrews.
   6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
   used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
   never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
   based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
   instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
       6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
       6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
       6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
   6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
   advective clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
   thunderstorms.
   6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
   departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
       6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC
       6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers
       6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
       feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level.
NOTE:
 Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs
providing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned missed
approach corridor, if applicable).
   6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
   or below, refer to 11-202V3 Chapter 8 and the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section
   D, Temperature Correction Chart.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                        99


   6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence.
   6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
   flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft; contact nearest military
   weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
   6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.11.1. Within 8°C of the freezing level.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM) ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. (Added-459ARW) Aircrews will accomplish the AMC Operational Risk
   Management (ORM) checklist and the locally designed Mission Worksheet for all missions.
   For AMC/TACC executed missions, aircrew will accomplish the AMC ORM worksheet as
   specified in AMCI 90-903.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. AFTO Form 781 Series.
   6.23.1. Review AFTO Form 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance
   officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional
   release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release.
   Ensure that the DD1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.23.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
   crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained,
   coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is
   required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.23.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   paragraph 12.3.
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Reference paragraph 12.4.
 100                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


6.25. Aircraft   Recovery     Away     from    Main     Operating     Base    (MOB). Reference
paragraph12.5.
6.26. Life Support Requirements.
   6.26.1. Oxygen. For flights where the total number of individuals on board the aircraft does
   not exceed the total number of operational flight crew oxygen system stations, the minimum
   quantity of oxygen aboard an aircraft before takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the
   planned flight from the equal time point (ETP) to recovery should oxygen be required.
   Calculate using the 100 percent oxygen chart in the flight manual.
       6.26.1.1. Crewmembers occupying or transiting the cargo compartment will have a
       portable oxygen walk-around bottle with quick-don mask/helmet, or Emergency
       Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) readily available for use in the event of an emergency.
       6.26.1.2. Crewmembers performing passenger monitoring duty will use a portable
       oxygen bottle with helmet or quick don attached.
       6.26.1.3. On missions carrying passengers, if EPOS is not prepositioned throughout the
       cargo compartment, distribute EPOS to each passenger regardless of planned flight
       altitude.
   6.26.2. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than life
   rafts will accommodate.
   6.26.3. Life preserver units (LPUs). Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs for overwater
   flights. Ensure the appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for overwater
   missions carrying children and infants.
       6.26.3.1. Over-water is defined as any flight exceeding 50 NM from the nearest shoreline
       or a power-off glide distance (15:1), whichever is less.
6.27. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.

   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC will report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.38.1. Notification of C2 Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft emergency
   action checklists and associated actions, the PIC will furnish ATC and appropriate C2
   agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other
   pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follows:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
       Center using global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable, aircrews
       are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone patch
       connectivity.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
          6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.

6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are ATIS, 618 TACC weather operations, OWSs, and USAF base
weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a US Air Force
aeronautical station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact 21 OWS
at Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact AFSOUTH Weather Flight at Davis-Monthan
AFB, AZ. The ATC system can provide weather information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts
to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be
involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required
checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR
   conditions if an approved instrument approach is not available or operational missions
   require a tactical approach. NOTE: A visual glide slope indicator, VASI, PAPI, etc., is
   required.
       6.41.1.1. On training/evaluation flights at familiar fields or recovery at home station,
       pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR traffic patterns to accomplish required
       training and evaluations. The pilot not flying will monitor a precision approach when
       practical to enhance safety.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft category. The KC-135 is a category "D" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed
   166 knots, the minimums for category "E" will be used.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
   route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
       6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or side step approaches.
           6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
           meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
       6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
           6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
           required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
           rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
           add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
106                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


         which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900
         feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
         minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
         visibility.
      6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by 1/2
      SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway
      approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not
      to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
      6.42.3.4. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published DoD or NACO
      precision approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, comply with fuel
      requirements before initiating en route descent, penetration, or approach.
      6.42.3.5. Variable visibility/ceiling reports. Many airfields are implementing automated
      weather reporting capabilities which may report variable visibilities and ceilings. When
      variable visibilities/ceilings are reported, pilots may use the greatest value reported. If it
      is subsequently determined that weather is actually below minimums for the approach,
      comply with 6.42.5. Do not attempt further approaches until the lowest visibility/ceiling
      reported is at/above approach minimums.
  6.42.4. Category I ILS and PAR Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will
  be as published, but no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
      6.42.4.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
      certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Refer to AFI 11-2KC135V1 for certification
      procedures. Comply with the following operational procedures:
         6.42.4.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.4.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.4.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
         ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
         arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
         clearance, who did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
         directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.4.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
         disengaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.4.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
         immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
         clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
         comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
         determines safety to be a factor.
  6.42.5. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When under radar vectors to final
  approach, when cleared for the approach or when established on a segment of the approach
  and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the PF has the
  option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point (MAP)/DH. If the approach
  is abandoned, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required for the missed approach
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                   107


   procedure). Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is
   received.
      6.42.5.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment
      is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
      6.42.5.2. If the approach is continued, the PIC must have sufficient fuel available to
      complete the approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with
      normal fuel reserve.
      6.42.5.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
      designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.42.6. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
      6.42.6.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
      and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
      remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
6.43. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.43.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or base
   operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to Chapter 7 of
   this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft and equipment
   are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, provides specific
   guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft.
   For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, seal the aircraft.
   RAVENS will provide security at all AMC RAVEN required locations; otherwise, use
   guards employed by the host country for flight line/airport area control. Do not leave
   unguarded classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.43.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized
   DoD personnel. If no U.S. facilities are available, crews will store COMSEC in the installed
   aircraft gun box/locker. Place a seal on the gun box/locker and secure it with a GSA-
   approved lock. Lock and seal the aircraft.
   6.43.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4 (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.43.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.43.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations if a ground check (6.43.4) was not accomplished. Aircrews can request

   6.43.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air
   Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.43.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A).
   6.43.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the PIC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC KC-135 aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incurs an unscheduled delay due to weather, aircraft maintenance, or foreign
diplomatic clearance problems, forcing the members to be lodged at that location until the
aircraft can continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) and other required support is charged to
   local TWCF funds via the US Bankcorp Government Purchase Card (GPC) account, in
   accordance with locally established procedures. TWCF payment is applicable for only those
   service members in a group travel status aboard any KC-135 aircraft delayed at these
   locations, regardless of the command owning the aircraft, provided the aircraft is flying a
   TWCF mission (SAAM, CJCS Exercise, JA/ATT, or Contingency) with an AMC mission
   identifier.
   6.44.2. If the aircraft delay is at a location where TWCF funds are not available (regardless
   if DoD facilities are available or not), the KC-135 aircraft commander will utilize SF 44,
   Purchase Order-Invoice-Vouchering (or AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice)
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                     109


   authority to acquire the necessary meals, quarters, and transportation for only the group
   travel status passengers. Upon return to home station, the aircraft commander will turn in the
   SF 44 or AF Form 15 to the local accounting liaison/budget office. Supporting
   documentation should include a copy of the service members" group travel orders along with
   applicable invoices/receipts for lodging, meals, and other required support. Upon validation
   of the SF 44 or AF Form 15, the accounting liaison/budget office forwards the bills for these
   charges to the DFAS Field Site for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft
   incurred the delay.
   6.44.3. This policy does not apply to those passengers traveling on delayed KC-135 aircraft
   flying TWCF missions who are authorized per diem on their individual travel orders or in a
   space available status.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers will debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines,
avionics equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without
maintenance support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough
debrief is provided to the C2 agency. On all AMC/ANG/AFRC missions, notify 618 TACC
Logistics Control (618 TACC/XOCL).
6.46. Border Clearance. The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base
or area command in accordance with AFI 24-401, AFI 24-402, AFI 24-403, Border Clearance,
Customs Program, and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or the BO, but the PIC retains ultimate
       responsibility. When a KC-135 aircraft is onloaded at a base without an air traffic
       function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
          visas, when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
          immunization (shot record).
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and Paragraph 6.47).
   6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
110                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


      6.46.2.1. En route, the BO will distribute personal customs declarations (when not
      accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. The
      BO will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and
      compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC‘s signature.
      6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
      ETA to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
      6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
      which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, proceed to another base in
      the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
      cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
      offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
      proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
      completed or a new permit to proceed is issued by a customs official. Do not make
      intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
      manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
      center.
      6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
      normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
      passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
      and property (crew chief excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
      agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
      initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
      or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
      6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
      Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are
      immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
      inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
      specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
      6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
      the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                     111


         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
     6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
     Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
     6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
     exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
     between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
     6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
     and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
     operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
     base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
     6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward ), is not required unless directed.

                baggage.
                6.46.4.3.2.3.2. One copy of the US Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
                each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
                observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
                6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander‘s
                certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
                not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
                6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
112                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


                representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
                officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
             6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
                6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
                each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
                media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD 1854, Customs
                Accompanied Baggage, U.S., or Customs Form 6059B.
                6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
                debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
                discretionary examination of the baggage.
      6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
         6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the AC will ensure
         all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
         6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
      6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
         6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
         6.46.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying
         civilian passengers.
             6.46.4.5.2.1. One copy of Customs Form 7507.
             6.46.4.5.2.2. One copy of Immigration Form I-92, Aircraft/Vessel Report.
             6.46.4.5.2.3. One copy/set of Immigration Form I-94, Arrival/Departure
             Record, for each foreign national.
      6.46.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
         6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
         6.46.4.6.2. Inbound:
             6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
             milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
             and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
             personal gear are to be cleaned of mud before being brought aboard the aircraft.
             Personal gear and equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to
             prevent their accidental entry into the U.S.
             6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
             will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
             6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
             higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
             before landing.
             6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      113


              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held
              for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Medical and Agricultural Foreign and Domestic Quarantine Regulations for
   Vessels, Aircraft, and Other Transports of the Armed Forces (Joint), Department of Defense
   FCG, or as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or
   on forms provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with
   passengers on board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
           6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
           sprayed.
           6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
           loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
           wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
           6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
           aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
           ventilation openings.
CAUTION:
 If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray before boarding crew or
passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15
minutes before allowing anyone on board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 3 minutes and 25 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the
       country being transited (see FCG).
NOTE:
Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, base operations, or airport manager of the
   situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
 114                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify 618 TACC or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of
   routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.49. Flight Data Recorder/Cockpit Voice Recorder (FDR/CVR). Pulling the FDR/CVR
Circuit Breaker disables three pieces of equipment: Cockpit Voice Recorder, Flight Data
Recorder, and TEMS Monitoring System. If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the FDR/CVR power circuit breaker. This procedure keeps the
CVR from recording over itself, but retains the FDR/TEMS Data. If AOR SPINS direct clearing
the CVR information, crews will utilize the ―Erase‖ function during engine shutdown vice
pulling the circuit breaker.
6.50. Life Support and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or designated
representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, life support, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire or remainder
   of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required dash 21
   equipment has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed
   by maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and life support and survival equipment have been certified as installed
   by aircrew life support and that configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment.        Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781 entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                     115


      6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A3TL (or MAJCOM life support office) and
      appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions
   6.51.1. The total number of personnel aboard -135 aircraft must not, under any normal
   condition, exceed the number of serviceable seats, with seat belts installed and available life
   support equipment. Personnel will not be seated aft of the aft emergency escape hatch. The
   PIC is the final arbiter as to how many space-A passengers can be safely transported.
   6.51.2. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from the flight will
   be downloaded prior to departure. See exception in Paragraph 13.4.2.8.
   6.51.3. Latrine Capacity vs. Personnel Loading. PICs will consider the limited capacity of
   latrine facilities when carrying passengers. Waiver authority to exceed maximum latrine
   capacity during deployment operations rests with the OG/CC. For all other missions, use
   Table 6.4 to calculate the total latrine capacity (in gallons) required against the maximum
   number of personnel and the sortie duration. Add additional devices or download passengers
   as required to meet mission requirements. The loss of capacity from unusable devices (e.g.
   inoperative commode, missing urinal, etc.) must be considered before calculating personnel
   accommodations. Aircraft modified with the 36 gallon capacity latrine (TCTO 1C-135-
   1596) need not compute maximum personnel loading against Table 6.4. If TCTO 1C-135-
   1596 is installed the maximum capacity is 60 people for 12 hours.
      6.51.3.1. Standard aircraft configuration with one latrine commode and two urinals
      provides approximately 16 gallons of total capacity. This may be reduced by up to 1.5
      gallons depending on the total amount of chemically treated water (pre charge) placed in
      each device. Extra devices (urinals, commode cartridges) may be added to accommodate
      larger passenger loads/increased sortie durations provided they can be safely stored,
      swapped and/or used inflight. Calculate.5 gal. pre-charge for each added device. Plan
      configuration requirements prior to home station departure.

Table 6.5. Latrine Capacity vs. Personnel Loading Chart.




6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A3AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should seek to impound the aircraft immediately after landing IAW AFI 21-101 and contact
the controlling C2 agency for further instructions.
6.54. Not Used.
6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    117


clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) for
more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.56. Overflying En route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a scheduled
en route stop (NGB/A3X for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command center for AFRC-
directed missions).
6.57. Aircraft Systems Operation.
   6.57.1. MFD. Pilot Flying (PF) must have the top MFD set with the full ADI for all
   takeoffs, final approaches and landings. Course guidance (other than stick map) appropriate
   for the current ATC clearance, will be displayed on a PF MFD. EXCEPTION : When
   malfunctions limit the pilot to a single operable MFD.
   6.57.2. Autopilot. To the maximum extent possible, the aircraft will be flown with the
   autopilot coupled to the FMS (except for takeoffs, air refuelings, uncoupled approaches, and
   landings).
   6.57.3. Weather Radar. Configure the weather radar based on mission requirements. Do not
   configure the weather radar to simultaneously operate in an excessive number of modes since
   this will significantly degrade normal radar performance in each individual mode.
   6.57.4. GPS, mode 4, and secure voice/HAVE QUICK keys. Load as required.
6.58. Aircrew Complement. C/KC-135 aircraft will normally be operated using three-person
procedures (minimum two pilots and one boom operator). Commanders may designate that a
mission use four-person procedures (minimum two pilots, one navigator and one boom operator)
if navigator currency/training requires (N/A ANG). When a mission is scheduled as four-person,
a ―Navigator suite or B-Kit‖ must be installed at the navigator station.
   6.58.1. OPLAN 8044 will be flown three-person.
   6.58.2. SOAR will be flown four-person.
   6.58.3. Basic Navigator. Navigator‘s duties include, but are not limited to, assist in mission
   planning/study, operating equipment at duty station, and functioning as backup to the pilot
   team for navigation, rendezvous and communication duties. Pilots will retain full
   responsibility for all navigation and rendezvous duties.
   6.58.4. SOAR Navigator. Navigator‘s duties (on both SOAR and Non-SOAR missions)
   include mission planning/study, operating equipment at duty station, and functioning as crew
   lead for navigation, rendezvous and communications duties as directed by appropriate flight
   manuals and mission directives. Pilots provide backup for all navigator duties.
6.59. MPRS. For MPRS, periodically check Ram Air Turbine (RAT) speeds on appropriate
Pod Control Panel(s) for overspeed condition(s).

                                            Chapter 7

                                    AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C/KC-135 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting
Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and
specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release
information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the
public.
7.2. Security. The C/KC-135 is a ―Protection Level 3‖ resource. Aircraft security at non-
United States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101, requirements for C/KC-135 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient
   permanent lighting is not available. Post security forces IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a
means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be
present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew
pre-preflight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another
aircrew.
NOTE:
 WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1
and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                        119


route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of three US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team‘s travel
   status is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEGP status and is responsible to
   the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for the team‘s welfare (transportation,
   lodging, etc.). Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing and aircraft
   egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199,
   Air Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC‘s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
       7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
       7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
       inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
 120                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal).
       7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       a forced entry.
       7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
       thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include: aircraft wheel wells, keel beam bays and
   lower nose compartment for unauthorized packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices.
   Report any suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened
   security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01A, dated 20 Jun 06, and 49 USC 46501
   and 49 USC 44903(e).
   7.7.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.7.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.7.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.7.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.7.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      121


   7.7.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C/KC-135 is operating
away from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 31-207, as
supplemented.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
       7.8.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
       tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
       the order of the troop commander or team leader.
       7.8.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
       of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.8.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission ―frag‖ as ―RAVEN in-flight arming required‖.
   7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.8.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/PIC
       retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.8.4.1.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
 122                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit and in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Notify ground agencies by
any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as circumstances
permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to be armed by the mission
execution authority, the PIC will determine which crewmembers will be armed (two
crewmembers will be armed unless directed otherwise). All crewmembers should know who is
armed. The following procedures apply when arming is directed:
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                   123


   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   Form 1297.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from
   the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, their military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms,
       authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they
       will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew
       will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their
       pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   onload or offload duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
   are aboard that require arming, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a
   satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not
   be unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
       available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
           7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft
           gun box.
           7.13.4.2.2. Stage aircrews should contact C2 for guidance.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member’s
Personal Protection Guide: Combat Terrorism While Overseas, and AFI 10-245, Air Force
Antiterrorism, for Force Protection measures.

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for worksheets, reports, and forms associated
with AMC operational activities. Consult governing instruction or contact wing, unit, or local
flight safety officers for assistance with safety forms.
8.1. (459ARW)General. The AC is responsible for completion of all 756 ARS required post-
mission forms. The MCD is responsible for completion of all 459 AES required post-mission
forms. Flight time data for all 459 ARW crew members will be entered on one AFTO 781. Both
the AC and MCD will initial the AFTO 781 (after verifying it for accuracy) in block 38, prior to
leaving the aircraft. The original AFTO 781 will be the only copy kept by SARM personnel. Do
not use an extract copy unless flying with another unit.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. The AF Form 457 is a tool to notify supervisors
and commanders of a hazardous condition that requires prompt corrective action. For hazardous
weather, complete the front side of an AF Form 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety
office. If addressing a computer flight plan deficiency, attach a copy of the AF Form 72, Air
Report (AIREP). Send your report so the parent unit receives it within 5 days of the event. For
more information, see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF Form 651 is a tool to
report near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See Attachment 3 of
AFI 91-202 for more information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
   Investigations and Reports, list HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center,
   Flight Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety
   allows. Include the following information in the radio call (as appropriate)
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield,
       incident, etc).
       8.3.2.3. Altitude or flight level.
       8.3.2.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
       8.3.2.5. Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a HATR upon landing.
   8.3.3. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode
   available. If landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed
   AF Form 651 to the airfield management officer for forwarding to the wing safety office. If
   landing airport does not have an airfield management office, notify the safety office of the
   Air Force base nearest to location where the condition occurred, PIC‘s home base safety
   office, or as prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide contact sufficient
   information to prepare AF Form 651.
   8.3.4. Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided:
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      125


       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
8.4. AMC FORM 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence
Worksheet. The AMC Form 97 (or MAJCOM equivalent) is a tool to notify appropriate
authorities of any mishap or unusual occurrence involving crewmembers or aircraft. PICs shall
complete all appropriate areas of the form in as much detail as possible. When notified, AMC
C2 agents will inform their supervisor/commander to start investigation and reporting activities
IAW AFI 91-204, AFMAN 91-223, and Operation Report 3 (OPREP-3) procedures.
   8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage
   to another organization‘s people or equipment caused by PIC‘s aircraft/crewmember. At a
   minimum, report the following:
       8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-
       flight due to medical or physiological reasons).
NOTE:
 In the event of a physiological episode, all crewmembers and passengers involved will report to
a flight surgeon as soon as practical and the flight surgeon will coordinate with the safety office
to generate a Class E Physiological Event in the Air Force Safety Automated System.
       8.4.1.2. A human factors related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
       information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
       analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
       short period of time); or confused switch-ology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
       wrong switch creates dangerous situation). Anonymous reports are acceptable.
       8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure,
       suspected engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine
       failures include, but are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component
       penetrating the engine case, engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire,
       substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately
       report incidents that involve multiple engines (may report single-engine incidents upon
       landing). NOTE: Exclude intentional shutdowns for training and/or FCF unless the
       engine fails to restart.
       8.4.1.4. A flight control malfunction (including the autopilot and trim systems) that
       results in an unexpected or hazardous change of flight attitude, altitude, or heading.
       Enter the flag words, ―Reportable Flight Control Malfunction‖ in the AFTO Form 781A.

  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, suspected laser exposure, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine
  failure, hostile fire, injury to passenger or aircrew member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive.
  Most events require C2 agents to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all
  cases, pass the ―who, what, when, where, why, and how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
     8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
     Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
     of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference.               PICs who encounter
     electromagnetic interference (EMI) will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon
     as practical.
         8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A63// and addressees
         listed in AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following
         information in plain text:

             8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number,
             and Duty hours).
         8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
         intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC‘s
         judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
         8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an
         adversaries‘ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
         accordingly. PICs on a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be
         interference from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report
         would reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located
         in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
      8.5.6.2. Suspected Laser Exposure. If suspected or exposed to a laser, the aircraft
      commander will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical and ensure
      the appropriate command and control, intelligence, and medical agencies are also
      notified.
         8.5.6.2.1. Aircrew who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or
         hostile sources will report to the Flight Surgeon‘s Office for evaluation immediately
         upon return to the nearest base.
         8.5.6.2.2. The Flight Surgeon and Base SE will manage and coordinate event
         reporting with MAJCOM/SE, USAFSAM/AFC, 77th AESG/YA, AFSC/SEH and
         AFRL as directed by AFOSH STD 48-139.
         8.5.6.2.3. For immediate Medical Assistance call Tri-Service Laser Injury Hotline (1-
         800-473-3549 or DSN 240-4784)
         8.5.6.2.4. Further mandatory reporting will be done through the NASIC web site on
         SIPRNET at http://www.naic.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/DEW/LE/index.html or

8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Reference DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel
and Services at Commercial Locations. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card for
the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants
can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/de-fuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations when ever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces.
       8.6.2.3. Open market.
NOTE:
DoD FLIP en route supplements identify locations with into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. DD1898, Aviation Fuels Into-Plane Sale Slip , is the fuel transaction receipt
       used for purchases at other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations.
       Log and place the DD1898 inside the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log.
       The PIC or designated representative shall complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor
       insists on a unique invoice along with the DD1898, annotate the vendor‘s invoice with
       ―DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.‖
       8.6.3.2. SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher , may be used to purchase fuel,
       ground services and/or other authorized products when no MSC card contract is in place.
          8.6.3.2.1. SF 44 fuel purchases where FBO agrees to invoice DESC for payment.
              8.6.3.2.1.1. The aircrew shall present the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when an
              FBO refuses to accept the MSC card. The aircrew shall complete the SF 44 and
              attach it to the FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use of the
              SF 44 and uses its own invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on a
              separate SF 44 from ground services and other authorized products since the FBO
              must invoice DESC for the fuel and the customer for non-fuel product and
              services.
              8.6.3.2.1.2. Copies 1 and 2 of the SF 44 shall be provided to the FBO. Copy 1 of
              the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applicable, shall be

         RRF, Building 1621-K, 2261 Hughes Avenue, Suite 128, Lackland AFB, Texas
         78236.
         8.6.3.2.1.3. Copy 3 of the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if
         applicable, shall be provided to the aircrew. Log and place a copy inside the AF
         Form 664. Aircrews shall present all fuel purchase receipts to the designated
         aviation squadron Certifying Official and/or Accountable Official upon return to
         home station to enable timely validation and financial obligation processing into
         the Fuels Automated System (FAS).
      8.6.3.2.2. SF 44 fuel purchases where the FBO requires cash payment.
         8.6.3.2.2.1. Cash fuel purchases are only authorized when either the DOD
         4500.54G, DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, requires cash payment, or when FBO
         locations outside the United States and U. S. Territories refuse MSC card and/or
         SF 44 invoicing processes. Aircrews required to pay cash for aviation fuel
         purchases shall employ the following procedures (NOTE: these procedures do
         not apply to non-fuel products or services):
             8.6.3.2.2.1.1. The aircrew shall obtain cash from a local DoD Finance source
             that is charged to an approved Treasury suspense account prior to home
             station departure.
             8.6.3.2.2.1.2. Aircrews shall complete the SF 44 and obtain the FBO fuel
             vendor annotation in block 11 of the SF 44 to confirm total cash amount and
             also sign and date the SF 44 blocks 20 and 21. Log and place a copy inside
             the AF Form 664. Aircrew shall return unused cash to their local DoD
             Finance source upon return to home station. Present the completed SF 44 (for
             non-fuel charges only) to the appropriate home station administrative
             personnel for processing (e.g., Wing Refueling Document Control Officer,
             Finance Office, etc.)
      8.6.3.2.3. SF 44 purchases of ground services and other approved products (not fuel).
         8.6.3.2.3.1. Complete a separate SF 44 for non-fuel purchases. Provide the FBO
         copies 1 and 2 of the SF 44. The FBO shall use copy 1 and one copy of the FBO
         commercial invoice, if applicable, to directly bill/invoice the purchasing
         organization. Block 9 of the SF 44 shall reflect the organization name and
         address of the finance office responsible for payment to the FBO. The purchasing
         organization shall make payment to the FBO upon receipt of the invoice from the
         FBO. Log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664.
      8.6.3.2.4. If the vendor presents their own form for signature and accepts the SF 44,
      write the statement "SF 44 Executed" on the vendor‘s form.
      8.6.3.2.5. Turn in two copies of the SF 44 to the operations officer at home station.
      8.6.3.2.6. Present the aircraft identaplate for purchases at SITCO Agreement
      locations. Make certain the invoice includes date of transaction, grade of product,
      quantity issued/defueled, unit of measure, and signature of Air Force member who
      accepted product. If vendor also requires completed SF 44 write statement, ―AF
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    131


        FORMS EXECUTED‖ on vendor‘s invoice. Log and place a copy inside the AF
        Form 664.
     8.6.3.3. Purchasing Aviation Fuel in Canada. The DoD and Canadian Department of
     National Defense have signed a memorandum of understanding allowing DoD aircraft to
     use the DD1896, when refueling at Canadian airfields with a Canadian National Defense
     Contract (CNDC). Use the AIR for fuel purchases at Canadian airports without a CNDC,
     and for ground handling services at all Canadian airports.
     8.6.3.4. Use host country forms to effect purchases at foreign military airfields, including
     ―replacement-in-kind‖ locations. Hand scribe information from aircraft identaplate on
     the local form. Log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664.
     8.6.3.5. DD Form 791 , DoD In-Flight Issue Log, is used to log in-flight offload of
     fuel. The DD Form 791 can be submitted as a paper copy or electronically IAW local
     procedures. Except for gallons transferred, fill out all blocks on the form. Use eight digit
     tail numbers for the tanker and receivers. For Navy and Marine receivers, use six digit
     bureau number. Log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664 and turn it in IAW local
     procedures.
        8.6.3.5.1. Boom operators will:
            8.6.3.5.1.1. Collect all pertinent information to document in-flight refuel
            operation to include, receiver aircraft MDS, unit of assignment, and home station.
            Obtain information from flying schedule prior to flight, verbally/visually during
            flight, or by any means following flight. NOTE: Boom operators may submit an
            incomplete DD791 only after exhausting all means to obtain the required data. In
            those cases, boom operators must include a brief explanation as to why the data is
            missing. Unit commanders will develop a local procedure to collect required
            information prior to the form‘s final processing.
            8.6.3.5.1.2. Prior to fuel offload, get receiver aircraft‘s tail number (use
            interplane radio, boom interphone, or visually if open communication would
            compromise the mission during clandestine or covert operations or threaten safety
            of flight). When refueling the same receiver multiple times on a single mission,
            enter a separate line on the DD791 for each AR. NOTE: EMCON 2 or 3 training
            does not disqualify inter-plane radio to obtain or verify AR data. DO NOT use
            inter-plane radios during actual EMCON 2, 3, or 4 to obtain or verify AR data
            unless specifically authorized by the mission directive. Consider HAVE QUICK
            II and secure voice if visual conditions make the tail number too difficult to read.
            8.6.3.5.1.3. Do not use ―known/suspected‖ aircraft serial number that belongs to
            unit being fueled, but not necessarily the actual aircraft getting fuel. Auditors
            compare receiver unit aircraft serial numbers with fuel load reports at home
            station. If ―known/suspected‖ aircraft tail number billed is incorrect (down for
            maintenance/unable to fly), the auditor will reject the fuel bill and the tanker unit
            is liable for the cost of the fuel transferred.
            8.6.3.5.1.4. Comply with locally established procedures to complete DD791 for
            classified in-flight refuelings.
 132                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       8.6.3.6. AF Form 1994, Fuels Issue/Defuel Document, is used to record fuel
       purchases at USAF bases using a valid DD1896. The PIC or designated representative
       shall complete the form then log and place a copy inside the AF Form 664.
       8.6.3.7. AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
       Document , is used to record POL actions for a particular airframe IAW applicable
       directives. The PIC or designated representative shall complete the form and submit to
       maintenance debrief.
       8.6.3.8. DD1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, is the aircraft fuel and oil charge card.
       8.6.3.9. The PIC will verify the AFTO Form 781H is completed and turned in to
       maintenance debriefing following the mission.
       8.6.3.10. For off-station missions, the PIC will complete or verify accuracy of the AF
       Form 15, 315, 664, AFTO Form 781H, DD1898, and associated fuels receipts then place
       them in the AF Form 664 (use eight digits for all USAF aircraft tail number entries). The
       PIC will transmit all AF Form 664 information via phone, fax, or message if mission
       causes him/her to be off-station past the last day of the month
       8.6.3.11. Pilots will accurately record fueling actions on the AFTO Form 781H.
          8.6.3.11.1. Receiver capable aircraft will record fuel onloads using AFI Form 664.
          Record issuing tanker‘s refueling information (i.e., tail number, unit of assignment,
          and home station.).
       8.6.3.12. Prior to off-station mission or deployment, maintenance technicians will obtain
       sufficient fuels transaction forms to complete the deployment. Unless directed otherwise
       by the PIC, accurately complete all ground refueling/de-fueling documents and place
       them inside the AF Form 664.
       8.6.3.13. Wing scheduling will:
          8.6.3.13.1. Provide a member to the AVPOL advisory group.
          8.6.3.13.2. By the 7th of each month, prepare monthly report for invoice control
          officer (ICO). Include organization (squadron), MDS, programmed flying hours for
          previous and current months in the report.
          8.6.3.13.3. Include receivers‘ MDS, command of assignment, unit or squadron,
          DoDAAC for USAF receivers, UIC for USN receivers, POC name, phone number,
          and home station name (for each in-flight refueling sortie) on the weekly schedule.
          8.6.3.13.4. Maintain the wing‘s current master list of receiver unit POCs and
          telephone numbers.
8.7. Not Used.
8.8. AMC Form 54, Aircraft Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities , is used to report
level of excellence for services encountered during mobility operations. Be quick to identify
outstanding performers and attempt to resolve problems at lowest level practical. PICs should
advise affected agency on their intent to submit an AMC Form 54. Provide a copy of the

                      TRAINING AND OPERATING LIMITATIONS

9.1. General. This chapter outlines training policy and applies to all AMC and AMC-gained
units performing AMC-directed missions, local training, or off-station training flights.
9.1. (459ARW)General. For KC-135 VFR operations at KADW, Fly a rectangular pattern
altitude of 1500‘ MSL. Unless directed otherwise by tower, proceed north to Suitland Parkway
when operating on Rwy 01L/01R and proceed south to a point abeam the base lake when
operating on Rwy 19L/19R before starting a crosswind turn.
   9.1.1. (Added-459ARW) ACs will pass to 459 ARW CP an alternate training base and
   ETA if it is other than scheduled. An aircrew electing to conduct training at an airfield other
   than those listed below must obtain approval from the OG/CC.
       9.1.1.1. (Added-459ARW) Alternate training bases are as follows:
NAS Patuxent River (KNHK)
McGuire AFB (KWRI)
Dover AFB (KDOV)
Wright Patterson AFB (KFFO)
Grissom JRB (KGUS)
Seymour Johnson AFB (KGSB)
Charleston AFB (KCHS)
Knoxville/McGhee-Tyson (KTYS)
Rickenbacker Intl (KLCK)
       9.1.1.2. (Added-459ARW) Due to airspace issues, very little tactical training may be
       accomplished at KADW. Overhead patterns and curvilinear approaches from the east
       may be approved.
       9.1.1.3. (Added-459ARW) Between 2300L and 0600L, only full-stop landings are
       authorized at KADW.
9.2. Passengers on Training Missions.
   9.2.1. Initial qualification or re-qualification for pilots will not be conducted with passengers
   onboard.
   9.2.2. Mission qualification training may be conducted on sorties with passengers onboard
   only if the individual in training is qualified (completed flight evaluation with a valid AF
   Form 8). Tanker and receiver AR is authorized if the pilot flying is qualified.
   9.2.3. Touch-and-go landings are prohibited with passengers onboard (N/A with MEGP
   passengers).
EXCEPTION:
 When approved by the MAJCOM, maintenance and civilian employees, under direct contract to
the DoD and engaged in official direct mission support activities, considered ―mission essential‖
may be onboard when touch-and-go landings are performed providing the mission is a
designated training flight and an IP or EP is in command.

                                           Chapter 10

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   initial radiation, and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a
   nuclear detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                   141


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
  equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
     10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
     attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
     at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
     controlling OPORD.
     10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
     reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
     aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
     the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
     landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
     engines and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors/hatches,
     don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the
     base. If time does not permit using base facilities, and the attack is a missile attack,
     remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow
     host-base guidance.
     10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
     contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
     and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
     contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
     the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
     10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
     aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
     includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
     shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
     (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
     canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
     gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
     They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
     The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew
     Life Support (ALS) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
     Control Area (ACCA). (Note: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask).
         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.

         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
      contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
      such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
      to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
      and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
      zone. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection; seal
      windows and doors, turn off HVAC systems, and use room above the first floor when
      possible.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended. Follow smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior
         contamination.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
      Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
      method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       143


      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination‘s alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 618 TACC or theater C2 agency (normally
   through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical
   pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue of dosimetry for potential
   radiological hazards.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist,
   to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to
   descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination‘s MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
 144                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-Line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags and properly marked IAW technical order requirements. Aircrew members entering the
   aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and
   ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
   entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decontamination procedures.
   Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and
   overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
   a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user‘s responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                                 145


    10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
    ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
    passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
    contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
    aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. (NOTE: An altitude below
    10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.)
    10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
    resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
    consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
    determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
    adverse physiological effects.
    10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
    thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
    performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
    full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A
    more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological,
    Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.

NOTES:
1. If wearing MOPP 4, add 10ºF to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing personal body
   armor in humid climates, add 5ºF to WBGT.
2. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if possible.
3. Caution: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not exceed 1 quart.
    The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and hydration for at least
    4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water needs will vary ± quart/ hour.
4. NL=no limit to work time per hour.


    10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
    actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
 146                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
        10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
        whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
        seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
        chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
        10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
        (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
        equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
        may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
        with agent residue is avoided.
        10.5.10.3. Table 10.1 shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
        10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
        case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
        phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                           Chapter 11

                                NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide enroute
KC-135 navigation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in
AFI 11-202, Volume 3, AFI 11-217, and FLIP. Since airspace and associated navigational aid
equipment capability are rapidly evolving, pilots must maintain an in depth knowledge of current
requirements/policies.
For Navigator responsibilities (SOAR and Non-SOAR) during 4-person operations see paragraph
6.58.
11.2. Navigation Databases.
   11.2.1. Flight Planning Navigation Database. Flight plans created using the Advanced
   Computer Flight Plan (ACFP) or the Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) use the
   navigation date from the Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF). Pilots are
   responsible for ensuring the accuracy of flight plan waypoints against current aeronautical
   charts, terminal instrument procedures, or FLIP documents (i.e. AP/1B). These flight plans
   may be saved to a PCMIA card and loaded directly into the FMS using the FMS data loader.
   11.2.2. Aircraft Navigation Database. The FMS uses a navigation database provided by the
   National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). This database is stored on a PCMIA card
   that is uploaded into the FMS prior to flight.  The FMS is not certified for terminal
   operations in Block 30.
       11.2.2.1. The PIC will ensure the navigation waypoints loaded in the FMS flight plan
       accurately reflect the intended/cleared route of flight. This can be done using one or
       more of the following methods:
           11.2.2.1.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
           11.2.2.1.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude are verified for
           each waypoint.
           11.2.2.1.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
       11.2.2.2. In some cases, waypoints in the database may differ from the charted
       instrument procedure. Differences less than 0.3nm are acceptable for GPS overlay
       approaches. For stand-alone GPS and RNAV approaches, the maximum allowable
       difference is 0.1nm. If distance information varies by more than these tolerances, the
       procedure shall not be flown. Variation between charted final approach course in the
       instrument approach procedure and the final approach course computed by the aircraft
       should be no more than 5 degrees. If the two differ by more than 5 degrees, the
       procedure is not authorized.
11.3. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further
guidance). US Military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       149


airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US
officials known as Defense Attache Officers (DAOs).
   11.3.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
   airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states" territorial
   seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal
   state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland
   waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such
   areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
   11.3.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
   Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
   operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
   provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by
   the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond
   12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
   differ from the standard.
   11.3.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
   information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international borders
   or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of
   the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
   11.3.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into
   territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend
   entry point(s).
   11.3.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
   departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance
   has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
   11.3.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
   penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
   country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
   11.3.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts to
   negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response will
   be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination,
   as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of
   flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should
   aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over sovereign airspace, which was
   not approved through diplomatic channels before mission departure, as being valid
   authorization.
   11.3.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will
   normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited
   before performing the critical portion of the mission.
   11.3.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to
   and will not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2
   and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option
 150                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   obligates the military PIC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other
   air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to
   protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical.
   Refer to FLIP GP for additional guidance on due regard.
11.4. En route Navigation Procedures.
   11.4.1. Navigation Systems Crosscheck.
       11.4.1.1. As a minimum, pilots should obtain a navigation system crosscheck every 30
       minutes during cruise. Update automatic navigation computers as necessary to ensure the
       computer present position remains within 5 NM of the actual aircraft position. This
       update requirement does not apply to malfunctioning automatic DR equipment that is not
       being used for navigation.
       11.4.1.2. For operations in oceanic airspace, follow additional navigation systems
       crosscheck requirements IAW paragraph 11.5.
   11.4.2. Navigation Charts.
       11.4.2.1. Maintain an in-flight chart for all missions which depart the airport traffic area.
       Use the chart to assist with in-flight navigation.
       11.4.2.2. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
       chart.
   11.4.3. Air Traffic Rules.
       11.4.3.1. This section provides guidance for aircrews operating worldwide. See chapter 6
       of the FLIP General Planning, the Foreign Clearance Guide, FAA Handbook 7610.4, and
       AFI 11-202 Volume 3 for additional requirements or restrictions.
       11.4.3.2. Unless authorized by the controlling agency, aircraft operating in controlled
       airspace under IFR on all routes published or unpublished, must fly along a direct course
       between NAVAIDS or fixes defining the route (AFI 11-202 Volume 3). Deviations will
       only be approved by the controlling agency or when operating in special-use airspace or
       on Military Training Routes (MTRs).
11.5. Oceanic Flight. Maintaining situational awareness during oceanic flight is essential to the
safe conduct of the flight. Situational awareness includes, but is not limited to, positional
awareness and accurate fuel updates. This requires due diligence on the part of all aircrew
members.
NOTE:
 The following information also applies to extended flight in non-radar environments where
position reporting is required.
   11.5.1. Oceanic Plotting Charts.
       11.5.1.1. Prior to flight, plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate chart.
       Annotate the chart with the mission number, aircraft commander‘s name, preparer‘s
       name, and date. If practical, chart may be reused.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    151


     11.5.1.2. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the Category I Route
     or over-water segment. Perform a gross error check using available NAVAIDS and
     annotate the position and time on the chart.
     11.5.1.3. When approaching each waypoint on a Category I route, recheck coordinates
     for the next waypoints.
     11.5.1.4. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record and plot
     the aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with courses and ETA
     tolerances.
     11.5.1.5. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
     chart.
     11.5.1.6. Upon return to home station, turn in the charts (copies if reused) and applicable
     computer flight plans to the squadron or applicable mission planning office. Squadrons
     will retain the charts, computer flight plans, and associated materials for a minimum of 3
     months.
  11.5.2. Inertial Navigation System.
     11.5.2.1. In-Flight, use all available NAVAIDS to monitor INS performance.
     Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability, which degrades
     centerline accuracy to the controlling ARTCC. Use the following procedures for flight
     progress:
     11.5.2.2. Steering should be through FMS pilot‘s steering source-autopilot tie-in except
     when conducting AR.
     11.5.2.3. At intervals not to exceed 30 minutes compare present position coordinates for
     each INU (pure and GPS-mixed positions).
     11.5.2.4. Should one or both INUs become inoperative or INU positions noticeably
     separate determine the most accurate navigation system using all available NAVAIDS
     (i.e. MAJCOM-approved GPS). Utilize steering solution of INU determined to be the
     most accurate.
  11.5.3. Differences Between Navigation Systems. When there is a difference between the
  INUs and GPS systems, normally two of the three will be in close proximity. This will help
  to determine which navigation system is becoming inaccurate. When available, check
  position using available ground NAVAIDS. Comparing the doppler groundspeed (if
  available) with the groundspeed derived from each system may also provide an indication of
  a malfunctioning system. If divergence has been gradual, it should have been determined
  which INU is accurate, then follow one unit inoperative procedure. If divergence has been
  sudden, check groundspeed function, as abnormal readouts would indicate a faulty INU. If
  unable to determine which INS unit is in error, follow two units inoperative procedure.
     11.5.3.1. One INU unit inoperative:
         11.5.3.1.1. Advise ARTCC.
         11.5.3.1.2. Plot position on navigation chart every 30 minutes.
 152                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


          11.5.3.1.3. Check the accuracy of remaining INU, using all available NAVAIDS
          (VOR/DME, GPS, and radar).
       11.5.3.2. Two units inoperative:
          11.5.3.2.1. Advise ARTCC.
          11.5.3.2.2. Crosscheck system heading with mission plan at waypoint or every 30
          minutes.
          11.5.3.2.3. Verify last recorded position on chart.
          11.5.3.2.4. Use computer flight plan as guide.
          11.5.3.2.5. Use ADF, VOR/DME, and ground map radar to update positions.
          11.5.3.2.6. If desired and other methods fail, try to obtain an HF DF fix. This service
          can be requested through the regular ARTCC frequencies.
11.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM). Airspace where RVSM is applied is
considered special qualification airspace. See FLIP GP for aircraft equipment requirements.
Both the operator and the specific aircraft must be approved for operations in these areas.
Always refer to the appropriate Area Planning (AP) publication for specific theater RVSM
requirements.
   11.6.1. Operations in RVSM airspace. In addition to the requirements established in the
   applicable AP publication, always comply with the following when operating in RVSM
   airspace:
       11.6.1.1. Both primary altimeters, the autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and the
       transponder, must be fully operational. Request a new clearance to avoid this airspace
       should any of this equipment fail.
       11.6.1.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
       the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
       11.6.1.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out.         Record
       readings of both altimeters.
       11.6.1.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
       11.6.1.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
       other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
       11.6.1.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
       RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
       11.6.1.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
       equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM tolerances.
       11.6.1.8. In the North Atlantic Region, Minimum Navigation Performance Specification
       (MNPS) airspace is a subdivision of RVSM airspace. Refer to FLIP AP/2 and paragraph
       11.5 for detailed requirements when operating in MNPS airspace.
11.7. Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Operations.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    153


   11.7.1. Operations within the North Atlantic area‘s MNPS airspace, Canadian MNPS, or
   selected Pacific routes are designed for INS-auto-pilot coupled operation. (See FLIP AP/2,
   chapter 5 and AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules). When not engaged in AR
   operations, aircrews will adhere to these procedures. Comply with FLIP for operations in
   North Atlantic Minimum Navigation Performance Specification Airspace, and US West
   Coast to Hawaii Route System Procedures.
   11.7.2. Malfunctioning equipment that reduces the aircrew‘s capability to comply with
   MNPS, whether occurring prior to, or within MNPS airspace, will immediately be reported to
   the controlling agency and subsequent agencies throughout the route of flight. Prior to
   airspace entry, aircrews will return to the nearest maintenance repair facility unless the
   aircraft has a minimum of two operable and correctly functioning INUs, unless specifically
   cleared to proceed along original, or revised routing by the controlling agency. If subsequent
   failures occur, advise ARTCC, comply with track restrictions, and use all means available
   (HF DR, dead reckoning, etc) to ensure navigation accuracy.
   11.7.3. When flying in MNPS airspace, exercise special caution to ensure the coordinates of
   the assigned track and associated landfall and domestic routings are fully understood and
   correctly inserted into the automatic DR navigation system with appropriate cross-checks. If
   at any time the route (re-routing, if appropriate) is in doubt, check the details with ARTCC
   facility.
   11.7.4. When flying in MNPS airspace, crews will utilize Strategic Lateral Offset
   Procedures (SLOP) to the max extent possible. Refer to the MNPS Manual and AFI 11-217
   for further information on SLOP.
11.8. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied is
considered special qualification airspace and can be determined by referencing the applicable
theater AP publication. The PIC is responsible for a thorough review of the aircraft forms and
maintenance logs to ascertain the status of RNP equipment. During flight, immediately notify
ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RNP airspace and coordinate a plan of
action. Document in the aircraft forms, malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment,
including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
   11.8.1. RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM of actual position
   95% of the time. KC-135 aircraft with properly functioning steering solutions may operate
   in RNP-10 airspace without time limitations. If the capability to update the inertial
   navigation solution with the GPS is lost, or if the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring
   (RAIM) is lost, the aircraft is limited to 6.2 hours of operation in RNP-10 airspace after the
   GPS or RAIM is degraded.
       11.8.1.1. At least two long range navigation systems certified for RNP-10 must be
       operational at the oceanic entry point. Periodic crosschecks will be accomplished to
       identify navigation errors and prevent inadvertent deviation from ATC-cleared routes.
       Advise ATC of the deterioration or failure of navigation equipment below navigation
       performance requirements and coordinate appropriate actions.
   11.8.2. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV). The KC-135 is approved for BRNAV operations.
   BRNAV is defined as RNAV with an accuracy that meets RNP-5 for operations under IFR in
   that European airspace designated for BRNAV/RNP-5 operations. When operating in
 154                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   BRNAV airspace, aircrews will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment
   fails, or is unable to meet BRNAV tolerances. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions
   or failures of RNP required equipment including the failure of this equipment to meet
   BRNAV tolerances.
11.9. FM Immunity (FMI) Operations in Europe. ICAO Europe mandates VHF navigation
immunity standards from FM radio broadcast interference. The most likely characteristic of FM
navigation interference is desensitized deflection of the course deviation indicator while using
VOR navigation signals or on an ILS/LOC approach. Prior to deploying to the European
Theater, aircrews will review and be familiar with this section, and the FMI section of the JCS
NOTAM webpage.
   11.9.1. Aircraft equipped with dual FMI VHF navigation receivers are considered fully
   compliant and will follow normal procedures. If one of the two FMI receivers fails in-flight
   the crew may continue the mission using single FMI receiver procedures below.
       11.9.1.1. Wings/Groups will ensure aircraft FMI status is recorded in GDSS/C2IPS
       remarks. Remarks will state "Tail #xx-xxx is FM immune", "Tail #xx-xxx has single FM
       immune receiver", or "Tail #xx-xxx is non-FM immune".
           11.9.1.1.1. "FM immune" indicates operations normal.
           11.9.1.1.2. "Single FM immune receiver" indicates circumnavigation is required of
           airspace requiring 2 FM immune receivers or as outlined in paragraph 11.9.3 below.
           11.9.1.1.3. "Non-FM immune" indicates circumnavigation of countries not providing
           exemptions or as outlined in paragraph 11.9.4 below.
   11.9.2. Some countries will post their FMI national information in FLIP or NOTAMs listed
   by nation and/or regional prohibitions and restrictions. For countries that do not post
   information that permits non-FMI use, assume FMI-equipped VOR/ILS is required. If an
   airfield is designated in FLIP or NOTAMs as using the generic method of analysis and no
   interference has been identified, the crew may then operate non-FMI receivers for departure,
   approach and landing. The generic method of analysis is defined as the host nation
   conducting analysis of the FM spectrum and publishing any noted interference.
   11.9.3. Single-FMI receiver mission planning and operations. Do not use the non-FMI
   receiver as the primary flight navigation for IFR navigation in airspace requiring FM immune
   receivers. Both pilots will configure their displays with the FMI receiver information for
   departure and approach procedures. If the single FMI receiver fails, revert to non-FMI
   procedures outlined in paragraph 11.10.4. below. Aircrews will report FMI status to
   command and control element upon initial contact. Standardized equipment codes for
   DD1801              block           10           can           be           found         at:
   https://www.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/docs/publication_77.doc.
       11.9.3.1. Single-FMI receiver departure planning and procedures. Aircrews will not fly
       departure procedures which require the cross-tuning of a second VOR. If the host nation
       has provided an exemption, a single FMI receiver on board is sufficient to be considered
       FMI compliant. If an aircraft normally carries two VOR/ILS receivers, but is equipped
       with only one FMI receiver and the host nation has not published an exemption for a
       single FMI receiver, circumnavigate that airspace or proceed as a non-FMI aircraft if
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                 155


     allowed by the host nation. Review departure alternate procedures when departing an
     FMI required field and file a destination alternate when filing to an FMI required
     destination, regardless of weather requirements. The alternate must meet approach
     requirements for the equipment installed on the aircraft and normal weather requirements
     for alternate designation.
     11.9.3.2. Single-FMI receiver en route planning and procedures. Navigation may be
     accomplished via normal procedures using the FMI receiver. Crews will pay special
     attention to fuel requirements keeping FMI, weather, and approach availability in mind.
     11.9.3.3. Single-FMI receiver arrival planning and procedures. Fly an ILS approach
     where a PAR is not available. An ILS approach is restricted to localizer minimums.
     TACAN, ASR, GPS, MLS and visual approaches remain valid alternate approaches if the
     aircraft is appropriately equipped. To fly a night visual approach, crews must obtain
     radar vectoring for a straight in approach to a runway equipped with VASI/PAPI
     guidance. Aircrews are reminded of the requirement to review appropriate terrain charts
     prior to descent into unfamiliar areas to ensure situational awareness of obstructions.
     This requirement becomes increasingly critical and difficult to accomplish when flying
     radar vectors to a visual approach. Aircrews will not fly arrival or approach procedures
     which require the cross-tuning of a second VOR. The aircraft must possess the
     equipment necessary to fly the published missed approach procedure or the crew must
     coordinate alternate missed approach procedures with ATC. If stated in FMI NOTAMs
     or FLIP AP/2, host countries may require the crew to declare FMI status to approach
     control. Clearance for the approach does not authorize use of non-FMI receivers at
     airfields not labeled "generic method of analysis" in FLIP/NOTAMs.
  11.9.4. Non-FMI receiver mission planning and operations. Do not use the non-FMI
  receivers as the primary flight navigation reference during IFR flight in airspace requiring
  FM immune receivers. Standardized equipment codes for DD1801 block 10 can be found at:
  https://www.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/docs/publication_77.doc.
     11.9.4.1. Non-FMI receiver departure planning and procedures. If host nations
     recognize operational air traffic (OAT), be prepared to file OAT rather than general air
     traffic (GAT), unless host nations have published specific FMI exemptions. Review
     departure alternate procedures when departing an FMI required field and file a
     destination alternate when filing to an FMI required destination, regardless of weather
     requirements. The alternate must meet approach requirements for the equipment installed
     on the aircraft and normal weather requirements for alternate designation.
     11.9.4.2. Non-FMI receiver en route planning and procedures. If required by a host
     nation, as stated in FMI NOTAMs or FLIP AP/2, aircrew will announce FMI status upon
     check-in with ATC controllers. Navigation workarounds include BRNAV certification
     and TACAN-to-TACAN navigation.
     11.9.4.3. Non-FMI receiver arrival planning and procedures. Fly a PAR approach if
     available. The pilot may fly a VOR/ILS precision approach only when FLIP/NOTAMs
     labels the field "generic method of analysis". At fields not labeled "generic method of
     analysis", clearance for the approach does not authorize use of non-FMI receivers. Do
     not execute an approach at an airfield with known or suspected interference unless in an
     extreme emergency. Terminate the approach if interference is reported, suspected, or
156                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


      encountered at a field previously noted to be free of FM interference by the generic
      method of analysis. TACAN, ASR, GPS, MLS and visual approaches remain valid
      alternate approaches available to the crew if the aircraft is appropriately equipped. The
      aircraft must possess the equipment necessary to fly the published missed approach
      procedure or the crew must coordinate alternate missed approach procedures with ATC.
      To fly a night visual approach, crews must obtain radar vectoring for a straight in
      approach to a runway equipped with VASI/PAPI guidance. Aircrews are reminded of the
      requirement to review appropriate terrain charts prior to descent into unfamiliar areas to
      ensure situational awareness of obstructions. This requirement becomes increasingly
      critical and difficult to accomplish when flying radar vectors to a visual approach.
      Aircrews will report FMI status to command and control element upon initial contact.
  11.9.5. Emergency Procedures. During an emergency, the crew may only use a non-FMI
  receiver as a last resort to facilitate a safe landing. Fly a precision approach (PAR or FMI
  ILS/LOC) as primary, non-precision approach (weather permitting), or visual approach
  (weather permitting) if unable to proceed to divert base. If possible, divert prior to using a
  non-FMI receiver for approaches in IMC conditions.
  11.9.6. Formation. The lead aircraft should be FMI-compliant or the entire cell will follow
  non-FMI procedures outlined in paragraph 5. Upon arrival at the cell formation termination
  or break-up point of FMI compliant formation, any non-compliant cell aircraft will proceed
  via non-FMI procedures outlined in paragraph 11.9.4. If cell breakup is ATC directed, non-
  FMI aircraft will announce status to ATC and follow their directions.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                   157


                                            Chapter 12

                  AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrews may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
12.2. (459ARW)Responsibilities. The AC is responsible for ensuring the cleanliness of the
aircraft. Crewmembers are responsible for cleaning around their crew positions. ACs will
ensure that the entire crew emphasizes cabin cleanliness during passenger or live AE missions.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not authorized to clear a Red X. If a situation is
encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not
available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home station
MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Aircrews are normally not required to
service the aircraft, however, aircrew members current in aircraft servicing (G190) may augment
qualified refueling supervisors. The aircraft servicing course does not qualify crews to perform
maintenance tasks. Aircrew members are not authorized to serve as refueling supervisors, only
qualified transient alert and maintenance personnel may serve as refueling supervisors.
   12.4.1. Do not refuel with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100 capabilities.
   AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency conditions. All
   JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to support transient
   aircraft. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs comply with the following:
       12.4.1.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry stating ―Caution: Aircraft refueled using JP-
       8+100, preventative measures must be taken when de-fueling.‖
       12.4.1.2. De-fuel the aircraft prior to next flight.
   12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent ground operations (simultaneous
   refueling or defueling while maintenance operations are being performed) will be in
   accordance with TO 00-25-172 and applicable KC-135 2-2 series maintenance technical
   orders for approved concurrent maintenance actions.
       12.4.2.1. Movement into or within the safe area must be under control of the chief
       servicing supervisor (CSS). Individuals must properly ground themselves before
       boarding the aircraft or handling fuel-servicing equipment.
12.5. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). When an aircraft will
land at a base other than the MOB, a crew chief should accompany the aircraft. The PIC is
responsible for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings.
   12.5.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       12.5.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       12.5.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
 158                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       12.5.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       12.5.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       12.5.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
       12.5.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
       12.5.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
   12.5.2. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
   12.5.3. Lightning strike. Dash-6 inspections following a lightning strike must be performed
   by maintenance personnel trained in KC-135 maintenance.
12.6. Engine Monitoring. Crews will perform a manual TEMS Data collection as required by
maintenance procedures or failure of the TEMS monitor system. Failure of the TEMS monitor
system will be annotated in the AFTO 781.
   12.6.1. With TCTO 1608, a manual TEMS Data collection will be accomplished whenever
   the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) is inoperative (FDR circuit breaker pulled/popped, and/or
   FDR fail light on).
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      159


                                           Chapter 13

                 CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The BO coordinates on/offloading with air terminal operations or shipping
agencies; plans loads; and supervises on/offloading operations. Performs pre/postflight checks
of aircraft and systems, and computes aircraft weight and balance, ensures safety and comfort of
passengers and troops, and security of cargo, mail, and baggage during flight.
13.2. Responsibilities Aircraft Loading
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations.
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, preparation of cargo for air shipment, load planning
       (as required), computing load distribution and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to
       meet scheduled departure. They will advise the BO of destination, size, weight, and
       types of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) before starting loading operations to permit
       proper positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affecting on/off loading
       activity, and assign sufficient airfreight loading personnel for cargo handling. Aerial port
       personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment (MHE) and
       cargo to or from the aircraft cargo door. Under the supervision of the BO, aerial port
       personnel prepare the aircraft for on/off loading, stow loading/tiedown equipment if the
       aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically on/off load the aircraft and secure/remove
       tiedown devices as required.
       13.2.1.2. The BO is responsible for aircraft preflight; load planning preparation of
       weight and balance documentation; completing all required load computations; certifying
       load plans, operating aircraft equipment; supervising and directing on/off loading
       operations; and cargo tie down. They coordinate with the loading crew supervisor to
       verify cargo against load plan and manifests. The BO supervises loading operations and
       is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. The BO will notify
       the PIC, C2, or terminal operations officer if loading personnel are injured or cargo,
       aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during on/offloading. The BO will
       brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo and cargo jettison capability prior to engine start.
           13.2.1.2.1. Responsibility for Customs Procedures. Unless otherwise directed, use
           the Foreign Clearance Guide, the AMC Aircrew Border Clearance Guide, and
           Chapter 6 of this directive for specific inbound/outbound customs requirements.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will normally be accepted by the BO
       and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load, or any portion of it, will
       compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders or
       USAF/MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to HQ AMC/A3VK
       through Stan/Eval channels. AMC units will include AMC Form 54, Aircraft
       Commander‘s Report On Services/Facilities.

 160                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


 The BO may deviate from load plans only to facilitate ease of on/offloading of cargo and to
alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration. The BO must take into consideration the next
station‘s cargo configuration requirements and will ensure the aircraft is in proper weight and
balance limits.
       13.2.1.4. The BO is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for airlift.
       Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and may require the BO
       to seek advice of other personnel (i.e., available boom operators, squadron, group, wing
       or HQ AMC/A3VK evaluators) or use their best judgment, based on training, experience,
       and knowledge, to determine the safest and most efficient method of cargo loading.
          13.2.1.4.1. Non-standard cargo/equipment not contained in the aircraft loading
          manual (TO 1C-135-9) may require certification for air shipment. The shipper will
          provide a copy of the certification to the BO prior to loading. If the certification letter
          with loading instructions/requirements is not provided to the BO, the cargo will not
          be loaded. Contact Air Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA) or
          ASC/ENFC at Wright Patterson AFB, OH, voicemail (937) 255-2330/2547 or HQ
          AMC/A3V for questions concerning cargo certification.
          13.2.1.4.2. Maintenance is responsible for the upload and configuration of (daily)
          training mission equipment and cargo roller systems. Maintenance is responsible for
          uploading and assisting Boom operators with configuration of additional equipment
          needed per AFI 11-2KC-135 V3, Addenda A. Boom operators must ensure all
          equipment has been properly configured/secured and accomplish a cargo roller
          system preflight (if installed) prior to departure. Aircraft equipment must be
          inventoried and configured IAW T.O. 1C-135-21, Equipment Inventory List All -135
          Series Aircraft, AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3, C/KC-135 Aircraft Configuration,
          Addenda A and T.O. 1C-135-9, Cargo Loading Manual.
          13.2.1.4.3. Sufficient cargo handling and securing equipment must be on board each
          -135 to properly secure all planned cargo items from home station and items listed in
          departure and pre-departure messages.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities as described in paragraph 13.2.1.1 and provides sufficient qualified personnel
   and MHE for on/offloading. Boom operator‘s responsibilities and authority are the same as
   described in paragraph 13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.3.
   13.2.3. During Joint Airborne Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), Special Assignment
   Airlift Mission (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the BO can accept
   DD2133, Airlift Inspection Record, Joint, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment being
   offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspection signatures (user and
   transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable portions of the T.O. 1C-135-9. The
   DD2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous materials. This will be
   accomplished using the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
   13.3.1. Passengers, troops and crew must have ready access to emergency exits. Load
   aircraft in such a manner that at least one unobstructed safety aisle in the cargo compartment
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                        161


   allows movement from the crew compartment to the aft escape hatch and access to cargo for
   fire fighting.
NOTE:
 All passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the
safety aisle(s). Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle way, will be stowed
with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.2. When passengers are seated in extended canvas troop seats, the BO will ensure there
   is sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit passenger leg room.
   13.3.3. Ensure only adult, English-speaking passengers are seated next to emergency exits.
   Do not seat any passenger with infants, children under 15 years old, or physically challenged
   persons, in seats adjacent to emergency exits. Boom operators will demonstrate emergency
   hatch operation to persons seated next to emergency exits.
   13.3.4. Aisle requirement. A safety aisle is defined as a minimum 14 inch-wide space
   extending from the aircraft fuselage or the edge of the extended canvas troop seat to the
   vertical stacking line of the cargo and is sufficient for an individual to proceed through. If, in
   the case of centerline cargo loading with two aisles and sufficient aisle space cannot be
   maintained, passengers or cargo must be downloaded according to relative shipping priority.
   Tie-down devices are permitted, but they must not obstruct the opening or installation of
   hatches and operation of emergency gear or flap extension ports.
       13.3.4.1. When carrying palletized cargo, the right overwing hatch may be blocked.
       Ensure the hatch is secured IAW applicable flight manual prior to loading cargo and all
       other exits are clear and operable.
13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions.
       13.4.1.1. The BO, in coordination with aerial port personnel, establishes loading times.
       Loading times differing from the normal pre-departure sequence of events will be
       established, with PIC coordination, before the BO enters crew rest. Loading time is
       governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized, etc.)
       not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels. When reporting for
       duty, the BO checks in with the air terminal operation center (ATOC) or other designated
       location to obtain load breakdown and assist in load planning as required. The BO will
       ensure a fully stocked and serviceable hazardous spill kit or Protective Clothing Kit
       (PCK) is onboard prior to cargo upload.
           13.4.1.1.1. Duty Boom Operator Operations. Duty boom operators can be used as a
           means of flow control at stations with limited aerial port personnel and/or when units
           are deployed as part of an Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron (EARS) or
           tactical/contingency operation. They do not relieve the primary aircrew BO of
           aircraft preflight and cargo security check requirements. Duty boom operators ensure
           items loaded on aircraft do not exceed aircraft limitations and adequate restraint is
           applied to cargo to prevent movement. Duty boom operators are required to restrain
           cargo for flight limits. They will accomplish a basic cargo loading preflight and all
           appropriate loading preparation checklists prior to conducting loading operations and
162                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


         will ensure the flight crew receives sufficient copies of all required cargo load
         documentation. They will ensure the oncoming flight BO receives all required
         briefings on the aircraft load to include hazardous materials briefings. Boom
         operators performing this function must have crew rest prior to performance of these
         duties.
      13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each load. A consolidated
      statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
      available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
      cargo listing or floppy disks containing manifest information must accompany the load.
      13.4.1.3. Make every effort to exchange tiedown equipment on a one-for-one basis. If
      this is not possible, annotate the AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At
      non-AMC stations, 463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on all missions. The maximum
  number of passengers may be limited by the aircrew complement (see Table 3.1), amount of
  life support equipment, operable seats with seat belts, baggage securing capabilities, aircraft
  configuration and latrine capacity vs. personnel loading (see Table 6.4), as well as a
  thorough assessment of ORM based on mission requirements. Passengers will be seated as
  far forward in the passenger compartment as possible. Seating aft of the aft escape hatch is
  prohibited. PIC is the final authority for seat release.
      13.4.2.1. Passenger Missions Without Dedicated Passenger Monitor. Up to 10
      passengers of any category and 3 dedicated crew chiefs may be carried. Normally the
      boom operator will occupy the flight deck position for takeoff and landing. If the BO is
      seated on the flight deck, passengers will be seated as far forward in the passenger
      compartment as practical during takeoff and landing. The PIC may direct the BO to
      occupy a cargo/passenger compartment seat during takeoff and landing if deemed
      necessary. Prior to conducting air refueling, the boom operator will brief all personnel to
      remain seated with their seat-belt fastened during the air refueling.
      13.4.2.2. Manifesting.    Passenger service or base operations personnel manifest
      passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity. Sufficient copies of
      the passenger manifest must be given to the BO prior to passenger boarding.
      13.4.2.3. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity it will be necessary
      for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations not having this capability.
      These functions include manifesting, anti-hijack processing (IAW AFI 31-207), and
      ensuring visa/passport requirements are met.            Do not hesitate to contact 618
      TACC/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center (APCC); DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial
      618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as to who may travel to specific locations
      or passport/visa requirements. Aircraft operating within other MAJCOMs which have
      operational command and control over that aircraft will contact the appropriate C2 for
      specific details. File a copy of the passenger manifest (DD2131) with the flight plan. If
      not filed with the flight plan, annotate the location of the manifest on the flight plan IAW
      AFI 11-202V3.
      13.4.2.4. The PIC and BO are responsible to ensure all passengers are properly
      manifested.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                  163


     13.4.2.5. Brief passengers using the passenger briefing checklist unless the passenger
     briefing video has been shown. Passenger monitors will brief all passengers on
     emergency exits upon arrival at the aircraft. The passenger video does not include
     required individual briefings for personnel seated next to emergency exit hatches or
     mission specific information. A crew member must brief these items separately.
     13.4.2.5. (459ARW) If possible, the APU and engines should not be operated during the
     passenger briefing.
        13.4.2.5.1. Place one passenger information guide at each airline type seat and one
        for every 5 seating positions in the case of side facing troop seats. Passenger
        information       guides      may      be      obtained        electronically    at
        https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/docs/publication_75.pdf      from     the   AMC
        Stan/Eval Publications website. Order printed copies of the Air Force Visual Aid
        (AFVA) 11-226 at the Air Force Publications website http://www.e-
        publishing.af.mil/mastercatalog/master_catalog.asp.
     13.4.2.6. A passenger service representative or crew member will assist passengers at the
     bottom of the steps, and the BO will assist in seating passengers. Make every effort to
     seat families together to minimize confusion during an emergency egress. DVs,
     passengers requiring assistance and families should be boarded first.
        13.4.2.6.1. If aircraft auxiliary power unit is in use, provide hearing protection to
        passengers prior to boarding the aircraft.
     13.4.2.7. Use caution when on/offloading passengers without air stairs. The PIC is the
     final authority on whether passengers/troops will be on/offloaded when air stairs are
     unavailable.
     13.4.2.8. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
     has the option to either hold the child or place them in a Department of Transportation-
     approved infant car seats (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through
     AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all
     passengers (duty and space A), regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own
     seat. This policy provides an infant and their sponsor with a dedicated seat allowing the
     use of an ICS seat at the sponsor‘s discretion; this mirrors current FAA (commercial)
     standards. The FAA and USAF have banned the use of booster seats, harnesses, and vest
     child restraints.
        13.4.2.8.1. Passengers may hand-carry ICS. If used, these seats will be secured to a
        seat using the seat belt. Adults will not hold infant seats during any phase of flight.
        13.4.2.8.2. If the mission aircraft is equipped with aft facing "airline style‖ seats,
        secure ICS in the same manner as in an automobile. However, if the aircraft is
        configured with side-facing seats, aircrew must ensure the ICS is adequately secured.
        The design of the sidewall seatbelt makes it difficult to remove enough slack to
        secure the ICS. Crewmembers may need to reroute the seatbelt by crossing the belt,
        between the sidewall and the seatback webbing, routing the belt back through the
        webbing and through the securing point on the ICS. When removing slack from the
        seatbelt ensure the buckle remains on one side or the other so that it can be easily
 164                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


             accessed for release. The PIC is the final authority for determining whether the ICS
             is adequately secured.
        13.4.2.9. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
        In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with
        TALCE or deploying unit CC to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.
        13.4.2.10. Aircrew will not except unaccompanied baggage except in the following
        circumstances:
             13.4.2.10.1. Baggage has been processed through Traffic Management Office
             (TMO), or Installation Transportation Office (ITO) and arrives to the aircraft as
             freight.
             13.4.2.10.2. Baggage has been processed/manifested through AMC Passenger
             Terminal as RUSH baggage.
        13.4.2.11. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-
        101V15. The BO will ensure ATOC provides a copy of the AMC Form 70, RUSH
        Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of RUSH baggage.
        13.4.2.12. Decisions regarding eligibility or acceptance of a less abled passenger for a
        flight must be determined at the lowest level possible. Problems concerning eligibility or
        acceptance that cannot be resolved locally must be reported (circumstances, chronology,
        names, units, etc.) to HQ AMC/A4T. For time-sensitive problems, telephone HQ
        AMC/A4TP DSN 779-4592 or 618 TACC/APCC. PACAF/USAFE crews contact C2
        agency.

NOTE:
A troop seat is available at STA 1140 for crewmembers and crew chiefs.
         13.4.3.1. When securing removed roller trays, do not over-tighten cargo straps as this
         may cause warping. Prior to moving any pallet, pallet stops and roller tray assemblies
         must be reinstalled as required. Refer to T.O. 1C-135-9.
         13.4.3.2. Secure passenger baggage on top of any cargo pallet but do not exceed the 65-
         inch height limit. Do not wedge or secure baggage between pallets or between the
         aircraft fuselage and the adjacent RH side of pallets. If passenger baggage is not pre
         palletized, weights must be provided by passenger service or ATOC prior to loading.
         13.4.3.3. Duty passenger baggage requirements and the capability to safely stow all
         baggage and maintain aisle space to all emergency exits will be considered in overall
         planning for maximum seating arrangements when using the A/M 135 roller system for
         deployment/redeployment. Except for unit deployment/redeployment, use the following
         guidance for passenger seating requirements.
            13.4.3.3.1. Civilian passengers will be seated on the seat pallet in pallet position
            number one (if installed) or in LH and RH troop seats adjacent to empty pallet
            positions. They will not be seated in troop seats adjacent to cargo pallets. To
            enhance egress capability when carrying civilian passengers, troop seats adjacent to
            cargo pallets will be stowed, if practical. The number of pallets carried will
            determine seat release.
            13.4.3.3.2. The seat pallet will be moved forward one detent (approximately 10
            inches) to provide required 30 inch spacing forward of netted or strapped cargo. A
            sufficient aisle to and from the cockpit must be maintained for egress. Other pallets
            may be repositioned, and pallet stops and center roller tray assemblies removed IAW
            1C-135-9 for passenger comfort and safety. Do not decrease number of passenger for
            this purpose.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. The BO is key to good passenger relations. The following common sense rules
   should be observed:
         13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
         13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics
         and/or criticism of other personnel or organizations.
166                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


      13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
      willingness to help.
  13.5.2. Comments by the BO and the manner in which they are made often determine
  passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals;
  address them collectively only when making announcements.
      13.5.2.1. Deleted
  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures.
      13.5.3.1. The BO will brief all passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened
      during air refueling. This briefing will be conducted, as a minimum, in-flight just prior to
      the BO moving to the boom pod. Except during air refueling, passengers may move
      about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however, judgment must be exercised on
      the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any one time. Seated passengers
      will have seat belts fastened at all times. Discourage passengers from congregating
      around galley, lavatory and crew bunk areas. Passengers are not allowed to lounge or
      sleep under or on top of cargo, baggage bins, or baggage secured to the floor.
      13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on cabin temperature, passengers with small children
      and cleanliness of the cabin and lavatory.
      13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment.
      13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
      make passengers comfortable such as dimming or extinguishing unnecessary
      compartment lights.
      13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck or boom pod only when approved by the
      PIC. Use good judgment when requesting this authority.
      13.5.3.6. Passengers will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
  13.5.4. Meal Service. The AMC form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket, indicates if a meal was
  ordered by a passenger.
      13.5.4.1. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at
      point of departure. Avoid waking passengers to offer meals. Ask the PIC about expected
      flight conditions prior to serving meals.
      13.5.4.2. For passengers who ordered a meal, serve meals in the following sequence:
         13.5.4.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
         13.5.4.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
         13.5.4.2.3. All other passengers.
      13.5.4.3. Use the following procedures for box lunches:
         13.5.4.3.1. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the
         passenger‘s AMC Form 148.
      13.5.4.4. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       167


       13.5.4.5. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio
       contact with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, numbered of
       spoiled meals (by menu) and issuing organization.
       13.5.4.6. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, annotate the
       individual‘s boarding pass to reflect reimbursement is authorized. Inform passengers
       they may receive refunds at the next station or the originating or destination terminal.
          13.5.4.6.1. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet and returned
          to the in-flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF Form
          129, Tally In-Out, is received from fleet to relieve the BO of meal accountability.
       13.5.4.7. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on Transportation
       Working Capital Fund (TWCF) funded missions (including ANG and AFRC flown
       missions) for passenger consumption only. Complimentary snacks are not authorized on
       JA/ATT, Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port
       operations officer will ensure snacks and beverages are placed on board when departing
       AMC stations. When departing from other stations and no snacks or beverages are
       placed onboard, the BO may obtain required snacks and beverages from the local in-
       flight kitchen. Direct the in-flight kitchen to bill the accounting and finance office at the
       aircraft‘s home station. Record all unused snacks and beverages on AF Form 129 and
       return to the in-flight kitchen for turn-in credit.
13.6. Not Used.
13.7. En route and Post Flight Duties.
13.7. (459ARW)En route and Post Flight Duties. On DV or live AE missions returning to
KADW, the aircraft may be required to block-in on the west ramp for passenger download.
Coordinate parking with 459 ARW CP or 11 AW CP, as appropriate. After the download is
complete, taxi the aircraft to the 459 ARW ramp unless prohibited by crew duty day.
   13.7.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound BO is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound BO is responsible for
   planning and loading the outbound load.
   13.7.2. At stops where the primary BO is relieved of cargo unloading, brief relief personnel
   about passenger and aircraft equipment, any missing items, the location of through cargo,
   mail and baggage, and any information pertinent to through passengers. Point out cargo
   requiring special consideration (hazardous material, perishables, etc.). If unable to conduct a
   face to face briefing, leave written instructions with cargo manifest or local C2.
   13.7.3. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers
   are aboard, the BO will inform the protocol or traffic representative respectively.
   13.7.3. (459ARW) Unless mission requirements dictate otherwise, deplane passengers
   before unloading crew baggage.
13.8. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.8.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
 168                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
   coordinate with the BO prior to directing personnel to load any weapons.
   13.8.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized location for redistribution on arrival at the objective.
   Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.
13.9. Weight and Balance.
   13.9.1. Accomplish weight and balance according to T.O. 1C-135-5-1, Basic Weight Check
   List, Maintenance Data, Loading Data, and Fuel Loading Data, and Addenda A of this AFI,
   C/KC-135 Aircraft Configuration. The unit possessing the airplane maintains the primary
   weight and balance handbook containing the current airplane status and provides a
   supplemental weight and balance handbook for each airplane. Enclose the supplemental
   handbook in a wear-resistant binder labeled "Weight and Balance" with the airplane model
   and complete serial number on the cover or spine.
   13.9.2. The pilot will file the original DD FORM 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance
   Form F – Transport/Tactical at the departure airfield and maintain a physical or electronic
   copy for the duration of the flight.
13.10. Cargo Validation On/Offloading Procedures and Format. Use the following format
when tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any cargo requiring
special or specific on/offloading or tiedown procedures not currently listed in T.O. 1C-135-9.
After completion, send through standardization channels to HQ AMC/A3V.
   13.10.1. General Loading Data:
       13.10.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number
       (NSN), and a brief description of the item.
       13.10.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture

AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       169


13.11. Emergency Airlift of Personnel: Apply the following procedures to ensure a safe,
efficient loading method for the emergency airlift of personnel from areas faced with enemy
siege, hostile fire, for humanitarian reasons, or when directed by 618 TACC.
   13.11.1. Emergency airlift normally will be accomplished without the use of individual seats
   or safety belts. The maximum number of personnel who may be airlifted by seating them on
   a pallet sub-floor in the cargo compartment or cargo floor will vary. Seat personnel in rows
   facing forward and load in small groups of 8-10 so they may be positioned and restrained by
   connecting the pre-positioned tie-down straps from the left and right outboard pallet/tie-down
   rings. Load personal effects/baggage in any safe available position.
   13.11.2. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL 250.
13.12. Rucksacks: The following procedures apply to loading rucksacks.
   13.12.1. In all cases, load rucksacks on the same aircraft as the individual.
   13.12.2. Rucksacks will not normally fit under seats without obstructing the aisle way,
   therefore during administrative deployments they must be palletized or loaded in baggage
   bins.
   13.12.3. During tactical deployments, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will be carried by the
   individual onto the aircraft. Allocate pallet space on the load plan for loading rucksacks.
   13.12.4. Ensure all rucksacks are properly secured and their weight is accounted for on DD
   Form 365-4 and all load computations.
   13.12.5. The following procedures apply to transporting hazardous materials in rucksacks.
       13.12.5.1. Personnel will only be permitted to carry their basic combat load or individual
       issue of hazardous material when they will engage an enemy force immediately upon
       arrival. Personnel may retain small arms ammunition (cartridge for weapons, DOT 1.4)
       and nuclear, biological, and chemical equipment as long as it is retained in a carrier (i.e.,
       bandoleers, pouches, bags).
       13.12.5.2. Munitions and other hazardous materials placed in rucksacks, field packs, or
       other authorized containers, removed from their shipping container, must be adequately
       protected from accidental functioning. All carriers will be consolidated in one central
       location on the aircraft (as directed by the boom operator) and distributed to personnel
       after landing. Ensure compliance with AFMAN 24-204.
13.13. Not Used.
13.14. Cargo and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Issues.
   13.14.1. The PIC or BO is responsible for assuring all cargo is properly secured in
   compliance with T.O. 1C-135-9. Regardless of passenger seating, all cargo and the MP-2
   Seat Pallet will be secured using 3G forward restraint criteria. Certain items may require
   additional restraint based on ASC/ENFC certification.
       13.14.1.1. Aeromedical Patient Support Pallets (PSP) require 9G restraints. In order to
       be in compliance with the 9G forward restraint limitation, PSPs cannot exceed 2000
       pounds total weight without requiring supplemental restraint.
   13.14.2. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
 170                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       13.14.2.1. PICs will comply with AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials For
       Military Air Shipments, AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures For Aircraft Carrying
       Hazardous Materials, when carrying hazardous cargo.
   13.14.3. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, a 30-
   inch space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward occupied litter or
   occupied seat. When cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, the
   30-inch spacing is not required.
       13.14.3.1. Maintain 30 inch spacing between all litters and cargo on Aeromedical
       Evacuation (AE) missions, when carrying occupied litters.
13.15. Human Remains. Transport human remains on KC-135 aircraft IAW AMCI 24-101
Vol 11 and AMCI 11-208 guidance.
13.16. Blood and Body Fluid Cleanup.
   13.16.1. There may be times when the aircraft requires clean-up of blood or other body
   fluids during and/or following mission execution. This clean-up is designed to alleviate
   legitimate health concerns. Blood and body fluids such as vomit and feces may contain
   disease-causing organisms which can pose a health threat to crewmembers and passengers.
   To ensure the health of personnel traveling aboard the aircraft and minimize any risk to
   mission accomplishment, spills must be prevented and/or cleaned properly by aircraft
   crewmembers or ground personnel. As in-flight duties permit, aircrew members need to
   address these spills. Medical crew or critical care air transport team members will continue
   to be responsible for cleaning and disinfection of patient-related spills.
   13.16.2. When transporting human remains, the possibility of body fluid spills is minimal.
   Condensation may occur on transfer cases due to ice inside the container. If there appears to
   be fluid other than condensation, it needs to be cleaned as follows:
       13.16.2.1. If possible, put a barrier (plastic, paper towels, rags) down to minimize
       aircraft contamination. Dispose of these items IAW paragraph 13.16.2.2. The
       recommended method to clean and disinfect the area in-flight is to use the AMC SG/A44-
       approved blood and body fluid clean up kit to ensure proper personal protection and to
       prevent the spread of disease.
       13.16.2.2. Personnel cleaning the spill will wear the appropriate personal protective
       equipment included in the clean up kit. Personnel will not use the PCK for blood and
       body fluid clean up. The PCK contains items for use by aircrew during emergencies
       aboard aircraft carrying hazardous cargo IAW AFMAN 24-204. At no time will
       contaminated items be placed in the PCK. The in-flight ventilation system is sufficient to
       eliminate vapors when the pre-moistened towels are used. If decontaminated in-flight, no
       further action is necessary. Place an entry into the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
       Discrepancy and Work Document, to ensure the kit is replaced. Any disposable items
       used and any potentially contaminated trash must either be placed in red-biohazard bags
       located in the clean up kit or in double-thickness bags. These bags must be clearly
       marked as containing bio-hazards. Wash hands or use the hand sanitizer in the spill kit
       after cleaning the spill. Contact the nearest military medical treatment facility thru the
       local command post to arrange disposal of contaminated materials.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    171


     13.16.2.3. If a clean up kit is not available and an alternative means of containing the
     leaking bodily fluids exists, clean the spill by applying paper towels or rags to absorb the
     fluid, then wipe the area with approved aircraft cleaners or water, then wipe dry. The
     area still requires decontamination upon landing. Clearly mark the area and, upon
     landing, contact the local C2 to request assistance and/or equipment required to properly
     clean the spill.
  13.16.3. Any necessary post-flight disinfection will be in accordance with the weapons
  system-specific tech data and/or T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons System Cleaning and
  Corrosion Control. Failure to comply may result in degradation of the aircraft structure. If
  required, senior operations and maintenance personnel will decide what additional measures
  need to be taken to minimize exposure risk.
     13.16.3.1. Absorbent materials such as fabric seats may resist disinfection; you should
     dispose of these materials IAW paragraph 13.15.2.2. Use water and chlorine bleach to
     disinfect aircraft items such as nylon seats and cargo straps.
     13.16.3.2. The squadron medical technician can order the blood and body fluid clean up
     kit through their host medical logistics account. The National Stock Number is 6515-01-
     524-9755. Ensure two kits are onboard the aircraft. Units deploying to an AOR should
     deploy with additional kits.

                                          Chapter 14

                                      FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter outlines KC-135 fuel planning factors. It is designed to assist
pilots and planners in planning for KC-135 missions.
14.2. Fuel Requirements. This section augments AFI 11-202V3 fuel requirements.
   14.2.1. Authorized Fuel Loads and Sequences. Aircraft will be loaded with fuel according
   to requirements of T.O. 1C-135-5-3, Fuel Loading Data. The OG/CC or equivalent will
   issue waiver approval. Units may develop standard alternate fuel requirements for local
   training missions; however, these fuel requirements will not be less than those specified in
   this volume. NOTE: AMC units will not develop standard alternate fuel requirements.
   14.2.2. Required Ramp Fuel. Will consist of all fuel required for mission accomplishment,
   to include fuel required for engine start, taxi, APU operation, takeoff, enroute, enroute
   reserve, air refueling, decompression, descent, approach and landing, alternate, transition,
   holding/minimum landing.
   Final landing fuel will not be less than 8,800 pounds. (AMC) For AMC unit missions, local
   or operational, and AMC-gained units on 618 TACC operational missions, if the actual fuel
   load exceeds the required ramp fuel load by more than 5,000 lbs, defuel the aircraft to the
   required load. For 618 TACC-directed missions, when there is a conflict between an on-time
   departure and defueling, the 618 TACC deputy director for operations will determine which
   takes precedence (OG/CC for AMC local missions).
   14.2.2. (459ARW) Fuel loads will be in accordance with 459 ARW PAMPHLET 11-305.
       14.2.2.1. Start Engines, Taxi, APU operation, and Takeoff. A standard planning factor
       of 2500 lbs of fuel for R/T-model (3000 lbs for D/E-model) is typically used. Fuel
       planning may be adversely affected with considerable taxi operations or ATC delays.
       14.2.2.1. (459ARW) After landing and taking into account airfield conditions such as
       taxiway widths and obstructions, aircraft systems, and maintenance procedures, ACs will
       consider shutting down one pair of engines (usually inboards) for taxi to parking.
       14.2.2.2. En route Fuel. Fuel from Start of Climb segment at the departure location to
       Begin Descent Point at destination.
       14.2.2.3. Enroute Reserve. 10% of the flight time fuel over the Category 1 route/route
       segment, not to exceed 1+00 fuel at normal cruise. A Cat 1 route is any route on which
       the position of the aircraft cannot be accurately determined by the overhead crossing of a
       radio aid at least once each hour with positive course guidance between such radio aids.
       14.2.2.4. Air Refueling Fuel. Scheduled offload.
          14.2.2.4.1. KC-135 R/T receiver aircraft. Scheduled offload minus scheduled
          onload. If scheduled onloads are not completed it may be impossible to complete the
          mission.
       14.2.2.5. Decompression Fuel. Additional fuel may be needed to satisfy oxygen
       requirements. For flights where the total number of individuals on board the aircraft
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      173


       exceeds the total number of operational flight crew oxygen system stations, ensure there
       is sufficient fuel on board to allow for a loss of cabin pressurization from any point along
       the route, an emergency descent to 10,000 feet MSL minimum, and continued flight to
       the nearest suitable emergency airfield. To compute decompression fuel, examine the
       intended route of flight and determine the point furthest from a suitable emergency
       airfield. From the flight plan determine the amount of fuel remaining on board the
       aircraft at that point. Compare that fuel remaining value with the amount of fuel that
       would be required to proceed from that furthest point, at 10,000 ft, to the suitable
       emergency airfield, execute a descent, approach and landing, and land with 8,800 pounds
       plus 30 minutes of reserve fuel. Decompression fuel is not cumulative with Enroute
       Reserve fuel or contingency fuel.
       14.2.2.6. Descent, Approach and Landing. Plan an enroute descent whenever possible.
       14.2.2.7. Alternate. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202
       Volume 3, General Flight Rules. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields
       are preferred if within 75 nautical miles of destination. Plan a 45 minute fuel reserve at
       the alternate.
          14.2.2.7.1. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 requires an alternate to
          be filed. Refer to section 6.18, this instruction, for further guidance on selection of
          alternates.
       14.2.2.8. Holding (Fuel Reserves). Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at the destination or
       alternate (if an alternate is required). (AMC) Plan an additional 30 minutes of
       contingency fuel for any unforeseen circumstances.
          14.2.2.8.1. Remote destination. If weather conditions require an alternate airfield in
          accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, aircrews may use 2+00 hours of holding fuel
          in lieu of an alternate (1+15 holding in lieu of and 0+45 reserve). A remote or island
          destination is defined as any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic location,
          offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
       14.2.2.9. Transition. Fuel for transition training at the destination. Compute at 7.5% of
       airplane gross weight per hour. This includes fuel for the initial approach.
       14.2.2.10. Minimum Planned Fuel at Begin Descent Point. Consists of fuel required for
       descent, approach and landing, alternate/missed approach, and holding/minimum landing
       fuel. Units may develop standard alternate fuel requirements for local training missions
       however; these fuel requirements will not be less than those specified in this AFI.
   14.2.3. Identified Extra Fuel. This value will not exceed 5,000 pounds. Identified extra fuel
   may be added to RRFL: when fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops,
   for known holding delays in excess of standard, for anticipated off course weather avoidance,
   when reliable wind data or receiver profiles are not available. Mission planners will add an
   additional 2,500 pounds if the thunderstorm forecast for intended route of flight is scattered
   or numerous.
14.3. Computer Flight Plan. Only AMC-validated computer flight planning software is
approved for use in producing CFPs. The CFP normally serves as the fuel log. It is the crew‘s
responsibility to review each CFP and determine if the planned values chosen by the flight
 174                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


planner are sufficient and correct for the mission. The CFP fuel calculations must be verified.
This ensures the flight plan has been computed with the correct values. Confirming each and
every segment on the flight plan is not necessary. Every effort must be made to eliminate
unnecessary "padding" of fuel figures.
   14.3.1. When mission requirements dictate a change to the planned mission, the fuel must be
   recalculated to ensure safe completion of the flight. A pilot may insert the new FMS
   waypoints for flight plan changes and determine new leg distances. This distance must be
   converted to air distance by applying the FMS wind factor. When the new leg air distance is
   known, calculate the new leg burn-off and update the flight plan. It is recommended that the
   fuel difference be applied at the destination, then work the plan backwards, applying the new
   leg burn-offs and any air refueling onloads or offloads.
   14.3.2. Drag degradation (BDA attached, MPRS pods installed, MPRS hoses in trail, flaps or
   gear extended) can significantly increase fuel consumption. These and any other external
   configuration changes, will require modifications to increase standard fuel planning numbers.
   In addition, ballast fuel may be necessary in certain cargo/MPRS configurations for CG
   management. This fuel should be considered unusable. Consult applicable MDS
   performance manual.
14.4. Fuel Conservation. Conservation of fuel requires everyone‘s active participation. For
every pound of excess fuel, 3 percent of the excess will be burned each hour. Do not carry extra
fuel for convenience.
14.4. (459ARW)Fuel Conservation. Instructor pilots conducting upgrade training are
encouraged to emphasize fuel-saving techniques during mission pre-briefs and inflight.
Stan/Eval will make fuel conservation procedures a special interest item on all evaluations.
   14.4.1. For AMC units, or AMC-gained units on AMC missions, standard ramp fuel loads
   will not be used. For AMC units, or AMC-gained units on AMC missions, if actual fuel load
   exceeds the planned ramp fuel load by more than 5,000 lbs, defuel the aircraft to the planned
   fuel load. For AMC units, or AMC-gained units on AMC missions, if circumstances prevent
   defueling, PICs must request a waiver to carry the extra fuel from HQ AMC/A3VK.
   MAJCOMs will supplement this policy for their affected flights.
   14.4.2. Planning guidelines for fuel conservation:
       14.4.2.1. Use optimized CFPs when possible.
       14.4.2.2. Airlift Missions.
           14.4.2.2.1. Plan 99% best range cruise (Mach.79) and optimum altitude, unless
           mission requirements dictate otherwise.
       14.4.2.3. Tanker Missions.
           14.4.2.3.1. When cruise to/from AR track or anchor takes less than one hour in
           duration, plan to and from the AR track or anchor at best range and at an altitude as
           determined by mission requirements.
           14.4.2.3.2. When cruise to/from AR track or anchor exceeds one hour in duration,
           plan 99% best range cruise and optimum altitude, unless mission requirements dictate
           otherwise.

                                           Chapter 15

                                       AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. This chapter establishes air refueling guidelines applicable to KC-135 aircraft
and aircrews and is supplemental to those prescribed by the flight manual and other applicable
directives.
15.1. (459ARW)General. 459 OSF Current Operations contacts the receiver unit to ensure air
refueling information accuracy. After show time, the aircrew will attempt to confirm receiver
status through 459 ARW CP prior to departure.
15.2. AR Limitations. The following limitations apply:
   15.2.1. AR altitudes. AR operations will be conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or 10,000
   feet AGL, whichever is higher.                Comply with Low Altitude Operations
   procedures/restrictions in aircraft Technical Order (Section V). EXCEPTION: C-130 and
   A-10 receivers may be refueled as low as 5,000 feet AGL, if mission requirements dictate.
       15.2.1.1. AR operations based at or above 12,000 feet MSL, which momentarily fall
       below 10,000 feet AGL, but no lower than 5,000 feet AGL, due to over flight of
       mountain ridges, peaks, etc., are permissible.
       15.2.1.2. If refueling must be accomplished below 10,000 feet AGL, limit refueling time
       to the minimum required to meet operational requirements and then immediately recover
       to normal refueling altitudes. Crews must ensure thorough knowledge of terrain features
       when operating below 10,000 feet AGL and will limit operations to flat or rolling terrain,
       or over water.
       15.2.1.3. Pilots will fly no lower than an altitude that provides at least 5,000 ft. of
       clearance above the highest obstruction or terrain within 5 nautical miles either side of
       the planned course centerline.
   15.2.2. Refueling During Missions. AR should not be accomplished during missions under
   the following conditions unless operational necessity dictates.
       15.2.2.1. Conditions result in marginal control of either aircraft or boom (in the opinion
       of either the PIC or BO).
       15.2.2.2. Either tanker or receiver (except B-52) has less than the full number of engines
       operating.
       15.2.2.3. Tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear.
       15.2.2.4. Pod Control Panel malfunction exists that cannot be resolved.
       15.2.2.5. MPRS pod malfunction. NOTE: If Pod Control Panel is operational and only
       one pod is malfunctioning, AR is permissible with operational pod.
   15.2.3. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will notify receiver pilots when any axis of the
   autopilot is not used. If a tanker pilot or receiver pilot is required to fly autopilot-off for
   qualification training, the pilot flying the opposing aircraft will be qualified. Verbal
   notification and acknowledgement will take place between the tanker and receiver prior to
   conducting autopilot-off training.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                         177


NOTE:
 This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student receiver pilot and the
student tanker pilot are under direct IP supervision.
   15.2.4. AR Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability
   means the BO cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. After a known loss of tanker
   disconnect capability with a particular receiver, do not attempt further contacts with that
   receiver. If the tanker signal system (signal coil) checks good, contact attempts with other
   receivers are permitted. If an immediate disconnect cannot be triggered on two successive
   receiver systems, no further contacts will be attempted. Receiver pilots may attempt a
   contact with another tanker; however, after two successive failures to disconnect from
   multiple tankers, no further contacts will be attempted with that receiver.
EXCEPTION:
 Fuel emergency situations, OPLAN 8044 missions, contingency missions, JCS alert, receiver
over water deployment or re-deployment, operational reconnaissance missions, prime nuclear
airlift force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is essential for
home base recovery, or when authorized in the mission directive.
NOTE:
 When conducting AR without tanker disconnect capability, limit contacts to the minimum
number necessary to complete mission requirements. Do not accomplish boom limit
demonstrations, or practice emergency separations while in contact.
   15.2.5. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) [also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching
   (EBL)]. Normal tanker disconnect capability and automatic disconnect limits are
   inoperative. Training and evaluation in MBL procedures may only be accomplished under
   the following conditions:
       15.2.5.1. Direct IP supervision on board receiver aircraft (if other than fighter type).
       15.2.5.2. Limit contacts to minimum required.
       15.2.5.3. Receiver and tanker AR systems must be fully operable.
       15.2.5.4. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or practice emergency
       separations.
NOTE:
 The BO and receiver pilot must coordinate all actions required by applicable directives and
checklists when making AR contacts during the situations listed above.
   15.2.6. Reverse AR will be accomplished only in an emergency or for operational necessity,
   or IAW FTU syllabus training.
   15.2.7. Practice Emergency Separations.
       15.2.7.1. Prior to actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
       coordination between the tanker pilot, BO, and receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination
       must include information on when the separation will occur and who will give the
       command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over interphone
       with the BO.
 178                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       15.2.7.2. If separation is initiated from the contact position, the receiver‘s AR system
       must be in normal, and tanker disconnect capability must be verified by a boom operator
       initiated disconnect prior to accomplishing the separation. Tanker disconnect capability
       will not be verified on the same contact as the Practice Emergency Separation, and will
       be verified with each receiver that accomplishes a Practice Emergency Separation.
       15.2.7.3. May be accomplished with passengers on board. Ensure all passengers are
       seated with seat belts fastened.
   15.2.8. Limits Demonstration. KC-135 tanker disconnect capability must be verified by a
   BO initiated disconnect prior to receivers conducting limits demonstrations.
   15.2.9. Receiver AR Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. The following procedures
   apply:
       15.2.9.1. The receiver pilot must inform the tanker crew of training status, and receive
       acknowledgment from the tanker BO.
       15.2.9.2. The BO operating the boom controls must be qualified for the applicable
       category receiver.
NOTE:
 This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student BO is under direct
instructor supervision.
   15.2.10. Boom Operator Qualification or Training. Unqualified and non-current boom
   operators must be under direct instructor supervision to conduct AR operations. Instructor
   boom operators supervising AR must have immediate access to the ruddevator control stick,
   and have immediate communication capability with receiver pilot.
   15.2.11. Operator Fatigue. If BO or receiver pilot fatigue becomes a factor during AR
   operations, the receiver will maintain well clear until fatigue is no longer a factor (operator
   judgment).
   15.2.12. Weather limitations.
       15.2.12.1. Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
       15.2.12.2. Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe
       refueling operations.
15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of AR shall discontinue AR and continue flight in accordance with the following
procedures:
   15.3.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes prior to exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.2. Receiver aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point
   shall exit the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling
   portion of the of the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio
   Failure IFR-VFR" as set forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
   15.3.3. Tanker aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall
   exit the track or anchor at the highest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                   179


   portion of the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure
   IFR-VFR" set forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
15.4. Operational Reporting. Air refueling command and control reporting will be in
accordance with Chapter 2 of this instruction.
15.5. MARSA Applicability for Aerial Refueling. MARSA begins between tanker and
receiver when tanker advises ATC it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO recognized
term. If in doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the aircrew is
responsible for, query the controlling agency.
   15.5.1. After MARSA has been declared, controller-assigned course or altitude changes
   prior to rendezvous completion will automatically void MARSA and are to be avoided.
   15.5.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made
   with the tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
   15.5.3. Upon rendezvous completion, receiver aircraft shall remain within 3 miles of the
   tanker until MARSA is terminated.
   15.5.4. After air refueling clearance is received and until rendezvous is completed, aerial
   refueling airspace from the ARIP to the ARCP is sterilized. After rendezvous is completed
   and tankers or receivers proceed down track, other non-participating aircraft may be cleared
   through the refueling block airspace with proper separation.
   15.5.5. MARSA ends between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises ATC the
   tanker and receiver aircraft are vertically positioned within the air refueling airspace and
   ATC advises MARSA is terminated.
15.6. Altitude Reservations. An ALTRV is authorization by a central altitude reservation
function (CARF, EUCARF, PACMARF, and CARU) or appropriate ARTCC/CERAP under
certain circumstances, for airspace utilization under prescribed conditions. Air refueling on
operational missions often utilizes an ALTRV under these conditions. ALTRVs may include all,
a portion, or portions of the intended route of flight. Request and approval format can be found
in FAA 7610.4.
   15.6.1. PICs will ensure ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. ALTRV
   status may be verified through the appropriate 618 TACC cell.
   15.6.2. Aircraft must depart within assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not
   Airborne) time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations.
   Normal AVANA will be 1 hour. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time,
   coordinate with the C2 authority as soon as possible. Rescheduling will normally be in 24-
   hour increments after the original schedule.
   15.6.3. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and areas specified in
   the approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or descend as specified.
   Controllers are not required to issue a climb or descent clearance for the various flight
   segments. They may, however, request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an
   altitude change.
   15.6.4. In a non-radar environment, aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be
   more than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
 180                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   15.6.5. File flight plans (1801 or DD175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP GP. Include
   ALTRV name in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or approvals do not
   eliminate the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file flight plans.
15.7. Receiver Pilot Responsibilities. Receiver Pilots are responsible for:
   15.7.1. Squawking normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.
   15.7.2. Maintaining two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the AR block altitude,
   established in that block, and cleared to the AR frequency by ATC.
   15.7.3. Pilots are reminded that oceanic clearances and an acknowledged readback are
   required for all flights within North Atlantic (NAT) controlled airspace. References for
   oceanic clearance procedures are FLIP Area Planning (AP)/2 and the NAT Minimum
   Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Manual.
       15.7.3.1. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and readback oceanic
       clearance. To the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own,
       individual clearance from the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they
       intend to operate, prior to entering oceanic airspace. Pilots will request oceanic clearance
       prior to oceanic entry point IAW procedures established in AP/2 and NAT MNPS
       Manual. Consider obtaining clearance and providing readback prior to rendezvous and
       air refueling.
       15.7.3.2. Tanker aircraft will not accomplish clearance readback for receiver aircraft.
       Receiver PICs are responsible for ensuring that oceanic clearance is always readback to
       the controlling authority by a member of their crew, and acknowledged by the oceanic
       controlling authority, prior to entering oceanic airspace.
   15.7.4. Opportune Air Refueling.
       15.7.4.1. PICs must receive permission from controlling authority (OG/CC, 618 TACC,
       etc.) prior to accomplishing opportune AR.
15.8. Tanker Pilot Responsibilities. Tanker Pilots are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the
   refueling track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for
   further use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be reoccupied without further ATC
   clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after
   rendezvous completion through completion of refueling operations (AR and MARSA have
   been terminated) except when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in
   an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility.                      All
   communications during refueling operations, including those concerning receivers, shall be
   between the ATC facility or military radar unit and tanker. To the extent practical, receivers
   shall establish communications with the tanker prior to or when departing the ARIP on the
   specified AR frequency. The tanker shall assume position reporting responsibility for the
   receivers upon rendezvous completion.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                      181


   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
       15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tanker at least 5 minutes prior to
       refueling completion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude
       reservation (ALTRV).
       15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military
       ground radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military
       radar facility shall forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay
       ATC clearances for the tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
       15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver
       aircraft intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. Tanker aircrews will not readback
       receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a receiver pilot responsibility.
   15.8.6. Vertically position aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point to facilitate the
   safe and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions
   of MARSA, to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of
   receivers and tankers shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.
   15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft‘s position at the completion
   of refueling operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the
   receiver‘s ATC clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
   15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper
   post air refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead
   tanker will confirm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with
   required lateral/vertical separation.
   15.8.9. Accomplishing Search and Rescue (SAR) procedures IAW AFI 11-207, Combat
   Aircraft Delivery. In an emergency, the flight leader immediately notifies the tanker
   commander. The tanker aircrew notifies ATC. In the event of a downed or ditched receiver,
   ATC notifies the Rescue Coordination Center, which in turn alerts the nearest SAR assets.
   The tanker provides cover as long as fuel reserves allow. Remaining receivers proceed
   unescorted to the nearest abort base or continue the mission with remaining tankers.
   15.8.10. Opportune Air Refueling.
       15.8.10.1. PICs must receive permission from controlling authority (OG/CC, 618 TACC,
       etc.) prior to accomplishing opportune AR with US receivers.
15.9. ATC Clearance. AR operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas
published in DOD FLIP. Operational considerations may require AR outside published areas or
within an ALTRV. The tanker PIC shall receive specific ATC clearance from the appropriate
ATC facility for the following:
   15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved
   ALTRV).
   15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
   15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to
   or beyond the exit point, or different from the flight plan routing.
 182                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


   15.9.4. Extending refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to adverse
   weather or winds, mission requirements, etc.
   15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e.,
   tobogganing).
NOTE:
 Protected airspace for AR tracks is defined in FAA order 7610.4M SPECIAL MILITARY
OPERATIONS               (or         current          version),         available           at:
http://www.FAA.gov/atpubs/mil/index.htm#order. If tankers need to exceed these bounds to
accomplish the rendezvous, they must request clearance from ATC prior to exiting the protected
orbit pattern airspace.
15.10. Emergency AR. When an emergency AR requirement arises, units tasked will attempt
to fill the requirement from available unit resources. Use unit training sorties as first priority and
generated alert sorties as second priority. If no capability exists, notify the controlling agency of
the requirement and unit shortfall. The following procedures apply for unit C2 personnel:
   15.10.1. Units will not routinely preposition additional aircraft to satisfy potential
   emergency AR requirements.
   15.10.2. Time permitting, coordinate emergency AR requirements with receiver parent
   MAJCOM.
   15.10.3. The unit command post should coordinate or direct unit actions.
   15.10.4. Identify unit sortie when notified of emergency air refueling requirement.
   15.10.5. Coordinate with OG/CC.
   15.10.6. Notify 618 TACC of requirement and proposed actions.
   15.10.7. Notify squadron or aircrew of requirement.             Provide ARCT, rendezvous
   information, altitude, receiver call sign, and communication plan.
   15.10.8. Advise receiver of planned actions.
   15.10.9. Notify the ARTCC liaison of requirement.
15.11. Air-to-Air Refueling with Foreign Aircraft. ATP-56(B) serves as the source document
for air refueling information among participating countries and is no longer limited to NATO
countries only.
   15.11.1. Tankers will only refuel those aircraft listed in ATP 56 (B) or specifically
   authorized by HQ AMC/A3V. Receiver aircraft not previously certified for refueling
   operations (includes foreign variants of US-produced aircraft) must be certified for technical
   and operational compatibility in accordance with USAF regulations prior to refueling.
   15.11.2. AR of foreign aircraft must be tasked by proper C2 authority. Opportune AR of
   foreign aircraft is prohibited.
15.12. Coronet East Mission Over Flights in France. Aircrews must explicitly follow pre-
coordinated mission profiles on missions that transit French airspace. Although ALTRVs are not
formally recognized in the French ATC system, pre-coordinated Coronet East Missions are
afforded a certain degree of additional protection while in French airspace. In exchange for this
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       183


special handling, it is absolutely essential aircrews adhere to pre-coordinated routes and altitudes
to avoid problems (including the portion of the flight to/from the ALTRV). Failure to do so
creates difficult diplomatic situations and jeopardizes future authorization for US Military over
flights of France. Aircrews will not request any maneuvers that have not been coordinated in
advance with French ATC. Examples of these maneuvers include formation split up and rejoin
(unless pre-coordinated). During the portion of the flight to/from the ALTRV, tanker and
receivers must remain in formation at a single altitude while in French airspace. If a request
(even if pre-coordinated) is denied by the controller, follow their instructions.

                                    MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter standardizes procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all
missions. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the mission materials. Unit
mission planning facilities should possess essential mission planning material.
   16.1.1. Mission planning is normally conducted the day before the mission. Operations
   group commanders may elect to use a "same day mission plan" option.
   16.1.2. Mission Commander. Chapter 2, Para 2.6, of this instruction specifies mission
   commander requirements and qualification criteria. AFTTP 3-1.KC10/KC-135 Volume 1
   contains a mission commander‘s checklist that is intended to assist mission commanders with
   their duties and responsibilities.
   16.1.3. Theater Indoctrination Folders (Part IV of FCIF) should provide additional
   information for aircrew and planning staff review. (Not applicable for ANG or AFRC)
16.2. Not Used.
16.3. Not Used.
16.4. Not Used.
16.5. Briefings.
   16.5.1. Pre-Deployment Briefing. Prior to deployments, the operations officer, mission
   commander, or designated representative should assemble the crew and brief description and
   purpose of the mission, tentative itinerary, aircraft configuration, special equipment, fuel
   load, clothing required, anticipated housing and messing facilities, sufficient money to defray
   individual‘s anticipated expenses, personal equipment/field equipment requirements, special
   clearance requirements, and flying safety.
   16.5.2. Other Briefings. In addition to the briefings above, mission participants will also
   conduct briefings as required in Paragraph 6.12 of this AFI.
16.6. Mission Debriefings. Hold immediately after the mission if practical.          Include the
following:
   16.6.1. Aircrews will attend the operations and maintenance debriefings as directed by unit
   or mission commander. Maintenance debrief should be conducted ASAP after flight.
   16.6.2. Intelligence debriefings will be accomplished as soon as practical after mission
   recovery, normally within 30 minutes.          Debriefings will be as prescribed in
   USTRANSCOMR 200-3, Intelligence Debriefing and Reporting.
   16.6.3. Aircrew Debrief. Mission critiques and debriefings are perhaps the most important
   learning tool available to aircrews and will be done after each mission. All crewmembers
   will attend. Use this time to review the entire mission.
   16.6.4. For formation flights, a post-mission debrief will be conducted by the mission
   commander or formation leader.

                                          Chapter 18

                                  AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. This chapter covers basic formation procedures and operations. All procedures
described apply to all KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft. The broad term "formation" as used does not
differentiate between specific tactics of en route formation or visual formation. Specific
references to each tactic must be made to ensure complete understanding.
   18.1.1. All formation flights will be planned, briefed, and critiqued in accordance with the
   applicable Technical Order, this chapter, ATP-56(B) and AFTTP 3-3.KC-135.
   18.1.2. These procedures are standardized with KC-10 formation operations.
18.2. Specified Times. The formation leader determines the sequence of events (SOEs) and
mission times based on mission requirements. Local SOEs for formation training missions may
be established for use at home station. Changes in briefing or mission timing will be relayed to
all formation members at the earliest opportunity.
18.3. Weather Minimums. Comply with weather minimums for takeoff and landing
established in AFI 11-202V3 and Chapter 6 of this instruction.
18.4. Ground Operations. The formation leader should accomplish radio checks and copy
ATC clearance in the chocks. All formation members should make every effort to accomplish
HAVE QUICK and SECURE VOICE radio operations on all local formation training missions.
All participating crews will accomplish as much of the pre-takeoff checklists as possible prior to
taxi. Lead will obtain taxi and takeoff clearance.
18.5. Communications and Radio Procedures. Radio and interphone discipline are critical
factors in maintaining formation integrity. The formation leader will ensure all formation
members have a complete understanding of the radio monitoring plan.
   18.5.1. Formation will not be flown on training sorties without inter-plane voice
   communications capability.
   18.5.2. When radio silent operations are required, the formation leader will pre-brief all
   formation members on specific procedures for frequency changes (i.e. timing, visual signals,
   etc.).
   18.5.3. Visual signals may be used as an alternate or secondary means of communication
   between aircraft.
   18.5.4. The flight lead will initiate all frequency changes. Lead will allow enough time for
   frequency change to be accomplished before initiating check-in. Lead must ensure all flight
   members are on frequency before initiating any action or making any radio calls to ARTCC,
   etc. If a flight member does not respond, a secondary radio or guard may be used to direct
   the wingman to the proper frequency. Specific procedures should be pre-briefed by the flight
   lead. Crews should maintain non-primary radios during silent operations; however, planned
   frequency changes may be performed on briefed timing or visual signals. All flight members
   must be on a common frequency.
18.6. Launch, Departure, and Level-Off.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                       187


  18.6.1. Formation Briefing. The formation leader will conduct a detailed briefing for all
  crewmembers covering the planned activities, procedures, techniques, specific EMCON
  procedures, and division of formation responsibilities. PICs may excuse crewmembers from
  the formation briefing to perform preflight duties, however the PIC will back brief all
  appropriate items. If lead changes are planned, each formation lead will brief their portion of
  the mission. The formation leader will ensure all crewmembers thoroughly understand their
  responsibilities, to include assumption of formation leadership.
     18.6.1.1. When deviations from the briefed mission are necessary, they will be directed
     by the leader. No actions will be taken until they have been coordinated with and are
     understood by all formation members.
     18.6.1.2. Non-collocated Units. If aircraft depart from separate bases and then
     rendezvous for formation activity, the formation lead should make every effort to conduct
     a telephone briefing with joining tanker and receiver formation leaders. If this is not
     possible, after detailed sortie study, the coordination and briefing between the appropriate
     lead planning agencies or mission commanders will satisfy formation briefing
     requirements. At a minimum, radio contact will be established between all formation
     aircraft NLT 15 minutes prior to join up. The formation lead will ensure altitude
     separation for aircraft in the formation or joining the formation. Coordination of these
     formations will include designation of mission commander responsibilities for all phases
     of the formation operation.
     18.6.1.3. Unit Responsibilities. Each unit will develop post takeoff separation
     procedures and departure separation plans with the local controlling agency. Each plan
     must consider emergency aspects, aircraft performance capabilities, terrain features,
     penetration of weather after takeoff, and local ATC restrictions. Procedures should also
     be developed for items such as aborts, lost communications, EMCON, and the recovery
     of formation aircraft.
  18.6.2. Filing Procedures. Flight plans for all formation members will reflect the same route
  of flight for the portion of flight the aircraft will be in formation. Local procedures for filing
  may be used provided they are coordinated and documented in writing by the unit and local
  FAA (or ICAO) representatives. Formation flights which do not consist of all RVSM aircraft
  will be considered non-RVSM compliant and will have 2,000 ft vertical separation standards
  applied in RVSM airspace.
  18.6.3. Taxi Procedures. Follow the taxi sequence established in the briefing. Maintain safe
  interval and a safe speed during taxi.
  18.6.4. Takeoff Timing Interval. Defined as the time between initiation of takeoff power for
  each successive aircraft in the formation. Use of takeoff power radio calls is not
  recommended. Minimum takeoff timing interval is 60 seconds between KC-135 and other
  non-KC-135 aircraft in the formation. Minimum timing interval between like-model KC-
  135s (and KC-135E following a KC-135R/T) is 30 seconds. Minimum timing interval for
  KC-135R/T following a KC-135E is 40 seconds. Takeoff interval may be extended and
  sequence may be varied as necessary depending on aircraft acceleration and performance,
  training requirements, weather, airfield conditions, and mission requirements.
188                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


  18.6.5. Formation Takeoff Procedure (Hold-Line through Takeoff). Receivers should
  takeoff first. Any time take off is aborted, an abort call will be made by the aborting aircraft
  over the ATC radio frequency being used by the formation. At bases with dual runway
  operations, aborting aircraft will identify the runway in use. An additional radio call
  announcing an abort is recommended over the formation interplane frequency.
  18.6.6. Departure. (N/A Fighter Buddy Departure) Climb speed below 10,000 feet MSL is
  250 KIAS, unless a higher speed is required to accommodate the minimum safe maneuvering
  speed of the heaviest aircraft in the formation (N/A USAFE). Planned climb speed will not
  be less than the heaviest aircraft‘s 3-Engine Climbout + 50kts. Above 10,000 feet MSL the
  normal planned climb speed is 285 KIAS. Above 10,000 feet MSL, for mixed KC-10/KC-
  135 cell formation departures, the normal planned departure speed is 285 KIAS (NOTE: this
  equates to 290 knots in the KC-10) for formations with KC-10s less than 500,000 pounds
  gross weight and 310 KIAS (NOTE: this equates to 310 knots in the KC-10) for formations
  with KC-10s equal to or greater than 500,000 pounds gross weight. Planned climb speeds
  apply to the lead aircraft only. Following aircraft may exceed/lag these speeds as necessary
  to accomplish the rejoin and maintain proper formation position. Climb speed schedules
  which result in KC-10s climbing with slats extended will be avoided. If visual, radar, A/A
  TACAN, TCAS, and radio contact are all lost, and altitude separation cannot be ensured, lost
  wingman and locally developed abort procedures will be accomplished.
  18.6.6. (459ARW) Under no circumstance will an aircrew accept a single assigned altitude
  for multiple formation aircraft from Potomac Departure or Washington ARTCC. Delay on
  the ground until an appropriate altitude block can be obtained. For formation departures,
  follow the procedures outlined in the current Letter of Agreement (LOA) with Potomac
  RAPCON.
      18.6.6.1. Formation Join-Up. Differential airspeed and/or visual cut-off in departure
      turns are the approved methods for formation join-up. The use of visual cut-off is
      restricted to day/VMC operations only and requires approval from ATC. Altitude
      separation will be carefully monitored during closure to en route spacing. Under other
      than VMC or when visual contact cannot be maintained with all formation members,
      altitude separation will be accomplished using TCAS or by periodically having each
      aircraft in the formation report its altitude or flight level. During night or instrument
      flight conditions, aircraft should turn at the same geographic points as the preceding
      aircraft.
      18.6.6.2. Buddy Departures (Tanker Snake/Formation Climb Procedures). Buddy
      departures may be used by collocated tanker and fighter or bomber units. The intent of
      this type of departure is to facilitate the join-up of receivers with their mated tankers.
      The procedures below are generalized and may require modification based on aircraft and
      airspace limitations.
         18.6.6.2.1. VMC Procedures. VMC procedures may be used when weather (ceiling
         and visibility) is 3000/5 or greater. Receivers will normally launch first and intercept
         an arc to place themselves on extended (approximately 10 NM) final to the departure
         runway. When the receiver calls 10 NM final, or the last receiver turns cross wind, or
         on predetermined timing, the tanker will launch. Continue with a straight ahead
         rejoin or according to briefed departure routing.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    189


           18.6.6.2.2. IMC Procedures. Under IMC or when weather is less than 3000/5, plan
           to rendezvous the formation at an orbit point along the route of flight. Tankers will
           normally launch first unless mission fuel load and performance considerations dictate
           otherwise. Receivers should be rejoined prior to rendezvous with the tankers.
   18.6.7. Level-Off. An altitude block will be obtained for all intermediate and final level-off
   altitudes. Block altitudes will provide a minimum of 500-foot separation between aircraft. If
   ARTCC will not approve a block altitude, then request IFR separation or hard IFR altitudes
   for each aircraft in formation. Stack down from lead during intermediate level-off altitudes.
   18.6.8. Airborne Aborts. Any aborting aircraft will clear the planned launch stream and take
   appropriate actions dictated by the reason for abort. Aborting aircraft will obtain ATC
   clearance prior to altering their route, or declare an emergency and deviate as necessary. The
   formation leader and other formation members should be ready to assist the aborting aircraft
   in any way possible.
18.7. En route Formation. En route formation consists of multiple tanker aircraft in trail,
stacked up at 500-foot intervals with 1 NM separation (2 NM may be used for contingency
operations). The primary means of maintaining proper formation position are TCAS under
instrument conditions and visual or TCAS under visual conditions. When visual conditions
permit, minimize radio transmissions. Heading and airspeed changes need not be announced. In
IMC, the formation leader should ensure all formation members are aware of heading and
airspeed changes, either through thorough pre-briefing, or use of inter-plane communications.
Aircrews will monitor the position of all other aircraft and, on inter-plane, notify any aircraft
excessively out of position.
   18.7.1. Turns. The formation leader should pre-brief specific bank angles for turns. This
   will help reduce inter-plane communications and aid in maintaining formation position. To
   maintain formation position during turns, all aircraft must initiate the turn over the same
   geographic point, unless executing a formation retrograde maneuver as described in AFTTP
   3-3.KC-135.
   18.7.2. Airspeed and Altitude. Formation climbs and descents will be accomplished using a
   constant airspeed and vertical velocity. The formation leader will ensure en route airspeed is
   compatible with the most restrictive aircraft in the formation.
   18.7.3. Autopilot Operations. The autopilot should be used to reduce fatigue and aid in
   altitude separation. Consideration should be given to placing an aircraft with an inoperative
   or malfunctioning autopilot in last position in the formation for missions with extended
   duration in formation.
   18.7.4. Visual Station-Keeping. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.KC-135 for visual station-keeping
   techniques. During operational situations requiring EMCON 3 or 4, and marginal visibility
   prohibits normal formation spacing, a compressed trail formation may be used. Formations
   may be compressed, but should not be less than 250 feet stacked up and 1/2NM spacing
   between aircraft.
   18.7.5. Formation Navigation Procedures. Cell lead is responsible for the navigation of the
   entire formation.
 190                                       AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       18.7.5.1. The primary responsibility of cell aircraft is station keeping. Cell aircraft, other
       than lead, should accomplish necessary navigation requirements to assume lead should
       the necessity arise.
   18.7.6. Navigation coordination between aircraft within the formation is encouraged unless
   operational (EMCON) restrictions or AR requirements limit communication. Do not
   jeopardize formation tactics or integrity for this purpose. However, if cell aircraft detect a
   known navigation error, inform lead immediately.
18.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. These procedures are to be used when visual, radar, TCAS,
or radio contact cannot be maintained and altitude separation cannot be ensured. In any lost
wingman situation, immediate separation of aircraft is essential to safety. Upon losing all
contact with the leader, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation, the wingman
will simultaneously execute the applicable lost wingman procedure while transitioning to
instruments. The bank angle used to achieve separation should equal the number of degrees to
be turned. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to minimize the effects of spatial
disorientation. Any aircraft, which can maintain contact with an aircraft executing a lost
wingman maneuver will remain in formation with that aircraft until otherwise directed by the
leader. When lead is notified of a lost wingman, lead will take appropriate action, as the
situation dictates, until positive separation is assured. Lead will establish a reference heading
and altitude after initial separation is assured. During recovery, if the flight has a block altitude
clearance, wingmen will establish appropriate altitude separation.
   18.8.1. Two Aircraft Flights:
       18.8.1.1. In wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition
       to instruments, inform lead, turn 15 degrees away and maintain new heading for 15
       seconds, then resume course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance if
       required.
       18.8.1.2. In turns (climbing, descending, or level):
           18.8.1.2.1. On the outside of the turn, transition to instruments, roll to wings level
           and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming
           turn. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as required.
           18.8.1.2.2. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to
           maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 10 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
           inform lead. Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed, and
           acknowledge wingman‘s call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call and
           confirms he or she has rolled wings level, the wingman will, after 15 seconds, roll
           wings level, establish 500 feet altitude separation, turn to lead‘s referenced heading
           and attempt to acquire lead on radar/TCAS. If loss of visual contact is not
           acknowledged by lead, maintain established bank angle, establish 500 feet altitude
           separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on radar/TCAS, and form
           into enroute formation position. If TCAS or radar contact cannot be re-established,
           obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency.
   18.8.2. Three Aircraft Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the
   procedures above would provide safe separation. However, as it is impossible for number
   three to immediately ascertain that number two still has visual contact with the leader, it is
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                     191


   imperative number three‘s initial action be based on the assumption number two has also
   become separated. If number two is still in visual, TCAS, or radar contact, he or she will
   maintain position. If number two goes lost wingman, he or she will follow the procedures
   outlined above. Number three will follow the procedures listed below:
       18.8.2.1. In wings level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously transition
       to instruments, inform lead, turn 30 degrees away, and maintain new heading for 30
       seconds, then resume course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearances as
       required.
       18.8.2.2. In turns (climbing, descending, level):
          18.8.2.2.1. In the outside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments, inform
          lead and reverse direction of turn for 15 seconds to ensure separation from lead and
          number two. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as required.
          18.8.2.2.2. In the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments to
          maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 20 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
          inform lead. Lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed and
          acknowledge the wingman‘s call. If lead has acknowledged the lost wingman call
          and confirms he or she has rolled wings level, number three will, after 30 seconds,
          roll wings level, establish 1000 feet altitude separation, turn to lead‘s referenced
          heading, and attempt to acquire lead and number two on TCAS and radar. If loss of
          visual contact is not acknowledged by lead, maintain established bank angle, establish
          1000 feet altitude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to acquire lead on
          TCAS and radar, and form into en route formation position. If TCAS or radar contact
          is not re-established, obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency.
   18.8.3. Lost Wingman Procedures during Receiver A/R. Depending on the makeup of the
   A/R formation, it is possible that in the event of a breakaway, receiver aircraft may find
   themselves co-altitude with another aircraft in the formation. If, during a breakaway, the
   receiver aircraft loses sight of the tanker aircraft, T.O. 1-1C-1-14 requires the receiver
   aircraft to descend to an altitude 1000 feet below the tanker. In the event this places the
   receiver aircraft co-altitude with another aircraft in the formation, immediately coordinate a
   de-conflicted altitude with tanker lead. If unable to immediately contact tanker lead and
   visual, A/A TACAN, TCAS, radar, or radio contact with the co-altitude aircraft cannot be
   maintained, descend to an altitude that will provide positive separation from other aircraft
   and decrease airspeed to ensure lateral separation..
18.9. Formation Position Changes. Follow the procedures described in AFTTP 3-3.KC-135,
chapter 5.
18.10. Formation Break-Up and Recovery. Formation separation procedures will be
thoroughly planned and briefed by the formation leader. Do not initiate formation separation
procedures without ATC approval.
   18.10.1. If formation descent and arrival is desired, detailed descent profile, airspeed
   reduction, and configuration procedures will be thoroughly briefed.
18.11. Mission Debriefing and Critique. A complete mission debriefing and critique should
be conducted by the formation leader following the mission.
 192                                    AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


18.12. Definitions.
   18.12.1. A standard formation is one in which a proximity of no more than 1-mile laterally
   or longitudinally and 100 feet vertically from the flight leader is maintained by each
   wingman.
   18.12.2. Nonstandard formations are those operating under any of the following conditions:
       18.12.2.1. When the flight leader has requested and ARTCC has approved other than
       standard formation dimensions.
       18.12.2.2. When operating within an authorized ALTRV or under the provisions of a
       letter of agreement.
       18.12.2.3. When operations are conducted in airspace specifically designed for special
       activity.
   18.12.3. Most formations are nonstandard and should be so indicated in the remarks section
   of the filed flight plan. Flight leaders are required to advise ARTCC on initial contact, and
   each sub-sequent controller or controlling agency, of separation being used. Advisories are
   not required when operating within an ALTRV or airspace specifically designed for
   formation flight activity.

                             AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

Section 20A—General Information

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force KC-135 Aircrews, aeromedical evacuation aircrew
   members (AECM) and all management levels concerned with aeromedical evacuation (AE)
   operations of KC-135 aircraft. All operators involved will use this chapter in conjunction
   with AFI 11-2AEV3, Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Operations Procedures for all KC-135
   AE missions.
   20.1.2. Use of KC-135 aircraft for AE transport of ill or injured DoD members and their
   dependents is authorized. C2 agencies may direct AE missions aboard KC-135s at any time.
   AECM will utilize procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AE and AFI 41-307,in conjunction with
   this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
   20.1.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM) between Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) crews
   and flight crews is paramount to the success of this challenging mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3)
   is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control (C2) of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. Aircraft Commander (AC) is the qualified pilot-in-command (PIC) responsible for
   command and control of all persons aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of
   flight safety, crew duty waivers, or operational considerations, their decisions are final. In
   matters of patient care, the medical crew director MCD decisions are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director (MCD). The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for
   the overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions.
   They advise the PIC on patient condition and the use of medical equipment that may affect
   aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well being of
   patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with the
   aeromedical evacuation operations officer (AEOO) and supporting agencies.
   20.2.5. HQ AMC Command Surgeon (AMC/SG) is responsible for providing clinical
   standards and procedures concerning the treatment of patients in-flight.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. Local AMC C2 will alert the PIC who will alert the MCD. The MCD will alert
   AECMs. The intent is to link the PIC, local AMC C2 and MCD before mission execution.
   Crew alerts will be 4+15 hours before scheduled takeoff time to allow 1 hour for reporting
   and 3+15 hours for mission preparation.
   20.3.2. When AECMs are staged separate from flight crews, the MCD will contact local
   AMC C2 and establish alert, show time, etc. MCDs will make every effort to brief other
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    195


   crewmembers on any mission irregularities prior to crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 to leave
   non-emergency messages.
   20.3.3. Local AMC C2 will provide PIC/MCD mission information when they check
   mission status. Local AMC C2 is the link between AECMs and the PIC, providing mission
   status updates to both parties.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There may be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the flight crew. The
   MCD will brief any changes to the PIC and local AMC C2 to de-conflict potential problems.
20.4. Pilot In Command Responsibilities.
20.4. (459ARW)Pilot In Command Responsibilities. AE trainers will be planned to afford
medical crew members the maximum possible platform time. If the AC determines that seat

   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions are not available on the aircraft
   20.9.3. For PSP management refer to Operations and AFI 11-2AE Volume 3, Aeromedical
   Evacuation (AE) Operations Procedures Addenda A.
       20.9.3.1. For planning purposes, use the following weights for empty PSPs:

PSP-W(2 litter tiers)                826 pounds
PSP-M(1 litter tier and 3 seats)     820 pounds
PSP-S(6 seats)                       814 pounds
RampExtender                         17 pounds
Ramp Spacer                          9 pounds


       20.9.3.2. Each litter position is rated to hold 320 lbs. Each seat is rated to hold 260 lbs.
       20.9.3.3. The maximum total PSP weight will not exceed 2000 pounds. This includes
       the weight of the PSP. If weight limit is exceeded, supplemental restraint is required.
       Exceeding 2000 pounds requires an additional applied restraint to meet a minimum 9 G
       forward restraint capacity. Use T.O. 1C-135-9 when applying supplemental restraint.
       20.9.3.4. When possible, configure PSP seats facing aft.
   20.9.4. The PSP will be transported to the aircraft by aerial port personnel, positioned and
   secured on the aircraft by the BO and configured by the AE crew.
       20.9.4.1. Exercise caution when maneuvering the pallet in and around the aircraft.
   20.9.5. AECMs will configure the pallet. Boom operators should open the aircraft 3 hours
   prior to take off to facilitate AECM aircraft configuration. Boom operators will coordinate
   with the MCD if the aircraft will not be open 3 hours prior to takeoff. Loading the PSP and
   airline seats should be accomplished before entering crew rest. In cases when the KC-135 is
   configured at an en route stop, the MCD will coordinate with the PIC and BO, to determine
   when the aircraft should be configured for the next day‘s mission. When possible, the
   aircraft should be configured the day prior to the mission. The MCD is responsible to ensure
   coordination between appropriate agencies has occurred or are in place to deliver PSPs to the
   aircraft.
   20.9.6. PSP configuration will be determined by patient requirements. Each seat has storage
   capacity for required pre-positioned life support (EPOS and life preserver unit).
   20.9.7. PSP ramps, extenders and spacers should be used with PSPs to mitigate hazards
   created by uneven surfaces. Spacers are designed to cover the gaps between the PSP‘s.
   20.9.8. Once secured in the roller system, secure PSPs with a cargo tie-down strap to the
   roller system rails to prevent forward-aft pallet movement during flight.
   20.9.9. Floor Loading. Litter patients may be floor loaded using standard cargo tiedown
   straps to secure the litter to the floor. Shoring is required to prevent damage to the aircraft
   floor.
 198                                      AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


       20.9.9.1. Do not place litters in front of exits or on top of landing gear inspection
       window covers (marked in red, yellow, or black).
       20.9.9.2. Maximum floor loaded litter capacity is eight patients.
          20.9.9.2.1. Maximum ambulatory capacity depends on aircraft configuration.
   20.9.10. Configure seats IAW AFI 11-2AEV3, Aeromedical Evacuation Operations
   Procedures, Addenda A. Aft facing stud mounted seats are the only approved seats for use
   on the KC-135.
       20.9.10.1. For AE-3 configurations install only four aft tandem seats (8-seats total) from
       Body Stations 860-920.
       20.9.10.2. Aircraft will depart home station with airline seats installed. Coordination is
       required when airline seats are located at the staging point. AECMs will ensure seats do
       not block emergency exits and will notify the BO if exits are blocked.
   20.9.11. Coordinate with the BO prior to securing excess AE equipment and in-flight kits.
       20.9.11.1. During preflight, the Charge Medical Technician (CMT) will provide the BO
       with equipment weights using AMC Checklist Insert Guide and provide weights per
       pallet.
   20.9.12. Pallet end stops protrude into egress paths. Remove forward and aft pallet end
   stops once PSPs are locked in place. The BO will reinstall pallet end stops prior to unlocking
   PSPs.
   20.9.13. Enplaning/Deplaning. Air stairs are the preferred method to enplane/deplane
   ambulatory patients. If litter patients are on board, use the High Deck Patient Loading
   Platform (HDPLP) or the Patient Loading System (PLS) to enplane/deplane all litter and
   ambulatory patients. Maximum PLS weight capacity is 1500 lbs. If the HDPLP or PLS is
   not available, request MHE support (Halverson Lift, Tunner, Hi-lift truck). Planning must
   take into consideration the limitation of MHE platforms, i.e., exposure to weather, loading
   time, loading considerations).
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
   20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
   utilization for passengers. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations will be
   identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of the
   number seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.3. For patient comfort and to permit inflight rest for patients use the following for
   missions over 4 hours in duration:
       20.10.3.1. Minimum of 2 litters must be available for ambulatory patients.
       20.10.3.2. One seat must be reserved for every 3 litter patients.
   20.10.4. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions.
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    199


   20.10.5. Portable Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
   and depositioning of Operational/contingency support AE Missions.
   20.10.6. A maximum of 25 PT LOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously
   without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. If shipping more
   then six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover the containers with plastic. This will
   prevent potential accumulation of high oxygen concentration levels. WARNING: Ensure the
   cargo floor is free from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.7. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue (CFR).
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per T.O. 00-25-172.
   Stand-by CFR vehicle is not necessary during normal operations however, a CFR vehicle
   will be available upon request. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle coverage
   may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
   20.11.3. Do not use MHE or PLS during ground evacuations as they may interfere with
   CFR.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance
   20.12.1. AIREVAC Priority. The PIC may request "AIREVAC priority" for preferential
   ATC handling if a delay will affect a patient‘s well being. PICs will request priority
   handling if AE missions are experiencing long delays during takeoff or landing phases,
   which will affect a patient‘s condition.
      20.12.1.1. The PIC needs to consider cabin temperature control during preflight, taxi,
      and flight when determining the need to request AIREVAC priority handling throughout
      all phases of the mission.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. At military bases, the flight crew will pass inbound load messages to the proper
   command and control personnel. At civilian airfields, notify ground control.
20.14. ERO Procedures. Not authorized.
20.15. Aerial Refueling (AR).
   20.15.1. Aerial refueling may be required when patients are on board. Unplanned aircraft
   attitudes can take place during AR, which can affect patient care. Prior to a planned AR, all
   patients should be screened by a validating flight surgeon to ensure they can tolerate AR.
   20.15.2. All personnel will be seated with seat belts fastened during AR. If urgent patient
   care is necessary, AECMs may stand to resolve the situation.
   20.15.3. Practice emergency separations are prohibited on AE missions while patients are
   on-board.
20.16. Aircraft Systems and Equipment.
200                                     AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011


  20.16.1. Electrical Power. Electrical power for 400Hz medical equipment is provided by an
  approved pigtail (P/N 8564034-135) located in the Electrical Cord Assembly Set (ECAS).
  Electrical power for 60 Hz medical equipment is provided by use of a modified Avionics
  Frequency Converter and Adaptive Electrical Pigtail (P/N 041238). Connect to KC-135
  110v, 400 Hz cannon plug receptacle (# 3 receptacle – KC-135E, galley outlet – KC-135R
  and T).
      20.16.1.1. Secure all ECAS connections with plastic tie-straps, including medical
      equipment plugs at the terminal end of the ECAS and AC electrical extension cord. To
      ensure stability of wires, secure the portion of the ECAS cord closest to the pigtail to a
      non-moving aircraft part.
         20.16.1.1.1. Plastic tie-straps should be 15 inches in length to adequately cover all
         circumferences.
      20.16.1.2. Use only "modified" Avionics Frequency Converters which are easily
      identified with a black on orange placard on the top of the unit with the statement:
      "Approved for Use in a Fuel Vapor Environment, Contract No. F41622-01-D-0001, DO
      5010."
      20.16.1.3. On KC-135R and T model aircraft, utilize the galley outlet receptacle. To
      supply power to AE equipment the aircraft galley oven power cord must be disconnected.
      The ECAS pigtail (P/N 8564034-135 or P/N 041238) is plugged into this same
      receptacle.
      20.16.1.4. On KC-135E model aircraft, an older P-22 Auxiliary Power Panel with 8
      receptacles is used. Ensure the ECAS pigtail is plugged into ONLY the #3 receptacle.
         20.16.1.4.1. All other receptacles Do Not provide power in flight and will result in
         equipment failure.
      20.16.1.5. Coordinate with BO to disconnect galley electrical power and pulling of
      circuit breaker before connecting the pigtail adaptor to the aircraft. Home station
      maintenance will lock out/tag all incompatible power receptacles and document in AF
      Form 781.
      20.16.1.6. Once the AECM has secured all electrical connections, coordinate with the
      BO to reset circuit breakers prior to powering on any medical equipment.
  20.16.2. Ensure equipment is turned-off before disconnecting any plugs from ECAS
  extension outlets in-flight.
  20.16.3. Emergency Oxygen for patients will be provided by Emergency Passenger Oxygen
  System (EPOS).
  20.16.4. Flight crews will ensure Life Support Equipment (LSE) is configured IAW AFI 11-
  302 V1, Table 7, Channel Mission.
  20.16.5. AE Crew Oxygen: MA-1 portable oxygen bottles will provide AECMs emergency
  oxygen. AECMs need not preflight personal oxygen equipment on a pressure demand
  regulator if they are assigned an MA-1 portable oxygen bottle.
  20.16.6. The aircraft should be configured at home station with 5 extra MA-1 portable walk
  around bottles with harnesses (if available). In the event MA-1 walk-around bottles are not
AFI11-2KC-135V3_459ARWSUP_I 23 March 2011                                                    201


   available and the preplanned flight level is below 350, AECMs will use EPOS as an
   emergency oxygen source.
   20.16.7. Latrine. The latrine capacity is limited. This should be taken into consideration for
   planning procedures. Aircraft will depart home station with an operable latrine and a
   minimum of two urine tubes and two latrine cartridges (see Table 6.3, Latrine Capacity vs.
   Personnel Loading chart). The CMT will verify the latrine is fully functional when
   uploading the PSP.
      20.16.7.1. AECMs should escort patients to the latrine. Same sex AECM will
      accompany mental health patients to the latrine to provide supervision.
