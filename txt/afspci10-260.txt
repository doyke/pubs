1. GENERAL POLICY:
   1.1. Tactics Development Program Overview. The AFSPC Tactics Development Program
   is designed to meet AFSPC’s responsibility to serve as the lead command in developing,
   documenting, and issuing Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for space and
   cyberspace weapons systems. This instruction provides guidance on each phase of the
   Tactics Development Process. The core of the Tactics Development Program is the
   documentation of validated best practices in Air Force TTP documents. In accordance with
   AFTTP Volume 3-1.GP, General Planning (GP) and Employment Considerations, the
   Tactics Development Program ―consists of four primary elements: tactic improvement
   proposals (TIP), tactics review boards (TRB), formal tactics development and evaluations
   (TD&E), and the dissemination of tactically significant information.‖ A healthy tactics
   program depends on continuous refinement and review of intelligence and inputs from
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   3


  operational units. AFSPC uses the Tactics Development Program to improve the combat
  capabilities of our weapon systems and how they integrate into the joint fight.
     1.1.1. Tactics Development Program goals.
         1.1.1.1. Improve overall military capability by instituting a responsive, standardized
         process to identify and address areas for improvement in AFSPC operations, systems,
         support, and command and control.
         1.1.1.2. Integrate tactics and intelligence considerations into daily operations and
         training.
         1.1.1.3. Rapidly validate and disseminate new tactics to correct deficiencies or
         pursue new/improved TTP.
         1.1.1.4. Persistently verify existing tactics against emerging threats and technologies.
         1.1.1.5. Invigorate the AFSPC tactics process, resulting in a robust program that not
         only improves organic weapon system effectiveness but leads to better integration
         with other MAJCOM tactics development processes.
         1.1.1.6. Facilitate the development of new TTP based on weapon system
         modifications to leverage new hardware, software, and operator capabilities.
     1.1.2. The focus of the AFSPC Tactics Development Program is to identify tactical
     deficiencies and to find, validate and document non-materiel solutions supporting both
     developmental and operational systems.
     1.1.3. Space Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) mission data (MD)
     updates associated with the space control mission area and equivalent cyberspace
     programs may require a separate development and validation approach/process outside of
     the Tactics Development Program described in this instruction (i.e., Quick Reaction
     Capability (QRC), etc.).
  1.2. The Tactics Development Program Is Not Intended For:
     1.2.1. Any modification of hardware, software and/or code requiring resources for a
     related acquisition activity. This process is covered in AFSPCI 63-104, Modifications to
     Systems and Implementation Approval Process.
     1.2.2. Changes to training programs. Weapons shops will ensure tactics training is
     matched to assigned missions.
     1.2.3. Changes to weapon system technical orders (TO), standard operating procedures
     (SOP), or checklists (C/L).
  1.3. Definitions.
     1.3.1. Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. Tactical doctrine used to employ a weapon
     system to produce a desired effect or to counter a threat posed by an adversary. TTP are
     authoritative but not directive.
         1.3.1.1. Tactics. ―The employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to
         each other.‖ Tactics define ―why‖ you employ your weapon system in a specific
         manner.
4                                                AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011


       1.3.1.1.1. Space tactic example. You might maneuver your satellite in response
       to an anti-satellite (ASAT) threat. The tactic is the evasive maneuver.
       1.3.1.1.2. Cyberspace tactic example. You might re-configure your network in
       response to a network intrusion threat. The tactic is the network protection re-
       configuration.
    1.3.1.2. Techniques. ―Non-prescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions,
    functions, or tasks.‖ Techniques define ―what‖ you do to implement a tactic. A tactic
    may be implemented or supported by one or more techniques.
       1.3.1.2.1. Space technique example. You may change either the inclination or
       the altitude of your satellite’s orbit to avoid the ASAT threat. These are two
       possible techniques to support the overarching tactic of evasive maneuver.
       1.3.1.2.2. Cyberspace technique example. Network defenders may employ
       layered defenses including filters, proxies, and/or sensors at multiple levels
       across a network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access to network
       resources and information. These are various techniques to support the
       overarching tactic of defense in depth.
    1.3.1.3. Procedures. ―Standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific
    tasks.‖ Procedures define the sequence of events that describe ―how‖ you implement
    the chosen technique(s). Procedures, as they relate to TTP, are not directive in nature
    but may be documented in detailed C/Ls, SOPs or TOs which are directive in nature.
       1.3.1.3.1. Space procedure example. Once you have chosen to change your
       altitude to avoid the ASAT threat, your procedures might include: calculating and
       coordinating the maneuver, executing the maneuver, and checking the status of
       health post-maneuver. Each of these may have a checklist, SOP, or TO that
       directs their implementation; however the overarching procedure is what is
       relevant to the TTP discussion.
       1.3.1.3.2. Cyberspace procedure example. Once you have chosen to employ
       filters across multiple levels to protect the network, your procedures might
       include coordinating the network re-configuration, re-configuring the network,
       and checking network status post re-configuration. Each of these may have a
       checklist, SOP, or TO that directs their implementation; however the overarching
       procedure is what is relevant to the TTP discussion.
    1.3.1.4. TTP Hierarchy and Relationship to C/Ls, SOPs and TOs: Operators may use
    more than one procedure to execute a technique, and also may use more than one
    technique to employ a tactic. C/Ls, SOPs and TOs, although not TTP, are often used
    to support the execution of procedures. They are produced by the system program
    office and standardization/evaluation organizations. See Figure 1. for a graphical
    representation of this concept.
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  5


Figure 1. TTP Hierarchy Overview.




      1.3.2. Tactic Improvement Proposal (TIP). A TIP is a comprehensive idea to improve
      the military capability of a fielded system, overcome a tactical deficiency or meet an
      emerging operational need. TIPs should not be used to request modification or
      acquisition of hardware or software, nor for requesting changes in training procedures.
      TIPs are non-materiel solutions which may require system testing. TIPs can be submitted
      by anyone, but are normally submitted by system subject matter experts (SME), via an
      Air Force Information Management Tool (AF Form 4326, Tactic Improvement
      Proposal).
      1.3.3. TTP Documents. TTP documents are the primary tactical doctrinal reference for
      the United States Air Force. AFSPC relies on current TTP to provide the foundational
      methodology for the employment of space and cyberspace forces addressing: (1) system
      specific capabilities and limitations, (2) mission planning considerations, and (3) mission
      specifics to deliver desired effects and/or mitigate threats to our systems.
         1.3.3.1. Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1/3-3 series
         volumes. AFTTP 3-1/3-3 series volumes are comprehensive tactical weapon system
         employment manuals. AFTTP 3-1/3-3 volumes describe specific TTP employed by
         the weapon system operator to deliver desired effects. These documents are typically
         reviewed every two years, or as deemed appropriate by the HQ AFSPC/A3. AFSPC
         AFTTP 3-1/3-3 series volumes are produced by a Model Manager (MM), typically a
         system SME at the operational unit. They are approved by the HQ AFSPC/A3, and
         published by the United States Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC) via the 561st
         Joint Tactics Squadron (JTS). Reference paragraph 2.6. for a detailed description of
         AFTTP 3-1/3-3 series volume coordination and documentation procedures.
         1.3.3.2. Tactics Bulletins. Tactics Bulletins (TB) act as official updates to AFTTP 3-
         1/3-3 series volumes between rewrites in an effort to ensure TTP remain current. TBs
         cannot alter guidance in existing AFTTP volumes, but can expound upon existing
         material or provide an avenue for dissemination of new TTPs. TBs are TTP that
         SMEs across CAF/MAF/Special Operations Forces (SOF)/Space/Cyberspace forces
6                                                       AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011


           deem worthy of AFTTP 3-1/3-3 credibility and longevity. They are analyzed, vetted,
           and validated in methods similar to AFTTP, including operational test, Weapons
           School missions, combat exercises, weapons validation programs, and actual combat
           employment. TBs are produced by weapon systems SMEs (ideally the 3-1/3-3 series
           volume MM), reviewed by the HQ AFSPC/A3, officially approved by the
           USAFWC/CC. TBs should be incorporated into future AFTTP 3-1/3-3 rewrites, as
           appropriate. Reference paragraph 2.6. for a detailed description of TB coordination
           and documentation procedures.
           1.3.3.3. Flash Bulletins. Flash bulletins (FB) are TTP or lessons learned that are time
           perishable and need to be passed to the warfighter immediately. They are produced
           by weapon system SMEs and are not coordinated above the SQ/CC level in order to
           facilitate rapid dissemination. They are ultimately approved and published by the 561
           JTS/CC. FBs can become TBs after more comprehensive vetting, and should be
           incorporated into future AFTTP 3-1/3-3 rewrites, as appropriate. Reference
           paragraph 2.6. for a detailed description of FB coordination and documentation
           procedures.
       1.3.4. Program Manager (PM). The PM is designated by the owning MAJCOM to
       oversee AFTTP volume production. Additional responsibilities include facilitating
       funding and manning, identifying and tasking Model Managers (MM), coordinating
       AFTTP conference scheduling with the 561 JTS, and performing draft AFTTP review.
       The HQ AFSPC PM is HQ AFSPC/A3TW.
       1.3.5. Volume Manager (VM). The VM is a member of the 561 JTS who is named as
       the POC for facilitating AFTTP 3-1/3-3 series volume writes/rewrites from preconference
       through publication.
       1.3.6. Model Manager. The MM is the lead SME who champions the TTP generation
       and production process and is responsible for the volume’s content. The MAJCOM with
       the majority of assets (volume owner) is required to provide the MM, and the PM will
       designate them in writing. Normally the MM is a Weapons School graduate at the group
       or wing level. If the MAJCOM has a SME assigned to the 561 JTS, then the assigned
       SME may act as MM for AFSPC volumes based on background and expertise.
       1.3.7. Operational system. A system that has been formally accepted for operations by
       the HQ AFSPC/A3 and has transitioned to an operational unit.
       1.3.8. Division Chief. For the purposes of this instruction, the use of the term Division
       Chief refers to a HQ AFSPC three-letter division chief who has planning, programming,
       budgeting and execution responsibility for an AFSPC weapon system. The Division
       Chief responsibilities outlined in this instruction do not apply to HQ AFSPC division
       chiefs who do not have oversight of a weapon system.
2. TACTICS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
    2.1. AFSPC Tactics Cycle. The AFSPC tactics cycle, shown in Figure 2., includes a
    development phase and an implementation phase. The cycle describes an iterative process in
    which new tactics are developed and existing tactics are reviewed to ensure relevancy and
    effectiveness. This AFSPCI is primarily focused on development phase of the tactics cycle.
    Attachment 3 details the processes involved from TIP submission through documentation.
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                         7

   2.2. TIP Submission. TIPs are submitted via AF Form 4326 to recommend TTP to
   overcome a tactical deficiency, improve military capability or respond to an emerging
   operational need. Reference Table 1. (not all inclusive) for a sample decision matrix of when
   a TIP should be submitted.
       2.2.1. TIPs may be submitted anytime.
       2.2.2. Anyone may submit a TIP. TIPs typically originate with individuals at
       units/squadrons, but may come from many other sources.
           2.2.2.1. The AF Form 4326 is available at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.
           Reference AFI 11-260 for instructions on completing the TIP form. Weapons and
           Tactics (W&T) shops at every level will work with individuals to ensure the AF Form
           4326 is completed correctly.
           2.2.2.2. Units should review historical TIP submissions, via internal records to
           determine whether the TIP was previously suggested.
           2.2.2.3. Individuals assigned to organizations outside AFSPC (i.e., AMC, USAFE,
           Army Space and Missile Defense Command, etc.) may submit TIPs applicable to
           AFSPC weapons systems directly to HQ AFSPC/A3TW.
               2.2.2.3.1. AFRC and ANG personnel operating an AFSPC-owned weapon
               system i.e., 19 SOPS, 8 SWS, 175 NWS, etc.) should submit TIPs through their
 8                                                         AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011


                applicable reserve or guard weapons and tactics shops.
                2.2.2.3.2. AFRC and ANG weapons and tactics shops will make every effort to
                coordinate TIP submissions for AFSPC-owned weapon systems with their
                counterpart active duty weapons and tactics shops.
            2.2.2.4. Individuals assigned at the wing level or below will submit TIPs to the
            appropriate unit W&T shop. Individuals assigned at Centers/NAFs will submit TIPs

     2.3. TIP Review. The purpose of this step is to refine the TIP through coordination with
     SMEs and levels of AFSPC leadership. Experience has shown that thorough TIP review is
     critical to ensure the Tactics Development Process proceeds in a timely and efficient manner.
        2.3.1. Upon receipt of a TIP, the unit W&T shop will review/refine it to ensure:
            2.3.1.1. The TIP is relevant and military utility is well defined.
            2.3.1.2. The TIP implementation criteria are well defined.
            2.3.1.3. The proposal includes a proposed development and/or validation method
            such as testing, modeling/simulation, experiment, exercise, or real-world operations
            with recommended objectives.
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 9


         2.3.1.4. The AF Form 4326 is completed correctly to include ensuring the ―Reviewed
         By‖ block contains an appropriate POC based on the level of review. Reference
         Table 2. for proper completion of ―Review By‖ Block on AF Form 4326
         2.3.1.5. TIPs of a similar nature are consolidated to the maximum extent possible.
         2.3.1.6. The TIP is not already incorporated in other guidance. Ensure other TTP
         sources (AFTTP volumes, Flash Bulletins, Intellipedia databases) and any TIPs
         already in development are considered.

      2.3.2. After initial review, W&T shops will submit the TIP to their first level of
      leadership for review.
         2.3.2.1. Following concurrence, W&T shops will contact HQ AFSPC/A3TW and
         provide an unclassified TIP title for assignment of a MAJCOM Control Number. HQ
         AFSPC/A3TW         may      be      contacted     via   NIPR  workflow     inbox
         (a3tw.wf@peterson.af.mil) or at DSN 692-5341 or 692-3726.
            2.3.2.1.1. If the TIP author, in coordination with first-level leadership, believes
            the TIP requires immediate attention, an Out-of-Cycle TRB may be requested as
            described in paragraph 2.7.
            2.3.2.1.2. If an Out-of-Cycle TRB is not required, units may accomplish steps in
            paragraphs 2.3.3. through 2.3.4. at their discretion in order to meet annual AFSPC
            TRB timelines.
         2.3.2.2. HQ AFSPC/A3TW will assign TIPs a MAJCOM Control Number consistent
         with AFI 11-260. The MAJCOM Control Number is a method to facilitate awareness
         and tracking of the TIP.
            2.3.2.2.1. Assignment of a MAJCOM Control Number does not represent TIP
            approval.
            2.3.2.2.2. Once assigned a MAJCOM Control Number, only the TIP author or the
            HQ AFSPC/A3 may remove the TIP from consideration. TIP authors may
            remove TIPs from consideration with a memo or email to HQ AFSPC/A3TW
            explaining the reason for withdrawal (i.e., not feasible, incorporated into other
            guidance, etc.). Memos requesting withdrawal may be transmitted to the HQ
            AFSPC/A3TW NIPR workflow e-mail.

         2.3.2.3. Upon receipt of a MAJCOM control number, W&T shops will submit the
         TIP to their next echelon W&T shop. The process outlined in paragraph 2.2.3. will
         continue up-echelon until the TIP reaches a NAF/Center W&T shop.
     2.3.3. Upon receipt of a TIP, next-echelon W&T shops will:
         2.3.3.1. Review the TIP and provide supporting details assessing military utility and
         feasibility of the TIP in their respective section of the AF Form 4326.
         2.3.3.2. Ensure the TIP is neither incorporated into current TTP sources or in the
         tactics development process as another TIP. TIPs already incorporated into guidance
         or in development will have that information annotated on the AF Form 4326.
         2.3.3.3. If the TIP is unsuitable for any reason, annotate the AF Form 4326
         appropriately. The TIP will continue in the process with the non-concurrence noted.
         The TIP may be returned to the submitter for revision if desired.
     2.3.4. Upon receipt of a TIP, NAF/Center W&T shops, or designated representatives,
     will:
         2.3.4.1. Coordinate on the TIP and document recommendations in the appropriate
         ―Reviewed By’ block on the AF Form 4326. The TIP may be returned to the
         submitter for revision if desired.
         2.3.4.2. Forward TIPs and any supporting documentation to HQ AFSPC/A3TW no
         later than 30 days prior to the AFSPC TRB. Reference paragraph 2.7. for out-of-
         cycle timelines.
            2.3.4.2.1. Submit unclassified TIPs via HQ AFSPC/A3TW workflow e-mail.
            2.3.4.2.2. Contact HQ AFSPC/A3TW at DSN 692-5341, 692-3726, or at the HQ
            AFSPC/A3TW NIPR workflow e-mail for instructions on TIP submissions
            classified higher than UNCLASSIFIED. The TIP will be submitted to HQ
            AFSPC/A3TW at the appropriate classification level. HQ AFSPC/A3TW can
            process TIPs up to the TS/SCI//SAP/SAR level with appropriate coordination.
     2.3.5. Upon receipt of a TIP, HQ AFSPC/A3TW will:
         2.3.5.1. Coordinate TIPs with appropriate HQ AFSPC Division Chiefs.
         2.3.5.2. Prepare the TIP and associated supporting documentation for the AFSPC
         Tactics Review Board (TRB).
  2.4. Tactics Review Board.
     2.4.1. HQ AFSPC/A3TW hosts the annual AFSPC TRB on behalf of the HQ
     AFSPC/A3. The AFSPC TRB is a meeting of SMEs representing space and cyberspace
     mission areas.
         2.4.1.1. The HQ AFSPC/A3, or their designated representative, will chair the TRB.
         The annual AFSPC TRB affords senior leadership an opportunity to decide how and
         if to dedicate resources toward the development, validation, approval, and
         implementation of a TIP.
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                            11


        2.4.1.2. The AFSPC TRB also provides an opportunity to review the results of
        previously held subordinate unit TRBs. Additionally, interaction among TRB
        participants allows for an exchange of ideas across AFSPC mission areas, yielding
        additional opportunities to improve current and future operations through tactics
        development.
     2.4.2. The annual AFSPC TRB is normally held in October to allow HQ AFSPC/A3TW
     time to properly evaluate and introduce AFSPC TIPs to the CAF TRB, as required.
        2.4.2.1. Squadrons, Groups, Wings/Centers and NAFs will hold their respective
        TRBs early enough to allow time to prepare TIP submissions for the AFSPC TRB.
        2.4.2.2. AFSPC TRB attendance is unit funded.
        2.4.2.3. AFSPC TRB is by invitation only. AFSPC/A3T will send invitations on
        behalf of the AFSPC/A3. The following exceptions apply:
            2.4.2.3.1. A representative from each AFSPC W&T entity is expected to attend.
            Additionally, each TIP author, or a designated weapon system SME, is expected
            to attend the TRB and present the TIP.
            2.4.2.3.2. Standing invitations exist for other organizations including, but not
            limited to, representatives of the 561 JTS, 547 IS, SIDC, 688 IOW, 328 Weapons
            Squadron (WPS), Headquarters U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense
            Command/Army Strategic Command Space Forces-Standards and Evaluations
            Section (USASMDC/ARSTRAT/G3 SF-SES), ACC/A3, U.S. Cyber Command
            and other service liaison officers assigned to AFSPC and ANG/AFRC W&T
            representatives.
     2.4.3. TRB Working Groups. HQ AFSPC/A3TW will select chairs for each working
     group based on subject matter expertise and availability and will provide a TRB
     Handbook detailing chair roles and responsibilities.
        2.4.3.1. Working groups will evaluate each TIP based on weighted criteria
        established by HQ AFSPC/A3TW prior to the TRB. These criteria, and/or the
        weighting assigned, may change based on operational need and the focus of HQ
        AFSPC leadership over the given period. Reference Attachment 2 for an example of
        TIP prioritization criteria.
     2.4.4. TIP Evaluation Consideration
        2.4.4.1. The primary determining factor for every TIP is military utility. Secondary
        considerations include ability to develop and/or validate and sustainability.
        2.4.4.2. At a minimum the TRB must answer the following critical questions
        regarding the TIP:
            2.4.4.2.1. Does the TIP have military utility?
            2.4.4.2.2. Does the TIP expand delivery capabilities for the Joint Fight?
            2.4.4.2.3. What is the confidence level that the TIP is technically and
            operationally feasible?
            2.4.4.2.4. Do systems and personnel factors support implementation of the TIP?
12                                                   AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011


            2.4.4.2.5. Can the TIP be supported through the weapon system’s life cycle?
     2.4.5. TIP Disposition Options. Criteria are provided below to aid in determining TIP
     disposition; however, warfighter need must always be considered when making a TIP
     disposition recommendation. The following options are available as TIP disposition
     recommendations to the HQ AFSPC/A3:
        2.4.5.1. TIP is approved and ready to deploy.
            2.4.5.1.1. In order to be approved and ready to deploy the TIP should not require
            further development or validation. The TIP has already been proven effective and
            the operational unit is currently capable of executing the new TTP. The only
            remaining requirement is to document the TTP, either via an update to the AFTTP
            3-1/3-3 volume, a TB or a FB.
        2.4.5.2. TIP is approved but requires further development and/or validation.
            2.4.5.2.1. This category includes TIPs that are approved, but not ready for
            immediate implementation. They may require further development, and will
            always require validation. There are three development/validation mechanisms
            that may be recommended in support of this option:
               2.4.5.2.1.1. TIP development and/or validation via exercises, demonstrations,
               or other venues.
                 2.4.5.2.1.1.1. Exercises, demonstrations and other venues provide
                 opportunities to leverage resources in support of tactics development. This
                 option can provide a cost-effective, responsive method of developing and/or
                 validating a TIP by leveraging systems, personnel and scenarios that are
                 already being utilized to accomplish other objectives.
                 2.4.5.2.1.1.2. TIPs developed/validated via this mechanism require zero to
                 low development effort.
               2.4.5.2.1.2. TIP development and validation via a Tactics Development
               Initiative (TDI).
                 2.4.5.2.1.2.1. TDIs are tactics development and validation efforts executed
                 by the 688th Information Operations Wing (IOW) and Space Innovation and
                 Development Center (SIDC) using organic resources. TDIs provide a
                 flexible capability to remain responsive to rapid changes in current and
                 emerging weapon system tactics. They provide a higher level of fidelity
                 than that achieved via exercises/demos, but less than that achieved via
                 formal testing. They may be developed and executed by SMEs, engineers,
                 and testers using a test-like approach, however, TDIs are not considered
                 formal testing as defined in AFSPCI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and
                 Evaluation of Space and Cyberspace Systems.
                 2.4.5.2.1.2.2. TDIs can only be executed in support of mission areas or
                 systems for whom the SIDC or 688 IOW has an organic tactics development
                 and validation capability.
                 2.4.5.2.1.2.3. TIPs developed/validated via this mechanism require low to
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                              13


                 medium development effort.
                2.4.5.2.1.3. TIP development and/or validation via Tactics Development &
                Evaluation (TD&E).
                 2.4.5.2.1.3.1. According to AFI 99-103, TD&Es are a tailored type of Force
                 Development Evaluation (FDE) conducted by MAJCOMs to refine doctrine,
                 system capabilities, and TTP throughout a system’s life cycle. TD&Es
                 normally identify non-materiel solutions to problems or evaluate better ways
                 to use new or existing systems.
                 2.4.5.2.1.3.2. TIPs developed and validated via this mechanism require
                 medium to high development effort and will be executed within AFSPC via
                 AFSPC Test Priority List tasking.
        2.4.5.3. TIPs will be forwarded to Combat Air Forces (CAF) TRB.
            2.4.5.3.1. TIPs requiring CAF TRB review will be forwarded by HQ
            AFSPC/A3TW to the CAF TRB via ACC/A3TW. The TIP author will be
            notified when a TIP is forwarded to the CAF TRB. Key questions for the AFSPC
            TRB to consider when determining whether a TIP should be submitted to the
            CAF TRB are:
                2.4.5.3.1.1. Does the TIP directly impact operations of air platforms, C2
                operations, information operations (excluding network operations), or joint
                systems?
                2.4.5.3.1.2. Does the TIP require coordinated testing using air platforms, C2
                operations, information operations (excluding network operations), or joint
                systems?
            2.4.5.3.2. The TIP author should attend the CAF TRB and present the TIP as the
            weapon system SME.
            2.4.5.3.3. If the TIP is denied at the CAF TRB or forwarded back to HQ AFSPC
            for action,        HQ AFSPC/A3TW will provide a recommendation to the HQ
            AFSPC/A3 for final disposition.
        2.4.5.4. TIP is denied. Grounds for denial include:
            2.4.5.4.1. There is no military utility.
            2.4.5.4.2. It is not operationally or technically feasible.
            2.4.5.4.3. TIP cannot be validated via testing, modeling/simulation, or other
            method.
            2.4.5.4.4. Criteria for TIP implementation are poorly defined.
            2.4.5.4.5. TIP requires a materiel solution to implement.
     2.4.6. In order to determine which disposition option to recommend for a TIP, working
     group chairs should consider TIP readiness level. Estimating the readiness level includes
     determining the TIP Operational Risk Management (ORM) score and the time required to
     develop and/or validate the TIP.
14                                                   AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011


         2.4.6.1. Working Group chairs will utilize the ORM Chart (MIL-STD 882) to
         determine the risk level of the TIP.
         2.4.6.2. Working Group chairs will rely on input from development/test SMEs in
         their working group to estimate the time required to develop/validate the TIP.
         Development/validation timelines may be placed into the following three categories:
         Short-term (90 days or less), Medium-term (91 days to 1 year), or Long-term (longer
         than 1 year).
     2.4.7. The HQ AFSPC/A3, or his designated representative, will receive the TRB
     outbrief and approve final disposition of all TIPs.
     2.4.8. HQ AFSPC/A3TW will maintain all TIPs, regardless of TRB-determined status, to
     provide documented feedback and serve as a reference source for future proposals.
     2.4.9. HQ AFSPC/A3T will disseminate TIP dispositions to the affected units via HQ
     AFSPC TRB minutes prepared by HQ AFSPC/A3TW.
         2.4.9.1. If requested, HQ AFSPC/A3TW will return HQ AFSPC TRB disapproved
         TIPs to the submitting unit along with disapproval rationale. After receipt of the
         disapproval disposition, an individual or unit may modify and resubmit the proposal
         as a new TIP on a new AF Form 4326.
  2.5. Tasking and Planning. The purpose of this step is to task appropriate organizations to
  plan and allocate resources for TIP development/validation (dev/val) efforts. Each TIP
  dev/val mechanism has unique tasking and planning requirements. Tasking and planning is
  primarily the responsibility of HQ AFSPC with support from subordinate and external
  organizations.
     2.5.1. Tasking/Planning requirements for dev/val via exercises, demonstrations, and
     other venues.
         2.5.1.1. An Integrated Validation Team (IVT) is responsible for the tasking and
         planning requirements for TIPs in this category.
         2.5.1.2. The Division Chief will assume the role of IVT Chair and will nominate a
         SME to lead the IVT.
         2.5.1.3. The IVT lead will nominate and request appropriate SMEs to compose the
         IVT.
         2.5.1.4. The IVT will develop a validation plan and gain approval from the IVT
         Chair.
         2.5.1.5. The IVT will designate a venue in which to accomplish the dev/val and will
         coordinate inclusion of the dev/val activities into that event.
         2.5.1.6. If the IVT requires assistance from organizations outside HQ AFSPC,
         request support through HQ AFSPC/A3TW.
     2.5.2. Tasking/Planning requirements for dev/val via TDI.
         2.5.2.1. HQ AFSPC/A3TW maintains separate MAJCOM tracking databases of
         prioritized TDIs for both the 688 IOW and the SIDC. Following each TRB, HQ
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 15


         AFSPC/A3TW will integrate the newly approved TDIs into each HQ AFSPC TDI
         database and reprioritize as necessary.
         2.5.2.2. HQ AFSPC/A3T will task the 688 IOW and/or the SIDC to accomplish TDIs
         following each TRB based on the reprioritized list.
         2.5.2.3. 688 IOW and SIDC will provide HQ AFSPC/A3T feedback on ability to
         accomplish TDIs within 30 days of receipt of the tasking. This feedback will include
         a planned execution schedule and identify any resource shortfalls.
         2.5.2.4. If the 688 IOW or SIDC requires assistance from organizations outside HQ
         AFSPC, they may request support through HQ AFSPC/A3TW. If direct coordination
         occurs with outside support organizations, HQ AFSPC/A3TW will be included on all
         coordination.
     2.5.3. Tasking/Planning requirements for dev/val via TD&E.
         2.5.3.1. HQ AFSPC/A3TW will provide a draft Test Asset Support Request (TASR)
         to the appropriate Division Chief within HQ AFSPC for them to submit to HQ
         AFSPC/A3TO in accordance with AFSPCI 99-103.
         2.5.3.2. HQ AFSPC/A3T will coordinate with the SIDC, 688 IOW and/or USAFWC
         to determine ability to execute, the test cost rough order of magnitude (ROM) and
         identification of any new, specialized test equipment or services needed to conduct
         testing.
         2.5.3.3. Division Chiefs will coordinate with HQ AFSPC/A3T to ensure TD&E
         inclusion on the HQ AFSPC Test Priority List (TPL). The TPL is published annually
         and includes all HQ AFSPC test priorities, including TD&Es.
         2.5.3.4. AFSPC/A3TO will coordinate required TD&E test support, as necessary,
         with other MAJCOMs or agencies. Once tasked through the AFSPC TPL process, if
         the TDE requires additional support from other MAJCOMs/agencies, AFSPC/A3TO
         will facilitate additional test support requirements between the AFSPC operational
         test organization and the applicable MAJCOM/agency.
  2.6. Development and Validation. The purpose of this step is to develop approved TIPs
  into actionable TTP and to validate the developed TTP to ensure it accomplishes the desired
  effect. The results of the validation will be documented in a written report. Development
  may occur prior to and concurrently with validation efforts. Facilitating TIP dev/val via
  TD&E or TDI is primarily the responsibility of the 688 IOW and the SIDC with support from
  external organizations. Facilitating TIP dev/val via IVT is primarily the responsibility of the
  applicable HQ AFSPC Division Chief with support from external organizations.
     2.6.1. Dev/val is an iterative process to derive the optimal TTP solution.
         2.6.1.1. TTP development involves translation of the TIP into actionable procedures
         that will be validated. During validation, the procedures can be modified and
         revalidated in order to perfect the TTP.
     2.6.2. If not already accomplished, specific actions for each dev/val mechanism include:
         2.6.2.1. Dev/val via exercises, demonstrations, or other venues
16                                                   AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011


            2.6.2.1.1. Dev/val activities will be executed by the IVT in accordance with
            approved validation plan.
            2.6.2.1.2. Results will be presented for approval to the applicable Division Chief
            in the form of an IVT report.
            2.6.2.1.3. Upon approval, a copy of the IVT report will be forwarded to HQ
            AFSPC/A3TW.
            2.6.2.1.4. Upon receipt of an approved IVT report that confirms the viability of
            the tactic, the AFTTP 3-1/3-3 volume MM, or designated SME, for the applicable
            weapon system will immediately utilize the report to document the TTP as
            described in paragraph 2.6.
         2.6.2.2. Dev/val via TDI.
            2.6.2.2.1. TDI dev/val activities will be executed by the 688 IOW and/or SIDC in
            accordance with local guidance and procedures.
            2.6.2.2.2. TDI results will be presented to the 688 IOW/CC or SIDC/CC (unless
            delegated) for approval in the form of a TDI report.
            2.6.2.2.3. Upon approval, a copy of the TDI report will be forwarded to HQ
            AFSPC/A3TW.
            2.6.2.2.4. Upon receipt of an approved TDI report that confirms the viability of
            the tactic, the AFTTP 3-1/3-3 volume MM, or designated SME, for the applicable
            weapon system will immediately utilize the report to document the TTP as
            described in paragraph 2.6.
         2.6.2.3. Dev/val via TD&E.
            2.6.2.3.1. TD&Es will be executed in accordance with AFSPCI 99-103.
            2.6.2.3.2. TD&E results will be presented for approval per AFSPCI 99-103.
            2.6.2.3.3. Upon approval, a copy of the TD&E report will be forwarded to HQ
            AFSPC/A3TW.
            2.6.2.3.4. Upon receipt of an approved TD&E report that confirms the viability of
            the tactic, the AFTTP 3-1/3-3 volume MM, or designated SME, for the applicable
            weapon system will immediately utilize the report to document the TTP as
            described in paragraph 2.6.
     2.6.3. If dev/val activities reveal a proposed TTP as deficient, the lead dev/val agency
     will provide HQ AFSPC/A3TW a recommendation to modify and continue efforts or
     cease further dev/val activities.
  2.7. Documentation. AFTTP 3-1/3-3 series volumes and TBs are official TTP documents.
  AFTTP volumes are approved by the HQ AFSPC/A3 and published by the USAFWC, via
  the 561st JTS. TBs are reviewed by the HQ AFSPC/A3, approved by the USAFWC/CC and
  published by the 561 JTS. FBs are informal TTP and are approved and published by the 561
  JTS/CC.     Documenting TTP is accomplished via three main steps:            Generation,
  Coordination, and Production. TTP documentation will be consistent with criteria
  established by the USAFWC/CC and executed through the 561 JTS. For guidance on
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                            17

         2.8.2.1. TIP submission. TIP submission follows the normal Tactics Development
         Process, but will be processed on an accelerated timeline. HQ AFSPC/A3TW will
         assign a MAJCOM Control Number within one business day of TIP submission.
         2.8.2.2. TIP review. Upon creation of the TIP the wing W&T shop will ensure
         squadron, group, wing, and NAF input within three (3) business days and transmit the
         TIP to HQ AFSPC/A3TW.
         2.8.2.3. TRB. HQ AFSPC/A3TW will schedule and facilitate an out-of-cycle TRB
         with the HQ AFSPC/A3 or designated representative within five (5) business days of
         receipt. HQ AFSPC/A3T, on behalf of HQ AFSPC/A3, will invite select wing,
         Center, and/or NAF representatives. TRB minutes will be transmitted within one (1)
         business day of TIP approval.
         2.8.2.4. Tasking and Planning. Tasking and Planning will occur per established
         processes but on an accelerated timeline based upon TIP level of urgency.
         2.8.2.5. Development and Validation. Development and Validation will occur per
         established processes but on an accelerated timeline based upon TIP level of urgency.
         2.8.2.6. Documentation. Documentation of the TTP will occur per established
         processes but on an accelerated timeline based upon TIP level of urgency.
3. IMPLEMENTATION.
  3.1. In an effort to expedite the operational availability of valid TTP, pending formal TTP
  document (AFTTP, TB, or FB) approval, unit commanders are authorized to employ new
  TTP following:
     3.1.1. HQ AFSPC/A3 approval of a TIP as ready to deploy at the AFSPC TRB.
     3.1.2. Approval of a dev/val report that confirms TTP viability. Approving authorities
     for reports resulting from each dev/val mechanism are listed in paragraph 2.5.2.
  3.2. Units will formalize operational checklists developed during TTP dev/val and
  incorporate, upon TTP document (AFTTP, TB, or FB) approval, the TTP and associated
  procedures into training and evaluations.
     3.2.1. If unit instructor/evaluator training is required, the operational unit will have 120
     days from time of TTP document approval to train unit instructors/evaluators, with
     support from the dev/val organization.
     3.2.2. Once unit instructor/evaluator training on the new TTP is complete (or if no
     training is required), units will have 90 days to develop the capability to train and
     evaluate the TTP. Local leadership will determine if and when the TTP is actually trained
     and evaluated based on current unit mission statement.
  3.3. A formal reply from the OG/CC to HQ AFSPC/A3T is required once the unit is capable
  of training and evaluating the TTP.
  3.4. Units should review all weapon system TTP to ensure continued relevance and
  effectiveness on a recurring basis as determined by the unit commander. If a TTP is
  determined to no longer be relevant it will be removed during the ensuing AFTTP 3-1
  volume rewrite.
AFSPCI10-260 29 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    21


4. DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS. TTP development should start as early as possible in
system acquisition cycles. Developmental systems should have a basic set of TTP identified on
how the system should be employed.           TTP development should be incorporated in
Developmental Testing and Operational Testing as much as possible by units/agencies
responsible for test and evaluation. Baseline TTP need not reach the level of fidelity in an
AFTTP 3-1/3-3 volume, nor do they need to be coordinated and approved via the formal AFTTP
process.
   4.1. HQ AFSPC enabling and operating concepts give operational context to desired
   capabilities and provide source documentation for development of operational tactics.
   4.2. The HQ AFSPC/A5 will identify the organization(s) or team responsible for baseline
   TTP development when the Program Management Directive (PMD) is issued or upon
   acquisition strategy approval (for programs with no PMD).
   4.3. HQ AFSPC/A5 will notify HQ AFSPC/A3 of the creation of Integrated Concept Teams
   and Integrated Test Teams so that appropriate tactics personnel can interface with those
   teams to ensure baseline TTP are developed and tested appropriately.
   4.4. Operational units should support the development of baseline TTP for systems in

Terms
Force Development Evaluation (FDE)— A type of OT&E performed by MAJCOM
operational test organizations in support of MAJCOM-managed system acquisition-related
decisions prior to initial fielding, or for MAJCOM sustainment or upgrade activities.
Integrated Validation Team (IVT)— The IVT is responsible for cradle to grave planning,
execution, and documentation of TIP development and validation activities. The team leverages
personnel and disciplines from organizations within AFSPC. Specific team construct is driven
by the nature and complexity of the TIP being developed and validated, as well as the selected
venue. The team supports the AFSPC Tactics Development Program by leveraging exercises,
demonstrations and other venues to develop and validate space and cyberspace TIPs as
determined by the AFSPC/A3 following the annual AFSPC TRB.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)— The field test, under realistic combat conditions,
of any item of (or key component of) weapons, equipment, or munitions for the purpose of
determining the effectiveness and suitability of the weapons, equipment, or munitions for use in
combat by typical military users; and the evaluation of the results of such test. (Title 10
§139(a)(2)) 2. Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic an operational environment as
possible to estimate the prospective system's operational effectiveness, suitability, and
operational capabilities. In addition, OT&E provides information on organization, personnel
requirements, doctrine, and tactics. It may also provide data to support or verify material in
operating instructions, publications, and handbooks. Note: The generic term OT&E is often
substituted for IOT&E, QOT&E, FOT&E or FDE, and depending on the context, can have the
same meaning as those terms.
Tactics Development and Evaluation (TD&E). TD&E is a tailored type of FDE specifically
designed to further exploit doctrine, system capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures
during the sustainment portion of the system life cycle. TD&Es normally identify non—
materiel solutions to tactical problems or evaluate better ways to use new or existing systems.
Tactics Development Initiative (TDI)— TDIs are tactics development and validation efforts
executed by the 688 IOW and SIDC using organic resources. TDIs provide a flexible capability
to remain responsive to rapid changes in current and emerging weapon system tactics. They
provide a higher level of fidelity than that achieved via exercises/demos, but less than that
achieved via formal testing. They may be developed and executed by SMEs, engineers, and
testers using a test-like approach, however are not considered formal testing as defined in
AFSPCI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation of Space and Cyberspace Systems.

                      TIP PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA EXAMPLE

A2.1. The primary consideration when evaluating TIPs is military utility. Secondary
considerations could include protection, enhanced delivery of capabilities, TIP validity and
feasibility, and TIP implementation criteria and sustainability. Working groups will evaluate
each TIP based on established sub-criteria. Working groups assign a numeric score within the
assigned range for each question. If the criteria is not relevant to the TIP in the least, the TIP
scores a zero. Higher scores reflect greater relevance. Once a numeric value is assigned to each
individual question, working groups will total all values to generate an overall value for each
TIP. This value will serve as a determining factor when deciding the overall prioritization of all
TIPs provided at the TRB. See Figures A2.1. and A2.2. for TIP prioritization criteria examples.
