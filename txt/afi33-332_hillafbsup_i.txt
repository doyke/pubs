                                             Chapter 1

                         OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY PROGRAM

1.1. Basic Guidelines.
     1.1.1. The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, The Congress finds the following:
(1) The privacy of an individual is directly affected by the collection, maintenance, use, and
dissemination of personal information by Federal agencies;
(2) The increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology, while essential to
the efficient operations of the Government, has greatly magnified the harm to individual privacy
that can occur from any collection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal information;
(3) The opportunities for an individual to secure employment, insurance, and credit, and his right
to due process, and other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain information
systems;
(4) The right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the
United States; and

(5) In order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained by
Federal agencies, it is necessary and proper for the Congress to regulate the collection,
maintenance, use, and dissemination of information by such agencies.
     1.1.2. The purpose of this Act is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an
     invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except as otherwise provided by
     law, to:
(1) Permit an individual to determine what records pertaining to him/her are collected,
maintained, used, or disseminated by such agencies;
(2) Permit an individual to prevent records pertaining to him/her obtained by such agencies for a
particular purpose from being used or made available for another purpose without his/her
consent;
(3) Permit an individual to gain access to information pertaining to him/her in Federal agency
records, to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof, and to correct or amend such records;
(4) Collect, maintain, use, or disseminate any record of identifiable personal information in a
manner that assures that such action is for a necessary and lawful purpose, that the information is
current for its intended use, and that an accurate adequate safeguards are provided to prevent
misuse of such information;
(5) Permit exemptions from the requirements with respect to records provided in this Act only in
those cases where there is an important public policy need for such exemption as has been
determined by specific statutory authority; and

(6) Be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a result of willful or intentional action
which violates any individual’s rights under this Act.
     1.1.3. The E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3601, Congress finds the following:
(1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly transforming societal interactions and the
relationships among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                              7


(2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in applying advances in information
technology to enhance governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient performance,
increase access to Government information, and increase citizen participation in Government.
(3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government are developed and presented
separately, according to the jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or agency,
rather than being integrated cooperatively according to function or topic.
(4) Internet-based Government services involving interagency cooperation are especially
difficult to develop and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding mechanisms to
support such interagency cooperation.
(5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved Government performance and
outcomes within and across agencies.
(6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the management of Government, to be
implemented as part of a management framework that also addresses finance, procurement,
human capital, and other challenges to improve the performance of Government.
(7) To take full advantage of the improved Government performance that can be achieved
through the use of Internet based technology requires strong leadership, better organization,
improved interagency collaboration, and more focused oversight of agency compliance with
statutes related to information resource management.
   1.1.4. The purposes of this Act are the following:
(1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government efforts to develop and promote
electronic Government services and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new Office
of Electronic Government within the Office of Management and Budget.
(2) To promote use of the Internet and other information technologies to provide increased
opportunities for citizen participation in Government.
(3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing electronic Government services, where
this collaboration would improve the service to citizens by integrating related functions,
and in the use of internal electronic Government processes, where this collaboration would
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.
(4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve agency missions and program
performance goals.
(5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging technologies within and across Government
agencies to provide citizen-centric Government information and services.
(6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other Government entities.
(7) To promote better informed decision making by policy makers.
(8) To promote access to high quality Government information and services across multiple
channels.
(9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and accountable.
(10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where appropriate, best practices from public
and private sector organizations.
(11) To provide enhanced access to Government information and services in a manner consistent
with laws regarding protection of personal privacy, national security, records retention, access
for persons with disabilities, and other relevant laws.
   1.1.5. Personal information is defined by the Department of Defense (DoD) as “information
   about an individual that identifies, links, relates, or is unique to, or describes him or her, e.g.,
   social security number (SSN); age; military rank; civilian grade; marital status; race; salary;
8                                          AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014


    home/office phone numbers; other demographic, biometric, personnel, medical, and financial
    information, etc. Such information is also known as personally identifiable information (PII)
    (i.e., information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as
    their name, social security number, date of birth, place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or
    biometric records, including any other PII which is linked or linkable to a specified
    individual).”
    1.1.6. The Privacy Act, defines the term record as “any item, collection, or grouping of
    information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited
    to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and
    that contains name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular
    assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.”
    1.1.7. The Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3301, defines a federal government record as
    “all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary
    materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of
    the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of
    public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate
    successor as evidence of the organization, functions, guidance, decisions, procedures,
    operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of
    data in them.” The definition of a record for purposes of the Federal Records Act is broader
    than as defined under the Privacy Act.
    1.1.8. Records that are retrieved by name or other personal identifier of a U.S. citizen or a
    person lawfully admitted for permanent residence are subject to requirements of the Privacy
    Act of 1974 and are referred to as a system of records (SOR). The DoD defines a system of
    records (SOR) as “a group of records, whatever the storage media (paper, electronic, etc.),
    under the control of a DoD Component from which personal information about an individual
    is retrieved by the name of the individual, or by some other identifying number, symbol, or
    other identifying particular assigned, that is unique to the individual.” SORs are only
    authorized as necessary to conduct the Air Force mission. The authority to establish a SOR
    must be derived from a specific statute or Executive Order that authorizes maintaining
    information in a system of records (IAW DoD 5400-11.R, Department of Defense Privacy
    Program).
    1.1.9. System of Records Notices (SORN), also referred to as Privacy Act System of
    Records Notices, are legal documents that describe the kinds of records collected and
    maintained in a SOR, on whom they are maintained, what the records are used for, and how
    an individual may access or contest the records in the system. DoD requires a SORNs for
    SORs being maintained by the AF to be published in the Federal Register to allow the
    general public a 30 day opportunity to comment before changing or implementing a SOR.
    Procedures for SORNs are addressed in Chapter 8 of this Instruction.
    1.1.10. Air Force personnel or supporting contractors shall:
       1.1.10.1. Only maintain paper and/or electronic SOR under the authority of an approved
       SORN which has been published in the Federal Register.
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           9


       1.1.10.2. Only collect, maintain, and use information under such systems for purposes
       described in the published SORN to support programs authorized by law or executive
       order and as implemented by DoD and AF prescribing directives.
       1.1.10.3. Safeguard the records in the system, keep them the minimum time required,
       and dispose of them according to Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

       1.1.10.7. Ensure personal information maintained in electronic files or folders are not
       stored on SharePoint or equivalent or like software programs unless required for daily
       operation and is accessible to only those individuals who have an official valid “need-to-
       know”.
       1.1.10.8. Remove personal information maintained within SharePoint or equivalent or
       like software programs when no longer needed for daily operations and file IAW AF
       RDS.

       information is being collected from the general public. For the purpose of this
       requirement, contractors are considered part of the general public. See AFI 33-324, The
       Information Collections and Reports Management Program: Controlling Internal,
       Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.

   PII, shall:
       1.2.12.1. In addition to Privacy Act Annual Refresher training, complete specialized
       Privacy Act training annually to comply with paragraph 11.1.2.2 of this Instruction.
       1.2.12.2. Immediately report any suspected or confirmed breaches of PII discovered to
       the United States Computer Emergency Response Team (USCERT) within one hour and
       to the local Privacy Manager/Monitor (see Chapter 9).
1.3. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
   1.3.1. Sensitive PII is personal information, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without
   authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness
   to an individual. Some categories of PII, when maintained by the Department of Air Force,
   are sensitive as stand-alone data elements. Examples of such sensitive PII include:
       1.3.1.1. Social Security Number (SSN) in any form.
       1.3.1.2. Alien registration number (A-number).
       1.3.1.3. Biometric identifier.

   contractors accessing and handling PII must coordinate with contracting officials to ensure
   the contract contains the proper Privacy Act clauses: 52.224-1, Privacy Act Notification; and
   52.224-2, Privacy Act as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see FAR
   website: at http://www.acquisition.gov/far/
      1.3.3.1. Contracts must be reviewed annually by the Contracting Officer Representative
      (COR) to ensure compliance with this Instruction.
      1.3.3.2. Disclosure of PII to contractors for use in the performance of an Air Force
      contract is considered an official use disclosure within the agency under exception (b)(1)
      of the Privacy Act.
1.4. Privacy Complaints and Violations.
   1.4.1. A privacy complaint is an allegation that an agency did not comply with specific
   provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended with respect to the maintenance,
   amendment, or dissemination of a SOR. A privacy violation is when an agency or individual
   knowingly or willfully does not comply with provisions of the Privacy Act. Privacy
   complaints or allegations of Privacy Act violations are not the same as PII breaches. For PII
   breach reporting procedures, see Chapter 9.
      1.4.1.1. Privacy complaints/violations must be submitted in written form.
      1.4.1.2. Alleged complaints of Privacy Act violations are processed through the
      supporting Privacy Manager. The Privacy Manager directs the process and provides
      guidance to the SOR manager. Issues that cannot be resolved at the local level shall be
      elevated to the HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Manager, as appropriate.
      1.4.1.3. The local SOR manager shall:
      1.4.1.4. Conduct an inquiry to determine if a formal investigation of the complaint or
      allegation of a Privacy Act violation is warranted.
      1.4.1.5. Ensure a response is sent to the complainant through the Privacy Officer.
   1.4.2. For Privacy Act complaints filed in a U.S. District Court against the AF, an AF
   activity, or an AF employee, the Office of The Judge Advocate’s General Litigation Division
   (AFLOA/JACL) shall provide SAF/A6P a litigation summary in accordance with the format
   in Appendix 8 of DoD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program. When the court
   renders a formal opinion or judgment, AFLOA/JACL will send SAF/A6P a copy of the
   judgment and opinion.

  1.4.3. Penalties for Violation. An individual may file a civil law suit against the Air Force
  for failing to comply with the Privacy Act. In addition to specific remedial actions, civil
  remedies include payment of damages, court costs, and attorney fees in some cases.
  Misdemeanor criminal charges and a fine of up to $5,000 may be imposed if:
     1.4.3.1. An employee maintains a SOR without publishing the required SORN in the
     Federal Register or discloses Privacy Act information from a SOR, knowing that
     dissemination is prohibited, to anyone not entitled to receive the information.
     1.4.3.2. An individual requests or obtains access to Privacy Act information on another
     individual under false pretenses.

     Sheet (see paragraph 9.4.3.) when removed from a SOR.
  2.2.4. The Privacy Act requires agencies to provide safeguards to ensure the security and
  confidentiality of SOR and to protect individuals against an invasion of personal privacy.
  Refer to AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use, for the appropriate procedures
  required to send Privacy Act information across the Internet.
     2.2.4.1. Exercise caution before transmitting personal information via e-mail to ensure
     the message is adequately safeguarded. Some information may be so sensitive and
     personal that e-mail may not be the proper way to transmit it. When transmitting
     personal information via e-mail within DoD, ensure:
     2.2.4.2. E-mail is encrypted, and
     2.2.4.3. There is an official need for the recipient(s), to include those in the “cc” block,
     to receive the information.
  2.2.5. When transmitting personal information over e-mail, encrypt and add “For Official
  Use Only” (“FOUO”) to the beginning of the subject line and apply the following statement
  at the beginning of the e-mail: "This e-mail contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)
  information which must be protected under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C 552)
  and/or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of this
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         19


   PERSONAL INFORMATION may result in disciplinary action, criminal and/or civil
   penalties. Further distribution is prohibited without the approval of the author of this
   message unless the recipient has a need to know in the performance of official duties. If you
   have received this message in error, please notify the sender and delete all copies of this
   message.” Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to all e-mails. Use it only in
   situations when you are actually transmitting personal information required to be protected
   For Official Use Only purposes. See DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4. Note: The guidance in
   this paragraph does not apply to appropriate releases of personal information to members of
   the public via e-mail, such as pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or with the
   consent of the subject of the personal information.
   2.2.6. Do not send unencrypted e-mails containing Privacy Act information to distribution or
   group or non .mil e-mail addresses. Official e-mail containing Privacy Act protected
   information shall be digitally signed and encrypted. Before forwarding an e-mail you have
   received containing personal information, verify that your intended recipients are authorized
   to receive the information under The Privacy Act.
2.3. Social Security Number (SSN) Reduction Plan. The stated intention of the Social
Security Reduction Plan is to reduce or eliminate the use of SSN in DoD and AF systems of
records, IT systems and forms IAW DoDI 1000.30, Reduction of Social Security Number (SSN)
Use Within DoD. The Functional office that owns the record for which SSNs are required to be
collected is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for submitting a SSN Justification
memorandum with respect to the collection of SSNs for those records. Records Professional,
Privacy Manager, and Forms Manager will assist to ensure compliance with the SSN reduction
plan requirements. The use of the SSN shall be limited to transactions that specifically require
the presentation of the SSN to meet a statutory or regulatory requirement. Most applications that
require the SSN for specific transactions do not require its use for every transaction. For
example, systems that link to financial institutions may need the SSN for initial interactions, but
thereafter use an account number or some other form of identification or authentication. As such
there is no need to use the SSN for individuals to authenticate themselves as part of every
transaction. DoDI 1000.30 is in effect and establishes.
   2.3.1. Acceptable Uses: Use of the SSN includes the SSN in any form, including, but not
   limited to truncated, masked, partially masked, encrypted, or disguised SSN. The acceptable
   uses of the SSN are those that are provided for by law, require interoperability with
   organizations beyond the DoD, or are required by operational necessities. Such operational
   necessities may be the result of the inability to alter systems, processes, or forms due to cost
   or unacceptable levels of risk. Those systems, processes, or forms that claim “operational
   necessity” shall be closely scrutinized. Ease of use and unwillingness to change are not
   acceptable justifications for continuing to collect SSNs.
   2.3.2. Documenting Acceptable Uses of SSN and other PII specifically. The authorization
   for use of PII is governed through DoD 5400.11-R. The method by which SSN use is
   documented shall be consistent with existing Privacy Act program requirements for forms,
   processes, IT systems, and systems of records, to include any locally created applications.
       2.3.2.1. In addition to the documentation required for the use of PII in the PIA and/or
       SORN, the use of the SSN in any form as part of any collection, transfer, or retention,
       including locally created user applications, must be specifically documented and justified.
20                                        AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014


     Documentation of the SSN justification shall be retained and available upon request. This
     documentation shall include:
         2.3.2.1.1. The specific requirement for use of the SSN.
         2.3.2.1.2. A senior official (flag officer or SES equivalent) shall sign a memorandum
         stating the justification for use of the SSN. It is unacceptable to collect, retain, use or
         transfer SSN without an approved justification.
            2.3.2.1.2.1. The justification memo to collect SSN in an IT System shall be
            forwarded with the PIA and/or SORN to the AF Privacy Officer. The justification
            memo will be addressed to Defense Privacy Officer for approval/disapproval.
            (see Attachment 6).
            2.3.2.1.2.2. Forms that collect SSN must have a completed AF Form 673 and a
            justification memo (IAW paragraph 2.3.2.1.2.1.) that is addressed to and approved
            by DPCLO. Submit items to appropriate Forms Manager IAW AFI 33-360,
            Publications and Forms Management.
         2.3.2.1.3. The DPCLO reviews SSN justifications for IT systems as an adjunct to the
         biennial PII review process. When justification for SSN use is rejected, the action
         officer will prepare a plan, to include milestones and a timeline, for the elimination of
         SSN usage.
  2.3.3. Periodic Review of SSN Use and Justification. SSN use and justification memo
  review is a responsibility under the biennial review process for all forms. IT systems
  Justification memos shall be reviewed in conjunction with the FISMA Annual review.
  2.3.4. Requesting the Social Security Number (SSN). When requesting an individual’s SSN
  always give a Privacy Act Statement or Privacy Advisory, as applicable.
  2.3.5. The Air Force requests an individual’s SSN and provides the Privacy Act
  Statement/Advisory required by law when anyone enters military service or becomes an Air
  Force civilian employee. Confirmation of Employment Eligibility is an acceptable use. When
  Air Force service members or employees are asked to provide their SSN as routine
  identification in order to retrieve an official record, such as a medical record; it is not
  necessary to inform the person again why their SSN is being requested.
     2.3.5.1. Alternative Means of Identifying Records: When law, executive order, or
     regulation does not require disclosing the SSN or if the SOR was created after January 1,
     1975, a SSN may be requested, but the individual is not required to disclose it. If the
     individual refuses to provide their information, use alternative means of identifying
     records. Executive Order (E.O.) 9397, Numbering System for Federal Accounts Relating
     to Individual Persons, November 22, 1943, was amended by E.O. 13478, Amendments to
     Executive Order 9397 Relating to Federal Agency Use of Social Security Numbers,
     November 18, 2008, which emphasizes the need to protect PII and deletes the mandatory
     requirement to collecting SSNs. E.O. 9397 (SSN), as amended (E.O. 13478) shall be
     referenced when cited in PAS, PIA and SORN whenever a SSN is collected, used, stored,
     or disseminated for acceptable uses within AF IT systems, on AF Forms, or in other
     physical media systems of records. IT systems, AF Forms, and AF records OPRs should
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      21


     also consult DoDI 1000.30, enclosure 2, paragraph 2, Acceptable Uses. Contact the
     OPR’s organizational Privacy Office for assistance.
     2.3.5.2. Protection of SSN. SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. The SSN in
     any form, including, but not limited to truncated (last 4 or 5), masked, partially masked,
     encrypted, or disguised SSN will be Protected as High Impact PII and marked FOR
     OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Within DoD, do not disclose a person’s SSN to another
     person without an official need to know or consent of the individual. Release of SSNs
     outside of the DoD are not releasable without the person’s consent or unless authorized
     under one of the twelve exceptions to the Privacy Act (see paragraph 10.4.).
  2.3.6. Reporting Results of Social Security Number Reduction.
     2.3.6.1. New Departmental Forms. The AF Departmental Forms Management Officer
     shall maintain a database to produce an annual report every July 1st. This report shall be
     an input into the Privacy Act section of the annual FISMA Report as required by
     subchapter III, chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code. The annual report shall contain
     the following elements:
         2.3.6.1.1. Number of forms reviewed.
         2.3.6.1.2. Number of forms requesting SSNs.
         2.3.6.1.3. Number of SSN justifications accepted and rejected.
         2.3.6.1.4. Examples of forms where SSNs were not allowed.
         2.3.6.1.5. Examples of SSN masking or truncation.
     2.3.6.2. For     new forms issued    below     the      departmental     level
     (HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, Wing, etc), no database shall be required as set forth in
     paragraph 2.3.6.1.
     2.3.6.3. Existing Departmental Forms. The AF Departmental Forms Management
     Officer shall report annually on July 1st the results of the AF Forms reviews and submit a
     report to the AF Privacy Officer. This report shall include the following elements:
         2.3.6.3.1. Total number of forms in the database.
         2.3.6.3.2. Number of forms reviewed.
         2.3.6.3.3. Number of forms containing SSNs.
         2.3.6.3.4. Number of forms where justifications were questioned.
         2.3.6.3.5. Number of SSN justifications accepted and rejected.
         2.3.6.3.6. Examples of forms where SSNs were not allowed.
         2.3.6.3.7. Examples of SSN masking or truncation.

                                            Chapter 3

      FIRST PARTY ACCESS TO OWN RECORDS UNDER THE PRIVACY ACT

3.1. Making a Request for Access. Persons or their designated representatives may ask for a
copy of their records maintained in a SOR. Requesters need not state why they want access to
their records. Verify the identity of the requester to avoid unauthorized disclosures. How you
verify identity will depend on the sensitivity of the requested records. Identity can be verified in
a number of ways, to include visually, personal knowledge of the requester, a signed letter or
request via telephone or e-mail, a notarized statement, or an unsworn statement. An unsworn
declaration or notarized statement should be obtained in the following format:
   3.1.1. “I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside the United States, add “under the laws
   of the United States of America”) that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date)
   (Signature).”
3.2. Processing a Request for Access. Immediately consult the local Privacy Manager, if
necessary, to assure timely response to the request. When individuals request information about
themselves, they are not required to site either the Privacy or Freedom of Information Act
(FIOA), individual who processes the request will apply the Privacy Act when records are
contained in a SOR and will apply the FOIA to all other records.
   3.2.1. Requesters must adequately describe the records they want. They do not have to name
   a SOR, but they should at least name a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask
   for “all records about me,” the requester should be asked for more information and tell the
   person how to review the government-wide systems of records published in the Federal
   Register or at http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/SORNs.html.
   3.2.2. Requesters will not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage,
   telephones, or official mail channels for making non-official requests for SOR. However,
   system managers shall process such requests and should advise requesters that using
   government resources to make non-official requests for SOR is not permissible.
   3.2.3. The requester will receive an acknowledgement letter within 10 workdays, informing
   them of the status of their request and providing an approximate completion date of no more
   than 20 workdays from the date of the initial receipt of the request.
   3.2.4. Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 20 workdays of receiving the
   request unless the system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
   Give information in a form the requester can understand. If the system is exempt from
   disclosure under the Privacy Act, follow the procedures addressed in paragraph 3.5.
3.3. Fees. Provide the first 100 pages free, and charge only reproduction costs for the
remainder. Copies cost $.15 per page; microfiche costs $.25 per fiche. No charge for copies is
made if records are provided electronically to the requester.
3.4. Do not charge fees:
   3.4.1. For official purposes, such as to respond to the proposed denial of a right, privilege, or
   benefit; disciplinary action; or if the requester can get the record without charge under
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          23


   procedures governed by DoD or AF regulation applicable to the record (for example medical
   records).
   3.4.2. For the time to search for a Privacy Act record of the subject.
   3.4.3. For reproducing a document for the convenience of the Air Force.
   3.4.4. For reproducing a record so the requester can review it.
   3.4.5. Fee waivers. Waive fees automatically if the direct cost of reproduction is less than
   $30, unless the individual is seeking an obvious extension or duplication of a previous
   request for which he or she was granted a waiver. Decisions to waive or reduce fees that
   exceed $30 are made on a case-by-case basis.
3.5. Denying or Limiting Access. When a Privacy Act system of record will not be released
under the Privacy Act, the request must be processed under the FOIA. If any part of the record is
denied under the FOIA, the procedures in DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, DoD Freedom of
Information Act Program, are followed. For Privacy Act denials not also processed under the
FOIA (Note: this should be an extremely rare circumstance), send a copy of the request, the
record copy, and why access has been denied (include the applicable exemption) to the denial
authority through the legal office and the Privacy Office. Judge Advocate (JA) offices shall
include a written legal opinion. The legal opinion shall not merely state that the decision is
“legally sufficient,” but shall provide factual details and an analysis of the law and applicable
regulations. The Privacy Manager reviews the file, and makes a recommendation to the denial
authority. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial
authority grants access, release the record copy. If the denial authority refuses access, tell the
requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights (see Chapter 5).
   3.5.1. Before a request for access to a Privacy Act system of record from the subject is
   denied that was not also processed under the FOIA, ensure that:
       3.5.1.1. The system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
       3.5.1.2. The exemption covers each document. All parts of a system are not
       automatically exempt.
       3.5.1.3. The FOIA does not require release of any part of the record.
       3.5.1.4. Nonexempt parts are segregated.
   3.5.2. Third Party Information in a SOR. A first party requester is not entitled to information
   that is not “about” him or her that is contained in their system of record; for example, the
   home address or SSN of a third party that is contained in their system of record solely for
   ease of identification of the third party. Servicing legal offices should be consulted prior to
   the release of a third party’s sensitive personal information to a first party requester that is
   contained in the first party requester’s Privacy Act record.
3.6. Denial Authorities.
   3.6.1. Initial Denial Authority (IDA). IDAs for denials of SOR to the subject of the record
   that is not also processed under the FOIA (Note: this should be an extremely rare case) is the
   same as IDAs for FOIA requests. An IDA in such a case is an official who has been granted
   authority by the head of a DoD component to withhold records requested under the FOIA for
   one or more of the nine categories of records exempt from mandatory disclosure. See DoD
24                                      AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014


  5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program. IDA’s may also
  deny a fee category claim by a requester; deny a request for expedited processing due to
  demonstrated compelling need in accordance with DoD Regulation 5400.7/AFMAN 33-302;
  deny a request for a waiver or reduction of fees; review a fee estimate; and confirm that no
  records were located in response to a request.
  3.6.2. Only approved IDAs will deny all or parts of records. However, if the only
  information withheld from an Air Force record is privacy information under the DoD policy
  to withhold lists of names of DoD personnel (“DoD Names Policy”), the organization/unit
  FOIA Managers may sign the decision memorandum to initially deny: fee category claims,
  requests for expedited processing, and waiver or reduction of fees. FOIA Managers
  determines fee estimates; and signs “no records” responses. Organizations are authorized to
  withhold DoD names below O7, and e-mail addresses of most DoD personnel, under the
  DoD Names Policy.

                           AMENDING A PRIVACY ACT RECORD

4.1. Amendment Reasons. Individuals may ask to have their personal information in SOR
amended to make them accurate, timely, relevant, and complete. System managers shall
routinely correct a record if the requester can show that it is factually wrong (e.g., date of birth is
wrong).
4.2. Responding to Amendment Requests.
   4.2.1. The individual may request simple corrections orally. Requests for complicated and
   detailed corrections must be in writing to ensure clarity.
   4.2.2. After verifying the identity of the requester, make the change if appropriate, notify all
   known recipients of the record, and inform the individual.
   4.2.3. Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an expected completion
   date unless you complete the change within that time. Final decisions must, unless extended
   by the appropriate authority, take no longer than 30 workdays of receipt.
4.3. Approving or Denying a Record Amendment. The Air Force does not usually amend a
record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment.
Determination not to amend such records constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal (see
Chapter 5).
   4.3.1. If the system manager decides not to amend the record; send a copy of the request, the
   record, and the recommended denial reasons to the denial authority through the legal office
   and the Privacy Office. Legal offices shall include a written legal opinion. The legal opinion
   shall not merely state that the decision is “legally sufficient,” but will provide factual details
   and an analysis of the law and applicable regulations. The Privacy Officer reviews the
   proposed denial and legal opinion and makes a recommendation to the denial authority.
   4.3.2. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial
   authority approves the request the record is amended.
   4.3.3. The requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with the SOR manager if
   SAF/GCA denies the request to amend the record. SAF/GCA explains the requester’s rights
   when they issue the final appeal decision.
4.4. Contents of Privacy Act Processing Case Files. Do not keep copies of disputed records in
this file. File disputed records in their appropriate series. Use the file solely for statistics and to
process requests. Do not use the case files to make any kind of determination about an
individual. Document the reasons for untimely responses. These files include:
   4.4.1. Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a system has records about them.
   4.4.2. Requests for access or amendment.
   4.4.3. Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions.
   4.4.4. Coordination actions and related papers.

                                              APPEALS

5.1. Appeal Procedures. Individuals who receive a denial to their access or amendment request
may request a denial review (appeal) within 60 calendar days of the date of the denial letter. (see
paragraph 3.6.).
   5.1.1. The denial authority promptly sends a complete appeal package to SAF/GCA. The
   package must include:
       5.1.1.1. The original appeal letter;
       5.1.1.2. The initial request;
       5.1.1.3. The initial denial;
       5.1.1.4. A copy of the record;
       5.1.1.5. Any internal records or coordination actions relating to the denial; the denial
       authority’s comments on the appellant’s arguments and the legal reviews.
   5.1.2. If the denial authority reverses an earlier denial and grants access or amendment,
   notify the requester immediately.
   5.1.3. The system manager may include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the
   record. Limit the summary to the reasons SAF/GCA gave to the individual. The summary is
   part of the individual’s record, but it is not subject to amendment procedures.
   5.1.4. AFLOA/JACL reviews the denial and provides a final recommendation to SAF/GCA.
   SAF/GCA provides the requester the final Air Force decision and explains judicial review
   rights.
   5.1.5. SAF/GCA shall provide a copy of the decision letter to the
   HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Officer if applicable, and the originating Privacy
   Manager to close the case file.
   5.1.6. The records will clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the record
   or separately, if applicable.
   5.1.7. The disputed part of the record must show that the requester filed a statement of
   disagreement.
   5.1.8. Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record’s previous recipients.
   Inform subsequent record users about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with
   the record.

                     DISCLOSING RECORDS TO THIRD PARTIES

6.1. Disclosure Considerations.
   6.1.1. Placing PII on share drives and/or SharePoint. PII contained in any record shall not be
   placed on share drives for access by groups of individuals unless each person of the group
   has an official need to know for an approved government purpose to perform their job. Add
   appropriate access controls to ensure access by only authorized individuals that have the need
   to know. Information shall be removed when no longer needed and maintained IAW
   approved disposition schedule.
      6.1.1.1. Recall rosters shall be marked FOUO (see paragraph 2.2.4.) and only provided
      to individuals with an official need-to-know to accomplish their official duties. Do not
      place a complete recall roster in a shared location allowing everyone within the
      organization access; unless everyone within the organization has consented to having
      their information accessible by everyone within the organization.
      6.1.1.2. “Social Rosters” shall be marked FOUO. Social Rosters are created in order to
      inform spouses/significant other of events of a social nature, such as office picnics and
      other events to which they will be invited. A spouse or significant other’s personal
      information shall not be collected and maintained for social roster purposes unless
      collected directly from or obtain a written consent from the individual it pertains to.
      Personnel who maintain social rosters will ensure the information is used for its intended
      purpose.
   6.1.2. Placing PII Files in Collaborative IT Environments. AF Information System Owners
   (ISO) of collaborative IT environments within the USAF enterprise, i.e., Microsoft ©
   SharePoint, Task Management Tool (TMT), Customer Relations Management (CRM), share
   drives, etc., shall adhere to this Instruction and Records Management policies established for
   particular categories of official records.
      6.1.2.1. Written permission from the owner of the SOR is required before placing
      electronic files or records copies into a collaborative or shared environment.
      6.1.2.2. The ISO shall protect, safeguard and manage SOR and records containing PII
      within a shared environment according to the published SORN and/or PIA of the owners’
      SOR from which electronic files and records copies are shared. AF SORNs are posted on
      the          Defense           Privacy          Office          public        website
      http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/SORNs.html. AF PIAs are posted on the Air
      Force Privacy Act public website http://www.privacy.af.mil/pia/index.asp.
      6.1.2.3. Organizations are not required by this directive to actively search through
      SharePoint or share drive to attempt to find PII which does not have the required
      safeguard procedures. Commands may implement additional requirements for reviewing
      sites. If PII is discovered, where proper safeguard measures are not in place (Need to
      Know to perform official duties) PII breach reporting and reprimand may be appropriate
      as outlined in Chapter 9 of this instruction.

   6.1.3. Personal Information That Requires Protection. Following are some examples of
   information that is normally not releasable to the public without the written consent of the
   subject. This list is not all-inclusive. The facts and circumstances of the request and the
   nature of the record will determine the appropriateness of release without consent.
   Withholding personal information from AF records is always subject to balancing the
   specific privacy interest of individuals contained in a specific record against the public
   interest in the information. Note: Since 2001 the release of names and other PII of certain
   DoD personnel are given more scrutiny and the interests supporting withholding of the
   information              given            more             weight.                      See
   http://www.DoD.mil/pubs/foi/dfoipo/docs/names_removal.pdf.
       6.1.3.1. Names of personnel below the grade of O-7 or civilian equivalent, unless the
       DoD person is a Director of an organization.

       6.1.3.13. Social Security Number.
       6.1.3.14. DoD Identification Number.
6.2. Releasable Information. Following are examples of information normally releasable to
the public without the written consent of the subject. This list is not all-inclusive and is always
subject to balancing the specific privacy interest of individuals contained in a specific record
against the public interest in the information. The facts and circumstances of the request and the
nature of the record will determine the appropriateness of release without consent.
   6.2.1. Names of Directors or personnel above the grade of O-6 or civilian equivalent.

   6.2.21. Date of retirement, separation.
6.3. Disclosing Information. In all cases, use the following guidelines to decide whether to
release information without consent:
   6.3.1. Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information
   requested?
   6.3.2. Is disclosing the information in the public interest? The public interest relates to how
   the Air Force carries out its statutory and regulatory duties.
   6.3.3. Balance the public interest against the individual’s privacy interest. Do not consider
   the requester’s purpose, circumstances, or proposed use.
6.4. Rules for Releasing Privacy Act Information Without Consent of the Subject. The
Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of any SOR without the written consent of the individual to
whom the record pertains. There are twelve exceptions to the “no disclosure without consent”
rule. See http://www.privacy.af.mil/exceptions/index.asp.
6.5. Disclosing the Medical Records of Minors. AF personnel may disclose the medical
records of minors to their parents or legal guardians in conjunction with applicable Federal laws
and guidelines. The laws of each state define the age of majority. Consult with the servicing legal
 30                                        AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014


office and Military Treatment Facility (MTF) for guidance in regard to the age of majority in
overseas locations.
6.6. Disclosure Accountings. System managers must keep an accurate record of all disclosures
made from any SOR except disclosures to DoD personnel for official use or disclosures under
the FOIA. System managers may use AF Form 771, Accounting of Disclosures. Retain
disclosure accountings for 5 years after the disclosure, or for the life of the record, whichever is
longer.
   6.6.1. System managers shall file the Accounting of Disclosure record and give it to the
   subject on request, send corrected or disputed information to previous record recipients,
   explain any disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each accounting:
       6.6.1.1. Release date.
       6.6.1.2. Description of information.
       6.6.1.3. Reason for release.
       6.6.1.4. Name and address of recipient.
   6.6.2. Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from the subject.
   6.6.3. You may withhold information about disclosure accountings for law enforcement
   purposes at the law enforcement agency’s request.
6.7. Computer Matching. Computer matching programs electronically compare records from
two or more automated systems of the DoD, another Federal agency, or a State or Local
Government. A system manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse action against
a Federal employee must meet these requirements of the Privacy Act: (1) prepare a written
agreement between participants; (2) secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board; (3)
publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before matching begins; (4) ensure full
investigation and due process; and (5) act on the information, as necessary.
   6.7.1. The Privacy Act applies to matching programs that use records from: Federal
   personnel or payroll systems and Federal benefit programs where matching: (1) determines
   Federal benefit eligibility; (2) checks on compliance with benefit program requirements; (3)
   recovers improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries.
   6.7.2. Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, tax administration,
   routine administration, background checks and foreign counterintelligence, and internal
   matching that won't cause any adverse action are exempt from Privacy Act matching
   requirements.
   6.7.3. Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact AF
   Privacy Officer immediately. System managers must prepare a Computer System Matching
   Agree notice for publication in the Federal Register with a Routine Use that allows
   disclosing the proposed system notice to AF Privacy Officer. Allow 180 days for processing
   requests for a new matching program.
   6.7.4. The subject of a SOR must receive a PAS when personal information of the subjects
   are asked to be provided and will be used in a matching program as a routine use. The most
   appropriate method of doing so is to include the PAS on the form used to apply for benefits.
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       31


   Coordinate appropriate statements with the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Manager and AF
   Privacy Officer.
6.8. Privacy and the Web. Do not post PII on publicly accessible DoD web sites unless
authorized by law and implementing regulation and policy. Additionally, do not post PII on .mil
secure web sites unless authorized by the appropriate local commander, for official purposes, and
an appropriate risk assessment is performed. See AFI 33-129.
   6.8.1. Add a prominent Privacy Act Advisory at web site entry points. A Privacy Act
   Advisory is required to be posted on the web page where the information is being solicited or
   through a well-marked hyperlink whenever a web site solicits PII, even when not retained by
   the site after login or maintained in a SOR. Notices must clearly explain when the collection
   of PII is voluntary and notify users how to provide consent.
   6.8.2. Include a Privacy Act Statement on the web page if it collects information directly
   from an individual that is maintained and retrieved by his or her name or personal identifier
   (i.e., SSN). Only maintain such information in approved SOR that are published in the
   Federal Register. Provide a link to the AF Privacy Act policy and SORNs at
   http://www.privacy.af.mil/ and http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/SORNs.html.

                                            Chapter 7

                             PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

7.1. Evaluating Information Systems for Privacy Act Compliance and Risk
Identification. ISOs, Portfolio Managers (PfMs), PMs, and IAMs shall address Privacy Act
requirements and risks to Privacy Act data in an IT system and plan the integration of privacy
protections with appropriate IA controls into the development life cycle of an information
system. A PIA shall be completed in accordance with DoDI 5400.16..
7.2. What is a PIA? The Privacy Impact Assessment is an analysis of how PII information
is collected and handled in an IT system: (1) to ensure PII handling conforms to applicable
legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy, (2) to determine the risks and
effects of collecting, maintaining and disseminating information in identifiable form in an
electronic information system, and (3) to examine and evaluate protections and alternative
processes for handling PII information to mitigate potential privacy risks.
   7.2.1. The PIA identifies the physical, technical, and administrative controls that are needed
   to protect PII. Information Assurance (IA) controls are identified in DoDI 8500.2,
   Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, that mitigate specific risks that will be
   implemented and tested before deployment or release of the system; and whether a SORN
   exists, needs to be created, and/or needs to be amended. The E-Government Act of 2002 and
   DoDI 5400.16 requires PIAs to be conducted before developing or procuring IT systems or
   projects that collect, maintain, or disseminate information in identifiable form from or about
   individuals as defined in DoD 5400.11-R.
   7.2.2. PIAs are required to be performed, accomplished and/or updated as necessary when a
   system change exposes a new privacy risk for which an IA control must be identified and
   tested before re-deployment or re-release of the system.
   7.2.3. The depth and content of the PIA should be thorough and appropriate for the nature of
   the information to be collected and the size and complexity of the information technology
   system.
7.3. When a PIA is required. PIAs are submitted 120 days from the scheduled operational and
expiration date (Authorization to Operate (ATO) or Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)) on
all new and existing systems meeting the criteria when PII, other than the user table is collected,
maintained, used, or disseminated in electronic form about members of the public, Federal
personnel, contractors or foreign nationals employed at U.S. military facilities internationally, in
order to:
   7.3.1. Ensure PII handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements
   regarding privacy;
   7.3.2. Determine the need, privacy risks, and effects of collecting, maintaining, using, and
   disseminating PII in electronic form; and
   7.3.3. Examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes to mitigate potential
   privacy risks.
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            33


7.4. When a PIA is not required. A PIA is not required when: (1) PII is not being maintained,
collected, store, used, and/or disseminated; other than the user table or (2) the IT system is an
approved National Security System (NSS). Administrative and personnel systems that do not
meet one or more of the NSS conditions are not exempt from the PIA requirement.
7.5. Who conducts the PIA? The ISO shall conduct a PIA in conjunction with the system
PM, IAM and local/functional Privacy Manager.
   7.5.1. Medical IT systems that are Defense Health Program (DHP) funded or in the AF line-
   funded portfolio and managed by AFMS assets, shall route PIAs through the AF SG-CIO
   office for appropriate management, signatures, and oversight.
   7.5.2. All DoD Medical Department IT systems purchased with DHP funds must ONLY be
   reported to the DoD Information Technology Portfolio Repository (DITPR) via the
   component Tricare Management Activity (TMA).
7.6. Format and Digital Signatures. PIAs shall be completed on DD Form 2930, Privacy
Impact Assessment, as an unsecured fillable PDF which requires digital signatures as follows,
except for medical DHP funded systems (see paragraph 7.5.1.):
   7.6.1. Obtain the first three signatures before e-mail submission to AF Privacy Officer
   (airforceprivacy@pentagon.af.mil) for review and to obtain digital signatures in the final
   three blocks.
   7.6.2. The system Program Manager.
   7.6.3. The system Information Assurance Manager.
   7.6.4. The Privacy Manager.
   7.6.5. The Senior Information Assurance Official (SIAO) or designee.
   7.6.6. The Component Privacy Officer.
   7.6.7. The AF CIO.
7.7. Submitting Approved PIAs. Approved PIAs which collect PII on members of the General
Public will be forwarded by the AF Privacy Officer to the Office of the Secretary of Defense,

                                           Chapter 8

 PREPARING SYSTEM OF RECORDS NOTICE (SORN) FOR PUBLISHING IN THE
                       FEDERAL REGISTER

8.1. Publishing System of Records Notices (SORNs). Records that are retrieved by PII and/or
a unique identifier are subject to Privacy Act requirements and are referred to as a SOR. The AF
must submit SORNs to Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office (DPCLO) to be published in
the Federal Register, describing the collection of information for new, changed or deleted
systems of records. When published, the public will be allowed 30 days to comment. During
this 30 day review period; collection of this information is unauthorized. Collection of the
information shall begin 30 days after the SORN appears in the Federal Register unless
comments are received that would result in a contrary determination. Any collection conducted
prior to or during the 30 days comment period is an illegal collection and can result in civil
penalties under the Privacy Act OF 1974 5 U.S.C. § 552a as amended, (i)(1)Criminal Penalties
8.2. When is a SORN required? A SORN is required when information onan individual is
retrieved by name of the indivdiual; some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying
particular assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires submission of new or
significantly changed SORNs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and both houses
of Congress before publication in the Federal Register. This applies when:
   8.2.1. Starting a new system. (Add).
   8.2.2. Instituting significant changes to an existing system. (Alter).
   8.2.3. Minor changes to an existing system. (Admin).
   8.2.4. Sending out data collection forms or Instructions.
   8.2.5. Issuing a request for proposal or invitation for bid to support a new system.
   8.2.6. Other Systems. National Security SOR are required to have a SORN be completed.
   While some or many of these systems may be classified, the SORN is written in an
   unclassified manner describing the nature of the collection of PII. (see DoD 5400.11-R, for
   the use and establishment of exemptions that may apply to these systems).
8.3. Adopting Existing SORNs. A new or existing SOR may utilize (piggy back) an existing
SORN published in the Federal Register:
   8.3.1. First, research current SORNs, including those that cover systems of records
   government-wide and DoD-wide on the Defense Privacy Notices website at
   http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/SORNs.html, and the AF Privacy Notices
   website at http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/component/airforce/index.html, for
   one that matches well with the new SOR at all points, i.e., Category of Individuals Covered,
   Category of Records, Authority, Purposes, Routine Uses, Policies, etc.
   8.3.2. Second, if necessary, contact the current SORN owner through the POC information
   on the SORN to discuss altering or amending their SORN to include the new AF SOR and
   POC information.
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     35


   8.3.3. Provide the system owner the altered or amended SORN for their review and
   processing.
8.4. Updating SORNs. Examples for Adding, Altering, Amending, and Deleting a SORN are
available on the AF Information Access SharePoint and the AF Privacy Website.
8.5. Submitting SORNs for Publication in the Federal Register. The PM must submit the
proposed SORN through their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Manager at a minimum of 120
days before the planned implementation date of a new SOR or a change to an existing SOR
subject to this Instruction. The Privacy Manager shall review for accuracy and completeness and
send electronically to the AF Privacy Office airforceprivacy@pentagon.af.mil. The AF
Privacy Office shall review and forward to DPCLO for review and publishing in the Federal
Register, as appropriate.
8.6. Requirement for Periodic review of published SORNs. System PMs shall annually
review to validate currency of their published SORNs coinciding with annual FISMA reviews
and submit any changes through the process described in this chapter and promptly update
appropriate answers to EITDR questions.
8.7. Deletion of SORNs. If your IT system is being decommissioned or closed and has a
published SORN, comply with DoD 5400.11-R, “Deletion of System of Records Notices” and
submit appropriate amendment or deletion request to the AF Privacy Office
airforceprivacy@pentagon.af.mil to be forwarded to DPCLO to have the SORN deleted from
the Federal Register.

       9.2.4.4. Download and local/remote storage of records containing PII is prohibited unless
       expressly approved by the ISO.
9.3. PII Breach Reporting. Refer to OSD Memorandum (OSD 15041-07, dated 21 September
2007), Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable
Information, Appendix A, Table 1, PII Incident Reporting and Risk Assessment Model for more
specific information on PII breach reporting. A PII breach is defined as “a loss of control,
compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any
similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users and for an other
than authorized purpose have access or potential access to PII, whether physical or electronic.”
(see Attachment 1). Breaches must be reported to the servicing Privacy Manager by anyone
discovering it.
   9.3.1. The servicing Privacy Manager shall assist with the submission of a Preliminary PII
   Breach Report by unencrypted e-mail according to the timeline below:
       9.3.1.1. PII Breach Reports shall be completed on the template provided by DPCLO

       e-mail (airforceprivacy@pentagon.af.mil) attaching the written PII Breach Preliminary
       Report.
       9.3.1.5. Within one hour of the discovery of the PII breach, the servicing Privacy
       Manager shall ensure the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) has
       been notified IAW guidance at www.us-cert.gov. The servicing Privacy Manager shall,
       through their chain of command to the Wing Command Post submit an initial Operational
       Report (OPREP) if the breach may have an impact on organization operation and or
       potential media attention.
       9.3.1.6. Within 24 hours of the PII breach, the Privacy Manager shall notify the senior
       level individual in the chain of command of the unit where the incident occurred and
       simultaneously notify the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Manager by official
       unencrypted e-mail attaching the written PII Breach Preliminary Report.
       9.3.1.7. Within 24 hours of being notified of the PII breach the appropriate level Privacy
       Manager shall notify the AF Privacy Office by official unencrypted e-mail

     9.3.1.9. Until resolved, the underlying issues that led to the breach shall continue to be
     reported to the AF Privacy Office IAW these reporting procedures.
     9.3.1.10. The servicing Privacy Manager shall send the PII Breach Final Report when
     resolved in the same routing as previous notifications along with a final OPREP.
  9.3.2. Guidelines for conducting an inquiry of a PII Incident. The senior-level individual
  who is in the chain of command for the organization where the loss, theft or compromise
  occurred shall appoint an official to conduct an inquiry (recommend E7/above or civil
  equivalent) on the PII incident to determine if it is an actual breach, the cause and if a there
  was any criminal intent that would warrant a criminal investigation.
     9.3.2.1. The servicing Privacy Manager/Monitor shall provide guidance to the individual
     appointed to properly complete the PII Breach Final Report and reference AFI and DoD
     Policies and the Privacy Act for use in completing the inquiry as required.

     and independently assess the handling of the breach. They shall make clarifications and
     additions on the PII Incident Final Report as required, and submit to the appointing
     senior-level individual a recommendation of whether notification to affected individuals
     is required after a risk assessment analysis has been completed, along with any corrective
     actions that should be taken. A legal review shall be completed before submission of the
     Final Report to determine the legal sufficiency of the report and advise whether
     administrative, disciplinary action or a criminal investigation is warranted and
     appropriate. The appointed official may be asked by the appointing senior-level
     individual to make additional recommendations or more formal reports as required.
     9.3.2.3. Upon concurrence with PII Breach Final Report recommendations, the senior-
     level individual who is in the chain of command for the organization where the loss, theft

     Manager.
     9.3.2.4. Notification to affected individuals, if determined to be required, are normally
     made no later than 10 working days after a PII breach is confirmed and the identities of
     the affected individuals ascertained by a senior level individual in the chain of command
     for the organization where the breach occurred. A senior level official is considered to be
     at a Directorate or higher level. Group or higher level commanders of the O-6 rank or
     above also meet the definition of “senior level.” (see Attachment 7).
  9.3.3. Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) Reported PII Incidents.
  According to CJCSM 6510.01A, Enclosure C, Paragraph 7.b, “when a Computer Network

9.4. Risk Based Management. Apply a risk based management approach. Evaluate the
effectiveness of additional protections against sensitivity, probability of exposure, risk and cost.
   9.4.1. Consider the sensitivity category (Low, Moderate, or High) of the PII and the
   probability of exposure, risk of disclosure, loss or alteration, when providing physical
   security measures. (see Attachment 5).
   9.4.2. Information marked For Official Use Only (FOUO) or Controlled Unclassified
   Information (CUI) must be protected from unauthorized disclosure. Reasonable steps shall
   be taken both during and after working hours to minimize risk of access by unauthorized
   personnel. Guidance on marking and physical security requirements for CUI and FOUO are
   addressed in AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management and DoDM 5200.01,
   Volume 4.
   9.4.3. AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet or DD Form 2923, Privacy Act Data Cover
   Sheet. Use is mandatory to protect PII from being viewed by unauthorized personnel when
   Privacy Act materials are removed from their system of record or approved storage location.
   9.4.4. AFVA 33-276, Privacy Act Label. Use is mandatory to assist in identifying Privacy
   Act information by placing the label on the covers of removable electronic storage media
   such as Laptops, Government Hard drives, DVDs, CDs, diskettes, tapes and/or deployment
   folders. The label is not authorized for use on file drawers or file folders, cabinets, or other
   stationary equipment or materials IAW with AFI 33-322, Air Force Records Management.
9.5. Disposing of Records. Consult a Records Professional before disposing of any records.
You may use the following methods to dispose of records protected by the Privacy Act for
authorized destruction according to RDS maintained in the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS).
   9.5.1. Destroy by any reasonable method that prevents loss, theft or compromise during and
   after destruction such as pulping, macerating, tearing, burning, shredding or otherwise
   completely destroying the media so that PII is both not readable and is beyond
   reconstruction. Refer to NIST SP800-88, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-
   88/NISTSP800-88_rev1.pdf.
   9.5.2. Degauss or overwrite magnetic media according to established guidelines. DoDM
   5200.01, Volume 4 and AFI 31-401 also govern destruction of FOUO and CUI.
   9.5.3. Recycling of material protected under the Privacy Act.
       9.5.3.1. When safeguarding information protected under the Privacy Act can be assured
       as described in this chapter, disposal of recyclable Privacy Act protected products may be
       accomplished through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) or
       through contracted recycling providers that manage a base-wide recycling program.
       9.5.3.2. Originators of material protected under the Privacy Act must safeguard it until it
       is transferred to the recycling provider. This transfer does not require a disclosure
       accounting. Note: Information protected under the Privacy Act shall not be placed in
       unattended recycle or trash bins.
       9.5.3.3. (Added-HILLAFB) To assure that FOUO information is not inadvertently
       released or disclosed to unauthorized persons, you must use one of the destruction
       methods listed below.
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     41


     9.5.3.4. (Added-HILLAFB) Whenever feasible, all unclassified paper products at Hill
     AFB, except for newspapers and magazines, will be shredded prior to disposal or
     removal from the workplace for recycling, preventing the inadvertent release of FOUO
     information. Destroy FOUO documents using a 3/8 crosscut or better shredder.
     9.5.3.5. (Added-HILLAFB) Hill AFB has designated Davis County Burn Plant,
     (Wasatch Integrated Waste Management District) as the Central Destruction Facility
     (CDF). This method is recommended for large amounts of FOUO data and is the only
     approved method for off-site destruction. Each organization is responsible for
     transporting their data to the Burn Plant and will witness the destruction of the data IAW
     paragraph 10.3.4.3.
     9.5.3.6. (Added-HILLAFB) You may contract out the destruction of FOUO documents
     provided the destruction takes place on site at Hill AFB, and is in accordance with all
     regulatory guidance and is witnessed by a government civilian or military employee.
     This is also applicable to Government Purchase Card (GPC) purchases.

                              PRIVACY ACT EXEMPTIONS

10.1. Exemption Types. This chapter contains the most current exemptions that have been
published as final rules for the listed systems of records as of the date of this AFI. The ISO
should ensure that a more recent final rule has not been published. There are two types of
exemptions from release or disclosure permitted by Title 5, USC 552a:
   10.1.1. A General exemption authorizes the exemption of a SOR from most parts of the
   Privacy Act.
   10.1.2. A Specific exemption authorizes the exemption of a SOR from only a few parts of the
   Privacy Act.
10.2. Authorizing Exemptions. Denial authorities may withhold release or disclosure of
records to the first party requesters using Privacy Act exemptions only when an exemption for
the SOR has been published in the Federal Register as a final rule. See
http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/component/airforce/index.html; exemptions are
noted in the right column.
10.3. Requesting an Exemption. An ISO who believes that a system requires an exemption
from some or all of the requirements of the Privacy Act shall send a request through the Wing
Privacy Office, the HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Office, and to AF Privacy Office. Final
approval is by DPCLO. The request will detail the reasons why the exemption applies, the
section of the Act that allows the exemption, and the specific subsections of the Privacy Act
from which the system is to be exempted, with justification for each subsection.
10.4. Exemptions. Exemptions       permissible      under    Title    5     are    located     at
http://uscode.house.gov/search/criteria.shtml:
   10.4.1. The (j) (2) exemption. Applies to investigative records created and maintained by
   law-enforcement activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement.
   10.4.2. The (k) (1) exemption. Applies to information specifically authorized to be
   classified according to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4.
   10.4.3. The (k) (2) exemption. Applies to investigatory information compiled for law-
   enforcement purposes by non-law enforcement activities and which is not within the scope of
   the (j) (2) exemption. However, the AF must allow an individual access to any record that is
   used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled by
   Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance
   of the information (unless doing so would reveal a confidential source).
   10.4.4. The (k) (3) exemption. Applies to records maintained in connection with providing
   protective services to the President and other individuals under Title 18; Crimes and Criminal
   Procedure, USC, section 3056; Powers, authorities, and duties of United States Secret
   Service.
   10.4.5. The (k) (4) exemption. Applies to records maintained solely for statistical research
   or program evaluation purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the rights,
   benefits, or entitlement of an individual except for census records which may be disclosed
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                        43


  under Title 13, CENSUS, U.S.C., Section 8; Authenticated transcripts or copies of certain
  returns; other data; restriction on use; disposition of fees received.

                                 PRIVACY ACT TRAINING

11.1. Who Needs Training. The Privacy Act requires that all DoD and pertinent contractor
personnel involved in the design, development, operation and maintenance of any SOR be
trained annually in the principles and requirements of the Privacy Act; personnel who may be
expected to deal with the news media or the public, as well as personnel specialists, finance
officers, knowledge operations managers, supervisors, and individuals working with medical,

Terms
Access—Allowing individuals to review or receive copies of government records that contain
personally identifiable information about them.
Amendment—The process of adding, deleting, or changing information in a SOR to make the
data accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.
Alteration—A significant increase or change in the number or type of individuals about whom
records are maintained. Increases in numbers of individuals due to normal growth are not
considered alterations unless they truly alter the character and purpose of the system. Increases
that change significantly the scope of population covered (for example, expansion of a SOR
covering a single command’s enlisted personnel to include all of the Component’s enlisted
personnel would be considered an alteration). A reduction in the number of individuals covered
is not an alteration, but only an amendment. Changes that add new categories of individuals to
system coverage require a change to the “Categories of individuals covered by the system”
caption of the notice and may require changes to the “Purpose(s)” caption.
Biometric—Physiological and/or behavioral characteristics that are measurable

                                    RISK ASSESSMENT

A5.1. Risk Notification. Five factors are used when determining if an agency is required to
notify those who may have been affected by a PII breach. Agencies should take the time to
determine the risk of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness surrounding the breach.
The factors used in assessing the likely risk of harm are:
   A5.1.1. Nature of Data Elements Breached. Consider context of the data involved and the
   potential harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness that might be generated by its
   exposure to unauthorized individuals.
   A5.1.2. Number of Individuals Affected. The magnitude of the number of individuals
   affected may determine how they will be notified, but should not impact an agency’s
   decision to provide notification.
   A5.1.3. Likelihood the Information is Accessible and Useable. Upon discovery of a breach,
   agencies should assess the likelihood the personally identifiable information has been or will
   be used by unauthorized individuals. The greater the risk that the information may be used
   unlawfully should influence an agency’s decision to provide notification to the individual(s).
   A5.1.4. Likelihood the breach may lead to harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or
   unfairness to an individual.
       A5.1.4.1. Broad Reach of Potential Harm, Embarrassment, Inconvenience or
       Unfairness. Consider the possible harm associated with the loss or compromise of the
       PII, i.e., loss of self- esteem, mental pain or emotional stress.
       A5.1.4.2. Likelihood Harm, Embarrassment, Inconvenience or Unfairness Will
       Occur. Agencies must determine the type of data has been compromised and the manner
       the breach occurred.
   A5.1.5. Ability of the Agencies to Mitigate the Risk of Harm, Embarrassment,
   Inconvenience or Unfairness. In addition to containing the breach, agencies must
   determine what countermeasures will be used to prevent further compromise of the system’s
   PII.

              PREPARING A DOD SSN JUSTIFICATION MEMORANDUM

MEMORANDUM THRU AIR FORCE PRIVACY OFFICE, SAF/A6PPF

FOR DIRECTOR FOR PRIVACY, DPCLO

SUBJECT: Justification for the Use of the Social Security Number (SSN)

       The memorandum should begin by naming the DITPR number of the IT system and/or
form that is the subject of the justification. The description must be sufficiently detailed so that
someone unfamiliar with the system can grasp the general understanding of its intent.

        The justification for the use of the SSN must include a reference to the SSN Instruction
Use Case that is being used to justify the use of the SSN. If the justification does not fall under
either the operational necessity use case or the legacy system interface use case, then the
justification shall also include the specific reference to the law that requires the use of the SSN
and why it is applicable to the use being justified.

        Reference is made to the system or form supporting documentation, including but not
limited to, System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Paperwork
Reduction Act (PRA) notice, or any other documentation that may be appropriate. If the
substance of the documentation is not attached, reference is made to how the reader may gain
access to this documentation.

        Justification for the use of the SSN does not constitute blanket permission to use the SSN.
Specific reference shall be made to indicate actions being taken to reduce the vulnerability of
SSNs, which may include indicating where SSNs are being removed from transactions, where
SSNs are no longer displayed, or any other protections that have been included. It should be
obvious to the reader that a thorough effort has been made to evaluate the risk associated with
the system or form and that every reasonable step has been or is being taken to reduce the use of
the SSN and protect it where the use is still required.

       If the justification for the use of the SSN falls under the “legacy use” authorization and is
not specifically required by the law, reference shall be made to the Plan of Actions and
Milestones for the elimination of the use of the SSN.

                EXAMPLE PRIVACY BREACH NOTIFICATION LETTER

OFFICIAL LETTERHEAD

Dear Mr. John Miller:

        On January 1, 2006, a DoD laptop computer was stolen from the parked car of a DoD
employee in Washington, D.C. after normal duty hours while the employee was running a
personal errand. The laptop contained personally identifying information on 100 DoD
employees who were participating in the xxx Program. The compromised information is the
name, social security number, residential address, date of birth, office and home e-mail address,
office, and home telephone numbers of the Program participants.

       The theft was immediately reported to local and DoD law enforcement authorities, who
are now conducting a joint inquiry into the loss.

        We believe that the laptop was the target of the theft as opposed to any information that
the laptop might contain. Because the information in the laptop was password protected and
encrypted, we also believe that the probability is low that the information will be acquired and
used for an unlawful purpose. However, we cannot say with certainty that this might not occur.
We therefore believe that you should consider taking such actions to protect yourself against the
potential that someone might use the information to steal your identity.

        You should be guided by the actions recommended by the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) on its Web site at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert. The FTC
urges that you to immediately place an initial fraud alert on your credit file. The fraud alert is for
a period of 90 days, during which, creditors are required to contact you before a new credit card
is issued or an existing card changed. The site also provides other valuable information that can
be taken now or in the future if problems should develop.

        The Department of Defense takes this loss very seriously and is reviewing its current
policies and practices with a view of determining what must be changed to preclude a similar
occurrence in the future. At a minimum, we will be providing additional training to personnel to
ensure that they understand that personally identifiable information must at all times be treated in
a manner that preserves and protects the confidentiality of the data.

       We deeply regret and apologize for any inconvenience and concern this theft may cause
you.

       Should you have any questions, please call ____________________.

                                               Sincerely,
                                               Signature Block

                               NATIONAL COMPLAINT VIGNETTES

Disclaimer: Vignettes are provided for the instructional purpose of teaching how to identify Civil Liberties related
issues only. They do not reflect official policies or positions of the Department of Defense.

1. Religion.

a. Scenario: During the work day, a military unit attended a religious themed movie at the base
theater. Members were given the choice of watching the movie or cleaning the barracks while the
unit watched the movie. A week later a member of the unit submitted a complaint. In his
complaint, he said he chose to watch the movie because he viewed cleaning the barracks as
punishment, but now he feels like his religious freedom was violated. He does not think a
punishment, like cleaning the barracks, should be an alternative to watching a religious themed
movie.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: First Amendment; Freedom of Religion. A service member should not
be punished for participating or not participating in a religious activity. If the service member's
belief that he faced a punishment for not attending the movie is accurate, his unit leadership
should be counseled about the necessity of allowing for unit member religious freedom without
the threat of punishment.

2. Social Media Use & Operational Security.

a. Scenario: A deployed service member posted a photograph on Facebook. The caption
indicated that his team had just returned from a patrol, and the date/time stamp on the photo
showed exactly when it was taken. The service member’s chain of command told him to take
down the photograph, to protect operational security. However, the service member stated that he
was using his personal Facebook account, during his personal time (not while on duty), and not
claiming to represent or speak for the military.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech/Expression. While individuals have a right to
express themselves through online social media outlets, such expression must not compromise
operational security. DTM 09-026, “Responsible and Effective Use of Internet-based
Capabilities,” Attachment 2, section 5, states that “when accessing Internet-based capabilities
using Federal Government resources in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals
shall employ sound operations security (OPSEC) measures.” Other regulations, like the “Joint
Ethics Regulation and the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive
Branch,” prohibit the release of non-public information, require appropriate disclaimers of
opinions being expressed, and restrict the use of government computers to access and to manage
personal sites during official duty time.

3. Service Members’ Political Involvement.
AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         71


a. Scenario: An active-duty service member placed a bumper sticker on his privately owned
vehicle. The chain of command told the service member to remove the sticker, but the service
member refused, citing his Constitutional right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech/Expression/Assembly (to the extent that
showcasing one’s political affiliation constitutes assembly). In keeping with the traditional
concept that service members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and
that service members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities
imply or appear to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement, the military may
regulate service members’ participation in political activities. According to DoDD1344.10, Sec
4.1.1.8. “A member of the Armed Forces on active duty may: display a political bumper sticker
on the member’s private vehicle.” In this case, the Directive regulating such participation allows
the service member to display the bumper sticker. Unit leadership should be counseled about
DoD policies regulating service members’ participation in political activities.

4. Search and Seizure.

a. Scenario: A DoD civilian, employed at a CONUS Air Force base, was randomly selected to
have his vehicle searched at the gate. The gate guard inspected the engine compartment, exterior
and undercarriage of the vehicle, and the interior of the vehicle, including the glove box and
consoles. The employee submitted a complaint to the base Civil Liberties Officer, alleging that a
search of the glove box and consoles was excessive and unreasonable.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: Right to be Secure against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures.
Installation commanders issue regulations for the protection and security of property or places
under their command. The search followed established procedures for vehicle searches, per
guidance provided in Air Force Instruction 31-204 “Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic
Supervision.” In evaluating this type of case, consider whether a command authorizes the search
of glove boxes and consoles. For example, the AFI instructs officials conducting searches of
vehicles entering a military installation to “look under all seats, under/behind dash, glove box,
consoles, visors, ashtrays and any packages and briefcases.”

5. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell – With Speech/Religion Implications.

a. Scenario: A service member speaks with a friend, informally on base, about the repeal of
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. The service member, consistent with her religion, expressed opposition to
homosexuality. The service member’s senior overheard comments and told her to stop
expressing these views on base. The service member filed a Civil Liberties complaint, alleging
that her freedom of speech/religion was violated when she was told to stop expressing her
religious views on base.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech/Religion. Service members may express moral or
religious beliefs, so long as service members do NOT make statements detrimental to good order
and discipline, and so long as service members obey lawful orders. Whether or not the service
member’s Civil Liberties were, in fact, violated is dependent upon whether or not her comments
fall within the constraints articulated in the guidance above.
 72                                        AFI33-332_HILLAFBSUP_I 13 FEBRUARY 2014



6. Carrying Privately Owned Weapons on Military Installations.

a. Scenario: Service member living in family housing aboard a Marine Corps base is required to
report to the Provost Marshall that she possesses a firearm and stores it at her home. The service
member filed a complaint with the Civil Liberties POC arguing that the Provost Marshall should
not be keeping records on how she exercises her right to keep and bear arms.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: Right to Keep and Bear Arms. In reviewing the service member's
complaint, consider whether the PM's requirement to report the firearm is authorized by a base
order or other regulation.

7. Civilian Employment Complaint.

a. Scenario: A DoD civilian supervisor typically allows overtime for all employees who
volunteer. However, a civilian employee in that office submitted a complaint, alleging that he
has not been allowed to work overtime because the supervisor saw him at an anti-war protest on
a Saturday last year. His complaint letter alleged that because his supervisor will not allow him
to work overtime, his Civil Liberties are being violated.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: Right to Due Process. His complaint about not being allowed to work
overtime, when other workers are encouraged to work overtime, could be a recognized employee
grievance. Direct him to consider the use of his agency's existing employee grievance process.

8. Member of Public, Pentagon Protests, and Suspicious Activity Reporting.

a. Scenario: A member of the public attended a protest at the Pentagon. He followed all rules
and procedures governing the protest, including not making threatening statements or displaying
threatening behavior, and complied with instructions from Pentagon Police Officers. The
individual submitted a complaint alleging that a civilian employee, employed at the Pentagon,
asked each of the protestors to identify themselves and subsequently stated that he was going to
identify them in a suspicious activity report, due to their participation in the protest.

b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech, Peaceable Assembly. Consider whether the Privacy
Act of 1974 is implicated by the Pentagon employee’s actions. According to the Privacy Act (5
U.S.C. § 552a(e)(7)), “no information shall be maintained on how an individual exercises rights
protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, including the
freedoms of speech, assembly, press and religion, except as follows:

       i. When specifically authorized by statute.
       ii. When expressly authorized by the individual, group of individuals, or
       association on whom the record is maintained.
       iii. When the record is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law
       enforcement activity.”

              CIVIL LIBERTIES COMPLAINT REPORT INSTRUCTIONS

Introduction
Section 803 of Public Law 110-53 requires the Department to report its Civil Liberties activities
to Congress. In order to comply with that requirement, each DoD Component must submit a
quarterly report to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office (DPCLO). DPCLO will
consolidate Component data and submit the Department's reports to Congress.
Component reports must include the following:

       (1) The number and nature of Civil Liberties complaints received; and
       (2) A summary of the disposition of such complaints.

Quarterly reports are due by the 10th day of the month following the closing of each fiscal year
quarter to the AF Civil Liberties POC: afcivil.Liberties@pentagon.af.mil.

Component Points of Contact (POCs) Reporting Responsibilities
POCs are responsible for establishing procedures to report Civil Liberties complaints for their
entire Component.

To ensure the Department is accurately accounting for and addressing Civil Liberties complaints,
Component reporting procedures should capture Civil Liberties complaints that may be received
by offices such as the Inspector General (IG), Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), and Labor
Management Employee Relations (LMER). Component reporting procedures should also ensure
that there is no duplicate reporting within the Component.
