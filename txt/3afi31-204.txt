ers or in accomplishing necessary documentation.

    tration and disposal of concession vehicles are effectively controlled and that the privileges accorded
    under this arrangement are not abused.

vices, assigned within the UK, and their dependents. They also apply to the American Red Cross (ARC)

are entitled to diplomatic privileges are also excluded.

     2.2.9.2. The color has faded or the figures on it cannot be read. Completion of the form is
     self-explanatory.
  2.2.10. Single Vehicle Approval Test Certificate. Owners of any non-European Union (EU) specifica-
  tion vehicles imported into the UK, less than three (3) years of age, are required to have them offi-
  cially inspected to ensure they are properly adapted for use within the UK. For US Force personnel
  only, a special one-time inspection and provisional Ministry of Transport (MoT) certificate is obtain-
  able from approved UK and visiting forces garages for a fee. A list of these garages can be obtained
  from the vehicle registrar’s office. Upon successful completion of the inspection, the garage will issue
10                                                                           3AFI31-204 10 MARCH 2005


     a provisional MoT certificate over-stamped with the vehicle inspectorate (VI) and DTLR logos and
     the statement VISITING FORCES PROVISIONS NEW VEHICLE. This certificate identifies the
     vehicle as a visiting forces vehicle and certifies the vehicle is properly adapted for use within the UK.
     Except for the visiting forces exemption, it is a legal requirement that vehicles meet EU specifications,
     or be “type approved”, and undergo a VI inspection before they can be used on the roads in the UK.
     The UK DTLR and Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders have agreed on a code of practice for
     dealing with applications for “type approval” certification of foreign passenger vehicles. For addi-
     tional inquiries and guidance on the VI inspection procedure and standards, or to obtain a copy of the
     Inspection Manual, contact the Vehicle Inspectorate, 91/92 The Strand, Swansea, SA1 2DH.
     2.2.11. MoT Certificate. A UK MoT safety inspection certificate is required for all vehicles that are
     over three (3) years old. The test and certificate can be obtained at any authorized British garage for a
     fee. The MoT inspection is mandatory annually for vehicles imported under any scheme and are over
     three (3) years old. The age of the vehicles is determined from the date of first registration shown on
     the registration document. If the vehicle was not new when first registered, the age is determined from
     the end of the year of manufacture.
     2.2.12. It is an offense to use any vehicle that is subject to this test on the public roads unless a valid
     test certificate is in force.

2.3. Accountability. Control over the acquisition and disposal of concession vehicles, except for scrap,
total loss, termination of entitlement and payment of revenue, is vested in the 100 SFS/SFOXI. Strict con-
trol over all concession vehicle transactions must be maintained by the 100 SFS/SFOXI and at each
USAF, USA, and USN installation in the UK. See paragraph 2.5. for tracking procedures.

2.4. Automated Support. Installation commanders, through the Chief, Security Forces or Provost Mar-
shal, are responsible for obtaining computer support for on-base or geographically separated agencies.
Support will consist of training computer operators as needed, technical advice to operators and periodic
use (daily, weekly, etc.) of computer equipment.

2.5. Tracking and Automated Procedures. Vehicle registrar offices located within the UK, governed
by this instruction and responsible to the 100 SFS/SFOXI, will comply with following tracking and auto-
mated procedures to ensure the systematic flow of vehicle records to satisfy HMCE and DTLR require-
ments:
     2.5.1. Ensure the vehicle owner completes and signs the USAFE Form 3, Drivers License/Vehicle
     Registration Application. The vehicle registrar maintains the signed USAFE Form 3 on file until no
     longer applicable (PCS, vehicle owner deregisters vehicles, etc.).
        2.5.1.1. The signed USAFE Form 3 gives implied consent to a chemical test of blood, breath, or
        urine for the purpose of determining the drug, alcohol content of blood if cited, requested or law-
        fully apprehended for an offense allegedly committed while in actual physical control of a motor
        vehicle or driving on the installation under the influence of any intoxicants, drugs or alcohol.
        Refusal to submit to such a chemical test will result in suspension, revocation of driving privi-
        leges, as further detailed in service motor vehicle operation regulations.
        2.5.1.2. The signed USAFE Form 3 also certifies that all information entered on the USAFE Form
        3 in section II is the truth to the best of the vehicle owner’s knowledge. By signing, the vehicle
3AFI31-204 10 MARCH 2005                                                                              11


     applicant also understands that entering false information could result in administrative or disci-
     plinary actions or denial of a US Forces driving license, permit or vehicle registration privileges.
  2.5.2. Use information from the USAFE Form 3 to update a computer-based program in the vehicle
  registrar offices. In order to be able to update 100 SFS/SFOXI, vehicle registrar offices will use a
  compatible computer-based program to record all vehicle information.
  2.5.3. At a minimum, the computer program vehicle file will contain the following fields:
     2.5.3.1. Vehicle owner’s full name, rank, SSAN, squadron, and five-digit APO number.
     2.5.3.2. Vehicle’s year, color, make, model, type (sedan, convertible, pick-up, van, etc.), and cur-
     rent license plate number (update license plate number when UK plates are issued).
     2.5.3.3. Vehicle classification code. If the space provides, use plain text or the following numeric
     digits which match HMCE and DVLA records:
         2.5.3.3.1. 00 - Tax free vehicle (concession)
         2.5.3.3.2. 66 - Vehicle entered on transfer of residence scheme
         2.5.3.3.3. 77 - Vehicle is off-the-road (non-operational)
         2.5.3.3.4. 99 - Vehicle is tax paid.
         2.5.3.3.5. 33 - Personal export provisions.
     2.5.3.4. Port of Entry (POE). City, town in which the vehicle entered the country. This port will be
     indicated on the HMCE stamp located on the HMCE Form 941. For repossessed vehicles or vehi-
     cles purchased from the Credit Union, use POE Code 999.
     2.5.3.5. Vehicle Acquisition Date. Use the date on the HMCE Form 941 on which the vehicle
     cleared into the UK. If acquired on a 3 AF Form 301, use the date of the transaction on the form.
     2.5.3.6. Vehicle Registration Date. The date the vehicle was permanently registered at the vehicle
     registrar office through the DVLA.
     2.5.3.7. The 3 AF Form 26 Number. Issued when vehicle is permanently registered.

                                                 Chapter 3

      CUSTOMS: INCIDENT TO IMPORT/ACQUISITION OF CONCESSION VEHICLES

3.1. General. Entitled persons are permitted to acquire, free of UK customs duty, VAT, and VED, motor
vehicles for their private use and the use of their dependents, and to replace such vehicles with further
concession vehicles.

3.2. Entitlements. Single, unaccompanied personnel, who are members of the USAF, USA, USN,
USMC, or members of the civilian components of these services or DOD, are authorized to own and oper-
ate not more than one concession vehicle. Personnel who are accompanied by a dependent spouse, irre-
spective of command sponsorship, may own and operate not more than two concession vehicles. These
restrictions may be waived by HMCE for temporary periods not to exceed 30 days to allow entitled per-
sons to purchase or dispose of other concession vehicles. If military personnel are married to another mil-
itary member, each military member may own, operate one concession vehicle.
     3.2.1. Base vehicle registrar offices will examine each application to acquire a concession vehicle and
     verify the applicants’ eligibility. When necessary, they will contact the local MPF, Central Civilian
     Personnel Office (CCPO), or the applicant’s squadron commander to verify status.
     3.2.2. Concession vehicles imported by entitled persons will be exempt, subject to certain conditions,
     from vehicle excise duty (road tax) for a period not to exceed 12 months from the date of first regis-
     tration with UK authorities. This exemption cannot be transferred with the vehicle if sold within the
     12-month period. The exemption is not affected by the date the entitled person arrived in the UK or
     the number of concession vehicles the individual may import or purchase during his or her tour. At the
     end of the exemption period, the procedures outlined in para 4.4. apply.

3.3. Importation Incident to PCS. All concessions vehicles imported into the UK incident to a PCS
will be declared at the port of entry via HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156). It is essential that these forms
be completed correctly as a false declaration constitutes a serious violation of UK customs laws. Entitled
persons will personally appear at the base vehicle registrar office to complete these forms. Concession
vehicles may be imported unaccompanied by the owner (i.e. shipped to a port by the US Government) or
accompanied by the owner (driven into a port). Only where an entitled person drives a vehicle through a
UK Port incident to a PCS will it be admitted or registered without a base authorization duly signed on the
HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156). In all other cases, the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) will be
authenticated by the base registrar or his or her designated representative before the importation of the
concession vehicle.
     3.3.1. Unaccompanied Vehicles. Four copies of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) will be com-
     pleted at the base vehicle registrar office. When the vehicle is customs cleared, the port of entry noti-
     fies the owner. At the port of entry, the owner will be asked to produce a valid USAFE Form 374,
     USAFE Drivers Permit, ID card, and a certificate of UK Insurance. Once the vehicle has been pro-
     cessed, the owner receives the vehicle and one copy of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156). The
     remaining copies are sent to HMCE, Nottingham, England. HMCE retains one copy and forwards the
     last copy to the 100 SFS/SFOXI. The 100 SFS/SFOXI will update the database and dispose of the 3
     AF Form 941 as appropriate. The vehicle owner will, within 72 hours of importation, register the
     vehicle at his or her base of assignment (see Chapter 4) and retain his or her copy of the HMCE Form
3AFI31-204 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                 13


   941 (3 AF Form 156) for presentation to the Vehicle Registration Office (VRO) to complete UK reg-
   istration.
   3.3.2. Accompanied Vehicles. Personnel assigned PCS to the UK, normally as a result of a Consecu-
   tive Overseas Tour (COT) from the continent, routinely import their vehicle in person into the UK.
   Military travel orders and a current DD Form 2, Identification Card, allows vehicle entry into the UK
   pending completion of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) at the gaining Pass and Registration
   office. The base vehicle registrar will stamp all copies of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) and
   return one to the applicant. The base vehicle registrar will mail the remaining two copies to HMCE,
   Nottingham, England. HMCE will retain one copy and forward the last copy to the 100 SFS/SFOXI
   for processing. The applicant will, within 72 hours of importation, register the vehicle at his or her
   base of assignment (see Chapter 4) and retain his, her copy of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156)
   for presentation to the VRO, Peterborough.

3.4. Importation Incident to Purchase Abroad. As with a vehicle imported incident to PCS, new con-
cession vehicles purchased abroad may be imported either unaccompanied or accompanied.
   3.4.1. Unaccompanied Vehicles. Entitled persons may import a new vehicle ordered through a dealer
   or concessionaire acting as import agent. The agent will make all arrangements for obtaining UK reg-
   istration. The HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) will be obtained from the base vehicle registrar
   office upon presentation of a properly completed purchase order. The customs officer will surrender
   the vehicle and one copy of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) to the agent for delivery to the
   applicant, mailing the other two copies to HMCE, Nottingham, England. HMCE will retain one copy
   and forward the last to the 100 SFS/SFOXI for processing and filing. The applicant will, within 72
   hours after delivery of the vehicle from the agent, register the vehicle at his or her base of assignment
   (see Chapter 4) and retain his or her copy of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) for presentation
   to the TMO when exporting the vehicle Concessions will not be applied to new vehicles ordered,
   delivered from the UK stock of any agent. Vehicles must be imported in the name of the applicant on
   HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156).
   3.4.2. Accompanied Vehicles. Four copies of HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) will be completed
   by the local base vehicle registrar. One copy of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) will be
   retained, pending registration of the vehicle and the other three given to the applicant. The agent will
   arrange with the factory to have the vehicle registered and have the appropriate registration plates
   mounted. The applicant will obtain an insurance “Green Card” and ensure three copies of the HMCE
   Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) are in his or her possession when he or she travels abroad to pick up the
   new vehicle. On return, the applicant will present the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) to the base
   vehicle registrar, who will stamp all copies and return one to the applicant. The base vehicle registrar
   will mail the remaining two copies to HMCE, Nottingham, England. HMCE will retain one copy and
   forward the last copy to the 100 SFS/SFOXI for processing. The applicant will, within 72 hours of
   importation, register the vehicle at his or her base of assignment (see Chapter 4) and retain his, her
   copy of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) for presentation to the VRO, Peterborough.
   3.4.3. New Means of Transport (NMT) only applies to individuals who are not covered by the visiting
   forces concession. NMT is a term that applies to non-concession vehicles bought from a EU country
   and imported into the UK. These vehicles may be subject to customs duty and VAT in addition to the
   taxes already levied on the vehicle when purchased. Only if the vehicle is over 6 months of age and
   has traveled under it’s own power for 6,000 kilometers will relief from VAT be granted upon import.
14                                                                           3AFI31-204 10 MARCH 2005


     Vehicle registrars will be familiar with the specific guidelines for UK taxation of NMT vehicles in
     HMCE VAT Notice 728. Vehicle registrars will differentiate and identify vehicles to the DVLA by
     endorsing the Form V55/5 in the bottom right hand corner with “NMT - VF” (New Means of Trans-
     port - Visiting Forces) or “Non-NMT - VF” (Non-New Means of Transport - Visiting Forces), as
     appropriate.

3.5. Purchase of British Manufactured Tax-Free Vehicles. Five copies of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF
Form 156) will be completed by the base vehicle registrar office upon presentation of a properly com-
pleted purchase order. The base vehicle registrar office will retain one copy pending registration of the
vehicle. The applicant will give the remaining four copies to the agent arranging the purchase. The agent
will forward all copies, together with an application for authority to release the vehicle free of VAT and
car tax, to HMCE. The entitled person will, within 72 hours of receipt of the vehicle and HMCE Form 941
(3 AF Form 156) from the agent, register the vehicle at his, her base of assignment (see Chapter 4). UK
manufactured vehicles will be UK registered and allocated UK license numbers and registration docu-
ment (V-5).
     3.5.1. If, prior to delivery of the concession vehicle, either the entitled person or the agent cancels the
     purchase order, then the entitled person will:
        3.5.1.1. Obtain a letter from the agent indicating that the vehicle was not delivered or otherwise
        taken possession of by the entitled person.
        3.5.1.2. Prepare a letter indicating that he or she did not accept delivery of the vehicle.
        3.5.1.3. Submit the letters to the base vehicle registrar office.
     3.5.2. The base vehicle registrar will forward the letters to 100 SFS/SFOXI or UK Customs Admin-
     istration as applicable for cancellation of the transaction. If the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Forms 156) is
     recoverable, it will also be returned.

3.6. Transactions between Entitled Persons. Entitled persons may acquire concession vehicles from
other entitled persons through purchase, exchange, or transfer of ownership. Procedures for such transac-
tions are outlined in para 5.5.

3.7. Purchase of a Vehicle from the US Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO). Applica-
tion for purchase of a vehicle from DRMO will be prepared on a HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156) in
four copies fully describing the vehicle to be purchased. The vehicle registrar will enter the following
statement in the “declaration” section: “THIS VEHICLE IS TO BE PURCHASED FROM THE US
DEFENSE PROPERTY DISPOSAL OFFICE”. The applicant will hand carry the approved form to the
US DRMO when purchase is desired. The purchaser will complete UK and base registration requirements
within 72 hours of release of the vehicle from the DRMO.

3.8. Civilian Component Stamps. For civilian component members applying for an AF Form 301 or
requesting a HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156), base vehicle registrars must ascertain if the member
applied and the date the member applied for the civilian component stamp.
     3.8.1. If the individual has not applied, direct him, her to the appropriate personnel office before issu-
     ing AF Forms 301 or HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156).
3AFI31-204 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                15


   3.8.2. If the individual has applied, contact the appropriate personnel office, verify the application
   and that the individual is in-fact entitled to concession vehicles.
   3.8.3. After verifying entitlement, type the following in section 34 of the 3 AF Form 301 or part “C”
   of the HMCE Form 941 (3 AF Form 156):
    “(Individual’s full name) has applied for a civilian component stamp on (date). Entitlement verified
   by (Personnel Office -- Individual’s name, Organization, and Duty Phone). (Name of Applicant) will
   present to the base vehicle registrar their passport with civilian component stamp upon receipt.” The

               REGISTRATION OF VEHICLES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK)

4.1. General. Registration with the base vehicle registrar office is mandatory upon import of a vehicle
and must be initiated NLT 3 duty days after the vehicle has cleared the port of entry or been receipted for
at the POV Compound after clearance. Failure to properly register and, or continued operation of vehicles
on other than UK license plates can result in disciplinary action under the UCMJ and by UK authorities.
     4.1.1. Concession vehicles will be registered in the name of the entitled person only. In situations
     where both husband and wife are entitled (i.e., either military or members of the civilian component),
     each may register a concession vehicle independent of the other. This does not authorize an increase
     in the total number of concession vehicles allowed (see paragraph 3.2.)
     4.1.2. The vehicle owner will have the registration plates made at his or her expense. Vehicle owners
     would be advised to await the “exempt” road tax disk (the vehicle owner is exempt from paying road
     tax for the first 12 months) to verify the vehicle license number prior to having the plates made up.
     The plates and the “exempt” tax disk will be mounted on the vehicle simultaneously. The disk is
     mounted on the inside lower left corner of the windscreen. Plates are mounted on the front and rear of
     the vehicle.
     4.1.3. If the vehicle owner wishes not to tax the vehicle because it is not kept on a public road, com-
     plete a Form V890, SORN, and return it to the DVLA. The requirement to make a SORN declaration
     only applies to vehicles for which a tax disc is in force on or after 31 January 1998.

cal repair can be released to an insurance company as a total loss provided the proper coverage was in
force and compensation is received for the vehicle.
     5.7.1. If the entitled person is covered by fully comprehensive insurance, he or she will obtain a letter
     from the parent insurance company (not the broker or agent who sells the policy) stating that the
     insurer accepts responsibility for the payment of any customs revenue for the vehicle. The letter must
     contain the policy number, a statement that the insurer will pay assessed revenue and all particulars on
     the insured. The owner may then accept total payment for the loss from the insurer and release the

        base vehicle registrar office.
     5.7.2. If the entitled person is covered by third party liability only, the insurer will not entertain a

     beyond economical repair.
     5.7.3. According to British law, individuals in part or full payments as part of an insurance settlement
     will not accept damaged concession vehicles. The insurance company must collect the remains of a
     vehicle from a “total loss” claim. In certain cases where third party insurance companies are involved
     in payment for damaged concession vehicles, HMCE will consider allowing the entitled individual to
     retain the vehicle remains and dispose of same in accordance with this instruction. In order for the
     individual to retain the remains of a vehicle, the individual will have to complete a written request to
     do so. The request will be forwarded to the 100 SFS/SFOXI by the vehicle registrar at the base con-
     cerned.

necessary to clear the vehicle from the 100 SFS/SFOXI. Vehicle stripped of parts (engine, transmission,
wheels, etc.) will not be accepted for release to DRMO. Should an entitled person attempt to relinquish
3AFI31-204 10 MARCH 2005                                                                                  27

be completed according to para 5.12.
   5.8.1. Applicants will prepare a DD Form 1348-1, Release Document for Unclaimed Property, in
   four copies, completely identifying the vehicle to be abandoned. The original and one copy of the
   form will be delivered to the disposal officer or the collecting agency as applicable. One copy will be
   retained by the base vehicle registrar office and the remaining copy by the vehicle owner. Upon final
   disposition, one copy of the form and the registration document (registered in the applicant’s name)
   will be forwarded to the 100 SFS/SFOXI.
   5.8.2. The base disposal officer or collecting agency will accomplish the following statement on the
   DD Form 1348-1: “THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN RECEIVED FOR ABANDONMENT IAW THE
   APPLICABLE INSTRUCTION”.

5.9. Repossession. In cases involving repossession of a concession vehicle by a creditor (bank, credit
union, etc.), the creditor will notify the base vehicle registrar office within 24 hours and HMCE of the
action. Once the base vehicle registrar office at the base concerned receives required notification of repos-
session and has forwarded the documentation to the 100 SFS/SFOXI, then the matter of repossession
becomes one between HMCE and the agency that repossessed the vehicle. An agreement exists between
HMCE and the Keesler Federal Credit Union (KFCU). In this agreement, should the KFCU find a mem-
ber of the US visiting forces who wishes to purchase the vehicle, the base vehicle registrar office will ini-
tiate four copies of 3 AF Form 301, Vehicle Transfer Request. KFCU will be listed as the seller. The lower
portion will reflect the new buyer’s information. The base vehicle registrar office will retain one copy of
the 3 AF Form 301 and forward the remaining three to the 100 SFS/SFOXI for onward transmission to
and action by HMCE. The proposed entitled buyer will not take possession of the vehicle until the 3 AF
Form 301 has been approved by HMCE.

5.10. Disposal upon Death of an Entitled Person. A duly appointed summary court officer may dis-
pose of concession vehicles of deceased persons according to this instruction.

   the form of a POA. Once approval is received, the summary court officer will take action to clear the
   vehicle from the 100 SFS/SFOXI records by completing one of the disposal actions outlined in this
   chapter. Base vehicle registrar offices may approve this transaction. A copy of the POA will be for-
   warded to the 100 SFS/SFOXI with the completed transaction documents.
   5.10.2. If a will is provided dealing with the disposition of the deceased estate, the summary court
   officer is authorized to complete the concession vehicle clearance directly with the 100 SFS/SFOXI.

   Customs Notice No. 368, which authorizes relief from duty and tax on inherited goods if the widow is
   remaining in the UK.

5.11. Theft of Concession Vehicle. In cases involving theft of a concession vehicle, security forces and
civil police will be notified not later than 24 hours from the discovery of the theft. If the vehicle is not

5.12. Irregular Disposal. A concession vehicle will be considered as an irregular disposal, abandoned,
or unclaimed in the event it comes into the possession, custody or control of any military service or DoD
agency other than voluntary release to the US DRMO by the owner at any installation in the UK through
loss, theft, etc. and is unclaimed by the owner. Such property, however, will not be considered legally
abandoned until all efforts have been made to locate the owner, or next of kin, or legal representative in
accordance with pertinent and applicable directives. If unclaimed, the vehicle will be turned in to the US
DRMO.
     5.12.1. An irregular disposal occurs when an entitled person sells a vehicle to an unentitled person
     (e.g. , a British national), or in some other manner contrary to this regulation. Refer to para 5.1.1.
     regarding administrative hold requirements for this offense.
     5.12.2. When an irregular disposal is discovered, the base vehicle registrar office will complete 3 AF
     Form 5 in triplicate. One is retained on file and the remainders are forwarded to the 100 SFS/SFOXI.
     One copy will be sent to HMCE Nottingham for revenue assessment. A charge letter will be for-
     warded to the owner through the 100 SFS/SFOXI to the base vehicle registrar office concerned. The
     owner will mail payment (certified check or postal money orders) in the pre-addressed envelope
     within 30 days of receipt. HMCE will process the payment and forward a receipt and CE Form 386 to
     the owner through the 100 SFS/SFOXI to the individual’s base vehicle registrar office. This will con-
     stitute proof that vehicle is no longer a tax-free unit.

5.13. Powers of Attorney (POA). POA’s are authorized in the following situations:
     5.13.1. Cases involving the death of an entitled person (see para 5.10.).
     5.13.2. Cases involving emergency PCS. In these cases, concession vehicle owners may appoint an
     attorney-in-fact and execute a POA authorizing the appointee to take necessary and permissible
     actions to dispose of any concession vehicle. Owners should be cautioned that while a POA gives the
     authority to dispose of a vehicle in the owner’s stead, it does not give the appointee the responsibility
     to do so. The ultimate responsibility rests with the vehicle owner.
     5.13.3. Base vehicle registrar office can accept POA’s in cases involving 5.13.1. and 5.13.2. Anytime
     a POA is accepted, the base vehicle registrar office will forward a copy of the POA with any transac-
     tion documents to the 100 SFS/SFOXI.

5.14. Emergency or Unusual Situations. When an emergency or unusual situation arises regarding the
disposal of concession vehicles, the owner of the vehicles must accomplish a 3 AF Form 301 transaction
using the following guidelines:
     5.14.1. If the seller (owner) of the vehicle has departed the country and still has concession vehicle in
     their name, they must accomplish a POA for an individual to deal with the situation. If the individual
     who has the POA does not have their entire entitlement of concession vehicles, they must register the
     vehicle in their name via the 3 AF Form 301 and the Departments of Transport V-5. They are then the
     legal keeper of the vehicle and must meet the mandatory conditions identified in para 6.2.4. The
     keeper of the vehicle must accomplish the 3 AF Form 301 transfer and V-5 actions within 3 duty days
     of receiving the POA.
     5.14.2. If the individual possessing the POA to deal with the vehicle already has their full entitlement
     of concession vehicles, the same procedure applies except the vehicle may only be operated to dem-
3AFI31-204 10 MARCH 2005                                                                             29


  onstrate it’s operability to a potential buyer. The vehicle must meet all UK DVLA requirements
  spelled out in Chapter 4, this instruction, for operation.
  5.14.3. If an entitled person cannot dispose of their concession vehicle prior to their departure from
  the UK, they must accomplish one of the disposal methods for concession vehicles as outlined in para

     one copy. The remaining two will be forwarded to HMCE at Nottingham for processing. After pro-
     cessing, HMCE will return one copy of the form to the 100 SFS/SFOXI.
     6.4.5. The 3 AF Form 301, Vehicle Transfer. This form is used for any transaction involving a conces-
     sion vehicle between entitled persons. Approval numbers are assigned to the base vehicle registrar
     offices by the 100 SFS/SFOXI. There are two types of transactions: Single Base Transfer and Dual
     Base Transfer:
        6.4.5.1. Single Base Transfer occurs when a vehicle is transferred between entitled persons
        assigned to the same base. The 3 AF Form 301 is completed in three copies. The original is given
        to the buyer, the base vehicle registrar office retains a copy and a copy is forwarded to the 100
        SFS/SFOXI. NOTE: Ten transactions are completed on one approval number. Base vehicle regis-
        trar offices will retain the 3 AF Forms 301 until all ten transactions are completed. At that time,
        they will forward the 3 AF Forms 301 to the 100 SFS/SFOXI and enter the proper computer entry
        for the transaction completed.
        6.4.5.2. Dual Base Transfer occurs when a vehicle is transferred between entitled persons
        assigned to separate bases. The seller completes the top portion of the form in four copies. All four
        are sent to the buyer’s base vehicle registrar office. If the buyer and seller are co-located, the forms
        may be given to the buyer. The buyer must complete the lower portion of the form at his, her base
        vehicle registrar office. The base vehicle registrar office will verify his, her ability to purchase the
        vehicle and contacts the 100 SFS/SFOXI for a dual base approval number. The buyer is given the
        original 3 AF Form 301, the base vehicle registrar office retains a copy, a copy is forwarded to the
        100 SFS/SFOXI and a copy is sent to the seller’s base vehicle registrar office. Both base vehicle
        registrar offices complete the appropriate computer or disk transactions.
        6.4.5.3. When 3 AF Form 301 transactions are completed, the transaction for each buyer and each
        seller will be noted on the computer records of each. The 3 AF Forms 301’s are forwarded to the
        100 SFS/SFOXI. Each card will contain the transaction date and approval date.
        6.4.5.4. A written request for cancellation of an approved 3 AF Form 301 will be forwarded
        immediately upon notification of circumstances which preclude the transfer. The written request
        will be signed by the seller and the buyer and forwarded to the 100 SFS/SFOXI. When transfer of
        the Form V-5, Registration Documents, is accomplished, the transaction will be considered final.
        6.4.5.5. If in any case dealing with the disposal of a concession vehicle, the owner’s DEROS is
        imminent, he may elect to hand carry the appropriate application to the 100 SFS/SFOXI. The
        owner must be briefed that a certified check or postal money order will be required for the exact
        amount of duty to clear his, her POV records.
