This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance. It establishes non-tactical radio call signs for use by the 52d Fighter Wing (FW) on all air-
craft maintenance radio nets. Call signs other than those listed are not authorized, nor will they be used by
any other organization; reference Air Force Instruction 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
Management. Distribution of this instruction is limited to a specific audience and controlled by the Office
of Primary Responsibility, 52 MXG/MXOOM, Maintenance Operation Center, 452-6236. Maintain and
dispose of records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) under https://afrims.amc.af.mil/

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Force protection reasons dictate that this instruction be designated as distribution “X”. This revision
deletes the 52 Logistics Group (LG) and moves numerous call signs from the 52 Operations Group (52
OG) to the newly formed 52 Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (52 AMXS). Adds the 52 Maintenance
Group (52 MXG) and re-designates the 52 Component Repair Squadron (52 CRS) as the 52 Component
Maintenance Squadron (52 CMS), the 52 Logistics Support Squadron as the 52 Maintenance Operations
Squadron (52 MOS). Also added are the 726 Air Mobility Squadron (726 AMS) and “Operations Security
Posture Radio Operations” in paragraph 4.

2. Conventions of Use.
   2.1. Fighter squadrons operating solely on their designated net do not need to use the Viper, Falcon,
   or Hog designator. However, when an agency switches radio nets for lateral coordination, the entire
   call sign must be used.
   2.2. When more than one individual of a given function is on the net coordinating shift turnover or as
   required by mission demands, one uses the ALPHA designator after their assigned call sign until shift
   change is complete, then drops the ALPHA designator and continue operations.

3. Brevity Codes.
   3.1. Organizations are encouraged to use maintenance brevity codes to shorten and clarify transmis-
   sions, and maintain discipline. During exercises or emergencies, brevity codes must be used.
   3.2. MOC will serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for all maintenance brevity codes
   (except AMMO specific brevity codes). Munitions Control will serve as the OPR for all AMMO
   codes.
