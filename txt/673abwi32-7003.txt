1. General:
     1.1. Land use controls (LUC), such as limitations on access, water use, excavations, and
     property transfers, will supplement engineering controls as appropriate for short-term and
     long-term management to prevent or limit human and environmental exposure to hazardous
     substances, pollutants, or contaminants. Examples include limitations on the depth and
     location of excavations, prohibition of or restrictions on well drilling and use of ground
     water, management of excavated soils, and prohibition of certain land uses. LUCs, often used
     interchangeably with institutional controls (IC), are administrative, procedural, engineering,
     and regulatory measures to control human access to and use of property.
     1.2. LUCs were established at JBER to prevent exposure to contaminated soil and water,
     based on agreements between the military services and the US Environmental Protection
     Agency (USEPA) and the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).
     LUCs are used to reduce the potential for exposure to hazardous substances or to enhance the
     protectiveness of a soil and/or water cleanup remedy. They include restrictions on the use of
     portions of the shallow aquifer south of the Elmendorf Moraine, limitations on the types of
     buildings allowed in certain areas – primarily occupancy limitations, and land use
     designations for certain areas as recreational use only. The LUCs have been implemented at
     several sites and operable units (OU) as part of the Environmental Restoration Program.
     LUCs were established for DP98 and OUs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 on former Elmendorf AFB
     property in their respective records of decision (ROD), as a component of the selected
     cleanup remedy. LUCs were also established for restoration and compliance sites formerly
     part of Fort Richardson in their respective RODs or Decision Documents. LUCs must be in
     place as long as a property is not available for unrestricted use or unlimited exposure and
     may include temporary or permanent restrictions or requirements. When all cleanup goals
     have been achieved for a given site, temporary controls, such as groundwater use restrictions,
     may be removed.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. JBER personnel, tenants, or contractors whose projects or activities require excavation
     in areas where site-specific LUCs are in effect will comply with all LUCs, 673ABWI 32-
     1007, and applicable Air Force instructions. Base contractors and tenant organizations will
     have LUC compliance requirements incorporated into their contracts and interagency
     agreements, as will be necessary. Failure to comply with LUCs will be grounds for penalty,
     in accordance with provisions specified in applicable contract documents. At project
     completion, the JBER organization or contractor will sign a certification of LUC compliance
     and return the compliance statement to 673 CES/CEANR.

   documents.     These agencies will ensure contractors are complying with this Wing
   Instruction.
3. Existing LUCs at JBER:
   3.1. LUCs in effect at JBER include site-specific LUCs and restrictions on groundwater use.
   The LUCs will be terminated as specified in the ROD when the sites or operable units have
   met required cleanup goals. The military services will seek prior concurrence from USEPA
   and ADEC to terminate LUCs or modify current land uses. In addition, the military services
   will seek prior concurrence before any anticipated action that may disrupt the effectiveness
   of the LUCs, or any action that may alter or is inconsistent with the land use assumptions or
   land uses described in the respective ROD.
   3.2. Site-specific LUCs are specified in the governing ROD or Decision Document. These
   documents are located in the information repository.
   3.3. The installation has implemented an administrative groundwater restriction on the use of
   groundwater from the shallow aquifer in the area that was formerly Elmendorf AFB. Use of
   the shallow aquifer within the groundwater control boundary for any purpose including, but
   not limited to, drinking, irrigation, fire control, dust control, or any other activity is strictly
   prohibited. Portions of the shallow aquifer are contaminated and may pose a health risk. The
   shallow aquifer is defined as any unconfined, saturated, water-bearing zone below the ground
   surface. The current groundwater control boundary can be found on the Environmental
   Restoration map located on the GeoBase webpage.
