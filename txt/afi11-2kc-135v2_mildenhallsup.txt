NOTES:
 1. N/N SPOT will consist of verbal ground evaluation covering at least one
     boldface/CAPS and one non-boldface emergency procedure. This will be
     documented in the ground phase on the Form 8 as “N/N EPE.”
 2. SPOT (OME) evaluations for Aircraft Commander upgrade will consist of a
     verbal ground evaluation. This will be documented in the ground phase on the
     Form 8 as “EPE.”
 3. Testing and Boldface/CAPS are not required for evaluations that normally do
     not require testing and/or Boldface/CAPS (e.g. Boom Operator MSN Cargo)


1.9.4.1. (Added) Initial In-house Instructor Requisites Individuals completing an in-house upgrade or
requalification to Instructor status will take the Instructor Open Book test administered by CCV. The
exam will be documented of the Form 8 as “INIT INSTR Open Book.”

1.9.5. SPOT Evaluations. SPOT evaluations on combat and combat support missions should be limited
to a minimum.
1.9.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Pilot EPEs, in conjunction with periodic evaluations,
will be administered in the Aircrew Training Simulator (ATS) to the maximum extent possible.
Navigator and Boom Operator EPEs will consist of verbal ground evaluations. Evaluators will use the
EPE scenarios available in 351 ARS/CCV.

1.14. Use of AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet, 6 June 2006, prescribed by AFI11-2KC-
10V2. Attachments 5, 6 and 7 of this instruction are the locally developed 3862 worksheets (or suitable
substitutes) to be used during flight evaluations. Current worksheets are available through 100 OGV
SharePoint website and e-Pubs. All AFI 11-2KC-135V2 and local requirements are included. Theater
Specific Procedures, HHQ and local SIIs will be evaluated. Flight examiners will verify and annotate all
applicable SIIs in the section provided and gather trend information accordingly. Once a draft AF Form
8 is accomplished and placed in the Evaluatee’s FEF, examiners will place the 3862 worksheet in the
trends inbox in 351 ARS/CCV.
1.15. Aircrew Testing. Testing is a prerequisite for all 100 OG evaluations with the exception of N/N
Spot evaluations. All requisite testing should be accomplished NLT 3 months into the eligibility zone.

1.16. Typical KC-135 Evaluation Profile. All Pilot QUAL/INSTM evaluations will be accomplished
in the ATS. The Pilot MSN evaluation will be accomplished in the aircraft. To the maximum extent
possible, all pilot MSN evaluations should be accomplished prior to the ATS portion for periodic
evaluations.

1.16.1. The following are 100 OG recommended MSN evaluation criteria.
1.16.1.1. (Added) Aircrew show time – Should be later than 0500L.

1.16.1.3. (Added) 1 hour of transition will be planned to accommodate multiple full-stop landings for
missions with multiple evaluations.
1.16.1.4. (Added) Other than OMEs, Priority 1A and 1B missions should not be scheduled for flight
evaluations to the max extent possible. 351 ARS/ DO will be the approval authority if this must occur.
Missions with multiple receivers are encouraged.
1.16.1.5. (Added) MSN evaluations and QUAL/INSTM evaluations should not be scheduled on the
same day.
1.16.1.6. (Added) Evaluators should not be scheduled as “A” coded flight crew during evaluations to
the maximum extent possible.

1.16.2. (Added)      QUAL/INSTM will be accomplished in the ATS IAW AMC approved ATS
courseware.

1.16.2.1 (ADDED) Crews are not responsible for providing a flight plan (Form 200), chart, Form F,
TOLD or DD175/1801 for the ATS portion.

1.16.3. (Added) Crew actions conducted during the EPE portion will be evaluated IAW the aircrew
briefing during the MSN check. If the ATS portion must be accomplished first, ACs will ensure that a
crew briefing is accomplished with the evaluator present prior to commencing the evaluation in the
ATS.

2.5.2.1. Suggested Profile for OME. The following are 100 OG recommended OME profiles, in order
of preference. NOTE: The profile for an OME is at the discretion of the OG/CC.
