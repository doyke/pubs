     military members (both on- and off-duty), and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians on
     duty, in accordance with AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management. At a minimum, the
     following medical information will be released to fulfill requirements for Occupational
     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) injury reporting as defined in DoDI 6055.7,
     Accident Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping and AFI 91-204: Name of the
     injured individual, their social security number, their organization, date of injury, date of
     treatment, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
     Problems (ICD-9) diagnosis of injury, a brief description of the nature of the injury,

     2.6.1.1. (Added) Ensure timely selection of a Safety Investigation Board (SIB). HQ
     USAFE/SE will provide the convening authority with a letter for his/her approval to
     direct the formation of a SIB. This letter will identify potential board presidents with
     their scheduling constraints, along with the wings required to provide SIB members. The
     potential board presidents and wings identified for support will be selected based on the
     investigative requirements of the mishap and the equitable distribution of efforts in
     previous SIBs. Once this letter has been drafted to convene a SIB, the letter will be sent
     to the convening authority for approval and release. The tasked wings will then provide
     the names to HQ USAFE/SE. The final board composition will be submitted to the
     convening authority for final approval. HQ USAFE/SE will inform HQ Judge Advocate
     (HQ USAFE/JA) of the final board composition, to allow HQ USAFE/JA to ensure the
     selected SIB members are not contacted during efforts to convene an Accident
     Investigation Board. See Attachment 7 (Added) for a copy of the COMUSAFE SIB
     Tasking Letter.
     2.7.3.1. (Added) Many European countries are not familiar with hydrazine (F-16, U-2)

     2.10.2.2. (Added) Upon notification of a SIB tasking, provide names and Social Security
     Numbers (SSN) for requested board member positions with any associated alibis. Do not
     assess individual availability based on alibis, convening authority safety staff (or above)
     will make the final determinations.
    2.10.4. (Added) Mishap Notification. Notify convening authority safety staff by providing
    a brief summary, estimate of the cost, status of Operational Report (OPREP) message (i.e.

     the content of the message prior to release (if possible) to avoid erroneous cost
     information, speculation, misleading details or privileged material. Provide follow-up
     information (via phone call or email) to HQ USAFE/SE as soon as practical.
    2.10.5. (Added) Follow-Up Notification. Provide a status update for all class A and B
    mishaps to HQ USAFE/SE prior to close of business (COB) on the day the mishap/event

                      COMUSAFE Smart Card Reporting Instructions:


A8.1. (Added) Overall Purpose: OPREPs are required shortly after a mishap occurs and do
not include details that COMUSAFE normally requires to ensure proper actions are being taken
to determine mishap cause and take care of those involved. The Smart Card is meant to give
COMUSAFE an update on mishap facts and safety investigation status after the investigator has
had a chance to make an initial assessment of the scene.
A8.2. (Added) Use the categories provided below. Investigators are not expected to provide
cause for the mishap or rush the mishap investigation process for this card. Investigators are
expected to provide a Smart Card to HQ USAFE/SE within 24 hours of the mishap. Do not
delay sending a Smart Card if you complete your initial assessment early.
A8.3. (Added) Provide Photos. Investigators are requested to provide 1 or 2 photos of the
mishap scene that provide an overall picture of the area and damaged/injury sustained. A picture
provides more information than can be included in a report and answers many questions.
Normally, a picture of the scene as a whole and a picture showing damage will suffice. Describe
them in your narrative. Use judgment when selecting pictures to forward to COMUSAFE. Do
not submit photos that you wouldn’t want to see in your local paper the next morning.
A8.4. (Added) Include. Include mishap wing and mishap date at the top of the Smart Card and
a Privacy Act statement at the bottom. Limit the card to one page plus photos.
A8.5. (Added) Mishap Type: Class and Category, i.e., Class A Off-Duty Private Motor
Vehicle (PMV)-4 (1 Fatality, 1 Serious Injury).
A8.6. (Added) Time and Place of Mishap. TIME - Local time. Include lighting conditions
(day, night) and weather conditions if outside. Could you find the mishap location on a map
based on your description? Provide addresses, building numbers/names, mile markers, distance
and direction from nearest town, road/highway names and direction of travel, etc.
A8.7. (Added) Who/What: WHO - Name not required. Include rank, age (if available),
assigned unit, marital status and # of dependents. Include data on all individuals involved in the
mishap. WHAT - What was happening when the mishap occurred? No causes required. Just
the facts as you know them from your first assessment. Paint an overall picture of the mishap
and outcome, referencing the pictures you provide.
A8.8. (Added) Injuries. What specific injuries were sustained? What is their condition
(critical, stable, etc.)? Treated and released or still in the hospital? Which hospital in which
town? Provide data on each person involved in the mishap. If no injuries, state so.
A8.9. (Added) Initial Investigation: What have you done in the first day of the investigation?
If you interviewed people, who did you interview? No names, just titles (witness, driver,
bartender, etc.). Were toxicology (TOX) tests conducted? Who is conducting them? Police
reports? Hospital records?
A8.10. (Added) Safety Action Required. What are your next big steps in the investigation? If
convening an ISB, how far along are you in the process? What information are you waiting on?

A8.11. (Added) Additional Comments. Any information you feel is important enough that
COMUSAFE would want to know that isn’t included above. Are there limitations to your
investigation due to the local authorities? Do you foresee any roadblocks coming up? Any
aspect of the investigation you will need higher headquarter (HHQ) assistance with? Include it
here.
