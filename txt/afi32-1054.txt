AFI32-10454 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   7


        resistance provisions are incorporated in the design. Include daily cleaning
        requirements (equipment, supplies, frequency) within the maintenance instructions
        provided to the using agency.
        4.4.4.2. Avoid chemical strippers. If chemical strippers are specified by contract,
        perform effectiveness tests prior to the contract award, particularly in cases where
        lead-based paint will be removed from wood. Specify procedures to confirm
        neutralization of the alkaline paint stripper through chemical testing. Alkaline residue
        left on substrate is a mechanism for recurring paint failure. Consult the supporting
        base environmental office for proper disposition instructions of any waste residue.
     4.4.5. Recordkeeping. Maintain records for protective coatings following UFC 3-190-
     06, Protective Coatings and Paints. (T-0) Use these records during evaluations of paint
     failures and prior to awarding a protective coatings contract. These records replace
     undocumented hearsay experience and allow fact-based decisions with costs and verified
     life expectancies of completed work to determine:
        4.4.5.1. Effectiveness of a particular paint system on different surfaces or in varying
        environments.
        4.4.5.2. Comparison of different paint systems under similar conditions.
        4.4.5.3. Comparison of different equipment for surface preparation or application.
        4.4.5.4. Frequency of spot painting and repainting.
  4.5. Industrial Water Treatment (IWT).
     4.5.1. The primary environmental concern of IWT is the proper disposal of chemically
     treated water. Consult AFI 32-1067, Water and Fuel Systems. Consult with the base
     environmental office prior to selecting any IWT chemical.
     4.5.2. Do not use chromates in any IWT application.
     4.5.3. Many of the chemicals used to treat industrial water may be harmful to the health
     of the operator and other base personnel. They range from highly toxic to mildly irritating
     to the persons handling them. Handle water treatment and testing chemicals with care,
     following guidance in OSHA directives, manufacturer’s recommendations, and the safety
     data sheets. Install eye wash stations and safety showers according to ground safety
     requirements. Obtain a chemical process authorization in accordance with AFI 32-7086
     for all chemicals to be used. Consult with wing safety, bioenvironmental engineering, and
     environmental engineering on potential safety issues and the use of less-hazardous
     substitutes. (T-0)
        4.5.3.1. Provide only approved backflow prevention devices to provide makeup from
        a potable water system to an IWT system in accordance with AFI 32-1067, Water and
        Fuel Systems.
        4.5.3.2. Chemicals added to protect condensate lines from corrosion make the steam
        and condensate unfit for consumption or other uses normally reserved for potable
        water. Do not use treated steam in direct contact with food or for any direct steam
        humidification, such as in a gymnasium steam room or humidity control for
        electronic equipment.
8                                                        AFI32-10454 7 NOVEMBER 2014


    4.5.4. Conduct acceptance testing of new heating and cooling systems to ensure the IWT
    system meets design and operation parameters. Construction contracts that include
    heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems shall include provisions for the
    contractor to provide water treatment testing and maintenance for the duration of the
    construction project warranty period.
    4.5.5. Indicate locations to install corrosion coupon racks following American Society
    for Testing and Materials® (ASTM) D2688, Standard Test Methods for Corrosivity of
    Water in the Absence of Heat Transfer (Weight Loss Methods), Test Method B. The
    coupons are the best confirmation of IWT effectiveness.
    4.5.6. Do not use non-chemical IWT devices on Air Force systems either regularly or on
    a test evaluation basis except as indicated below.
       4.5.6.1. Many variables affect performance, and no criteria and standards have been
       developed that may be incorporated into guide specifications or statements of work.
       Such criteria and standards are necessary for standard Air Force contracting methods
       to ensure devices will perform as advertised.
       4.5.6.2. Various energy services companies (ESCO) are investigating the use of these
       devices for energy and water conservation measures under energy savings
       performance contracts (ESPC). Under ESPC, the ESCO provides guaranteed savings
       that are validated each year to reconcile payments, using an agreed-upon
       measurement and verification methodology. Consult AFCEC/COS to determine
       measurement and verification protocols for nonchemical devices for use under ESPC.
       For additional guidance, refer to Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 13-13, Energy
       Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC).
    4.5.7. IWT requires testing at a frequency that ensures the prevention of scale, corrosion,
    and biological formation in the heating and cooling systems. The time period between
    testing depends on system integrity and operations. A mechanically sound system will
    require less-frequent testing since less chemicals leave the system over time. Refer to
    UFC 3-240-13FN, Industrial Water Treatment Operation and Maintenance, for
    recommended testing frequencies.
    4.5.8. Develop and post, in appropriate locations, control charts for each boiler, cooling
    tower, and closed system showing the treatment chemicals used, the amount to add per
    operating parameter, the testing required, the limits to maintain in the system, what to do
    if the chemical levels are above or below the limits, and any other information peculiar to
    the system. (T-1)
    4.5.9. Perform periodic surveys to ensure effective IWT.
       4.5.9.1. Annually check the capacity of ion exchangers. (T-1) Do not rely on a timed
       regeneration cycle.
       4.5.9.2. To identify leaks at the earliest stages, test the condensate throughout the
       return system for possible water leakage at heat exchangers once at the start of
       heating season and once at the end of heating season. (T-1)
       4.5.9.3. When adding or deleting buildings on a steam system or significantly
       changing IWT chemicals, perform the design acceptance tests for the boiler total
AFI32-10454 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    9


        dissolved solids limit and verify the total protection of the condensate return system.
        (T-1)
     4.5.10. IWT records should reflect the minimum entries needed to effectively manage
     the control of the IWT program and indicate the need for additional testing. The reverse
     of the forms explains their use. Associated recordkeeping includes the following:
        4.5.10.1. Accomplish IWT operating logs based upon one log for each individually
        treated system (each boiler, each cooling tower bank, and each closed system). (T-1)
        4.5.10.2. Use AF Form 1457, Water Treatment Operating Log for Cooling Tower
        Systems, as a minimum. (T-1)
        4.5.10.3. Use AF IMT 1459, Water Treatment Operating Log for Steam and Hot
        Water Boilers, as a minimum. (T-1)
        4.5.10.4. Keep other industrial water system records on modifications of these forms
        or a log developed locally for the specific tests required. (T-1)
        4.5.10.5. Keep the maintenance and history of IWT, other than that contained in the
        logs, in a historical record for each system. This book should contain a record
        (including dates) of occurrences of corrosion and scale, major maintenance and
        surveys performed on the system, replacement of piping and equipment, accidents,
        outages, changes in methods of operation and treatment used, and other pertinent data
        to assist troubleshooting and provide facts for management decisions on process
        improvements. (T1)
  4.6. Design and Material Selection.
     4.6.1. Design, construction, and application of cathodic protection, IWT, and protective
     coatings are functional requirements for almost all projects. Designs shall achieve the
     minimum life cycle cost for the overall facility. Base personnel must be able to operate
     and maintain the final facility design, including the corrosion control systems, without
     extensive training or equipment investment, unless this is the best approach to achieve
     minimum lifecycle cost.
     4.6.2. Corrosion resistance is not the only criterion for material selection. When selecting
     a material, investigate all aspects of its physical properties in the application
     environment, during both normal operation and typical system failure.
     4.6.3. Construct new pipelines to enable the use of in-line inspection tools such as video
     cameras, acoustic devices, and smart pigs.
     4.6.4. Conduct leak investigations and system failure evaluations using AF IMT 1687,
     Leak/Failure Data Record. Use the information captured on AF IMT 1687 to provide
     justification for system repair or replacement, for installation of corrosion control
     measures, and for the project narrative on DD Form 1391, FY __ Military Construction
     Project Data. Consult AFI 32-1069, Gas Supply and Distribution; UFC 3-230-02,
     Operation and Maintenance of Water Supply Systems; and UFC 3-460-01, Design:
     Petroleum Fuel Facilities, for leak detection and survey requirements on these systems.
