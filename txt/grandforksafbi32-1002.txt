  2.4. Severe Weather Commanders Senior Staff, (CSS). Whenever severe winter weather
  conditions jeopardize the mission capability of the wing, or dictate a change in snow removal
  priorities to ensure the health and safety of base personnel, the 319 ABW/CC may convene
  the severe weather CSS in the Wing Command Post. Permanent membership will include
  the 319 ABW/CC, 319 MSG/CC, 319 MDG/CC, 69 RS/CC, 69 MXS/CC, 319 OSS/CC, 319
  CES/CC, 319 SFS/CC and representatives from any other tenant units operating on the Grand
  Forks AFB airfield. The CSS will evaluate priorities contained in the snow plan based on
  changing requirements and dynamics of the situation. Priorities will be adjusted and the base
  civil engineer will then direct the SCC to implement decisions made in the CSS. In the event
  of a crisis, e.g., medical emergency, fire, etc., 319 MSG/CC is authorized to unilaterally
  deviate from previously agreed upon decisions.
  2.5. Support Units.
     2.5.1. Organizational responsibilities. Wing squadrons, tenant units, and base
     operations will ensure their plowable paved areas are free from all tools, stands, fire
     extinguishers, wheel chocks, and other equipment at all times. Removal of snow and ice
     from transient aircraft surfaces and from critical areas under/adjacent to the aircraft will
     be accomplished and monitored by the base transient alert services. The Department of
     Homeland Security and Transient Alert will be responsible for removal of snow and ice
     from their assigned aircraft surfaces and from critical areas under those aircraft. Other
     tenant organizations with aircraft based at Grand Forks Air Force Base will perform
     similar snow removal functions for assigned aircraft.
  2.6. General Instructions.

              runway condition and priority changes, and flight schedules.
              3.4.4.1.4. During snow/ice storms and/or as required, obtain updated weather
              forecasts (DSN: 362-4396/4398 Commercial: 701-747-4396/4398) from the duty
              forecaster. During non-airfield hours the 15 th Operational Weather Squadron
              assumes the responsibility for all forecasting functions (DSN: 576-9698/9699
              Commercial: 618-256-9698/9699) until weather flight standby personnel can be
              recalled.
              3.4.4.1.5. Be responsible for control of civil engineering personnel movement
              and maintain a personnel status board with space for team location and member’s

       feet west and running parallel to Eielson Street, excluding the POL parking area.
    3.5. Snow Control Operations.
       3.5.1. When objective conditions jeopardize safe runway operation, cessation of the
       flying operation is required. The aim of "bare pavement" is paramount to snow removal
       operations on the runway; therefore, removal operations will start at the beginning of
       snow accumulation. Base snow removal crews will generally start simultaneously on
       runways, taxiways, and ramps except as dictated by special conditions.
       3.5.2. An accumulation of ice, sleet, freezing rain, or snow can result in closing the
       airfield and other facilities to traffic. This jeopardizes base missions if effective measures
       are not taken. The removal of ice is much more difficult than snow clearing operations.
GRANDFORKSAFBI32-1002 14 JUNE 2013                                                      7


       A Runway Condition Reading (RCR) of 12 or higher must be maintained on the runway
       if at all possible.
       3.5.3. The shift supervisor will determine when chemicals are to be used. Airfield
       Management will be advised when chemicals are to be spread.
       3.5.4. Cleanup.
          3.5.4.1. Snow will be cleared back 25 feet from the edges of the runway/overruns
          and 25 feet from the edges of taxiways when the depth exceeds 30 inches.
          3.5.4.2. Snow will be removed from glide slope, airfield lighting, Tactical Air
          Navigation (TACAN) antenna, etc., to meet requirements established by T.O. 31R4-
          2GRN31-22. Airfield lighting will be kept uncovered and exposed from snow by use
          of air blast sweepers and hand shoveling as required.
