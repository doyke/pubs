   radio contact cannot be established, the vehicle operator will exit the CMA and ensure all
   personnel and vehicles are clear of the CMA NLT 0800L (or such time as the airfield opens,
   if other than regularly scheduled). Failure to either notify Tower or exit the aircraft
   movement area will be documented as a CMA violation or runway intrusion.
4.5. Disabled Vehicles.
   4.5.1. In the event a vehicle becomes disabled anywhere on the airfield immediately notify
   the control tower and Airfield Management office. During non duty hours contact Command
   Post. State the problem, vehicle registration number and where the vehicle is located. Under
   no circumstances will the operator abandon the vehicle.
   4.5.2. Airfield Management or Command Post will contact 30 LRS/LGRDDO and
   coordinate immediate removal of the vehicle from the airfield.
   4.5.3. Airfield Management will close the portion of the airfield until the vehicle has been
   removed.
4.6. Radio Control Procedures.
   4.6.1. When the airfield is open, the control tower controls and directs all ground traffic and
   vehicles in the CMA. To achieve this control, the following must be obeyed.
 18                                                        30SWI13-204 26 OCTOBER 2010


   4.6.2. Maintain two-way radio communication with Tower. Organizations must provide
   their own radios, however, AMOPs may loan a radio if one is available.
NOTE: Tower light-gun signals will not be used as a substitute for the two-way radio
requirement.
   4.6.3. Use the Tower, Crash, and Security Forces FM Nets or Ground Control frequencies
   (UHF/VHF) to communicate with Tower. Tower does not continuously monitor the Security
   Forces or Crash FM Nets. Security Forces and Fire Department vehicle operators who
   require communications with Tower on these frequencies must coordinate with Vandenberg
   Emergency Control Center (VECC) and Fire Dispatch to have Tower monitor the frequency.
   VECC or Fire Dispatch will activate the select-call equipment or call the Tower on a landline
   to request for Tower to monitor the appropriate frequency. When communication with the
   Tower is no longer required, VECC, Fire Dispatch, or the vehicle operator(s) will inform the
   Tower.
   4.6.4. Request and receive permission from the Tower before entering the CMA.
       4.6.4.1. There is a runway hold line painted across the taxiway at the three locations
       where taxiways intersect the runway. A runway hold line consists of two solid yellow
       lines and two dashed yellow lines (Attachment 5).
WARNING: DO NOT confuse controlled movement area hold lines with runway hold lines
(Attachment 5). DO NOT cross a runway hold line without permission from the Tower.
       4.6.4.2. Tower approval to cross the runway is a one-time approval only. Once your
       vehicle has exited the runway beyond the runway hold line(s), tower approval is required
       to re-enter the runway.
       4.6.4.3. Make radio communications concise to eliminate the possibility of confusion.
       State who you are, your position on the airfield, the route you wish to use, and your
       destination. Tower will respond with a specific clearance. Repeat instructions back to
       the Tower exactly as they are received.
       4.6.4.4. Ask Tower to repeat instructions you do not fully understand. DO NOT
       ASSUME ANYTHING. When in doubt, always take the safest course of action. If the
       Tower does not respond to your request to enter the movement area or cross the runway,
       do not proceed until Tower tells you.
       4.6.4.5. Immediately report to tower when you depart the runway or CMA. State the
       location where you exited the runway or CMA.
NOTE: Until you pass the runway hold lines you are not off the runway. If you exit the runway
into the grass or you pass over the runway edge lines, you are to report off the runway. Remain
in radio contact with the tower if you are within 100 feet of the runway edge.
       4.6.4.6. Obey all Tower instructions. If Tower instructions conflict with guidance in the
       Airfield Driver’s Familiarization Program or this instruction, Tower instructions have
       priority. If for example, Tower instructs you to ―exit the runway immediately,‖ you are
       not expected to obey the 40 mph speed limit.
       4.6.4.7. If you are operating a vehicle on the runway and Tower directs you to exit the
       runway, exit the runway at any of the taxiway intersections with the runway or position
30SWI13-204 26 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     19


      yourself at least 100 feet from the edge of the runway or runway overrun. As a guide, the
      runway distance remaining markers (large black signs with larger white numbers),
      located in the grass on both sides of the runway, are approximately 75 feet from the
      runway edge.
      4.6.4.8. Never use the word ―clear‖ in radio transmissions. Radio transmissions can
      bleed through to different frequencies and cause aircraft in-flight to misinterpret landing
      instructions.
      4.6.4.9. Control tower controllers will not issue unconditional instructions when
      authorizing movement on a runway or taxiway for the purpose of airfield checks or other
      airport operations. Instructions must ensure positive control with specific instructions to
      proceed on a runway or movement area and. as necessary, hold short instructions.
4.7. Operating a Vehicle on the Parking Ramp.
   4.7.1. Vehicles may not be driven diagonally across the ramp. Travel parallel or
   perpendicular to Airfield Road and make all turns at 90 degree angles. There are very few
   painted lines on the ramp to use for a reference. As a guide, follow the seams in the concrete
   slabs that make up the ramp.
   4.7.2. Use taxiway centerlines as highway dividers–drive to the right. Remain on concrete
   surfaces when possible and avoid the airfield lights on the asphalt surfaces.
   4.7.3. If a vehicle must be backed or driven forward toward an aircraft, clear the area, use a
   spotter and ensure the spotter uses chocks pre-positioned to keep your vehicle from striking
   the aircraft.
   4.7.4. If parking near an aircraft, do not park with front or rear of vehicle pointed towards
   the aircraft unless absolutely necessary; park perpendicular to the aircraft’s fuselage off the
   nose of the aircraft or parallel to the aircraft off a wing tip. Again, the driver’s side of the
   vehicle should be closest to the aircraft. Park at least 25 feet away unless you are servicing
   the aircraft or loading/unloading cargo.
   4.7.5. When leaving a parked vehicle unattended:
      4.7.5.1. Turn off the ignition.
EXCEPTIONS: Emergency or servicing vehicles that must remain in operation to perform their
function may be parked with engine running, transmission in park (automatic) or neutral
(manual), parking brake set, and rear wheel chocked.
      4.7.5.2. Leave vehicle unlocked with key in ignition.
      4.7.5.3. Shift transmission to park (automatic), or reverse (manual).
      4.7.5.4. Set parking brake.
      4.7.5.5. Turn on emergency flashers.
      4.7.5.6. Place chocks in front of and behind a rear wheel of any vehicle left unattended
      within 50 feet of an aircraft.
EXCEPTION: Vehicles responding to an emergency are exempt from chocking requirements if
the engine is shut off.
 20                                                          30SWI13-204 26 OCTOBER 2010


4.8. Airfield Speed Limits.
   4.8.1. 5 mph – in close proximity (within 25 feet) of an aircraft.
   4.8.2. 10 mph – for special purpose vehicles and for vehicles towing multiple pieces of
   equipment.
   4.8.3. 15 mph – when towing equipment or for general purpose vehicles on the aircraft
   parking ramp.
   4.8.4. 40 mph – for general purpose vehicles on the taxiway or runway. If you encounter an
   aircraft, pull over to the side, stop, and wait for the aircraft to pass, then proceed.
EXCEPTION: Emergency vehicles (Fire Dept, Ambulance, Security Forces, AMOPs) may
exceed the speed limit during emergency situations. Extreme caution must be used during these
periods.
   4.8.5. During hours of darkness or reduced visibility, speed limits for towing equipment and
   for general purpose vehicles on the taxiway or runway shall be reduced by 10 mph. Those
   agencies responding to an emergency and exceeding the speed limit shall consider the current
   road conditions (nighttime, precipitation present) and adjust their speed accordingly.
4.9. Immediate Vicinity of Aircraft.
   4.9.1. If a vehicle must approach an aircraft, approach with the driver’s side of the vehicle
   closest to the aircraft so the driver can judge the distance separating the vehicle and aircraft.
   4.9.2. If an aircraft’s engines are running, do not drive or park a vehicle within 25 feet
   forward or 200 feet behind the aircraft.
   4.9.3. Do not drive within 25 feet of a parked aircraft except when the vehicle is involved in
   servicing or loading/unloading cargo.
   4.9.4. Do not drive a vehicle under any part of an aircraft unless your vehicle is part of a
   cargo loading or unloading operation and a vehicle is specifically designed to do so (Aircraft
   certified forklift, 60K cargo loader, or missile/bomb loader).
4.10. Encountering Aircraft on a Taxiway.
   4.10.1. Small Wing Span (C-130 or less). The vehicle operator may simply elect to move to
   the side of the taxiway to let it pass. The vehicle operator must maintain a minimum 25 feet
   separation from the aircraft.
   4.10.2. Large Wing Span (C-5, B-52, etc…). Vehicle operator should turn around and
   proceed off the taxiway at the nearest exit. Avoid driving into the grass do so because of the
   potential (FOD) hazard. If getting out of the way of taxiing aircraft means you need to drive
   into the grass and then drive at a minimum of 200 feet from the taxiway centerline.
   4.10.3. Aircraft always have the right of way over vehicles. Never cross the path of a
   moving aircraft. Yield to the right of aircraft approaching head-on. Always wait until a
   taxiing aircraft has cleared your path before proceeding, then pass to the rear. All aircraft
   create ―jet blast‖ or ―prop wash,‖ do not come any closer than 200 feet behind, or 25 feet in
   front of, an aircraft whose engines are running (Attachment 10). VAFB does not have any
   designated ―jet blast‖ areas.
30SWI13-204 26 OCTOBER 2010                                                                      21


   4.10.4. When an aircraft is approaching your vehicle at night, stop and turn off your
   headlights, but leave your parking lights on, until the aircraft passes you. Know how to turn
   off DRLs. If you are unsure on how to turn off your DRLs refer to the vehicle operator's
   manual.
   4.10.5. Any vehicle mishap on the VAFB airfield will be reported to the AFM, DAFM, 30
   SW/SE, 30 SFS/CC, and 30 OSS/CC.
4.11. Emergency Vehicle Operations.
   4.11.1. During emergencies responding vehicles (Fire Department, Ambulance, Security
   Forces and Airfield Management) may:
   4.11.2. Exceed the speed limits only when necessary to save lives or property.
NOTE: Emergency response vehicles are not exempt from contacting the Tower for permission
into the controlled movement area’s or onto the runway.
   4.11.3. Vehicles responding to an emergency are exempt from chocking requirements if the
   engine is shut off.
   4.11.4. During an emergency all non-essential vehicle traffic and radio transmissions shall
   be kept to a minimum.
4.12. Fog, Night and Reduced Visibility Conditions.
   4.12.1. Exercise extreme caution during these conditions. Most aircraft are painted gray and
   are difficult to see under adverse conditions. During low visibility conditions (e.g. fog, night,
   rain, etc...) aircraft occasionally operate without landing lights to reduce glare.
   4.12.2. At night, do not direct vehicle headlights toward a moving aircraft. Leave the
   parking lights on to mark your vehicle’s position. Keep the headlights off until the aircraft is
   out of range. It is difficult to see on the airfield during hours of darkness, exercise extreme
   caution when performing nighttime operations.
   4.12.3. During low visibility conditions, all vehicles will stop short of the ILS hold sign
   (Attachment 5 and 16) and ask permission from the Tower to cross and/or enter the runway.
   Contact AMOPs during periods of inclement weather for reduced visibility conditions prior
   to entering the airfield.
   4.12.4. There is minimal flood lighting available on the parking ramp. Portable lighting
   units are sometimes used to supplement security; however, these units cast shadows that can
   easily hide hazards.
   4.12.5. During Fog conditions and at night speed limits will be reduced.
4.13. Airfield Driving Blackout Procedures. It is prohibited to drive on the VAFB airfield in
black out conditions.
4.14. Vehicle Lights on the Airfield. All vehicles operating within the CMA will use rotating
beacon lights or hazard/warning flashers and headlights. Vehicles equipped with daytime
running lights will ensure they are on when operating on the airfield.
4.15. Control Tower Light Gun Signals.
 22                                                         30SWI13-204 26 OCTOBER 2010

   Definitions of signs are as follows:
      4.16.2.1. Mandatory signs are provided when pilots and vehicle operators must follow an
      instruction such as at runway hold positions. Mandatory signs have a red background
      with white lettering (Attachment 8 and 16).
      4.16.2.2. Non-mandatory signs are classified as informative. These signs are necessary
      to indicate a specific movement area or to provide other useful information. Informative
      signs have a yellow background with black lettering or black background with yellow
      lettering (Attachment 8 and 16).
   4.16.3. Airfield markings unique to Vandenberg include the cargo Deployment Functional
   area located on the airfield in front of the Transient Maintenance building. This area is
   marked with a dashed alternating green and white line. This area is only used during
   contingency or exercise operations (Attachment 16).
4.17. Tower Visual and Radio Blind Spots.
   4.17.1. The ramp behind the aircraft hangar is a visual blind spot from the Tower.

   forward 18‖ – 24‖ and re-inspect tires for FOD or other debris (rollover FOD check). When
   you drive a vehicle off of any prepared surface (including onto the runway overruns and
   asphalt shoulders adjacent to the taxiways and runway) where tires may pick up rocks and
   gravel, conduct a rollover FOD check and remove any foreign objects immediately after you
   return to a prepared road surface.
4.19. Mobile Obstacles on Taxiways and Aprons.
   4.19.1. No equipment will be left unmanned in the following areas:
       4.19.1.1. 1,000 feet from runway centerline out to either side.

      callsign (TRAINING—#) assigned by AMOPs personnel.
   4.23.2. Vehicle operators must be able to clearly communicate and understand instructions
   from the Tower. If an operator does not understand, they will ask Tower to repeat the
   message. The radio operator will relay information back to the Tower exactly as it was
   stated. Ground vehicle operators will not use the word ―Clear‖ when communicating with
   the Tower (Attachment 9).
4.24. Procedures to Use Infield and/or Other Airfield Routes.
   4.24.1. Vehicle operators must understand standard traffic flow procedures, including
   driving lane locations; mandatory stop and yield signs, accident reporting and vehicle
   parking on airfield (Attachment 11, 12 and 14). Vandenberg AFB does not have designated
   driving lanes painted on the aircraft parking apron. When driving on taxiways or toward
   approaching aircraft; approach at a 90 degree angle (Attachment 14).
   4.24.2. Airfield Road is a two-way traffic lane, marked with yellow paint, which runs North
   and South from Gate 4 to the south end of the hanger. Use caution in front of Airfield
   Operations (Building 1746) due to DV activity (Attachments 11 and 13). Do not drive on or
   across the painted red carpet located on the parking ramp.
      4.24.2.1. Operating a Vehicle on Airfield Road. Stop signs are painted on Airfield Road
      in three critical locations: two near the aircraft hangar and one in front of Fire Station 1.
      Obey stop signs and visually clear the area for moving vehicles and aircraft before
      proceeding.
   4.24.3. Immediate Runway Departure Procedure. If you are operating a vehicle on the
   runway and Tower directs you to depart the runway immediately, drive onto a taxiway
   (beyond the hold line) if one is immediately available. If a taxiway is not available, drive
   into the grass along the runway at least 100 feet beyond the runway edge. As a guide, the
   runway distance markers (large black signs with white numbers located in the grass on both
   sides of the runway) are approximately 75 feet from the runway edge. These instructions are
   for emergency situations only. Remember to complete a FOD check prior to re-entering the
   runway or taxiway area from off un-improved surfaces.

   4.27.2. Cell phones shall not be used within the distances listed below when near aircraft
   being serviced with fuel or oxygen.
       4.27.2.1. Within 50 feet of any pressurized aircraft fuel or oxygen servicing components.
       4.27.2.2. Within 25 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet during fuel transfer.
       4.27.2.3. Within 10 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet.
4.28. Loss of Communications.
   4.28.1. While on the runway. If Tower loses radio contact, they will flash the runway lights
   on and off and attempt light gun signal communication to get the vehicle operator’s attention.
   All personnel will be alert for these signals and remain vigilant for aircraft. DO NOT re-
   enter or cross the runway without ATC’s permission. Immediately leave the controlled
   movement area and contact Airfield Management as soon as possible to report the situation.
   4.28.2. On the movement area (area other than runway). If Tower loses radio, they will flash
   the taxiway lights on and off and attempt light gun signal communication to get the vehicle
   operator’s attention. All personnel shall be alert for these signals and remain vigilant for
   aircraft. Immediately move to the extreme edge of the taxiway and drive slowly to the
   nearest movement area exit. Contact Airfield Management as soon as possible to report the
   situation.
4.29. Fuel Pits.
   4.29.1. Vandenberg has fuel pits located on the main parking ramp annotated by white
   squares painted on the concrete. The fuel pits are empty and not active.
   4.29.2. Do not drive over the fuel pits covers.

   6.1.1. Violations of airfield access procedures, airfield driving rules, aircraft movement area
   violations or unauthorized runway entry must be reported to AMOPs as soon as the incident
   occurs.
   6.1.2. The Airfield Manager will initiate an investigation and coordinate with 30 SW/SEF
   and the AOF/CC to determine the proper method of reporting the incident and to decide
   which agency will investigate. The following guidelines apply:
       6.1.2.1. Airfield Manager will investigate general motor vehicle violations of access
       procedures, airfield driving rules and movement area procedures.
       6.1.2.2. For a runway incursion, the individual’s AF Form 483 must be surrendered to
       AMOPs and airfield driving privileges revoked until an investigation, retraining and
       certification is complete.
       6.1.2.3. Coordinate with 30SW/SE to assign all runway incursions an operational
       category (Operational Error, Pilot Deviation, Vehicle/Pedestrian).
       6.1.2.4. Use AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, to report a runway intrusion that does
       not involve an aircraft. AFI 91-202, The U.S. Air Force Mishap Prevention Program,
       prescribes the use of this form.
   6.1.3. Use AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), to report a runway intrusion
   that involves an aircraft. AFI 91-202, The U.S. Air Force Mishap Prevention Program and
   AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports prescribes the use of this form.
6.2. Airfield Driving Violation Recourse.
   6.2.1. Violation of airfield driving procedures is a serious safety issue and will be handled
   according to the seriousness of the offense. Serious offenses such as a runway incursion and
   controlled movement area violations will be addressed as follows:
       6.2.1.1. A first-time offense will result in a one-month suspension of all airfield driving
       privileges.
       6.2.1.2. A second offense will result in a 3-month suspension of all airfield driving
       privileges.
       6.2.1.3. The third offense will result in a permanent revocation of all airfield driving
       privileges.
   6.2.2. Punishment for other violations such as speeding and not performing FOD checks will
   be determined by the Airfield Manager.
   6.2.3. In all cases of suspension or revocation, the Airfield Manager or designated
   representative will take possession of the individual’s AF Form 483.

   6.2.4. The Airfield Manager will send a letter to the individual’s supervisor, unit ADPM, and
   unit commander informing them of the airfield violation and suspension of airfield driving
   privileges.
   6.2.5. If the individual is needed to alleviate manning shortages to support a mission on the
   airfield, the individual’s unit commander may submit a letter requesting reinstatement of
   airfield driving privileges. The petition will be on official letterhead and addressed to the
   Wing Commander (30 SW/CC).
   6.2.6. The 30 SW/CC is the only one that can reinstate airfield driving privileges. This
   authority cannot be delegated. The letter must explain the reason(s) why the individual
   should retain their airfield driving privileges and state the driver has been counseled by their
   supervisor about the airfield driving violation.
   6.2.7. For reinstatement of airfield driving privileges following a suspension, an individual
   must complete remedial training under the guidance of their ADPM. The remedial training
   consists of all training requirements for individuals undergoing initial training and
   certification. After all training requirements are met and the individual passes the written
   airfield driving test, a new AF Form 483 will be issued. If the individual fails the written
   exam, a retest will be conducted no earlier than 48 hours after the initial test.
   6.2.8. If an individual’s civilian driver’s license has been suspended or revoked by civil
   authorities, the unit commander will also suspend or revoke the individual’s airfield driving
   privileges, confiscate their AF Form 483, and notify the individual’s unit ADPM and the
   Airfield Manager in writing. The Airfield Manager will take possession of the individual’s
   AF Form 483 upon presentation of written notification. Upon reinstatement of the
   individual’s civilian driver’s license, the individual will undergo remedial training in airfield
   driving procedures.
NOTE: Reporting of runway, taxiway, ramp and CMA violations are the responsibility of all
personnel operating and utilizing the airfield.
