                                    DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Driving privileges requirements.
   2.1.1. Driving a government motor or privately owned vehicle (GMV/POV) on WPAFB is a
   privilege granted by the 88 ABW/CC. If a person accepts that privilege, the individual must
   comply with the laws and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on
   the installation. Consequently, everyone operating a motor vehicle on WPAFB must
   produce, upon request from the Security Forces, the following:
       2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration.
       2.1.1.2. A valid state, provincial or international driver’s license.    Ohio Department of
       Motor Vehicles honors international driver’s licenses for a period      of six months. After
       six months, individuals must apply for an Ohio driver’s license.         WPAFB follows the
       Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles guidelines and recognizes             international driver’s
       licenses.
       2.1.1.3. Proof of current vehicle insurance as required by the state of Ohio.
       2.1.1.4. Operation of GMVs (owned, leased or rented) requires possession of an AF
       Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card.
2.2. Stopping and inspecting personnel or vehicles.
   2.2.1. 50 U.S.C. 797 and DODI 5200.08 grants the 88 ABW/CC the authority to stop,
   inspect, search and impound motor vehicles at CONUS installation gates and Air Force
   restricted areas to ensure the safety and security of all personnel and resources under their
   control.
   2.2.2. Reasons for conducting these activities may include, but are not limited to, increased
   force protection conditions, random vehicle inspections, and when there is reasonable basis
   to believe it is necessary to enforce a traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal
   activity.
2.3. Implied consent to vehicle impoundment.
   2.3.1. As a condition to accepting installation driving privileges, drivers give their consent
   for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their POV is:
       2.3.1.1. Illegally parked for unreasonable periods.
       2.3.1.2. Interferes with traffic operations.
       2.3.1.3. Interferes with military operations
       2.3.1.4. Creates a safety hazard.
       2.3.1.5. Disabled by accident or incident.
       2.3.1.6. Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area, or
       abandoned.
 8                          WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


     2.3.2. Drivers agree to reimburse an authorized agency or contractor for the cost of towing,
     storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their vehicle.
2.4. Suspension or revocation of driving privileges.
     2.4.1. When revocation action for implied consent is combined with another revocation, it
     will run concurrently.
     2.4.2. Individuals whose base driving privileges are suspended or revoked may park their
     POVs in one of five approved locations.
        2.4.2.1. Area A, in the parking lot adjacent to the Hope Hotel.
        2.4.2.2. Area B, in the back row of the Springfield Street parking lot across from Gate
        1B.
        2.4.2.3. Area C, in the parking lot immediately outside Gate 1C adjacent to State Route
        444.
        2.4.2.4. Kittyhawk Center, the back row of the parking lot adjacent to Building 1240,
        immediately inside Gate 38C.
        2.4.2.5. Prairies at Wright Field, the back row of the parking lot adjacent to Community
        Center, Building 6933.
     2.4.3. Individuals who wish to park in other than the approved locations must request special
     permission in writing from 88 MSG/CC. Permission must be approved prior to parking in an
     alternate location.
     2.4.4. Individuals must request, in writing, special permission from the 88 MSG/CC to drive
     on WPAFB when their base driving privileges are suspended or revoked. Permission must
     be approved prior to driving on WPAFB.
2.5. Barment procedures: Under the authority of 50 U.S.C. 797 and DODI 5200.08, the
88 ABW/CC may deny access to the installation through the use of a barment order.
     2.5.1. The 88 ABW/CC will approve all barment actions occurring on WPAFB, OH.
     2.5.2. Personnel recommending barment action will forward a request to 88 SFS/S5SR with
     supporting documentation. 88 SFS/S5SR will initiate all actions to bar personnel under Title
     18 of the US Code, Section 1382, IAW AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
     Program, and forward barment package to ASC/JA for action.
        2.5.2.1. The ASC/JA will review all Security Forces incident reports and make
        recommendations to the 88 ABW/CC on all other barment actions. When the
        88 ABW/CC concurs with the ASC/JA, the ASC/JA office will complete the formal
        barment package and serve the barment action on the individual in person or via certified
        mail.
     2.5.3. 88 SFS/S5SR will input barment data into Security Forces Management Information
     System (SFMIS) when the 88 ABW/CC signs the memo. The Security Forces Control
     Center (SFCC) has real-time access to the barment roster.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                             9


  2.5.4. The 88 SFS Reports and Analysis Section will notify the 88 CONS Squadron and/or
  the ASC Contracting Office on all barments completed by the 88 SFS, and those initiated
  through the ASC/JA to the 88 ABW/CC.
  2.5.5. 88 SFS/SFOSP (S3SS) will produce a barment roster monthly and place the rosters on
  each installation entry point.
  2.5.6. Barments will remain in effect until the individual requests and/or receives approval
  from 88 ABW/CC to reenter WPAFB or until it expires.
  2.5.7. A list of barred personnel will be maintained at all gates, Pass and Registration,
  NMUSAF, 88 ABW/CEH and the SFCC.
  2.5.8. No immediate barment orders will be issued to military-affiliated personnel unless the
  circumstances surrounding the situation dictate otherwise. Barment action against such
  personnel will normally be staffed after-the-fact and during normal working hours.
  2.5.9. No immediate barment of other personnel will be conducted unless their actions pose
  an immediate threat to the installation or personnel. While no such list can be exhaustive,
  consider such factors as: age, mental or physical capacity of the individual, where the
  individual’s “culpability” is in doubt, and/or the duress/emergency nature of the situation.
  When there is any doubt whether barment is the right course of action, do not proceed with
  the barment.
  2.5.10. Security Forces may initiate temporary barment actions on a verbal authorization
  from the 88 ABW/CC. The SFCC will contact the Command Center to initiate a three-way

  and the commander on reasons for the requested action and the commander will make a final
  decision.
     2.5.10.1. When temporary barment actions are imposed by SFS using the pre-signed
     barment order, the ASC/JA will review the incident and when necessary follow-up the
     initial barment with a formal barment package signed by the 88 ABW/CC.
  2.5.11. Barment orders should be in writing and contain sufficient details to support
  prosecution by civilian authorities. The barment orders must also state a specific period of
  barment. Oral barment orders should be given only when time constraints prevent preparing
  a written order; they must be immediately followed-up in writing.
  2.5.12. Offenses warranting immediate barment and specified minimum duration of
  barment:

   leave time to attend the hearing.
      2.6.3.1. Hearing officers will make recommendations to the 88 MSG/CC who will render
      a decision. The decision of the 88 MSG/CC may be appealed in writing to the
      88 ABW/CV through ASC/JA. The 88 ABW/CV’s decision is final. One request for
      reconsideration may be made during the period of suspension/revocation. No further
      appeals or requests for reconsideration will be considered.

   The individual must have a valid driver’s license or be authorized partial or restricted driving
   privileges by proper civilian authority. NOTE: Being granted partial or restricted driving
   privileges by proper civilian authority does not automatically grant driving privileges on
   WPAFB. A request for restricted driving privileges may be submitted in writing at the due
   process hearing or at any other time to the 88 MSG/CC. Any restricted driving privileges
   granted will be specified in writing and provided to the offender. Restricted driving
   privileges may be granted for mission requirements, unusual personal or family hardship, or
   where there is a delay not attributable to you of more than 90 days in the disposition of the
   charge. Disapproved request for restricted driving privileges may be appealed to the
   88 ABW/CV on a one time basis. The decision of the 88 ABW/CV is final and cannot be
   appealed. Restricted driving privileges issued during a suspension are revoked when a
   revocation is enforced. The violator may petition for the restoration of all or partial driving
   privileges upon notification of the revocation.
2.8. Extensions of suspensions and revocations.
   2.8.1. The individual’s driving privileges will remain suspended or revoked indefinitely until
   the individual shows proof that he/she successfully completed an approved driver training
   course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed necessary.
   2.8.2. Any individual discovered driving on WPAFB while their state drivers license or base
   driving privileges are suspended or revoked will receive an additional two-year revocation
   IAW AFI 31-204, Table 5.1, Assessment 1.
   2.8.3. An individual discovered driving on WPAFB while on a two-year revocation will
   receive an indefinite revocation of installation driving privileges. Military personnel may
   also receive additional administrative or disciplinary action in accordance with the UCMJ.
   DoD civilian personnel may also receive administrative or disciplinary action in accordance
   with applicable guidance. Contractor or non-base connected personnel in violation of
   suspension or revocation may result in administrative debar under Title 18, USC Section
   1382. (See WPAFBI 31-101 for further information on debarment procedures.)
2.9. Reciprocal state-military action. 88 SFS/S5SR will notify the licensing authority of the
state where a license is issued as required by AFI 31-204, Paragraph 2.12.1.1.2. and AFMAN 31-
201V7, Paragraph 2.7.1.

        presents a safety hazard, the individual has not reported to Security Forces or the
        vehicle has not been moved after 72 hours from the date/time the DD Form 2504 was
        issued, 88 SFS/S2I will implement impoundment actions.
        4.2.2.6.4. Personnel must remain observant and look for signs of vehicle
        abandonment (leaves gathered around wheels, flat tires, expired tags or base

        appellant must provide the date, time (approximate), and location of the towing, and
        the year, make, model and color of the vehicle towed. The appellant will be notified
        in writing of the date and time of their appeal hearing by ASC/JA. The sole issue for
        determination in appeals of towing is the authority of the Security Forces to order the
        towing under this regulation, and AFI 31-204. Individuals who had their vehicles

        Notice (See DODD 5525.4), on POVs considered abandoned or improperly
        unattended. Document this action with an entry in the SF blotter.
        4.2.2.8.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the
        vehicle. Have the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If an
        approved towing service is used, complete a DD Form 2505 Abandoned Vehicle
        Removal Authorization according to DODD 5525.4.
           4.2.2.8.2.1. Approved towing services will be established through the use of a

           approved and added also at this time.
        4.2.2.8.3. After 88 SFS/S2I notifies them, the towing company will respond to the
        designated location of the tow within 2 hours. Failure to respond within 2 hours will
        result in the company being by-passed and the call for service offered to the next
        available towing company.

        the North, East, and West Lots.
        4.6.2.4.4.2. (Added-NASIC) Reserved Pool Parking spaces will be used on a
        first come, first served basis by individuals who have been issued a Reserved
        Parking Pool parking permit by NASIC/LGM. If no Reserved Pool Parking
        spaces are open, individuals assigned to Reserved Pool Parking must park in
        General Parking.
        4.6.2.4.4.3. (Added-NASIC) The number of Reserved Pool Parking spaces will
        be based on the number of eligible personnel for Reserved Pool Parking.
            4.6.2.4.4.3.1. (Added-NASIC) The number of Reserved Pool Parking spaces
            will not exceed 2/3 the number of those eligible.
            4.6.2.4.4.3.2. (Added-NASIC) NASIC/LGM will evaluate the number of
            Reserved Pool Parking spaces twice per year in each lot based on the
            monitored usage.
        4.6.2.4.4.4. (Added-NASIC) Personnel assigned to a Reserved Pool Parking
        Space will be issued a parking permit by NASIC/LGM. This parking permit will
        be used by the individual entitled to parking in the Reserved Parking Pool. The
        permit is not to be given to an unauthorized individual.
        4.6.2.4.4.5. (Added-NASIC) Reserved Pool Parking will be designated by metal
        signs stating, “Reserved Parking.”

            Visitor parking is restricted to no more than 2 hours. Visitors staying NASIC for
            longer than 2 hours should park in General Parking.
            4.6.2.4.4.7. (Added-NASIC) Commander’s Discretionary Parking is limited to

                4.6.2.4.4.7.1. (Added-NASIC) Commander’s Discretionary Parking spaces
                will be located in the North, East, and West Lots.
                4.6.2.4.4.7.2. (Added-NASIC) Commander’s Discretionary Parking spaces
                will be designated with a numbered sign. The number will be displayed when
                someone is assigned the spot for the day. The sign will be flipped up so the
                number is not displayed when no one is assigned the spot for the day. When
                the sign is flipped up, the parking space will be general parking for that day.
     4.6.2.5. Processing reserved parking requests.
        4.6.2.5.1. Request for reserved parking is coordinated through the real property
        building manager (RPBM) for approval/recommendation by the commander. For the
        purposes of this procedure, the commander is the unit commander or for facilities
        occupied by more than one unit, the senior officer exercising control over the facility.
        4.6.2.5.2. Unit commanders must approve or disapprove reserved parking requests
        for their facility prior to completion of AF Form 332. The RPBM for each facility is
        responsible for maintaining a listing and diagram of reserved parking slots. Any
        proposed changes to a facilities reserved parking plan must be agreed upon by all unit
        commanders who occupy the facility and incorporated into the consolidated parking
        plan for that facility.
        4.6.2.5.3. Business facilities that do not operate in conjunction with a designated
        squadron (i.e., AAFES, Commissary, and Credit Union) will coordinate all reserved
        parking requests through the Traffic Review Board for approval under the provisions
        of paragraph 4.6.2.4.1 for requesting reserved parking.
        4.6.2.5.4. The RPBM will evaluate each request and complete an AF Form 332, CE
        work order request.         The request will indicate the type of work requested,
        justification with a diagram of the target area and a letter of approval from the
        approving official. This package is forwarded to 88 ABW/CEMR to assign a CE
        work order number. 88 ABW/CEMR forwards the AF Form 332 to the Traffic
        Review Board for approval. The Traffic Review Board will meet as needed to review
        all traffic/parking related AF Form 332s. It will approve or disapprove the work
        orders and will prioritize the approved AF Form 332s. Approved work orders will be
        sent to 88 ABW/CEM for installation, according the priority set by the Traffic
        Review Board. Disapproved requests (i.e. exceeds the 20 percent limit, creates a
        traffic hazard etc.) will be returned to the originator. The requestor may appeal this
        decision by forwarding a letter to the 88 ABW/CE outlining why his/her reserved
        parking request should be reconsidered. The appeal will be reviewed by the full
        Traffic Review Board and a recommendation will be forwarded to the 88 MSG/CC,
        who will render a final decision.
26                      WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


        4.6.2.5.5. The RPBM is also responsible for completing a biennial review of the
        original or updated request. This review shall be documented and kept on file with
        the RPBM along with a legible copy of the current AF Form 332 and diagram that
        was approved by Traffic Review Board. This complete review will be submitted to
        88 ABW/CEM, who will forward the packages to the Traffic Review Board. This
        review must be submitted annually by 31 October.
        4.6.2.5.6. Within 90 days from the date of this instruction, each RPBM will submit
        an updated parking plan for his/her facility to the Traffic Review Board through
        88 ABW/CEM. Any reserved parking not approved within 90 days from the date of
        this instruction will be considered disapproved and no longer valid.
     4.6.2.6. Official business parking permits.
        4.6.2.6.1. Official business parking permit is defined as a pass authorizing
        individuals to park a POV in a GOV or “Mission” parking slot when performing
        official business. The permit is designed for units with few or no government
        vehicles available to accomplish the mission.
        4.6.2.6.2. Permits will be issued by 88 SFS Police Services section to the requestor’s
        unit and not to a particular vehicle/person. Only permits signed and issued by the
        authorizing 88 SFS official are valid on WPAFB. Permits are issued based on the
        mission needs. To keep the number of permits to a minimum, organizations with
        fewer than 50 people may be issued one permit. For organizations with more than 50,
        the total organizational strength will be calculated at two percent (rounded to the
        nearest full point) for additional permits. For example, an organization with 201
        people assigned multiplied by two percent would be eligible for 4.02 (rounded off to
        4) permits. It is imperative that commanders review the need prior to requesting
        permits. Permits will be issued on a case-by-case basis after review of circumstances
        surrounding the request. At a minimum, all requests must meet the general guidelines
        listed below.
            4.6.2.6.2.1. The organization has limited or no authorized government vehicles.
            Requester performs duties that require numerous daily or weekly trips. Requester
            must show or validate trips visiting facilities per workweek, mission impact if the
            pass is not issued and the commander authorization for the use of POVs while
            performing official duties.
            4.6.2.6.2.2. Requesters submit a letter and supporting documentation through
            their commander, director, or detachment chief to 88 SFS/S3SC (Police Services),
            who has program management responsibilities.
            4.6.2.6.2.3. Individuals may use the pass only when performing government
            duties and not for personal use or convenience. Abuse of the permit will result in
            immediate termination of the permit and the appropriate Commander or First
            Sergeant will be notified, explaining the circumstances for confiscation of the
            permit.
            4.6.2.6.2.4. Permits are issued for a one calendar year period, from 1 January to
            31 December.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                              27


  4.6.3. Parking wardens. 88 SFS/S5SR will manage the installation parking warden program.
     4.6.3.1. The unit commander, director or detachment chief, exercising jurisdiction over a
     particular facility or building, will appoint parking wardens (designated military or Air
     Force Civilian Employees) for specific building/facility parking lots. They will also
     direct/dictate the scope of operations, time spent dealing with parking issues. This is an
     additional duty, therefore parking wardens are not appointed solely to focus on parking,
     but to assist the RPBM in enforcing parking plans and to randomly monitor parking areas
     or deal with illegal parking issues. Nobody may write a parking ticket without having
     been appointed in writing as specified above and having attended the specified training in
     paragraph 4.6.3.3 below.
     4.6.3.2. A listing of a unit’s parking wardens will be provided to 88 SFS/S5SR initially
     and/or when there are changes made. Parking wardens will follow the same ticket
     writing procedures as the Security Forces member. The main difference is the special
     instructions on the reverse of the pink copy of the DD Form 1408 that directs the violator
     to contact the monitor who issued the ticket within 24 hours or next business day, instead
     of the SFCC.
     4.6.3.3. 88 SFS/S5SR will ensure parking wardens are trained on specific parking
     warden duties. There will be initial training when assigned and remedial training as
     needed.
         4.6.3.3.1. Parking wardens will maintain a roster of reserved parking spaces assigned
         to their building/facility and the people authorized to use reserved parking slots.
         Handicapped, GMV, and mission parking are reserved, but are not assigned to any
         one specific person or vehicle.
         4.6.3.3.2. Parking wardens will enforce compliance with these parking rules and
         regulation by writing parking tickets and/or calling security forces to report a vehicle
         for towing, according to this instruction. Tickets will be received into 88 SFS/S5SR
         within five days of the date of issue.
  4.6.4. General rules for stopping, standing, or parking. No person shall stop, stand, or park
  in any of the following places, except when in compliance with the law or directions from a
  Security Forces member or official traffic control device.
     4.6.4.1. On, in front of, or blocking private or public driveways, sidewalks, pedestrian
     crosswalks, or entrances/exit ways, or so near as to interfere with the obstructed use of
     the above.
     4.6.4.2. In any way that obstructs the visibility of a traffic control device. This includes
     the parking of recreational vehicles (RV) in the base housing area.
     4.6.4.3. In fire lanes, whether posted or not (unmarked fire lanes include open areas
     between buildings and those areas within 20 feet of a building, except when authorized
     parking is posted). This requirement ensures adequate space is available for mobile fire
     equipment.
     4.6.4.4. Within 10 feet of a fire hydrant.
28                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


     4.6.4.5. Within 20 feet of a driveway entrance/exit way to any fire, ambulance, crash or
     explosive ordinance disposal station, or alert crew vehicle. Note: This does not apply to
     emergency vehicles.
     4.6.4.6. Within 25 feet of or in, an intersection.
     4.6.4.7. Adjacent to any red or yellow painted curb/edge line.
     4.6.4.8. In excess of time specified by time limited parking signs.
     4.6.4.9. In designated reserved/parking areas in the base family housing area.
     4.6.4.10. On the side of the street facing oncoming traffic. Vehicles parked at an angle
     within parking areas will not be parked facing the flow of traffic. Exception:
     Maintenance and emergency vehicles may be temporarily parked in these areas while
     performing official duties.
     4.6.4.11. Using two or more designated parking spaces. Vehicles parked in marked
     places shall be within the lines painted, or if directed to park in an unmarked area by a
     Security Forces member, not to extend beyond that area reasonably necessary for the
     vehicle.
     4.6.4.12. With the exception of emergency response vehicles (during a response),
     persons operating or in charge of a motor vehicle will not allow it to stand unattended
     while the engine is running.

     4.6.4.18. Off paved areas or any seeded or unimproved area anywhere on WPAFB,
     unless such areas have been specifically designated and properly marked for parking.
     Exception: Maintenance and emergency vehicles may be temporarily parked in these
     areas while performing official duties.
     4.6.4.19. Track, race/stock cars, unmounted truck type campers, unmounted camper
     shells, utility and special purpose vehicles will not be parked along roadways, curbside,
     or in non-designated vehicle parking areas or spaces. Such vehicles will only be parked
     in the RV storage lot.
     4.6.4.20. In driveways or parking areas in such a manner that any portion of the vehicle
     extends onto or blocks a roadway or sidewalk so as to hinder pedestrian or vehicular
     traffic.
  4.6.5. Flight line parking: Parking within the flight line fence must be approved by the
  Chief, Airfield Management (88 OSS/OSAM) or a designated representative from Building
  206, area C.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                 29


   4.6.6. Parking violations: A DD Form 1408 will be completed for all parking violations.
   The citation will be issued to all persons employed on base, all persons employed by the Air
   Force or the Department of Defense or their dependents. Parking citations will be charged
   against the registering party, unless it is shown that another individual is responsible for the
   infraction.
   4.6.7. Housing area parking:
       4.6.7.1. In the Pine Estates, Green Acres, and the Brick Quarters, on-street parallel
       parking is permitted, according to the ORC, except where a no-parking zone is indicated
       by a yellow line on the pavement.
       4.6.7.2. In the Prairies at Wright Field, parking is permitted only in garages, parking lots,
       or in painted parking stalls, except on Spinning Road. On-street parallel parking on
       Spinning Road is permitted only in painted parking stalls across from the community
       center. Parking in the trailer court is permitted only on the parking pads. Garages are
       provided for residents. Because of the limited number of available parking spaces in the
       Prairies housing area, it is imperative that residents use garages for parking to the fullest
       extent possible. Vehicles will not be parked in any manner that obstructs driveways,
       garages or hinders safe and efficient movement of traffic.
       4.6.7.3. In the Woods at Wright Field, parking is permitted in driveways, garages or
       along the roadway on Shields Dr., McClellan Dr. and DuPont Way. Parking on roadways
       in other location hinders safe and efficient movement of traffic. Vehicles will not be
       parked in any manner that obstructs driveways, garages or limits views of sidewalks.
       4.6.7.4. Oversized POVs including, but not limited to, motor homes, utility trailers, and
       camper trucks, are authorized to be kept on base. They will be stored in the RV lots
       provided by MWR. Oversized POVs in base housing may be exempt from this
       requirement if in daily use or for up to three days, only after the sponsor notifies the
       SFCC.
       4.6.7.5. Vehicle maintenance and repair. POVs may be taken to the base Auto Hobby
       Shop, AAFES service station or off base for major repairs. Minor repairs, such as tire
       changes or rotation, light bulb replacement, etc., may be done in public areas.
4.7. Traffic violation reports.
   4.7.1. Moving violations. Anyone operating a motor vehicle, including a bicycle, on a public
   street or highway that violates a provision of this regulation regarding the operation of a
   motor vehicle or any provision of the ORC has committed a moving violation. Except as
   otherwise set out herein, DD Forms 1408; 1805, Violation Notice; and/or AF Form 3545,
   Incident Report, are authorized methods of documenting and/or enforcing the requirements
   of this instruction. Personnel from other installations will be identified and their infraction
   forwarded to the appropriate agency for action. 88 SFS/S5SR is responsible for distribution
   of information concerning infractions.
   4.7.2. A DD Form 1408 may be completed, as appropriate, on all active duty personnel,
   cadets/midshipmen of the military academies to include the Coast Guard academy, reservists
   on active duty orders or performing inactive duty training, including commuting to and from
   training and guardsmen in federal service, under Title 10 of the United States Code. Title 10
30                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


  status is reflected on the guardsmen's orders. Issue a DD Form 1408 for civilian personnel
  operating a GOV and juvenile traffic offenders. The applicable forms will be forwarded to
  the appropriate commander or supervisor for action. Juvenile offenders will be processed
  through the ASC/JA for referral to the juvenile court for the county where they reside.
  4.7.3. A DD Form 1805 will be completed for all traffic violations which will be referred to
  Federal Magistrate’s court by ASC/JA. Note: Do not issue a DD Form 1805 for any offense
  that will be reported on an AF Form 3545 (i.e. speeding that result in a DUI). This includes
  all offenders who are civilian personnel not operating GOVs, reservists not on active duty
  orders or performing inactive duty training, including commuting to and from training and
  guardsmen in federal service under Title 10 of the United States Code, adult dependents, and
  non-base connected personnel. All such offenses referred to the Federal Magistrate’s Court
  will be handled in that system for any criminal penalties. Referral to the Federal Magistrate’s
  Court neither precludes nor requires further administrative action, based on the traffic offense
  involved.
     4.7.3.1. Persons receiving a DD Form 1805 are given the option of forfeiting collateral
     for minor traffic violations. More serious charges require court appearance. All
     individuals have the option to appear and contest any citation.
     4.7.3.2. 88 SFS/S5SR will not assess any points against an individual’s base driving
     record if they are acquitted or have their citation dismissed by the court.
     4.7.3.3. Military/civilian supervisor action. On receipt of the white (action) copy of the
     DD Form 1408 the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander exercising disciplinary
     authority over the violator will conduct an inquiry into the incident and take appropriate
     action. The action taken will be annotated on the reverse side of the white copy and
     returned to 88 SFS/S5SR. The Chief, Reports & Analysis (88 SFS/S5SR) will review the
     action for regulatory compliance. Completed actions will be updated in the Security
     Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) and filed as required by AFMAN 33-
     363.
  4.7.4. Violation appeal procedures. Any individual receiving a DD Form 1408 who believes
  they have been unfairly or unlawfully cited may contest the validity of the citation.
     4.7.4.1. The individual who received the DD Form 1408 may (rebut) challenge the
     validity of the 1408 within 10 days from the time his/her supervisor, first sergeant, or
     commander notifies him/her that they are in receipt of the white (action) copy of the DD
     Form 1408. This appeal is to the supervisor, first sergeant or commander, not the
     88 SFS. The individual may, at the supervisor’s, first sergeant's or commander’s
     discretion, make an oral presentation, as well.
     4.7.4.2. Within 3 days, the supervisor, first sergeant or commander will render an
     opinion based on factual matters and notify the individual of their decision on the appeal
     and will require the individual to acknowledge receipt of that notification.
     4.7.4.3. If the supervisor, first sergeant or commander agrees the citation is not valid, the
     entire report of action taken is sent to 88 SFS/S5SR and will reflect this determination
     and the reasons for it. 88 SFS/S5SR will contact the patrolman/parking warden and
     obtain a written statement of the facts surrounding the issuing of the citation. This
     statement will be included in the rebuttal package. The CSF will either concur or non-
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI31-204_NASICSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                  31


       concur with the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander. If the CSF concurs,
       88 SFS/S5SR will annotate the individual’s base driving record as appropriate and notify
       the individual. If the CSF non-concurs, the entire package will be forwarded to
       88 MSG/CD for a decision on the validity of the citation. 88 MSG/CD will notify
       88 SFS/S5SR of his/her decision and the individual’s base driving record will be
       annotated appropriately. The decision of 88 MSG/CD is final.
       4.7.4.4. If the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander determines the citation is valid,
       the entire report of action is sent to 88 SFS/S5SR and will reflect this determination and
       the reasons for it. 88 SFS/S5SR will annotate the individual’s base driving record as
       appropriate.
       4.7.4.5. If the individual wishes to appeal the supervisor's, first sergeant's or
       commander's decision, a letter of appeal requesting 88 MSG/CD to render a decision
       must be sent to 88 SFS/S5SR within 10 days of being notified of the supervisor's first
       sergeant's or commander's decision. 88 MSG/CD will notify 88 SFS/S5SR of his/her
       decision and the individual’s base driving record will be annotated appropriately. The
       decision of 88 MSG/CD is final.
4.8. Operation of bicycles.
   4.8.1. Every bicycle in use from one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise,
   and at any other time when there are unfavorable atmospheric conditions or where there is
   not sufficient natural light to render discernible persons, shall be equipped with the
   following:
       4.8.1.1. A lamp on the front that shall emit a white light visible from a distance of at
       least five hundred feet to the front.
       4.8.1.2. A red reflector on the rear of a type approved by the director of public safety that
       shall be visible from all distances from one hundred feet to six hundred feet to the rear
       when directly in front of lawful lower beams of headlamps on a motor vehicle.
       4.8.1.3. A lamp emitting a red light visible from a distance of five hundred feet to the
       rear shall be used in addition to the red reflector.
       4.8.1.4. An essentially colorless reflector on the front.
       4.8.1.5. Either with tires with retro reflective sidewalls or with an essentially colorless or
       amber reflector mounted on the spokes of the front wheel and an essentially colorless or
       red reflector mounted on the spokes of the rear wheel. Each reflector shall be visible on
       each side of the wheel from a distance of six hundred feet when directly in front of lawful
       lower beams of headlamps on a motor vehicle. Retro reflective tires or reflectors shall be

4.9. Wear of Bicycle Helmets. Bicycle riders on military installations are required to wear
approved bicycle helmets. This includes dependents, contractors, and retirees. An approved
helmet must meet American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or SNELL Memorial
Foundation Guidelines. Workers operating bicycles in areas that require the use of ANSI-
approved helmets (hard hats) for protection from falling and flying objects are allowed to use
those helmets instead of approved bicycle helmets. The only exception is for workers operating
bicycles in industrial or flight line areas designated no-hat areas due to potential of foreign object
damage to aircraft need not wear the bicycle helmet; operators of three-wheeled bicycles are not
required to wear the bicycle helmet.
