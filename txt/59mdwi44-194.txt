1. Overview. The purpose of the 59 MDW Form 154 is to streamline communication between
the provider, patient and unit of assignment. The 59 MDW Form 154 also serves as a temporary
duty restriction notice and an appointment reminder to ensure trainees are restricted from
training requirements as deemed necessary by a medical provider. This includes being able to
return to full training once medically cleared and being reassigned to medical hold units when
deemed necessary.
2. Personnel Responsibilities. The Reid Trainee Health Clinic staff members are responsible
for distributing the 59 MDW Forms 154 to trainees upon completion of each appointment. The
patient will have a copy on them at all times and deliver the unit copy to their unit to ensure
physical/duty limitations are allowed and complied with for Basic Military Trainees. Individual
units for each Basic Military Trainee are responsible for gathering the appropriate information
and disposing of the form in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.
3. Forms Submission. The 59MDW Form 154 is destroyed after the pertinent information has
been collected and in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.
