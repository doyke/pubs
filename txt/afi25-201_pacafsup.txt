SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include clarifying the types of support agreements and modification of the roles and
responsibilities of the Installation Commander, Receiver Support Agreement Manager (SAM),
and Supplier SAM. This revision replaces intra-service categories of support with specific core
support activities within the Functional Communities (Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 4-
0, Combat Support) and Installation Support Categories (DoDI 4000.19). This instruction does
not address support agreements contemplated by the streamlined authority given to the Military
Services to enter into an agreement with a state or local government subject to Title 10 United
States Code (USC) Section 2336, Intergovernmental Support Agreements with State and Local
Governments, and addressed in enclosure 3, paragraph 1a(3) of DoDI 4000.19. Such
agreements, identified herein as a community inter-governmental support agreement, must be
approved by Secretary of the Air Force (SAF)/IEI. Installation Commanders wishing to enter
into such an agreement must contact SAF/IEI for direction and approval and guidance under the
Air Force Community Partnership Program. This revision also defines the impasse process and
reinstates the annual budget and triennial support agreement reviews. This revision refers the
user to DoDI 4000.19 for the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) samples, identifies early National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                                                                         3


compliance, and adds verbiage to allow support agreements to augment contingency plans. This
instruction prescribes that if the Installation Commander wants to use a contracted service in a
support agreement the Installation Commander will comply with Air Force Instruction AFI 63-
138, Acquisition of Services to obtain the service prior to using the contracted service in a
support agreement. This instruction identifies that the Installation Commanders (as a Supplier)
should develop and use an Installation Support Agreement Catalog (ISAC) or equivalent
document as part of the support agreement process. This instruction replaces the old “Suggested
Agreement Process Flow Chart” with a revised support agreement process flow. This revision
removes the Annual Financial Management Review Flow Chart, Manpower Annex, and the
Intra-service and Inter-service Funding Annex (Suggested Format) and adds a new Attachment
4, Sample ISAC Approval Page and a new Attachment 6, Sample Support Agreement Receivers
Profile.

(PACAF) This revision supplements the newly revised AFI 25-201. Reference to the
Community of Practice (CoP) has been replaced with “SharePoint Site”. Impasses unresolved at
the MAJCOM Functional level after 180 days will be passed to the Command Support
Agreement Manager (SAM) for elevation to the appropriate Headquarters Air Force (HAF)
Functional office for resolution. PACAF Supplier SAMs cannot enforce certain administrative
requirements of this AFI on Receiver organizations as pointed out at appropriate paragraphs of
this supplement. A timeline has been provided to complete the triennial review of all support
agreements. Functional Area Agreement Coordinator (FAAC) and Resource Advisor (RA)
responsibilities have been further clarified.

                                            Chapter 1

        SUPPORT AGREEMENT OVERVIEW AND RELATED SUPPORT AREAS

1.1. Overview. This instruction establishes uniform and consistent procedures for developing
and managing intra-service support agreements (IAW AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements). It also
establishes uniform and consistent procedures for developing and managing inter-service (also
called intra-agency) and inter-agency support agreements (IAW DoDI 4000.19). These support
agreements will apply to core support activities provided under the Functional Communities
(identified in AFDD 4-0, Combat Support) and Installation Support Categories (identified in
DoDI 4000.19). This instruction does not cover community inter-governmental support
agreements subject to 10 USC § 2336 and referenced in DoDI 4000.19, Enclosure 3 paragraph
1a(3). Approval, coordination and guidance for community inter-governmental support
agreements must be obtained from SAF/IEI.
1.2. Support Agreements. DoD and AF policies direct that support agreements be developed
between affected Suppliers and Receivers to document recurring support in order to provide the
unit commander with the capability to ensure resources are expended wisely and to help
eliminate unnecessary resource duplication. Support agreements are also used for single or non-
recurring reimbursable support and non-reimbursable support. Support agreements may be used
to augment contingency documents such as Base Support Plans (BSP), Programming Plans and
Operations Plans (PPLANs and OPLANs), Concepts of Operations (CONOPS), Installation
Deployment Plans (IDPs), Emergency Plans, etc., but will not be used in lieu of these
contingency documents. An Air Force signatory to a support agreement must have appropriate
delegated authority for executing the agreement. This AFI only provides the procedural
framework establishing and managing such support agreements. When a type of support
requires external approval (e.g., MAJCOM may direct that a specific agreement must be
approved at the MAJCOM-level before being signed), the Installation Commander must obtain
this external approval prior to the agreement being signed.
     1.2.1. Support agreements document recurring support (e.g., janitorial services, flight line
     operations, etc.), non-reimbursable support, and single or non-recurring reimbursable support
     IAW DoDI 4000.19, AFPD 25-2, AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures,
     and this instruction. A support agreement can take the form of a Defense Department (DD)
     Form 1144, Support Agreement, an MOA, or an MOU. Support agreements belong in one of
     the following principal categories:
        1.2.1.1. Intra-service support agreements (within the Air Force) are for Air Force to Air
        Force units to include Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). When the ANG is the
        Supplier of AF Active Duty or ANG property, with 100% AF appropriations (e.g., funds
        provided by the AF instead of the States), ANG support to an AF unit will be considered
        to be intra-service. ANG to ANG (between different states) support agreements will also
        be considered intra-service. AFPD 25-2 addresses AF intra-service support agreement
        policy.
        1.2.1.2. Inter-service support agreements (also called intra-agency support agreements)
        document support between Air Force units and DoD Components. When ANG is the
        Receiver on AF Active Duty base with AF property and AF appropriations, the
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                            7


     relationship is also considered an inter-service or intra-agency support agreement. DoDI
     4000.19 addresses intra-agency support agreement policy.
         1.2.1.2.1. IAW DoDI 4000.19, support will be reimbursable to the extent that the
         provision of specified support for a Receiver increases the Supplier’s direct cost. The
         direct costs must be measurable and directly attributed to the support received and
         should be expressed in units of support appropriate to the type of service
         reimbursement charges. Reimbursement for direct costs associated with Defense
         Working Capital Fund (DWCF) mission products and services will be based on the
         approved stabilized rate.
         1.2.1.2.2. IAW DoDI 4000.19, indirect costs are normally not reimbursable for intra-
         service and inter-service (or intra-agency) agreements. Indirect costs may be
         included in the reimbursable charges to the extent these charges have a significant
         relationship to providing support and benefit to the Receiver. For DWCF activities,
         indirect costs will not be included in reimbursement charges except those included in
         the stabilized rates.
         1.2.1.2.3. IAW DoDI 4000.19, existing support agreements in which the Air Force or
         a DoD Component is the Supplier that are in effect upon publication of this
         instruction will be modified to comply with the requirements of this instruction and
         DoDI 4000.19 or terminated no later than 3 years from the date of this instruction.
         1.2.1.2.4. Facilities accepted by the Receiver are understood to be in an “as-is”
         condition. Site Activation Task Forces will identify all known requirements to repair,
         modernize, recapitalize, and fit out the facilities to the Receiver’s mission
         requirements prior to the mission beddown and will be included in basing approval.
         At a minimum and prior to beddown the Receiver will fund the installation of utility
         meters, as required, to ensure fair and equitable billing. The Receiver and the
         Receiver’s parent organization will prioritize these mission requirements and provide
         funds to the Supplier for execution as resources permit. When the Receiver no
         longer needs the provided facility, the Receiver’s organization will provide funding to
         return the facility in like-condition as it was received or demolition funding at the
         discretion of the Installation Commander. (T-1)
     1.2.1.3. Inter-service (on intra-agency) support agreements for basing decisions at Joint
     Bases and AF Installations will be guided by AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing to obtain a
     basing decision prior to the establishment of a support agreement. For additional
     guidance, contact Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF)/A8PB, Strategic
     Basing Division.
     1.2.1.4. Inter-agency support agreements document support between the Air Force and a
     non-DoD Federal agency or federally-recognized Indian tribe. Support agreements
     between ANG and non-DoD Federal agencies or federally-recognized Indian tribes are
     also considered inter-agency. DoDI 4000.19 addresses inter-agency support agreement
     policy.
  1.2.2. DoDI 4000.19 governs the policy, procedures, and general guidance for intra-agency
  support agreements (within a DoD Component and between DoD Components) and inter-
  agency support agreements (between a DoD Component and a non-DoD Federal agency or a
 8                                                   AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


     federally-recognized Indian tribe) in support of Title 10 USC, Armed Forces and Title 32
     USC, National Guard. The provisions of DoDI 4000.19 for intra-agency support agreements
     can generally be applied to intra-service support agreements under AFPD 25-2. Although it
     also governs the policy, procedures, and general guidance for community inter-governmental
     support agreements (between a DoD Component and a state or local government) those
     agreements are not covered by this instruction.
     1.2.3. Inter-agency reimbursable support agreements must comply with 31 USC § 1535,
     (2006), The Economy Act and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 17.5, Inter-agency
     Acquisition under the Economy Act.
1.3. DD Form 1144, Support Agreement. IAW DoDI 4000.19, a DD Form 1144 will be used
to document recurring reimbursable support where the Air Force or DoD Component is the
Supplier. Non-reimbursable support may also be included on the form but it will not be used to
document only non-reimbursable support unless both parties agree to use a DD Form 1144 in
lieu of an MOA or MOU. See Attachment 2 for details of the DD Form 1144 entries. When a
non-DoD Federal Agency or federally-recognized Indian tribe is the Supplier, the Air Force may
use the Supplier’s standard support agreement documents, DD Form 1144, or the Financial
Management Service (FMS) Form 7600, Interagency Agreement (IAA) – Agreement between
Federal Agencies for these support agreements with the Air Force as agreed between the Air
Force and the other party.
1.4. Memoranda of Agreement or Understanding (MOA or MOU).
     1.4.1. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). In the absence of a DD Form 1144 or
     equivalent support agreement, an MOA will be used to document the specific terms and
     responsibilities that two or more parties agree to in writing, especially those that involve
     reimbursement. MOAs can be used to document a single reimbursable purchase, non-
     recurring reimbursable support, and non-reimbursable support. Consecutive reimbursable
     MOAs shall not be used for similar single reimbursable purchases or non-recurring
     reimbursable support to circumvent the use of DD Form 1144 or equivalent support
     agreement unless the conditions in paragraph 3.2.6 apply. Any obligation of funds in
     support of the MOA will be accomplished using a DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental
     Purchase Request (or equivalent form with a non-DoD Federal agency or federally-
     recognized Indian tribe). The obligation of funds by the parties is subject to availability of
     appropriated funds pursuant to the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) 7000.14-
     R, DoD Financial Management Policy and Procedures. Regardless of the format used,
     DoDI 4000.19, Enclosure 3, Figure 1, Sample MOA Template identifies the information that
     will be included in an MOA.
     1.4.2. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). An MOU will be used to document issues of
     general understanding between two or more parties that do not involve reimbursement.
     Regardless of the format used, DoDI 4000.19, Enclosure 3, Figure 2, Sample MOU Template
     identifies the information that will be included in an MOU.
     1.4.3. Command-Level MOA. This broad MOA is an agreement between or among Major
     Commands (MAJCOMs), Numbered Air Forces (NAFs), or MAJCOM-equivalent
     Commands to identify parameters for developing support agreements between subordinate
     units. The Suppliers and Receivers at the installation level use these broad MOAs as a
     source document in addressing the provision of services, funding, and reimbursement
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                             9


   arrangements for continued support. However, an MOA alone will not be used to affect the
   transfer of funds or other resources; only the DD Form 448 will serve that purpose for MOAs
   with a reimbursable requirement.
   1.4.3. (PACAF) Signatory authority for command level agreements is held by
   COMPACAF and is hereby delegated to PACAF/A4. Further delegation of authority will be
   accomplished on a case-by-case basis as approved by COMPACAF. Numbered Air Forces
   (NAFs) are allowed to consummate Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs)/Memorandum of
   Understandings (MOUs) without HQ PACAF coordination as long as the scope of support,
   whether reimbursable support is provided or not, applies only to their area of responsibility
   (AOR). NAF Commanders are neither authorized to negotiate a command-to-command
   agreement, nor commit PACAF resources beyond what already exists and are available
   within their AOR. NAF Commanders may in broad terms of an MOA commit installations,
   but may not sign agreements committing specific installation resources. This signatory
   authority rests with the Installation (or equivalent Group) Commander, or that Commander’s
   delegate.
   1.4.4. Functional Area MOU. The Supplier’s subordinate units may use MOUs between
   functional areas to document mutually-agreed upon roles and responsibilities, such as
   statement of facts, intentions, and procedures for future actions that can be used in a formal
   support agreement. The Functional OPR (e.g., Civil Engineer, Security Forces) will draft,
   sign, and maintain these documents, which are procedural or technical in nature. The
   Supplier’s Manpower and Financial organizations and the Judge Advocate (JA) office will
   review and coordinate on functional area MOUs for reimbursement, manpower, and legal
   implications that will need to be incorporated in a formal support agreement. The functional
   OPR maintains these MOUs and provides a copy to the Supplier SAM for inclusion in the
   applicable support agreements.
1.5. Installation Support Agreement Catalog (ISAC). The Installation Commander should
develop an ISAC or equivalent document that contains a consolidated list of the installation’s
core support activities provided under the Functional Communities (AFDD 4-0) and Installation
Support Categories (DoDI 4000.19) and corresponding level of support for each activity. The
Installation Commander should use the Support Agreement Catalog located on the Support
Agreement SharePoint (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-LG-00-17/default.aspx) as a guide when
developing their ISAC.
1.6. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs). Air Force GSUs will request support from the
closest DoD installation IAW this instruction and DoDI 4000.19. When an AF installation can
provide the “best value” support to a GSU, the AF installation will provide support to the GSU
regardless of parent Command or DoD Component.
1.7. Major Range and Test Facility Bases. Department of Defense Directive (DoDD)
3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB), covers certain specialized range
documentation; however, base support provided to range users is still to be covered by a support
agreement IAW this instruction and DoDI 4000.19.
1.7. (PACAF)In accordance with DODD 3200. 11, Major Range and Test Facility Bases,
Enclosure 2, paragraph E2.3, AIR FORCE ACTIVITIES: There are no Major Range and
Test Facility Bases in PACAF. This paragraph does not apply to any PACAF bases.
 10                                                 AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


1.8. Support That Does Not Fall Under DoDI 4000. 19 or This Instruction. This instruction
does not cover the exceptions identified below or outlined in DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 2b.
   1.8.1. Obtaining Support through AF contractors. Individuals will comply with AFI 63-138
   for acquiring any service from a private contractor. Contact AF Program Execution Office
   (AFPEO)/CM for additional guidance.
Note: Once the service contract is signed the Supplier can use this contracted service to provide
support to a Receiver as part of a support agreement.
   1.8.1. (PACAF) MOAs, MOUs, or other Support Agreements will not be entered into with
   a private entity other than not for profit private organizations, as required, e.g, Boy Scouts of
   America, American Red Cross, and other organizations as outlined in paragraph 1.9.6., or
   local similar type organizations. The requirement for support for contractors will be included
   in the contract developed by the originating contracting agency. Refer all inquiries and
   requests from contractors to their originating contracting agency. Installations may enter into
   a support agreement to provide installation support and other support to contractor personnel
   with the government agency owning the contract. The originating contracting agency will
   coordinate with the providing organization to determine method of payment for
   reimbursement for support (see AFI 65-601, Vol 1 Chapter 7). Support agreements, MOAs,
   or MOUs cannot be used in lieu of a contract or to amend or change a contract. The
   originating contracting agency is responsible to ensure current accounting guidelines are
   followed to prevent double payment by the Air Force.
   1.8.2. Support In Lieu of War or Contingency Plans. Support agreements are not a suitable
   means to document support for war, Stability Operations, or exercise requirements. These
   requirements will be documented in appropriate support, operational, or deployment plans,
   such as BSPs, PPLANs, OPLANs, CONOPS, Concept Plans (CONPLANs), Installation
   Deployment Plans, and Emergency Plans (e.g., Installation Emergency Management Plan
   (IEMP) 10-2, Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP), Civil Engineer Contingency
   Response Plan (CRP)). Support agreements may be used to augment these documents, but
   will not be used in lieu of these documents.
   1.8.3. Support for Grants, International, Commercial, and Acquisitions. The guidance
   provided by this instruction does not apply to grants, international agreements, commercial
   activities, or acquisition purchases under the FAR. Individuals will comply with DoDD
   5530.3, International Agreements, for international agreements.
   1.8.4. Granting Use of Air Force Real Property. A support agreement is not a substitute for
   a real estate instrument that may be required IAW legal requirements, Office of the Secretary
   of Defense (OSD) and AF policies, for example AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of
   Air Force Real Property.
   1.8.5. Civilian Provided Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Support. Installations will not
   establish a support agreement with civilian bomb squads to respond to AF installation
   accidents that involve military ordnance, aircraft with military ordnance or cartridge actuated
   devices, and any other military assets that contain explosive material. Allowing civilian
   bomb squad units to respond to military ordnance is a safety hazard and may violate Title 40,
   Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 300, National Oil and Hazardous Substances
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                              11


   Pollution Contingency Plan. See paragraph 1.11 for guidance on DoD Provided EOD
   Support.
   1.8.6. Joint Use of Military and Civilian Flying Facilities. This instruction does not apply to
   civilian use of Air Force airfields or Air Force use of public airports and joint use agreements
   that may be required in accordance with AFPD 10-10, Joint Use of Military and Civilian
   Flying Facilities and AFI 10-1002, Agreements for Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields.
   For additional guidance, contact HQ USAF/A3O-B, Directorate of Bases, Ranges, and Air
   Systems.
   1.8.7. ANG and AFRC Joint Use Agreements (JUAs). This instruction does not apply to
   ANG and AFRC JUAs. Refer to ANG Pamphlet (PAM), 32-1001, Airport Joint Use
   Agreements for Military Use of Civilian Airfields and AFRC Handbook 32-1001, Standard
   Facility Requirements, for information on JUA policy, guidance and format.
   1.8.8. Mutual Aid Agreements (MAA). This instruction does not apply to MAAs for fire
   emergency services (FES) or reciprocal fire protection agreements for mutual aid to local
   communities. Refer to AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program for information on
   MAA guidance and format. For additional guidance, contact Air Force Civil Engineer
   Center (AFCEC)/CX-CXF, Readiness Directorate, FES.
Note: If the agreement is subject to 10 USC § 2336 or an installation is interested in pursuing a
community inter-governmental support agreement as referenced in DoDI 4000.19, they must
notify SAF/IEI early in the process of the intent to pursue the agreement and must obtain
SAF/IEI approval prior to the agreement being signed. Community inter-governmental support
agreements are not covered by this AFI.
   1.8.9. Service Level Agreements (SLAs). SLAs are initiated as required by communications
   directives and are technical arrangements that fall outside of the normal support agreement
   program as governed by this instruction. SLAs are governed by AFI 33-115, Volume 1,
   Chapter 13, Network Operations (NETOPS).
   1.8.10. Air Traffic Control Letter of Agreement (LOA). LOAs are arrangements that fall
   outside the support agreement program. Refer to AFI 13-204, Volume 3, Airfield Operations
   Procedures and Programs, for information on Air Traffic Control LOA and format.
   1.8.11. Regulated Service Organizations such as a bank or credit union are charged for
   installation support services on the basis of existing directives or contracts. Air Force
   officials will not enter into a support agreement with regulated service organizations. Refer
   to DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 5, Chapter 34, Disbursing Policy, Financial Institutions on
   DoD Installations, for information on dealing with banks and credit unions.
   1.8.12. Executive Orders and public law permit, and in some cases may mandate, the DoD to
   provide explosive and narcotic detector dog support to Civilian Law Enforcement Agency
   (CLEA) for dignitary protection and drug interdiction. Civilian Support Release and
   Reimbursement Agreements will be accomplished for direct routine request. Refer to AFI
   31-121, Military Working Dog Program, for coordination requirements and for formatting.
   1.8.13. Support to or from a state or local government authorized under 10 USC § 2336 are
   overseen by the Air Force Community Partnership Program Office (SAF/IEI). Contact
   SAF/IEI for procedures on this type of agreement.
 12                                                 AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


1.9. Special Support Conditions. Air Force, as a Supplier, will provide support for the
following Receivers IAW the applicable governing documents or funding exceptions.
   1.9.1. Army Veterinary Service. The status of the United States (US) Army Veterinary
   Service on Air Force installations is governed by an MOU dated 20 August 2003 between the
   Surgeon Generals of the two Services. It specifies that “US Army Veterinary Service, as the
   Executive Agent for DoD Veterinary Services (Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 48-131,
   Veterinary Health Services) is considered an integral part of the local AF medical staff on the
   AF installation.” Support agreements are not required as a condition of authorizing support
   to US Army Veterinary Services located on AF installations; however, a wing-level MOU
   may be established to specify the services and support provided to the installation and
   veterinary unit.
   1.9.2. United States Postal Service (USPS). The status of USPS offices on military
   installations is governed by the USPS Handbook PO-630, Post Offices Serving DoD
   Installations. In effect, this commits DoD to provide “adequate facilities” for civilian post
   offices located at military installations solely in support of the unit’s mission; however,
   janitorial services, utilities, and local telephone service shall be furnished on a reimbursable
   basis. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs will establish a support agreement to document the
   level of support the installation will provide to the USPS.
   1.9.3. Aviation Engine Oil Analysis Program. AFI 21-124, Oil Analysis Program, is for
   non-depot Oil Analysis Program laboratories to provide Nondestructive Inspections
   laboratory analysis of aero engine oil samples IAW DoD policy.
   1.9.4. Civilian Personnel Servicing Arrangements (CPSAs). CPSAs are governed by AFI
   36-105, Civilian Personnel Servicing Arrangements. If inter-agency civilian personnel
   support is involved, reference the current CPSA in the support agreement.
   1.9.5. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Document Services. The current support agreement
   between Headquarters DLA and Headquarters Air Force (HAF) is that DLA Document
   Services will be a tenant and occupy AF real estate and facilities, and receive the same level
   of support as the AF supplier’s units (i.e., non-reimbursable support).
   1.9.6. Community Service Organizations. IAW DoDD 1000.26E, Support for Non-Federal
   Entities Authorized to Operate on DoD Installations, DoDI 1000.15, Procedures and Support
   for Non-Federal Entities Authorized to Operate on DoD Installations, DoDI 1015.9,
   Professional United States Scouting Organization Operations at United States Military
   Installations Located Overseas, and applicable delegated authorities, the Installation
   Commander will provide adequate space (when available) and cover custodial and utilities
   for that space within their existing budgets to the greatest extent determined practical to
   Community Service Organizations such as the American Red Cross, the Boy and Girl Scouts,
   Civil Air Patrol (headquarter and liaison offices), United Service Organization (USO), and
   United Seamen’s Service.
Note: There is an MOU (located at www.militaryhomefront.mil) between DoD and the USO.
   1.9.7. Mutual Benefit. In some instances it is not appropriate to charge for certain services
   provided to local governments when such services are of mutual reciprocal benefit (e.g.
   agreements with fire departments to provide mutual aid in the event of local disasters).
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                            13


   Information regarding support to civilian authorities is covered in AFI 10-801, Defense
   Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA).
   1.9.8. Special Supplier-Receiver Arrangements for AF Satellite Organizations. The Supplier
   will budget, fund, and provide non-reimbursable support (i.e., support that is equivalent to
   that provided to the Supplier’s unit at no cost to the Receiver) for the requirements of the
   following AF Receivers except for civilian pay, military and civilian suggestion cash awards,
   temporary duty (TDY), and where noted below. This arrangement applies to the following
   AF Receivers located on or near the Supplier’s installation where the Receiver is mainly
   there to support the Command’s units.
       1.9.8.1. Air Force Special Security Officers.
       1.9.8.2. Mobile Training Detachments and Field Training Detachments.
       1.9.8.3. Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) District Offices and
       Detachments except for the following requirements. HQ AFOSI will budget and fund
       for:
          1.9.8.3.1. Emergency roadside repairs and off-base purchases of gasoline and oil for
          government-owned vehicles assigned to the AFOSI.
          1.9.8.3.2. Camouflage fatigues and mobility bags when the requirement is not
          specified in mobility taskings (e.g., unified and specified OPLANs).
       1.9.8.4. Air Force Audit Agency resident, liaison, and regional offices.
       1.9.8.5. Air Force Reserve Medical Service Units (MSU), if co-located and assigned to
       active duty medical facilities for training. This applies only to personnel in non-
       Temporary Duty (non-TDY) status.
       1.9.8.6. Air Force Judicial Circuit Offices.
1.10. Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). The Support Agreement Program
Manager (identified herein as a Command-level SAM) must ensure that all support agreements
within their Command comply with policies for requiring analysis of the environmental impact.
   1.10.1. The Air Force accomplishes its environmental impact analysis through Title 32,
   CFR, Part 989 (32 CFR Part 989), Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), current
   edition, 32 CFR Part 187, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense
   Actions, current edition, DoDD 6050.7, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department
   of Defense Actions, and Executive Order (EO) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of
   Major Federal Actions. The support agreement process will implement the applicable EIAP
   elements consistent with 42 USC Chapter 55, the National Environmental Policy, and Title
   40, CFR Part 1500-1508, Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for
   Implementing NEPA.
   1.10.2. The individual or organization responsible for initiating actions and complying with
   the EIAP is the proponent of the action. The proponent ensures there is integration of the
   EIAP during the initial planning stages of proposed actions so that planning and decisions
   reflect environmental values, delays are avoided later in the process, and potential conflicts
   are minimized as much as possible.
 14                                                AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


   1.10.3. The Environmental Planning Function (EPF) supports the proponent. The proponent
   notifies the EPF of its pending action and completes Section I of AF Form 813, Request for
   Environmental Impact Analysis. The proponent prepares the Description of Proposed Action
   and Alternatives through an interdisciplinary team approach including the EPF and other key
   participants.
   1.10.4. When a non-AF proponent (i.e., DoD Component, non-DoD Federal Agency, or
   federally-recognized Indian tribe) wants to use an Air Force installation (or portions thereof)
   for the proposed action, the non-AF proponent must follow the Air Force’s EIAP process.
   The Command-level SAM will provide the regulations and forms, when required.
   1.10.5. NEPA and its implementing regulations prohibit the irreversible or irretrievable
   commitment of resources (personnel, facilities, or dollars) prior to completion of the EIAP
   process. NEPA also prohibits taking any action that would have an adverse impact on the
   environment or limiting the choice of reasonable alternatives until the EIAP process is
   complete.
1.11. DoD Provided EOD Support. The Military Munitions Rule (MR) Implementation Policy
(MRIP) (http://www.denix.osd.mil/mmrp/Archives.cfm) and DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 7,
DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards: Criteria for Unexploded Ordnance,
Munitions Response, Waste Military Munitions, and Material Potentially Presenting and
Explosive Hazard, reflect that military EOD teams are the “Explosive and Munitions Emergency
Response (EMER) specialists” for DoD and perform EMER duties for all military munitions.
   1.11.1. AF installations with no EOD capability will develop an MOA or MOU with the
   closest DoD EOD unit. All MOAs and MOUs must be officially coordinated with the
   supporting EOD unit.
   1.11.2. AF installations may enter an agreement with civilian bomb squads to provide AF
   support for incidents involving improvised explosive devices (IED). The Supplier SAM
   must identify in the support agreement the requirement to contact the supporting DoD EOD
   unit. See AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program, for further guidance
   in developing the MOA or MOU. If the agreement is subject to 10 USC § 2336, contact
   SAF/IEI for guidance and approval. Such agreements are outside the scope of this AFI.
   1.11.3. AF installations are encouraged to enter agreements with federal, state, and local
   authorities to provide AF EOD support to incidents involving non-military ordnance and
   explosives off the installation. DSCA permits such military support to civilian authorities
   within its “Immediate Response Authority” to save lives, prevent human suffering, or
   mitigate great property damage within the United States.
   1.11.4. The support agreement will also include the requirement for federal, state, and local
   authorities to contact the supporting DoD EOD unit and request response when any military
   ordnance is found outside an installation.
1.12. Contract Provided Support. The Supplier can use a contracted Service to provide
support to the Receiver as part of a support agreement, but the acquiring of that contracted
service is outside of this instruction.
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                              15


   1.12.1. A formal support agreement is required when a Receiver requests support that is
   currently provided to the Supplier via a service contract. See paragraph 2.4.2 for additional
   information.
   1.12.2. Each support activity provided by a base contractor will be documented in the
   support agreement.
   1.12.3. Neither specific reference to the supporting contract number nor detailed wording
   contained in the contract will be included.
   1.12.4. The Receiver’s requested changes in support will be routed to the Receiver SAM and
   forwarded to the Supplier SAM or designated Supplier Functional Area Agreement
   Coordinator (FAAC). The Supplier SAM or designated Supplier FAAC will forward the
   requirement to the Single Manager for Service IAW AFI 63-138 to work.
   1.12.5. Contractors will not serve as the FAAC for the specific contractor’s provided support
   to prevent the appearance of impropriety.
   1.12.6. Conversion from organic to contractor provided support (e.g., as a result of an A-76
   study) is non-reimbursable if the Receiver was provided the service on a non-reimbursable
   basis prior to the support being contracted out.
   1.12.7. When the Receiver increases the scope or magnitude of the required support since
   the contract’s last award date, then the incremental costs that are directly attributable to the
   Receiver’s increased requirement and the contract modification are negotiated as
   reimbursable unless otherwise noted in the support agreement.
1.13. Relationship with Other Guidance. This AFI does not delegate or establish authority to
affect policies, procedures or programs that are the responsibility of other designated Air Force
offices. Support agreements will not supersede or be inconsistent with any applicable official
DoD or AF issuances or publications, Air Force contracts, or programmatic agreements executed
by DoD or Air Force entities. If an applicable DoD or AF issuance or contract lacks sufficient
detail for local implementation, then a local operational procedure or directive should be
prepared (and referenced in the support agreement, as needed). This instruction does not change
the reimbursement policy identified in AFI 65-601, Volume 1. In addition, this instruction does
not change reimbursement policy reflected in DoD FMR 7000.14-R, nor does it direct
reimbursement changes in current support agreements.

                             ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. HQ USAF/A4L. HQ USAF/A4L is the AF SAM. HQ USAF/A4L designated HQ
USAF/A4LX to perform the AF SAM duties. The AF SAM will:
   2.1.1. Act as the OPR for this instruction and related procedures, as required.
   2.1.2. Chair the AF Support Agreements Program Managers Workshop.
   2.1.3. Convene and chair HAF-level working groups to discuss changes to the procedures, as
   required.
   2.1.4. Provide clarification of procedures within this instruction.
   2.1.5. Staff impasse packages within the HAF that involve cross-functional areas in dispute.
2.2. MAJCOMs,        NAFs,     or   MAJCOM-Equivalents          (Command-Level). Non-AF
organizations and large AF Field Operating Agencies (e.g., AF Intelligence, Surveillance, and

2.3. Installation Commander. The Installation Commander has authority over the installation
and other real property (including use rights such as leases, permits, easements, and licenses)
used to support the Receivers subject to delegated authorities and OSD and Air Force policies.
In addition, the Installation Commander will provide support to GSUs IAW paragraph 1.6 and
Receivers under the special support conditions IAW paragraph 1.9 (T-1)
Note: Non-AF organizations will use their equivalent of an Installation Commander.
   2.3.1. The Supplier will provide the Receiver the required support activity described in
   DoDI 4000.19 and this instruction. The Supplier will not terminate services, in-house or
   contracted, to a Receiver without notification IAW DoDI 4000.19 and this instruction. As
   long as a support activity is required, the Supplier has the responsibility to provide and fund
   the service. However, the Supplier can authorize the decrease or increase in the level of
   service to its units and the applicable Receivers to reflect the Supplier’s particular
   capabilities to include funding constraints. (T-0)
       2.3.1.1. If a Receiver requires an increased level beyond the Supplier’s support activity
       levels to the installation at large or a Receiver requires a new support service and these
       services were not identified during the strategic basing decision or part of the Supplier’s
       existing Base Operating Support (BOS) requirement, then the Supplier will charge the
       Receiver for the costs of those additional services unless otherwise noted in the support
       agreement. (T-0)
       2.3.1.2. Supplier provided services affected by budget shortfalls and not mitigated by the
       corporate funding process will result in adjusted service levels. The Supplier and
       Receiver may renegotiate service levels to stay within the funding constraints or the
       Receiver may pay for an increased level of service. (T-0)
   2.3.2. The Supplier establishes standard levels of support for the core support activities
   provided to both Supplier and/or Receiver units. The Supplier will fund the Receiver’s
   support provided by contracted services IAW paragraph 1.12 and the Receiver will
   reimburse the Supplier based on the arrangements in the support agreement. Additionally,
   the Supplier funds contracted services for communication services, utilities, training, contract
   custodial services for on-base facilities, and other on-base CE services done under contract
   such as trash hauling and snow removal. (T-1)
   2.3.3. The Supplier establishes local procedures and processes (to include standard
   timeframes for support agreement-related actions) which the Supplier SAM will use to
   prevent unnecessary delays in negotiating, revising, and reviewing support agreements. (T-
   1)
   2.3.4. (Added-PACAF) For PACAF Supplier units, base level approval authority for intra-
   service, intra-agency, inter-agency and memorandum of agreements is the Installation (or
   Wing) Commander or his/her designated representative. For those organizations not aligned
   with standard wing structure, i.e., Air Support Squadron (ASUS), Air Support Group (ASG),
   Pacific Region Support Center (PRSC), etc., approval authority is the Activity Commander
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                            19


   who has authority over personnel and materials utilized in providing the specified support
   (block 8.c.), and the Activity Commander who has authority over the mission receiving the
   support (block 9.c.). If the Activity Commander delegates his authority to sign agreements,
   the delegation must be accomplished in writing and a copy filed in the SAM’s continuity
   folder. A new delegation of authority letter must be signed by each new Activity
   Commander as it is his decision to delegate or not, and to what level. Since the delegation is
   to a position, a new delegation letter need not be signed for a change in personnel in the
   delegated position. Delegation of authority letters will be uploaded to the PACAF SA
   SharePoint site.
      2.3.4.1. (Added-PACAF) At joint bases where Air Force is the lead, the Joint Base
      Commander is the approval authority for all agreements providing installation support as
      detailed in the Joint Base Memorandum of Agreement. The Joint Base Commander may
      delegate his authority within the Joint Base organization. If mission support categories
      are included in the Joint Base agreements, the local AF mission Commander must
      provide his/her written coordination of the agreement.
      2.3.4.2. (Added-PACAF) At joint bases where Air Force is not the lead, (PACAF) Air
      Force Wing Commanders (or equivalent) have authority for, and are the approval
      authority for all AF mission support categories under their control. The Air Force Wing
      Commander may delegate his/her authority in accordance with para 2.3.4. above.

      their response tracking.
      2.4.1.4. Advise the Supplier SAM of the Receiver’s requirements as early as feasible to
      permit consideration when the Supplier formulates its budget submission, execution
      plans, and revisions to the submission timeline. (T-1)
      2.4.1.5. Identify the required support through the use of an ISAC or equivalent document
      provided by the Supplier. Also identify the required support not in the ISAC or
      equivalent document. (T-1)
      2.4.1.6. Upon the Supplier SAM’s request, furnish the requested information (e.g.,

     2.5.2.1. Define, provide, and validate the levels of support for each support activity.
     Provide the required definitions to the Supplier SAM for compilation, publication, and
     update in the ISAC or equivalent document. (T-1)
     2.5.2.2. Review the specific provisions and terms relating to each support activity to
     ensure complete understanding of required support is documented and that sufficient
     information is contained to determine the impact of providing the requested Receiver
     support. (T-1)
     2.5.2.3. Negotiate with the Receiver FAAC on the support activities not in the ISAC or
     equivalent document to establish procedures and technical aspects for the required and
     available support. (T-1)
     2.5.2.4. Notify the Supplier SAM of potential disputes. Work to resolve procedural and
     technical disputes directly with Receiver’s FAACs. If a Receiver FAAC is not
     responsive, submit an official request through the Supplier’s and Receiver’s chains of

     Guidance. Provide required cost data to FM and the Resource Advisor for development
     of unit cost factors for relevant support capabilities. (T-0)
     2.5.2.5. (PACAF) The functional area’s unit resource advisor (RA) with close support
     provided by each FAAC is responsible for developing, reviewing, and updating the cost
     of providing their particular categories of support contained within a particular
     agreement. The RA provides cost data to the designated Financial Analysis personnel
     responsible for development of the Funding Annex in the format requested. This
     information may also be collected by the SAM and forwarded to the Financial Analysis
     personnel depending on local established procedures.
         2.5.2.5.1. The basis for reimbursement (e.g., cost per defined unit of service)
         recorded in the support agreement (and the funding annex) will be determined by the
         Supplier’s computation of incremental direct costs incurred by Supplier to provide
         each unit of support above the standard levels of support documented in the ISAC or
         equivalent document.
         2.5.2.5.2. Costs must be measurable and directly attributable to the Receiver.
     2.5.2.6. Assist FM in annual costing reviews (when requested). (T-1)

      2.5.2.6. (PACAF) The FAAC working with their RA, will review annually the cost of
      providing support to all Receivers and the RA will notify Comptroller Financial Analysis
      personnel of adjustments to rates or factors. If support cost estimates listed in the
      agreement for a Receiver differ from actual reimbursements received due to changes in
      the level of support requirements, the FAAC will initiate a request for an agreement
      revision through the Supplier SAM. The functional area RA will coordinate with
      Financial Analysis for any adjustments required to the Funding Annex. If cost estimate
      differences are a result of rate changes, an agreement revision may not be required.
      2.5.2.7. Contact the servicing MO Section and assist in determining manpower
      requirements for support requested. (T-1)
      2.5.2.8. Interface with the Resource Advisor to ensure bills for reimbursable support are

   SAM and the Receiver’s MO. (T-1)
   2.6.2. Document manpower impacts of the support agreement, identify “Contract Full-Time
   Equivalent (CFTE)” as appropriate, or identify when “no additional manpower is required”
   in situations where support does not merit transfer of manpower or equivalent funds. (T-0)
      2.6.2.1. If there is no manpower impact, enter “No additional manpower is required to
      support the Receiver” in support agreement (e.g., DD Form 1144, Block 11, General
      Provisions) and then sign the support agreement.
      2.6.2.2. When there is a manpower impact, forward support agreement(s) with validated
      manpower impacts to the applicable Command-Level MO offices to facilitate manpower
      transfers.
      2.6.2.2. (PACAF) The Manpower Chief will forward a signed DD1144 to

                                            Chapter 3

                    SUPPORT AGREEMENT PROCESS OVERVIEW

3.1. Circumstances for Support.
   3.1.1. The Receiver will seek support when:
       3.1.1.1. Additions or changes to existing roles or missions require support. (T-1)
       3.1.1.2. There is an unplanned loss of an existing source of support (e.g. natural disaster).
       (T-1)
   3.1.2. The Supplier or Receiver may request changes to an existing support agreement or
   establish a new support agreement when:
       3.1.2.1. Similar or identical functions are being duplicated by nearby DoD components,
       non-DoD Federal Agencies, or federally-recognized Indian tribes. The change may
       provide an opportunity to streamline to one Supplier and gain some efficiency. (T-1)
       3.1.2.2. It may enhance mission effectiveness or improve economy or efficiency of
       operation. (T-1)
       3.1.2.3. There is a need to consolidate functions. (T-1)
       3.1.2.4. AFELMs need AF-unique support that a non-AF Supplier cannot provide (e.g.
       Military Personnel Flight Services, USAF unique uniform). (T-1)
       3.1.2.5. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) and co-located units on a base request
       support service were not identified. Contact the pertinent Plans and Program office to
       determine if the projected scope and responsibilities fall under AFI 10-503. (T-0)
Note: BRAC and co-located units will obtain the additional basing decision(s) prior to
establishing a support agreement.
3.2. Support Agreement Development.
   3.2.1. AF units provide support to other AF units and non-AF organizations when requested,
   subject to a determination that the AF Supplier has the capability to do so without
   jeopardizing assigned missions. AF units also receive support from other AF units and non-
   AF organizations when a determination is made that those Suppliers have the capability to do
   so without jeopardizing their assigned missions. (T-0)
   3.2.2. A support agreement will have only one Supplier. A support agreement normally
   covers only one Receiver, but more than one Receiver can be included if both Receivers are
   funded from the same source (e.g., DD Form 1144, Block 11c is the same for both
   Receivers). (T-0)
   3.2.2. (PACAF) The Supplier may not obligate one of its Receiver units to provide support
   to another Receiver. A separate agreement between the two Receivers should be
   accomplished by their respective SAMs.
   3.2.3. If two organizations or units both supply and receive support to and from each other,
   then separate support agreements will be developed because the support agreement process
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                            29


   only allows for one Supplier to be identified in the document with one or more Receivers.
   (T-0)
   3.2.4. The Supplier may use attachments to identify unique requirements and arrangement
   with each Receiver when a support agreement is for more than one Receiver. (T-0)
   3.2.5. At a minimum, the support provided to intra-service Receivers will be at an equivalent
   availability, quality, quantity, and cost the Supplier gives its units, unless the Receiver
   requests and approves a lower level of support. Suppliers will determine the standard levels
   of support for its units and all applicable Receivers based on the capacity and resources
   normally available. Any requested level of support “above and beyond” the standard levels
   of support the Supplier can provide will be funded (reimbursed) by the Receiver. (T-0)
   3.2.6. The provision of small-scale recurring support may not justify the administrative
   effort and expense of preparing a DD Form 1144 or equivalent document. In such cases, the
   support agreement Approval Authority may waive the need to prepare a DD Form 1144 or
   equivalent document; however, when the MOA is developed, the author will provide a copy
   of the small-scale recurring support to the SAMs for historical purposes and continuity of
   arrangement. (T-0)
   3.2.6. (PACAF) The small-scale recurring support waiver letter will be signed by the SA
   approval authority to include as a minimum, Receiver name, number of personnel,
   facility(ies) occupied, and type support required. This letter containing support details will
   preclude the need for an accompanying MOA.
   3.2.7. Receivers will pay all reimbursable costs identified in the funding annex (paragraph
   4.3) and transfer manpower resources identified in the manpower annex (paragraph 4.4).
   (T-0)
   3.2.8. When a new support agreement, revision, review, waiver, or termination is required,
   the Supplier and Receiver SAMs will ensure all relevant functional offices are notified and
   will maintain POC details for all functional units involved. (T-0)
   3.2.9. (Added-PACAF) Support agreements are not normally required or encouraged
   between PACAF units, but may be established at the request of the Commander of either
   party. This is because all resources belong to a single command and may be realigned to
   meet the needs of the agreement.
   3.2.10. (Added-PACAF) Reference command-to-command agreements in Purpose
   Statements of applicable installation level support agreements (normally contained in block
   11 of DD Form 1144). Command level MOA/MOUs are maintained/available on the
   PACAF SA SharePoint site.
3.3. Funding Responsibilities and Reimbursements.
   3.3.1. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 7 identifies the funding responsibilities for intra-
   service support agreements; however, each Supplier SAM with their FAACs will determine
   if a specific support activity or an increased level of support will be reimbursable or non-
   reimbursable. (T-0)
      3.3.1.1. A new support activity to an existing support agreement is reimbursable if the
      Supplier cannot absorb the projected increase with its existing capacity. The Receiver
 30                                                AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


       has financial responsibility for the additional costs unless otherwise noted in the support
       agreement. (T-0)
       3.3.1.2. A requirement is reimbursable if the AF Supplier does not have an existing non-
       Agile Combat Support (non-ACS) capability for AF Receivers. (T-0)
   3.3.2. Inter-service (or intra-agency) support agreements (with other DoD Components) will
   be reimbursable unless otherwise noted in the support agreement. (T-0)
   3.3.3. Inter-agency support agreements (with non-DoD Federal Agencies or federally-
   recognized Indian tribes) will be charged for all (direct and indirect) costs specified IAW
   DoDI 4000.19 and DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 11, Reimbursable Operations, Policy and
   Procedures, unless specified by another statute. If there is no additional cost to the Supplier
   or the cost to receive the reimbursement (e.g., bill and transfer) exceeds the actual funding
   required, then the specific support activity can be identified non-reimbursable. (T-0)
   3.3.4. Use DoDI 4000.19 to identify funding and reimbursement responsibilities for intra-
   service, inter-service (or intra-agency), and inter-agency agreements. (T-0)
3.4. Support Agreement Processing. Communications between the Receiver and Supplier are
normally through the Receiver and Supplier SAMs but discussions on specific support activities
may occur between the Supplier and Receiver FAACs. The Supplier SAM will establish
suspense dates (e.g., 30 calendar days from the date of the request) for providing and receiving
information to ensure timely processing of a support agreement, accomplishing periodic reviews,
and resolving disputes. (T-1)
   3.4.1. The prospective Receiver SAM contacts the Supplier SAM and requests support. (T-
   1)
   3.4.2. The Supplier SAM provides the prospective Receiver with an approved ISAC or
   equivalent document and requests completion of a Receiver Profile (Attachment 6). (T-1)
   3.4.3. The prospective Receiver, with the assistance of the Receiver’s FAACs, reviews the
   ISAC or equivalent document and identifies the required support activities. The prospective
   Receiver notifies the Supplier SAM of its requirements and provides a completed Receiver
   Profile. The prospective Receiver also identifies any additional required support (above the
   identified standard levels of support in the ISAC or equivalent document or not currently
   defined in the ISAC or equivalent document) to the Supplier SAM. (T-1)
   3.4.4. The Supplier SAM produces the initial or revised draft support agreement and ensures
   it is coordinated by all required and concerned parties (Attachment 5). (T-1)
   3.4.5. The Supplier SAM compiles and forwards the Receiver’s support agreement
   requirements using a DD Form 1144 (or equivalent document) and the Receiver’s profile to
   each Supplier FAAC for review. The Supplier SAM tracks the DD Form 1144 (or equivalent
   document). Requested support listed in the ISAC or equivalent document does not require
   additional negotiations but all other support requests do. See Figure 3.1 for support
   agreement requirements when a specific Receiver’s requirement is consistent with the
   standard levels of support in the ISAC or equivalent document. See Figure 3.2 for support
   agreement requirements when a specific Receiver’s support activity exceeds the standard
   levels of support in the ISAC or equivalent document. (T-1)
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                             31


   3.4.6. The Supplier FAACs will review the support activities and when required provide
   information to the Supplier SAM for use in negotiations that cannot be resolved at the FAAC
   level. A request for support that is not included in the ISAC (or equivalent document) or that
   exceeds the identified standard levels of support identified in the ISAC or equivalent
   document will be negotiated between the Supplier and the Receiver. The finalized
   reimbursable costs will be included in the funding annex and added to the support agreement.
   (T-1)
   3.4.7. The Supplier SAM updates the support agreement to reflect the negotiated changes
   and forwards a final draft to the FM and MO offices for annex development (paragraphs 4.3
   and 4.4) and certification. (T-0)
   3.4.8. The Supplier’s SF, CE, and JA offices will review the support agreement if a Receiver
   has requested services not identified in the ISAC (or equivalent document) or the Receiver
   has a change in personnel, role, mission, or equipment that affects the support agreement.
   (T-0)
Note: When the Supplier has a change in personnel, mission, or equipment, the Supplier will
follow the modification process outlined in paragraph 3.7.
       3.4.8.1. An increase for a Receiver’s support activity that stays within the standard level
       of support listed in the ISAC may not require additional review unless there is a
       significant change in Receiver’s mission or the degree of change warrants a new
       beddown or joint basing request. (T-0)
       3.4.8.2. The Supplier SAM transmits the draft support agreement to Receiver SAM.
       This draft explains any apparent inconsistencies or deviations from standard levels of
       support, as well as the Supplier SAM’s rationale for proposed changes for the requested
       support. If the Receiver SAM requires further changes to this draft, then the Supplier and
       Receiver SAMs with their applicable FAACs will renegotiate any disputed provisions.
       Once all identified issues are resolved, the Supplier SAM will modify the draft support
       agreement and continue the approval process. (T-1)
       3.4.8.3. The Supplier SAM is responsible for identifying the need for additional reviews
       and consulting with the Supplier’s SF, CE, MO, FM, and JA offices, as appropriate. (T-
       1)
   3.4.9. The Supplier SAM consolidates the Receiver’s “agreed to” requirements into a final
   support agreement. (T-1)
   3.4.10. The Supplier SAM forwards the final support agreement to JA for final legal
   sufficiency review. (T-1)
   3.4.11. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs obtain signatures from their Comptrollers and
   Approval Authorities. (T-1)
       3.4.11.1. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs will transmit a copy of the final support
       agreement to their respective Comptrollers for approval signature starting with the
       Supplier’s Comptroller. (T-1)
       3.4.11.2. After securing both Comptrollers’ signatures, the Supplier and Receiver SAMs
       obtain Approval Authority signatures starting with Receiver’s Approval Authority. The
       date the Supplier Approval Authority signs the support agreement (e.g., DD Form 1144,
 32                                                AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


       Block 3) becomes the effective date unless otherwise noted in the support agreement
       (e.g., DD Form 1144, Block 11). (T-1)
Note: Based on Command-Level guidance and applicable delegation of authority, a support
agreement may need to be routed through the Supplier’s and/or Receiver’s Command leadership
prior to obtaining Approval Authority signatures.
       3.4.11.3. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs are authorized to use electronic and digital
       signatures on support agreements. Per AFI 33-321, Authentication of Air Force Records,
       a record is authenticated when it contains an official signature or seal indicating the
       document is genuine and official. A signature or seal may be written, stamped,
       electronic, or digital. (T-0)
   3.4.12. The Supplier SAM forwards the completed support agreements to all affected parties
   and posts the completed support agreements to the applicable repositories. (T-1)
       3.4.12.1. Distribution will include at least the Supplier and Receiver repositories,
       Supplier and Receiver SAMs, Supplier and Receiver FAACs, and the applicable financial
       accounting services (e.g., DFAS). The Supplier and Receiver SAMs will provide copies
       of the signed support agreements to additional affected or interested offices, as
       appropriate. (T-1)
       3.4.12.2. A completed support agreement consists of a signed support agreement (i.e.,
       MOU, MOA, DD Form 1144, or equivalent document) with completed General and
       Specific Provisions and Requirements, a Funding Annex, if required, and a Manpower
       Annex or Certification. Other relevant attachments will also be included. (T-1)
   3.4.13. The Supplier SAM will consolidate correspondence and coordination that documents
   significant changes, and retain it as part of the support agreement file for the next review
   cycle and auditability. (T-1)
3.5. Support Agreement Reviews. The Supplier FM will conduct annual budget reviews (for
agreements with reimbursable support activities) and the Supplier SAM will conduct triennial
reviews (for all support agreements) to ensure the support activities and associated funding are
current. (T-0)
   3.5.1. Annual Budget Review. These reviews are conducted by the Supplier FM for those
   support agreements with at least one reimbursable support activity and do not change the
   effective date of the support agreement unless changes require renegotiation. (T-0)
       3.5.1.1. Coincides with budget lead-time requirements and Financial Plan preparation;
       includes a verification of personnel assigned and estimated reimbursement charges to
       confirm validity and completeness of the charges. (T-0)
       3.5.1.2. Does not initiate a renegotiation unless there are significant changes (e.g., +/–
       5% or more) in required support. (T-0)
       3.5.1.3. FM reviews estimated support requirements prior to the annual budget
       submission. The Supplier’s FM will forward a revised Funding Annex (if required),
       signed by both Supplier and Receiver FMs, to the Supplier SAM so the revised funding
       annex can be included as an attachment to the support agreement. Creation of a revised
       Funding Annex, alone, does not require re-coordination with the final Approval
       Authority. (T-0)
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                           33


      3.5.1.4. The support agreements will be rerouted for approval if one or more support
      activities changes from non-reimbursable to reimbursable or vice versa. (T-0)
   3.5.2. Triennial Review. All support agreements must go through this review. (T-0)
   3.5.2. (PACAF) A triennial review consists of the agreement being reviewed in its entirety,
   by all applicable FAACs.
      3.5.2.1. The Supplier SAMs will conduct support agreement reviews triennially or more
      frequently when significant changes in the requested support occur. The Command-level
      SAMs will coordinate with Supplier SAMs to develop a timeline to complete the triennial
      review of all support agreements. The items for the triennial review are located in the
      Logistics Compliance Assessment Program and Inspector General Inspection Checklist.
      Support agreements with an effective date within the last three years do not require a
      triennial review until 2 ½ years have elapsed from the effective date. (T-0)

Table 3.1. (Added-PACAF) Timeline
        By 30 Sep 2014: 33% current
        By 30 Sep 2015: 66% current
        By 30 Sep 2016: 90% current or greater
        PACAF goal for FY17 and beyond is for
        units to maintain at least a 90% currency
        rate.

      3.5.2.1. (PACAF) PACAF units will use the following timeline to complete the triennial
      review of all support agreements.
      3.5.2.2. The Supplier SAM initiates the triennial review prior to the 3-year anniversary
      of the support agreement’s effective date or last triennial review whichever occurred most
      recently. (T-0)
      3.5.2.2. (PACAF) A triennial review is initiated by the Supplier SAM at least 120 days
      from the 3-year anniversary of the agreement’s effective date or last triennial review
      whichever occurred most recently. However, MAJCOMs are authorized to defer
      triennial reviews if a major review has been completed in the interim, in which case the
      3-year period will begin from the date of the last major review.
      3.5.2.3. The Supplier SAM will initiate the triennial review by sending the Receiver
      Profile (Attachment 6) to the Receiver SAM. The Receiver SAM will identify
      significant changes in support (e.g., level of required support and current number of
      people, facilities, vehicles), using the new Receiver Profile to provide updated
      information or indicate there are no significant changes on the latest Receiver Profile.
      (T-1)
      3.5.2.3. (PACAF) The Receiver Profile (Attachment 6) may be modified by the
      Supplier SAM to fit the needs of their program.
      3.5.2.4. When an existing support agreement is changed, it must be re-signed by the
      appropriate Approval Authorities (e.g., DD Form 1144, Blocks 8.c.(1) thru 9.c.(1)).
      When no significant changes are identified or required by the Supplier or Receiver, the
 34                                                 AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


      Supplier SAM (with written concurrence of the Receiver SAM) will change the effective
      date of the support agreement (e.g., DD Form 1144, Block 3) to reflect the date of review
      completion and establish the next triennial review date. The Supplier’s identification and
      the support agreement number will normally remain the same for as long as the support
      agreement is in existence. (T-0)
      3.5.2.5. A triennial review is considered complete when the support agreement (e.g., DD
      Form 1144, Block 3) has been updated IAW paragraph 3.5.2.4. (T-0)
      3.5.2.6. (Added-PACAF) The Comptroller, servicing manpower office, base civil
      engineer, security and staff judge advocate will be included in the coordination process of
      each agreement.
      3.5.2.7. (Added-PACAF) FAACs, with assistance from their RA, review standard
      levels of support, basis for reimbursement, and estimated reimbursements to determine
      whether they are still current.
   3.5.3. Minor Revisions to an Existing Support Agreement.
      3.5.3.1. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs will make minor pen and ink changes,
      including non-substantive modifications, by mutual agreement provided the changes do
      not affect the transfer of manpower or funds. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs will
      initial and date such pen and ink changes to document mutual acknowledgement to the
      changes. (T-1)
      3.5.3.2. Minor changes that do not significantly alter the existing support agreement but,
      which when made, would cause the conditions of support to exceed the limits permissible
      without additional approval (e.g., stated in DD Form 1144, Block 11), will be annotated
      on the existing support agreement and its attachments, and initialed and dated by the
      appropriate Approval Authorities (e.g., DD Form 1144, Blocks 8c and 9c). (T-1)
      3.5.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Revisions to support agreements initiated within 180 days
      prior to the triennial review date should be coordinated with all activities involved and
      the triennial review accomplished concurrently with the revision. The Supplier SAM
      should request FAACs to review the agreement in its entirety during the review process.
      If after the review, an agreement requires major revision, the agreement should be re-
      accomplished.
   3.5.4. Review Trigger. Existing support agreements will be reviewed when changing
   conditions or costs require substantial alterations to the support agreement or a new support
   agreement is required. (T-1)
   3.5.5. Aligning Reviews with the Budget Process. Changes to a support agreement that
   substantially impact resource requirements and estimated reimbursements will correspond
   with the budget process, when possible, to permit appropriate adjustments to budgeted
   requirement. (T-1)
3.6. Disputes and Impasse Resolution Prior to Agreement Signature.
   3.6.1. The Supplier and Receiver (through their FAACs and SAMs) will work together to
   resolve disputes at the lowest possible level. If a dispute cannot be resolved at the functional
   level, the Supplier and Receiver FAACs elevate the dispute through their respective chain of
   commands for possible resolution keeping the SAMs informed. If a dispute cannot be
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                            35


   resolved at the Approval Authority level, the Supplier FAAC declares an impasse and
   elevates the dispute to the Command-Level SAMs through the Supplier SAM. (T-1) The
   following rules apply:
      3.6.1.1. If an impasse relating to a specific support activity cannot be resolved at the
      installation level between the Supplier and Receiver, then the Supplier FAAC drafts an
      impasse memo (Attachment 3) for Approval Authority signature. The memo documents
      the details of the impasse, steps taken to resolve the impasse, and request for assistance.
      The Supplier FAAC sends the signed impasse memo to the Command’s functional area
      subject matter experts, the Command-level SAMs, and the Supplier and Receiver SAMs.
      (T-1)
      3.6.1.2. The Supplier SAM will omit the specific impasse support activity from the
      support agreement and include the following statement, “Due to an impasse in
      negotiating support for Support Activity XXX, this support agreement is being processed
      with an impasse” (e.g., annotate in the DD Form 1144, Block 11). A copy will be
      provided to the Supplier and Receiver FAACs, SAMs, and Command-level SAMs. (T-1)
      3.6.1.3. If the impasse concerns the entire support agreement or multiple functional
      areas, the Supplier SAM will not process the support agreement for signature. The
      Supplier SAM prepares and forwards the impasse letter through the Approval Authority
      for signature to the Command-level SAMs for staffing and resolution. HQ USAF/A4LX
      will be available to provide clarification of procedures within this instruction, when
      requested. (T-1)
      3.6.1.4. (Added-PACAF) The Supplier SAM will maintain a tracking system for all
      impasses forwarded to PACAF to ensure periodic follow-ups towards a resolution.
   3.6.2. The Command-level SAM will elevate impasse(s) that cannot be resolved at
   Command-Level to the appropriate HAF functional area for assistance in resolving the
   impasse(s) and notify HQ USAF/A4L of the Command-Level impasse(s). If an impasse
   involves cross-functional areas, the Command-level SAM will send the impasse package to
   HQ USAF/A4L for staffing within the HAF. (T-1)
   3.6.3. DoD Components will assist in resolving support agreement differences and disputes
   with other DoD Components, non-DoD federal Agencies, or federally-recognized Indian
   tribes through their respective chains of command. (T-0)
   3.6.4. Upon resolution of an impasse, the correspondence documenting the resolution
   process will become part of the support agreement file. (T-1)
3.7. Termination or Modification of Support.
   3.7.1. The Supplier or Receiver SAM must respond to a termination or modification request
   received from the other party. To terminate or modify a support agreement, the Approval
   Authorities sign the appropriate place on the support agreement (e.g., DD Form 1144, Blocks
   10a (Supplier) and 10c (Receiver) will be signed). (T-0)
   3.7.2. A party to a support agreement that involves reimbursement may unilaterally
   terminate that support agreement prior to the expiration date only with advance notification
   (i.e., a minimum of 180 days), to permit appropriate resource adjustments to be made during
   the budget formulation process. (T-0)
36                                                 AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


     3.7.2.1. If a support agreement that involves reimbursement or resources must be
     significantly modified or unilaterally terminated with less than 180 days’ notice to the
     other party or parties to the support agreement, the party requiring the modification or
     termination may be billed for reimbursement of unavoidable termination expenses
     incurred up to 180 days following the written notification. (T-0)
     3.7.2.2. When a termination or modification involves contracted support, the Supplier
     SAM will comply with AFI 63-138 for resolution. (T-0)
     3.7.2.3. Support agreements that do not involve reimbursement may be terminated prior
     to the expiration date as outlined in the support agreement. (T-0)
     3.7.2.4. The Resource Advisor will submit and track final support charges for
     termination or modification of a support agreement. (T-1)
  3.7.3. The Supplier SAM notifies all applicable Supplier and Receiver offices. (T-1)
  3.7.4. When the Supplier SAM is unable to contact the Receiver due to deactivation or
  relocation of the Receiver, the Supplier SAM will contact the Parent Organization of the
  Receiver SAM for resolution. If the Supplier SAM is unable to obtain a termination
  signature from the Receiver or the Parent Organization of the Receiver SAM, the Supplier’s
  Approval Authority will sign the support agreement (e.g., DD Form 1144, Block 10c) and
  attach a “memo for record” documenting the reasons for not obtaining a Receiver’s signature.
  (T-1)
  3.7.5. IAW DoDI 4000.19, a Supplier will provide support in a manner that will not
  prejudice the availability, quality, quantity, or cost of equivalent for its own Receivers. (T-1)
     3.7.5.1. When the Supplier receives less funding due to sequestration or other budget
     shortfalls, the Supplier will notify its units and all applicable Receivers of the changes in
     operation that will be implemented to stay within the received funding. The Supplier will
     not pass the cost of this funding shortfall solely on its Receivers but will establish an
     equitable reduction in operations that impacts the Supplier’s organizations and all
     applicable Receivers equally. (T-1)
     3.7.5.2. Those Receivers whose requirements are already part of the Supplier’s budget
     and BOS requirement will not be asked to pay for the service that was previously non-
     reimbursable because of the funding shortfall. If these Receivers want full support (i.e.,
     above the reduced level of support), these Receivers may be required to reimburse the
     Supplier for the additional support. (T-1)
     3.7.5.3. Those Receivers who currently reimburse the Supplier for support will be
     informed of the proposed reduced service and can either accept the reduced service at the
     same rate (e.g., xx dollars for each day of service) or pay more for increased services
     (e.g., provide additional dollars to maintain the full level of support). (T-1)

                            SUPPORT AGREEMENT ACTIONS

4.1. Identifying the Requirement.
   4.1.1. The potential Receiver identifies support activities to the proposed Supplier through
   official correspondence and if possible, holds a face-to-face meeting to clarify respective
   requirements and capabilities, including mission, equipment types, and personnel. (T-1)
   Typical questions to be answered include:
       4.1.1.1. Do the Supplier and Receiver have authority (implementing the direction of the
       Approval Authority) to enter into this agreement?
       4.1.1.2. How will the potential Receiver request support from the Supplier?
       4.1.1.3. Who will receive the actual support?
       4.1.1.4. What support activities and level of support will be required?
       4.1.1.5. Are there conditions or requirements beyond what is identified in the ISAC or
       equivalent document related to this request for support?
       4.1.1.6. What is the Receiver’s objective or mission being supported?
       4.1.1.7. When will the Supplier provide the support?
       4.1.1.8. Has the Receiver considered all support activities?
       4.1.1.9. Where will the support be provided?
       4.1.1.10. Does the Receiver have any requirement(s) currently provided through
       contractors where the government has agreed to provide the support?
       4.1.1.11. Does the Receiver have an existing contract that precludes the Supplier from
       providing requested support or duplicating services already provided in the contract?
   4.1.2. The Supplier and Receiver must clarify any doubts as to exactly what support
   activities and level of support are needed or will be provided before the support agreement is
   approved. (T-1)
4.2. Drafting – Support Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs ensure the population, square footage, equipment,
   weapon system assets, and any other elements are identified and defined. (T-1)
   4.2.2. The Supplier SAM with the assistance of the Supplier FAACs prepare a draft support
   agreement to reflect the required support activities identified by the Receiver using the
   Supplier’s ISAC or equivalent document. In addition, all support activities outside of the
   ISAC or equivalent document must be negotiated (between the Supplier and Receiver
   FAACs) and included in the draft support agreement. (T-1)
   4.2.3. All affected parties, including the Receiver’s and Supplier’s FAACs will review and
   coordinate on the draft support agreement. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs will ensure that
   their FAACs fully understand the implications of the support agreement in their respective
   areas. Specific questions on support activities for the Receivers are best coordinated directly
 40                                                 AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014


   between Supplier and Receiver FAACs and that information is then provided to the SAMs
   for inclusion in the support agreement. (T-1)
   4.2.4. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs need to ensure applicable support agreement
   attachments are listed in the support agreement (e.g., DD Form 1144, Block 11). (T-0)
   4.2.5. The Supplier and Receiver SAMs ensure all specific provisions are identified and
   defined in the applicable support agreements. (T-0)
4.3. Drafting – Financial Inputs.
   4.3.1. Funding responsibilities are identified in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 7, Figure 7.1
   but the reimbursement decision for each support activity is determined between the Supplier
   SAM and their FAACs. Any reimbursable costs will be funded by the Receiver based on the
   funding annex provided by the Supplier. (T-0)
   4.3.2. The Supplier’s FM will detail all costs to be billed to the Receiver (T-0) to include the
   following:
       4.3.2.1. All relevant support capabilities. (T-0)
       4.3.2.2. The computation details of the reimbursable items. (T-0)
       4.3.2.3. Frequency of billing (e.g. monthly, quarterly, or annually). Per DoD FMR
       7000.14-R, Volume 4, advance payment is required from non-DoD Receivers. (T-0)
   4.3.3. The Supplier’s FM will record all reimbursement computations in sufficient detail to
   provide an audit trail by clearly documenting computation methods, factor sources, and
   results. In addition, the Funding Annex will include sufficient documentation to satisfy the
   financial concerns of the Receiver. (T-0)
   4.3.4. Reimbursement will be the recovery of actual cost for products and services provided,
   not the exchange of services. Non-reimbursable exchange of services in a support agreement
   between the Supplier and the Receiver will be documented in the support agreement but
   reimbursements are only associated with the exchange of funds for the products and services
   provided. (T-0)
   4.3.5. If current Air Force accounting systems do not directly correlate identification of
   incurred expenses with the support capabilities outlined in DoDI 4000.19, AFI 65-601,
   Volume 1, Chapter 7, and this instruction, then the Supplier’s FM will estimate the
   anticipated reimbursements (T-0) based on:
       4.3.5.1. General and specific provisions of the support agreement. (T-0)
       4.3.5.2. Reasonable projections of required levels and amounts of support. (T-0)
       4.3.5.3. Generally accepted cost analysis techniques and principles. (T-0)
4.4. Drafting – Manpower Inputs.
   4.4.1. The Supplier’s MO Section will identify the required manpower in the manpower
   annex to support the additional workload. (T-0)
   4.4.2. The manpower annex will detail the following:
       4.4.2.1. Computation method. (T-0)
AFI25-201_PACAFSUP_I 30 APRIL 2014                                                              41


      4.4.2.2. Man-hour or manpower impact by functional area or support activity. (T-0)
      4.4.2.3. Total manpower impact in whole numbers. (T-0)
   4.4.3. Because current Account Codes and Manpower Standards do not correlate to the
   support activities the Supplier’s MO Section will base the manpower impacts on:
      4.4.3.1. Specific provision(s) of the support agreement. (T-0)
      4.4.3.2. Manpower Standards. (T-0)
      4.4.3.3. Management engineering methods (technical estimates, good operator timing,
      position manning, operational audits, etc.). (T-0)
   4.4.4. The man-hours required to support the additional workload will be totaled and the
   manpower will be computed using the appropriate Man-hour Availability Factor(s). The
   Supplier’s MO Section will document and maintain on file all computations in sufficient
   detail to provide an audit trail of required manpower. (T-0)
   4.4.5. Inter-Service (or intra-agency) and inter-agency support agreements causing a
   manpower impact need to be worked between the Supplier’s and Receiver’s MO staffs. All
   disputes will be processed IAW paragraph 3.6 (T-0)
4.5. Drafting – Supplier Modifications to Reduce Support Provided Pursuant to an
Existing Support Agreement.
   4.5.1. The Supplier SAM identifies the funding vs. requirement delta based on FAACs and
   FM inputs. (T-1)
   4.5.2. The Supplier SAM, Receiver SAM, and FAACs identify those non-mission critical
   support activities that can have the level of support reduced without significantly impacting
   the Supplier and Receiver missions and determine the proposed level of reduced service. If
   reduction in non-mission critical support capabilities does not bring the support agreements
   within the provided funding, the Supplier SAM, Receiver SAM, and FAACs determine
   additional necessary reductions with FM support. (T-1)
   4.5.3. If the Supplier still has a funding gap, the Supplier SAM, Receiver SAM, FAACs, and
   FM will review the remaining support activities and determine the level of reduction in each
   of these activities that the Supplier units and all Receivers will need to endure to stay within
   the available funding. (T-1)
   4.5.4. Once all reduction decisions are identified, the Supplier SAM will then initiate the
   modification of the support agreement with its Receivers IAW paragraph 3.7 (T-1)
