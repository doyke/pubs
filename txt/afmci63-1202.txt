This is a new instruction and should be reviewed in its entirety. This instruction provides
guidance for how the engineering staffs within Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)
organizations will gain support from and provide support to the Air Force Global Logistics
Support Center (AFGLSC). Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil.    Send comments and suggestions about this publication for
improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR).

1. Engineering Support. This instruction defines a single framework that defines the roles and
responsibilities for the AFMC Scientist and Engineering (S&E) community to use to provide
support to, and receive support from, the AFGLSC S&E community.
   1.1. Two AFGLSC implementation decisions led to the need for an instruction to describe
   the support the AFGLSC S&E community will need:                      1. The foundational
   philosophy/direction/agreement that AFGLSC would be a virtual, geographically dispersed
   organization with the majority of the personnel physically located at AFMC ALCs. 2. The
   foundational philosophy/direction/agreement to implement/stand-up the AFGLSC as an
   organization with very minimal headquarters and local staff. That philosophy means the
2                                                            AFMCI63-1202 10 MARCH 2009


    AFGLSC S&E community will need to secure support for many S&E staff functions from
    other AFMC staff organizations co-located with AFGLSC units.
    1.2. As some of the engineering staff that will influence the single manager’s ability to
    assure the Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E) of their assigned
    weapon system(s) have been reallocated to the AFGLSC, roles and responsibilities associated
    with that new relationship were required. This instruction formally documents some of those
    requirements.
    1.3. The major roles and responsibilities documented in this instruction are:
       1.3.1. S&E force development.
       1.3.2. Development and execution of technical policy and guidance.
       1.3.3. Process oversight.
       1.3.4. Technical authority.
       1.3.5. Administrative support.
       1.3.6. Technical support to include, but not limited to, Systems Engineering, OSS&E,
       Deficiency Reporting, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages
       (DMSMS), Item Unique Identification/Serial Number Tracking (IUID/SNT), Request for
       Engineering Assistance (AFMC Forms /202/761/762/807/813 & DLA 339 process),
       Defense Standardization Program and Scientific and Technical Information (STINFO)
       policy.
2. Organizational Structure.
    2.1. AFGLSC.
       2.1.1. The AFGLSC organization structure is depicted in Figure 1.
AFMCI63-1202 10 MARCH 2009                                                                 3


Figure 1. AFGLSC Organizational Structure.




      2.1.2. Within that structure, the engineering leadership staff consists of:
         2.1.2.1. A Director, Engineering & Technical Management, who serves as the Center
         Technical Authority and Center Senior Functional, and the Senior Technical Advisor
         to the AFGSLC/CC at Scott Air Force Base (AFB).
         2.1.2.2. Three unit senior functional, Group Directors of Engineering (DOE),
         assigned to, and physically located with, each of the Planning and Execution (P&E)
         Groups of the 448 Supply Chain Management Wing (SCMW): 638 SCMG (Robins
         AFB), 748 SCMG (Hill AFB), and 848 SCMG (Tinker AFB). The Group DOEs
         report directly to the Group Commander/Director at their respective locations. Also,
         each Group DOE will serve as the Unit Senior Functional (USF) for all AFGLSC
         S&Es geographically located at their respective locations.
4                                                          AFMCI63-1202 10 MARCH 2009


          2.1.2.3. A unit senior functional, Director of the Engineering and Technology
          Squadron (designated the 403 Supply Chain Management Squadron -- SCMS)
          assigned to, and physically located with, the 591 Supply Chain Management Group
          (SCMG -- also known as the Strategy and Integration Group) at Wright-Patterson
          AFB. The 403 SCMS/CL reports directly to the 591 SCMG/CL at Wright-Patterson
          AFB.
       2.1.3. Roles and responsibilities defined within this instruction for the 448 SCMW units
       cover the wing staff and any applicable subordinate groups and squadrons. The 448
       SCMW/CL will determine how those roles and responsibilities are delegated within the
       wing.
       2.1.4. Roles and responsibilities defined within this instruction for the 591 SCMG cover
       the group staff and applicable subordinate squadrons and flights. The 591 SCMG/CL
       will determine how those roles and responsibilities are delegated within the group.
       2.1.5. Roles and responsibilities defined within this instruction for AFMC Program
       Offices are applicable to any AFMC program office that requires AFGLSC engineering
       support.
    2.2. EN Functional Organization. HQ AFGLSC/EN has no assigned HQ staff, other than the
    Director. The Air Logistics Center (ALC)/EN organizations co-located with the 448 SCMW
    units and the HQ AFMC/A4 Technical Director have agreed to have their staff support HQ
    AFGLSC/EN to execute the functional responsibilities specified below. Any reference to
