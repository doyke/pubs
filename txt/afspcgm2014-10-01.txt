                                 AFSPC Cybercrew Training

A1.1. General.

A1.1.1. Program Goals. This document prescribes basic policy and guidance for training Air
Force Space Command (AFSPC) cybercrews to include AFSPC gained ANG/AFRC units. The
Cybercrew Training Program (CTP) ensures all cybercrew members obtain and maintain the
certification/qualification and proficiency needed to effectively perform their unit’s mission.
The objective of the CTP is to develop and maintain a high state of mission readiness for
immediate and effective employment across the full range of military operations. Structure each
training mission to achieve optimum training experience.

A1.1.1.1. Cybercrews consist of individuals who conduct cyberspace operations and are
assigned to a specific weapon system.

A1.1.1.2. This GM applies to cybercrew positions that are designated Mission Ready (MR)/
Combat Mission Ready (CMR) in accordance with Attachment 7 in this memo.

A1.1.1.2.1. Individuals not assigned to a MR/CMR crew position IAW Attachment 7 of this GM
follow the Quality Assurance policy in AFI 33-150, Management of Cyberspace Support
Activities, Technical Order (TO) 00-33A-1001, General Communications Activities Management
Procedures and Practice Requirements and AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, as
required. Examples include, but are not limited to, Information Assurance professionals,
network administrators, helpdesk personnel, and Communication Focal Point (CFP) technicians.

A1.1.1.3. This GM applies to personnel in Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status whose
minimum requirement is to complete Initial Qualification Training (IQT) and Mission
Qualification Training (MQT).

A1.1.1.4. Contractors. U.S. contractor personnel who perform cyberspace operations duties and
are designated as MR/CMR are bound by the requirements of this memorandum when current
contracting language allows. All future contracts (including modifications to existing multi-year
contracts) that include cyberspace MR/CMR positions subsequent to this instruction must state
contractor personnel are bound by the requirements of this instruction. MR/CMR designated
contractor personnel are waived from the MR/CMR requirement to attend IQT; however,
contracts shall require requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities to meet IQT standards.
Contractors and their processes are subject to inspection visits.

A1.1.1.5. Prior to filling a designated CMR position with a non-military member, the specific
duties to be performed will be reviewed by 24 AF/JA to ensure compliance with existing policy
and the Law of Armed Conflict.

A1.1.1.6. 624th Operations Center (OC). Personnel filling MR/CMR positions at the 624 OC,
IAW Attachment 7 of this memo, will adhere to guidance in paragraphs A1.1 through

A1.2. Qualification Training.

A1.2.1. This section defines cybercrew operational status and specifies minimum training
requirements for IQT and MQT.

A1.2.1.1. Cybercrew Operational Status. A cybercrew member may be assigned BMC or
MR/CMR status.

A1.2.1.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A cybercrew member who has satisfactorily
completed IQT and MQT, but is not fully-certified MR/CMR status. The cybercrew member
must be able to attain MR/CMR status to meet operational taskings as specified in the applicable
instructional supplements. This status is primarily for individuals in units that perform weapon
system specific operational support functions (i.e., formal training units, operational test, and
tactics development).

A1.2.1.3. Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR). A cybercrew member who has
satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT and maintains certification, currency, and proficiency in
the command or unit operational mission is MR. A cybercrew member who has satisfactorily
completed IQT and MQT and maintains certification, currency, and proficiency in the command
or unit combat mission is CMR. Minimum requirements include:

A1.2.1.3.1. Completion of IQT, MQT and a formal Stan/Eval evaluation.

A1.2.1.3.2. Certifying official’s certification.

A1.2.1.3.3. Once a certifying official certifies an individual as MR/CMR, the individual
maintains MR/CMR status based on Continuation Training requirements identified in paragraph
A1.3.

A1.2.1.4. When significant hardware, software, or procedural changes impact unit mission
requirements, recertify affected MR/CMR personnel to address the changes. The certifying
official will determine the requirements for recertification.

A1.2.1.4.1. Guidance for what may be considered “significant” includes the following: major
version changes (i.e., product upgrade from Version 1 to Version 2) and major enterprise and/or
infrastructure upgrades or changes (i.e., change in the vendor for the technical capability in
question).

A1.2.1.5. Certifying Official. The unit commander or Operations Officer as the certifying
official ensures the successful completion of required mission-oriented training, evaluation, and
ancillary training.

A1.2.1.5.1. The certifying official documents, in writing (or electronic signature), MR/CMR
certification for crew members in their unit.

A1.2.1.5.2. OG/CC will designate certifying officials for geographically separated units (e.g., 68
NWS OL C, 352 NWS Det 1, etc.).

A1.2.1.6. Restricted Status. Personnel in restricted status will not perform unsupervised
MR/CMR crew duties. Document restricted status entry and reason on the AFSPC Form 4420,
Individual’s Record of Duties and Qualifications. As a minimum, the certifying official restricts
personnel for the following:

A1.2.1.6.1. Failure to pass a cybercrew evaluation.

A1.2.1.6.2. Failure to complete continuation training.
A1.2.1.6.3. Failure to complete a periodic cybercrew evaluation.

*A1.2.1.6.4. Failure to perform at least one duty shift for 45 calendar days in the assigned
MR/CMR duty position (90 days for Air Reserve Components (ARC)). Multi-position certified
personnel are required to perform at least one duty shift in each position every 45 days.
Restricted status will begin the 46th day following the last duty shift.

A1.2.1.6.4.1. The operations log will be the primary means to document the names of personnel
conducting crew shift duties.

A1.2.1.6.5. When the certifying official determines an individual no longer possesses the
proficiency or professionalism required and decertification is inappropriate.

A1.2.1.7. Removal from Restricted Status. The certifying official determines when to remove
an individual from restricted status based on the circumstances of each case. Multi-position
certified individuals must meet the requirements in each duty position for which they are in
restricted status. Document removal from restricted status on the AFSPC Form 4420. Before
removing an individual from restricted status:

A1.2.1.7.1. Individuals who have failed a cybercrew evaluation must complete the required
corrective action and successfully complete a requalification evaluation.

A1.2.1.7.2. Individuals who are delinquent on their periodic cybercrew evaluation must
complete the periodic evaluation and any required corrective actions.

A1.2.1.7.3. Individuals who are delinquent on continuation training must complete the
continuation training.

A1.2.1.7.4. Individuals who have failed to perform the minimum crew duty shifts must complete
necessary training (if required) and be observed performing crew duties (simulator or field) by an
instructor or examiner or evaluated by an examiner, as determined by the certifying official.

A1.2.1.7.5. Individuals placed in restricted status for substandard performance or due to a lack
of professionalism must satisfy requirements established by the certifying official.

A1.2.1.8. Decertification. Decertified personnel will not perform duties in the applicable duty
position(s). Document decertification on AFSPC Form 4420. Decertify personnel for any of the
following:

A1.2.1.8.1. When the certifying official determines an individual no longer possesses the
proficiency or professionalism required and decertification is appropriate.

A1.2.1.8.2. Non-performance of crew duties or shifts for 90 calendar days. Decertified status
will begin the 91st day following the last duty shift.

A1.2.1.8.3. Failure to maintain the appropriate security clearance.
A1.2.1.8.4. Permanent Change of Station (PCS).

A1.2.1.8.4.1. If the assignment is in the same system, decertification is not required. Retain
only the individual's evaluation delinquency date and date of last duty shift. The gaining unit
commander or operations officer must ensure the remainder of MR/CMR certification
requirements are accomplished. Additionally, the losing unit provides the individual with
supporting documentation, with annotation of individual's evaluation delinquency date and date
of last duty shift. The gaining unit may decertify incoming individuals and provide additional
training prior to recertification.

A1.2.1.8.4.2. If the assignment is to a different system, decertify the individual and give the
supporting documentation to the departing individual.

A1.2.1.8.5. Change of duty position when the unit commander no longer desires the individual
to be multi-position certified.

A1.2.1.8.6. Restricted status projected to exceed 90 days. (Note: once an individual exceeds 90-
calendar day’s restricted status, units must decertify the individual.)

A1.2.1.9. Recertification. Decertified crew members must complete unit requalification actions
at the discretion of the certifying official. Document recertification on the AFSPC Form 4420.

A1.2.1.10. Assignment Availability Codes (AAC). AACs are intended to provide a stabilized
crew force, a Trained Personnel Requirements (TPR) validation tool and to ensure payback for
training.

A1.2.1.10.1. Officer Crew Tour Commitment Dates (Except ARC). Officer crew members in
MR/CMR positions (operations officers and above as well as NAF/MAJCOM MR/CMR
members are excluded, where applicable) at CONUS nonisolated bases are placed on an AAC
55, CONUS Minimum Stabilized Tours. Personnel with an AAC 55 must perform duty in a
MR/CMR position until an appropriate authority waives the AAC 55 or the AAC 55 expires.
Individuals whose primary duties do not require MR/CMR certification (e.g., plans, executives,
protocol) should not remain MR/CMR certified. Ideally, officers selected for these positions
should be near or at the end of their crew tours. An AAC 55 starts from the month the member
arrives at the organization or function in accordance with AFI36-2110, Assignments, paragraph
2.15 and the AFPC Stabilized Tour Guide. The individual becomes available for reassignment
during the assignment cycle when the AAC expires. Operational units performing weapon
system upgrades or bringing new weapon systems online may request an AAC 39, Operational
Continuity, not to exceed 3 years, for designated SMEs to support transition.

A1.2.1.10.1.1. A waiver is required prior to removal of officers from duty in a MR/CMR
position if the AAC 55 has not expired. HQ AFSPC/A3 is the AAC 55 waiver authority;
however, this authority is delegated to 24 AF/CC for waivers of 7-12 months and wing
commanders for waivers of 6 months or less.
A1.2.1.10.1.2. 24 AF will submit a consolidated semi-annual roster to HQ AFSPC/A3TT (due
45 days after the end of the 1st and 3rd quarters) reflecting all crew members granted AAC 55
waivers and instances where AFPC has broken AAC 55 for an Air Force-level PCS requirement.
See Attachment 8.

A1.2.1.10.2. Enlisted Crew Tour Commitment Dates (Except ARC). Based on assignment
policy, most first term airmen will complete 2 years of crew duty before PCS, all other enlisted
crew members will complete 3 years without the need for an AAC. Units may request AAC 51,
Operational Deferment, for enlisted crew members selected to fill NAF/Wing/Group and OSS
Staff positions not to exceed 4 years, 3 months’ time on station. For enlisted crew members
selected to fill NAF/Wing/Group or OSS Staff positions that PCS to the duty assignment, no
AAC is required. Operational units performing weapon system upgrades or bringing new
weapon systems online may request an AAC 39, Operational Continuity, not to exceed 3 years,
for designated SMEs to support transition.

A1.2.1.10.2.1. AFPC is the approving authority for enlisted AAC requests. Submit requests
through HQ AFSPC/A1KK, 150 Vandenberg St. Ste 1105, Peterson AFB CO.

A1.2.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Formal courses conducted by AETC or FTU as
listed in the ETCA found at https://etca.randolph.af.mil, USAF Formal Schools. These courses
provide system specific and positional specific training as a prerequisite to MQT. IQT may be
waived based on experience of the individual or mission needs. Process waivers IAW
Chapter A1.1.

A1.2.2.1. Method. The primary method of IQT is to attend and complete the appropriate formal
training course(s) listed in the ETCA. Completing the appropriate formal course(s) satisfies all
IQT requirements.

A1.2.2.2. In-Unit IQT (IUIQT). When formal course attendance is not practical or quotas are
not available, units will request waivers, to conduct IUIQT. Approved in-unit training must be
accomplished IAW the following guidance:

A1.2.2.2.1. Training lessons should be completed in order; however, if mission scheduling or
student progress dictates otherwise, the unit commander or designee may change the order.

A1.2.2.2.2. Training syllabi will establish a maximum time lapse between training events.
Failure to accomplish training as scheduled will require documentation and corrective action.

A1.2.2.2.3. With operations group commander (OG/CC) (or equivalent) approval, IQT
requirements may be completed during operational missions under the supervision of an
instructor.

A1.2.2.2.4. Cybercrew members entered into in-unit IQT will be dedicated to that program (i.e.,
give training requirements priority over non-training related duties). Exception: Supervisory
personnel may continue their normal duties as time permits.
A1.2.2.3. Cyberspace personnel grandfathered into the 17DXA and 1BX4 career fields do not
need to attend the Network Warfare Bridge Course (NWBC) or Intermediate Network Warfare
Training (INWT). Additionally, graduates (within last 5 years) of Computer Network
Operations Development Program (CNODP), or the Joint Cyberspace Analyst Course (JCAC) do
not need to attend INWT. However, this does not preclude a unit commander from submitting
personnel to attend one of the courses. Attendance in this instance would be based on seat
availability and unit provided funding.

A1.2.3. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT prepares an individual for successful
formal evaluation.

A1.2.3.1. Method. MQT is comprised of local training at the unit.

A1.2.3.2. Units will determine MQT training requirements for each MR/CMR program by using
the appropriate performance criteria and document these MQT requirements appropriately in the
Plan of Instruction (POI). The POI contains the knowledge, tasks, method of training, and total
training time (to include estimated and maximum training times). The time spent per task is
optional. Schedule, conduct, and document MQT in accordance with the POI.

A1.2.3.3. For MR/CMR programs having an IQT course, MQT focuses on filling training
requirements not met at IQT and increasing proficiency, as needed. It also focuses on local
procedures and orientation to ensure a smooth transition from IQT to MR/CMR status. MQT
should not be designed as a substitute for available IQTs.

A1.2.3.4. For MR/CMR programs not supported with an IQT course, MQT provides essential
skills, knowledge and motivation required to attain MR/CMR status.

A1.2.3.5. For personnel assigned to a unit with previous position experience, but who did not
attend IQT for the present assignment, unit training will assess the individual’s knowledge and
proficiency on the required MR/CMR tasks. MQT will be adjusted to reflect the necessary
training.

A1.2.4. Requalification Training. A cybercrew member is considered unqualified upon loss of
currency exceeding 6 months, expiration of his or her qualification evaluation or completion of a
qualification evaluation in a different weapon system (unless multiple qualification has been
approved prior to the evaluation), whichever occurs first. The duration of unqualified time is
from the date the cybercrew member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date.
An unqualified cybercrew member can requalify IAW the following:
A1.2.4.1. Loss of currency 6-12 months: Completion of training in all delinquent items (as
applicable), additional training as directed by the squadron commander and a requalification
evaluation IAW AFSPC GM 10-2.

A1.2.4.2. Loss of currency exceeding 12 months: Recompletion of MQT and a requalification
evaluation IAW AFSPC GM 10-2.
A1.2.4.3. Expiration of qualification evaluation not exceeding 6 months: Completion of training
in all delinquent items (as applicable), additional training as directed by the squadron
commander, and a requalification evaluation IAW AFSPC GM 10-2.

A1.2.4.4. Expiration of qualification evaluation exceeding 6 months: Recompletion of MQT
and a requalification evaluation IAW AFSPC GM 10-2.

A1.3. Continuation Training (CT)

A1.3.1. The continuation training program provides crew members with the volume, frequency,
and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification level.

A1.3.2. Currency. Currency is the minimum frequency required to safely perform a task when
on operational or combat crew duty. Minimum currency requirements for all weapon systems
are as follows:

A1.3.2.1. Crew members will complete training of each task in the MTTL at least once every 18
months. Only one subtask needs to be trained to satisfy the task requirement.

*A1.3.2.2. Crew members will complete a performance training event with stimuli every
quarter. Each performance training event will include an operationally realistic scenario guided
by a script (as applicable) and based upon NAF-approved evaluation criteria. The content and
format of the scenario script is left for units to determine using guidance found in AFH 36-2235
Vol. 12, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Test and Measurement Handbook,
standardizing to the extent practical. At a minimum, each performance training event should
include inputs to measure crew coordination, prioritization and use of approved tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTP). Review and approval of training materials will be determined
by Group or Unit Training Offices.

A1.3.2.3. Crew members will complete a written examination every quarter.

A1.3.2.4. Crew members must complete CT requirements to maintain currency. Crew members
who fail to accomplish minimum CT requirements and subsequently lose currency are
considered in restricted status and are not allowed to perform MR/CMR duties.

A1.3.2.5. Crew members on restricted status for less than 6 months, may regain their currency
by demonstrating proficiency with an instructor in all delinquent items/tasks.

A1.3.2.6. Document decisions to suspend or retain cybercrew member status following failure
of the individual to meet required standards IAW this GM and AFSPC GM 10-2.


A1.4. Upgrade Training.

A1.4.1. Upgrade Training is training needed to qualify to a cybercrew position of additional
responsibility (e.g., from a crew member to a crew commander). Upgrade training will consist
of the mix of IQT, MQT, as required, and all applicable tasks in the position’s MTTL to prepare
an individual for evaluation IAW AFSPC GM 10-2.

A1.5. Multiple Qualifications.

A1.5.1. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one weapon system for
crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is
economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below the MAJCOM level, except
for the Lead MAJCOM. HQ AFSPC delegates this authority to 24 AF/CC.

A1.5.2. Multiple qualifications do not apply to cybercrew members selected for reassignment to
another weapon system who attend training prior to PCS. Squadron commanders from the losing
organization will review reassignment training and validate requirement for additional
qualification prior to cybercrew member operations in the original weapon system. Additional
qualification authorization under this exception terminates when the cybercrew member signs
out from the losing organization.

process outlined in AETCI 36-2203. Submit major change requests through appropriate 24 AF
channels to HQ AFSPC/A3TT for coordination with HQ AETC.

A1.9.2. FTU Course Change/Request Process.

A1.9.2.1. All FTU course change requests will be routed through the appropriate OG/OSS to 39
IOS for coordination. 39 IOS will make determination if change request is a minor or major
change. If 39 IOS determines the course change is major they will inform the Training Planning
Team (TPT) which will determine the need for a Course Resource Estimate (CRE).

A1.9.2.2. Course Resource Estimate Process. Upon direction of the TPT chair, the 39 IOS will
complete a CRE and forward to HQ AFSPC/A3TT for proper staffing and execution. HQ
AFSPC/A3TT will notify the originating agency of the results of the request.

A1.9.2.3. Request for course deletions must be forwarded from the appropriate group
commander through 24 AF. Deletions of 39 IOS courses are reviewed and approved by
HQ AFSPC/A3T.

A1.9.3. Courseware Request Process.

A1.9.3.1. If the 39 IOS has previous approval to build courseware for a unit, the 39 IOS is
approved Direct Line of Authority (DIRLAUTH) for information exchange. This includes
courseware built for other MAJCOMs (e.g. Cyberspace Warfare Operations Weapons Instructor
Course (CWO WIC)). For AFSPC units requesting courseware, submit courseware requests
directly to the 39 IOS.

A1.9.3.2. All other courseware requests originating outside of AFSPC should be submitted to
HQ AFSPC/A3TT who will forward the request to 39 IOS.

A1.10. Formal Training Unit.

A1.10.1. The 39 IOS is designated as the AFSPC cyberspace FTU and provides cyber formal
training not otherwise provided by other Training Commands. The 39 IOS also supports Air
Combat Command’s (ACC) Information Operations (IO) courses. This relationship is described
in Memorandum of Agreement on AFSPC Information Support to ACC.

A1.10.2. 39 IOS Responsibilities.

A1.10.2.1. Provide formal training for Cyberspace career forces as requested.

A1.10.2.2. Support Training System Requirements Analysis (TSRA) for cyber weapon systems

A1.10.2.6. The FCR will review formal training programs and syllabi for currency,
applicability, compliance, and effectiveness.

A1.10.3. Courseware Development. The 39 IOS will develop and maintain courseware for each
course under their purview. The following documents illustrate some of the course core and
administrative documents: Course Training Plans (CTP), Task Training Lists (TTL), Syllabi,
operational unit AF 797’s, and lesson objectives. Ensure courseware complies with Air Force
ISD specifications in AFM 36-2234, Instructional System Development; and AFH 36-2235V8
and other applicable volumes, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Applications,
AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors. All course syllabi will be approved by
HQ AFSPC/A3T or designated representative.

A1.10.4. Course Administration. The 39 IOS will develop and maintain products that are
required for proper administration of courses. These products include, but are not limited to,
assessment surveys, student critiques, course failures, and student registration processes. In
addition to the procedures for slot allocation below, the 39 IOS may develop course
administration procedures outlined in a unit Operating Instruction.

A1.10.4.1. The following guidance is provided for the prioritization and allocation of training
slots for Cyberspace Intermediate Network Warfare Training (INWT) and the Network Warfare
Bridge Course (NWBC).
*A1.10.4.1.1. INWT/NWBC seats are reserved for personnel assigned to Cyber Mission Force
(CMF) teams, 24 AF, ANG, and AFRC MR/CMR positions identified in Attachment 7, award of
17DXA shred or 315 NWS only, and are prioritized using 39 IOS ranking matrix.
*A1.10.4.1.2. Prioritization for assignment of the remaining INWT/NWBC class seats is based
on seat availability and will be prioritized using the 39 IOS ranking matrix. Course slots for
personnel not assigned to CMF teams, 24 AF, ANG, and AFRC MR/CMR positions identified in
Attachment 7, award of 17DXA shred or 315 NWS will be unit funded. Obtain waivers from
HQ AFSPC/A3TT.
A1.10.4.1.3. NWBC seat prioritization will follow the same process as INWT based on the
number of AFSPC funded seats. Remaining unfunded seats will be funded by the appropriate
CFM/FM/unit and are prioritized using 39 IOS ranking matrix.
A1.10.4.1.4. The 39 IOS will provide a prioritized draft INWT and NWBC class roster to HQ
AFSPC/A3T prior to final seat assignment NLT 45 calendar days prior to class start.

A1.10.5. Course Management. The 39 IOS may develop and maintain processes that are
required for course management. These processes include, but are not limited to, course change
requests and CRE.
A1.10.6. Instructor Qualifications and Currency. The 39 IOS will develop procedures for
instructor qualification and currency. A plan and guidance to address instructor selection,
training, certification, and continuing training requirements may be outlined in a unit Operating
Instruction.

A1.11. New or Upgraded System Requirements.

A1.11.1. Prior to system operational test activities and/or initial operations, the wing/group
ensures operations, training, standardization, evaluation and crew force management programs
are developed and managed to provide adequate support to the new or upgraded system
operations. The unit commander will report this status using Status of Resources and Training
System (SORTS) criteria (see AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System). See
AFSPCI 10-604, Space Operations Weapon System Management and AFSPCI 36-283, Space
Training System Management for additional requirements.

A1.11.2. When significant hardware, software or procedural changes impact unit mission
requirements; the certifying official who owns the mission will determine whether supplemental
training or requalification is warranted. If supplemental training is needed, units will develop
and conduct training prior to implementing changes. If requalification training is deemed
necessary, units will train, evaluate and certify affected personnel prior to implementing changes.

A1.11.3. To prepare for significant equipment or procedural changes, a limited number of
subject matter experts (SMEs) in the unit may be designated certified (i.e. MR/CMR,
Specialized, or AF OJT) by the certifying official who owns the mission. The primary duties of
the SME are to develop technical documentation, training and evaluation materials and to
conduct training and evaluations. SMEs appointed for new or upgraded systems are not required
to accomplish the training they develop; however, they must accomplish contractor provided
Type 1 training, if available and any training directed by the OG/CC.

A1.11.3.1. SME designation will be documented in individual training records.

A1.11.3.2. SMEs must accomplish the appropriate training for the duty position, such as
contractor-provided Type 1 training, if available. If deemed more appropriate and cost effective,
SME training may be accomplished by other training types defined in AFI 36-2201. Document
completion of SME training in individual training records.

A1.11.3.3. SMEs will validate training/evaluation programs through formative and summative
evaluation methods IAW ISD processes. This will include delivery of training and evaluation to
non-SME personnel to validate program effectiveness and to ensure sufficient numbers of
personnel are certified to support system test activities and initial operations.

                       TRAINING DEVELOPMENT (Example Only)

A2.1. Training development will define the special set of skills required for mission
accomplishment. Applicable published training standards establish the minimum training task
performance standards required and provide constraints for all performance scenarios. These
will include all tasks/subtasks, along with associated performance standards, conditions,
proficiency codes and applicable timing requirements. For standardization levels see AFSPC
Guidance Memorandum 10-2, Cybercrew Standardization and Evaluation Program.

A2.1.1. Tasks Standard Level Descriptions. Three task standard levels will be used for each
task: A, B, and C. All tasks/subtasks will be documented in a MTTL developed by the units,
approved by the NAF, and coordinated with HQ AFSPC/A3TT.

A2.1.2. Level A/Critical task/sub-task. Critical tasks are tasks that could result in mission
failure, endangerment of human life, serious injury or death. Critical tasks have the greatest
potential for extreme mission or personnel impacts and drive the most stringent training and
evaluation program requirements. Critical tasks apply to time-sensitive tasks or tasks that must
be accomplished as expeditiously as possible without any intervening lower priority actions that
would, in the normal sequence of events, adversely affect task performance/outcome.

A2.1.3. Level B/Essential task/sub-task. Essential tasks are tasks deemed integral to the
performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and
mission execution. Essential tasks drive significant training requirements.

A2.1.4. Level C/Non-Essential task/sub-task. Non-Essential tasks are rudimentary or simple
tasks related to weapons system operations that by themselves have little or no impact on
mission execution. Non-Essential tasks require the least stringent training requirements.

A2.2. Use the sample MTTL and task requirements tables on the next pages as examples only.

A2.3. Table A2.2.1. is an example only. CCC is Crew Commander, COC is Cyberspace
Operations Controller, CA is Cyber Analyst, CO is Cyber Operator, and COT is Cyberspace
Operations Technician. Refer to AFI 36-2201, for definition of proficiency codes (1b, 2b, 3c,
etc.) used in this table.

Units will provide semiannual reports on training devices to HQ AFSPC/A3TT using the formats
and instructions below. HQ AFSPC/A3TT will consolidate unit reports to present the overall
status of command training systems. Submit unclassified reports to a3tt.wf@us.af.mil; reports
are due by 31 January and 31 July each year.

A5.1. Time to Train: Average Time to Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
Units will report the number of calendar days to complete MQT and certification requirements to
bring IQT graduates to MR/CMR status.

Example:

A5.2. Training Device Fidelity/Task Coverage. Use the MTTL, IAW applicable instructions, to
provide a subjective assessment of training device fidelity in a stoplight chart. Provide narrative
to further explain the rationale for the rating assigned. Our goal is to have training devices that
look, sound, and feel like the actual operational equipment to achieve and maintain required
proficiency levels. These systems should emulate appropriate position console displays,
messages and operational support equipment.

Fidelity categories:
Physical (degree of physical representation, appearance, feel and function) Functional (data
change rates, display response, system performance). In addition, use the MTTL and Proficiency
Levels to indicate the percentage of the training system’s coverage of designated tasks at the
specified level of learning. (See Figure A5.1. below).
Figure A5.1. Training System Fidelity/Task Coverage.




A5.3. Training device Performance. Utilization: Report Available/Scheduled/Actual hours per
month for each training device.

Example: 448 / 336 / 331 (device available 16 hours/day [not including scheduled maintenance]
x 7 days x 4 weeks = 448 hours, scheduled for 12 hours/day = 336 hours, 5 hours of lost
utilization = 331). Include an explanation for lost training time. The intent is to reflect
utilization of available trainer time and lost training time due to unscheduled maintenance,
equipment failure, etc.

Reliability: Mean Time Between Maintenance (MTBM). Average time between maintenance
events, based on operating hours. Tracked by month.

Example:
                             Reliability = % available
 Training Device       Jan        Feb         Mar        Apr    May        Jun




Maintainability: Mean Downtime (MDT). Average elapsed time between loss of mission
capable status and system restoration to at least partial mission capable status. This includes
maintenance and supply response, administrative delays, actual on-equipment repair and other
activities such as training and preventive maintenance. Tracked by month.

Example:
                        Maintainability = % available
 Training Device       Jan        Feb        Mar         Apr    May        Jun

                                     624 OC GUIDANCE

A6.1. POLICY AND CONCEPTS

A6.1.1. Introduction

A6.1.1.1. This Attachment provides guidance for 624 OC training programs and applies to
624 OC crewmembers.

A6.1.1.2. This Attachment directs formal appointment of 624 OC trainers with a unit developed
trainer training program.

Note: 624 OC crewmember training, as outlined in this Attachment, is a separate program from
Air Force On-the-Job Training (OJT). OJT is governed by AFI 36-2201 and documented on the
AF Form 623, On-the-Job Training Record or other AF approved system (for enlisted members
only). There is a potential overlap of training requirements and events. 624 OC training and
career field training documentation are separate programs.

A6.1.2. General

A6.1.2.1. 624 OC training: 624 OC crewmember training consists of Initial Qualification
Training (IQT) and Mission Qualification Training (MQT) for all 624 OC crewmembers
qualifying to Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status. Upon receipt of
MR/CMR designation, all 624 OC MR/CMR crewmembers will then complete Continuation
Training (CT) requirements IAW paragraph A6.2.2.3 of this Attachment.

A6.1.2.2. All training will be documented IAW paragraph A6.2.2.5 of this Attachment.

A6.1.2.3. CT will be documented on locally developed tracking systems, other (Sharable
Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant) electronic storage means, or Learning
Management System (LMS). Units may maintain manual training folders as backups only.
Units will maintain IQT/MQT training documentation on personnel until PCS and forward to
next unit. Following award of MR/CMR status, IQT/MQT training documentation and
certificates may be maintained in unit developed grade books, or maintained in unit developed
training folders.

A6.1.2.4. The 624 OC will have an Annual Training Plan (ATP)/Annual Plan of Instruction
(APOI).

A6.1.3. Responsibilities

A6.1.3.1. HQ AFSPC

A6.1.3.1.1. Provides training oversight and direction to 624 OC.
A6.1.3.1.2. Approves 624 OC formal course content via 39th Information Operations Squadron-
generated syllabi.

A6.1.3.1.3. Establishes general 624 OC MQT/CT requirements.

A6.1.3.1.4. Coordinates 39 IOS training slots for 624 OC training.

A6.1.3.2. 24 AF

A6.1.3.2.1. Validate, approve, and provide guidance on the implementation and use of Master
Training Task Lists (MTTLs). Coordinate MTTL with HQ AFSPC/A3TT.

A6.1.3.3. 624 OC/DOT

A6.1.3.3.1. Manages the unit 624 OC training program, coordinates with ARC aligned units,
and serves as the 624 OC CC’s POC for all applicable 624 OC training items.

A6.1.3.3.2. Coordinates class slots for 624 OC training.

A6.1.3.3.3. Provides guidance, assistance, and review of division/team training programs.

A6.1.3.3.4. Ensures full range of 624 OC training is accomplished and documented IAW this
GM and approved local supplements or operating instructions.

A6.1.3.3.5. Reports 624 OC training program status, LIMFACs, and recommendations to the
commander as directed.

A6.1.3.3.6. 624 OC Training Manager (TM) or designee should attend as the 624 OC CC's POC
for applicable syllabus reviews.

A6.2. 624 OC TRAINING PROGRAM

A6.2.1. Introduction: This chapter provides 624 OC training requirements. Crewmember
training is a sequential, three-phased program to reach and maintain MR/CMR status. Phases
are: IQT, MQT, and CT.

A6.2.2. Crewmember Training Program

A6.2.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT):

A6.2.2.1.1. IQT provides the training necessary to qualify 624 OC crew-members in a generic
division/team level position. IQT provides foundational knowledge, skills, and context for
follow-on training. IQT provides basic skills to all crewmembers in order for them to work in
the 624 OC.
A6.2.2.1.2. The 624 OC TM will attempt to gain course slots for individuals to attend formal
training at the 39 IOS. Personnel unable to attend training at the 39 IOS training will request a
waiver and complete MQT.

A6.2.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT)

A6.2.2.2.1. Definition: MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or requalify 624 OC
crewmembers in a specific position to perform the missions assigned. MQT is a unit
responsibility. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for attaining MR/CMR status.

A6.2.2.2.2. Method: MQT normally involves tailored training with a trainer plus applicable
SMEs, classroom academics, self-study, and practice as necessary. The 624 OC will determine
the best mix of methods to meet all MQT training needs.

A6.2.2.2.3. Timeline: MQT must be started NLT 60 days from IQT completion (180 days for
ARC personnel). First term airmen will complete the first term airmen course then have 30 days
for entry into MQT. In all cases, MQT must be complete within 90 days of start (ARC personnel
have 365 days to complete) of MQT.

A6.2.2.2.4. MQT is complete when all training requirements are complete and the individual is
released to unit Stan/Eval. A crewmember will achieve MR/CMR status when Stan/Eval has
completed its evaluation process and the 624 OC/CC or designate (not lower than 624 OC
Division Chief level) signs the appropriate paperwork.

A6.2.2.2.5. Initial on-the-job (OJT; job orientation) may be accomplished before formal entry
into MQT IAW the timelines established above.

A6.2.2.2.6. MQT may not be waived.

A6.2.2.2.7. Extensions: Extensions to the MQT timeline may occur as follows: The
Commander may approve one 60-day extension (180 days for ARC units).

A6.2.2.3. Continuation Training (CT)

A6.2.2.3.1. Definition: CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix of
training necessary to maintain MR/CMR proficiency in their assigned position. CT begins after
a crewmember has attained MR/CMR status. Units are responsible for developing an annual CT
plan focusing on the units’ mission or support for any upcoming exercises. These plans will be
approved by 624 OC/CC.

Note: Mandatory AF training generally referred to as ancillary training may not be counted
toward CT. ARC units will accomplish standardized academic CT over a two-year vice one-year
period. Thus, quarterly requirements become semi-annual; semi-annual become annual
requirements, and annual requirements become bi-annual for ARC aligned units.

A6.2.2.3.2. Content: CT content is to be determined and developed by the unit.
A6.2.2.3.3. Purpose: CT accomplishes two purposes: maintaining 624 OC positional
qualification (MR/CMR status) and expanding operational level knowledge and C2 skills. CT is
the 624 OC/CC’s and Division Chiefs’ tool to ensure that 624 OC crewmembers are prepared to
perform the mission at all times. Crewmembers qualified in more than one position must meet
CT requirements for each position. Dual qualified crewmembers with like CT requirements that
are the same for each position only need to perform the specific CT requirement for 1 position.

A6.2.2.3.4. Method: CT may consist of any combination of mass academics, e-learning,
directed self-study, systems training, positional refresher training, or exercises.

A6.2.2.3.5. Timeline: CT requirements begin the first duty day of the following month after the
individual is designated MR/CMR.

A6.2.2.3.6. Proration: Units may prorate CT requirements based on initial MR/CMR date,
TDYs, deployments, or periods of non-OC duty (e.g., honor guard, medical leave). Unit must
ensure training is adjusted to account for time assigned (PCS or TDY) to contingencies.

A6.2.2.3.7. Failure to meet CT requirements: Failure to meet CT requirements results in
regression to non-MR (N-MR)/CMR (N-CMR) status. 624 OC/CC may allow up to a 30-day
grace period for the accomplishment of CT requirements. ARC-aligned unit commanders may
allow up to a 180-day grace period.

A6.2.2.3.7.1. N-MR/N-CMR crewmembers may not perform 624 OC duties unless supervised
by a MR/CMR crewmember.

A6.2.2.3.7.2. To regain MR/CMR status, a crewmember must accomplish the delinquent CT.
The individual's training records must reflect both the regression to N-MR/N-CMR and the
reacquisition of MR/CMR status.

A6.2.2.3.7.3. Failure to regain MR/CMR within 6 months (18 months for ARC) results in
regression to unqualified status (UQ).

A6.2.2.4. Trainer Program

A6.2.2.4.1. The 624 OC weapons system (WS), is not similar to other weapons systems in that
active duty personnel are normally assigned for only one tour. Therefore, the WS does not have
a formal program to develop and certify trainers for a career. Unit personnel selected to perform
as trainers are considered by unit leadership as highly proficient in division and team processes
or a particular WS application. Individuals will complete local unit trainer program requirements
below and are not required to complete any formal USAF trainer/instructor program in order to
be considered a unit trainer.

A6.2.2.4.2. 624 OC crew position trainers must be approved by the commander, or ARC aligned
unit commander or commander designated division/team chiefs, and must be certified in their
current crew position.
Note: 624 OC may elect to use a SME for certain elements of their training programs (e.g.,
theater/mission familiarization training, systems and applications, or designated processes).
SMEs will not fill the role of duty position trainer but rather augment training given by the
designated trainer.

A6.2.2.4.3. 624 OC crew position trainers will receive the following training from the unit TM:

A6.2.2.4.3.1. Unit training administrative practices to include filling out unit training
documentation

A6.2.2.4.3.2. Trainer responsibilities

A6.2.2.4.3.3. Positional training techniques

A6.2.2.4.3.4. Briefing/Debriefing techniques

A6.2.2.5. Training Documentation

A6.2.2.5.1. Individual Qualification Folders (IQF). The IQF contains the source documents that
constitute the history of training for each member. The AFSPC Form 4419 is the source
document used to record training of a member. Software applications capturing the same
information are authorized provided the unit gains approval by HQ AFSPC/A3T prior to use.

A6.2.2.5.2. Electronic format IQFs are authorized provided proper security measures, backup
capability, and sustainment plans are in place. If electronic IQFs are used, the Chief of Training
(or equivalent) will publish guidance on storage and layout.

A6.2.2.5.3. At a minimum the following items will documented via approved AF Forms or
software applications capturing the same information.

A6.2.2.5.3.1. Acknowledgement and documentation of task qualification/certification upon
completion of training.

A6.2.2.5.3.2. Trainee strengths, weaknesses, attitude and corrective action (if required).

A6.2.2.5.3.3. Explanation of delays in training requirements and/or completion, problems
encountered with task certification (if any).

A6.2.2.5.3.4. Training plan manage and execute training activities, to include milestone for task
completion (projected timeframe the trainee will complete all required tasks).

A6.2.2.5.3.5. Certification(s) and decertification(s) (e.g., MR/CMR, instructor, evaluator).
Include reason for decertification entries.
