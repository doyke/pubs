                     NONDESTRUCTIVE INSPECTION PROGRAM

2.1. Purpose of Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) and Oil Analysis Program (OAP) (AFSC
2A7X2).
   2.1.1. NDI is a group of inspection methods used to investigate the quality, integrity,
   properties and dimensions of materials and components without damaging or impairing their
   serviceability. The primary inspection methods are fluorescent liquid penetrant, magnetic
   particle, eddy current, ultrasonic and radiographic. NDI extends the life of aircraft, engines
   and related support equipment by detecting defects, i.e., cracks, voids, delaminations and
   foreign objects.
   2.1.2. The OAP is used to measure and evaluate internal engine wear metal by interpreting
   oil analysis results. The engine condition is assessed based on the diagnosis of the probable
   source of the wear metal. Based on this assessment, the OAP Laboratory makes a
   maintenance or operational recommendation to the user. The OAP is an essential part of
   aircraft maintenance because it helps determine the condition of aircraft engines.
      2.1.2.1. Scanning Electron Microscope/Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM/EDX) analysis
      is used to analyze engine wear metal debris that accumulates on master/magnetic chip
      detectors. The size of this debris is too large to be detected by conventional oil analysis
      spectrometers in the OAP. SEM/EDX machines use software with an algorithm specific
      to the engine type under analysis to produce a maintenance or operational
      recommendation.
2.2. MAJCOM/A4M Responsibilities.
   2.2.1. Manages the command NDI and Oil Analysis Program.
   2.2.2. Designate a senior NCO to manage the program and perform the following
   responsibilities:
      2.2.2.1. Represent command at 2A7X2 utilization and training workshops.

guidance for applying command approved, non-USAF standard aircraft coatings and markings as
authorized in T.O. 1-1-8 Application And Removal of Organic Coatings, Aerospace And Non-
Aerospace Equipment. Paint schemes/configurations and USAF standard aircraft markings will
be applied in accordance with T.O. 1-1-8 and the applicable aircraft technical order.
   3.14.1. Advanced Performance Coating (APC), is the preferred topcoat unless mandated
   otherwise IAW weapon system specific technical data. This preferred coating system
16                                                         CAFI21-105 5 SEPTEMBER 2012


  includes the appropriate Mil-PRF-23377 primer for bare metal uncovered during preparation,
  non-chromated tie coat material and an approved APC topcoat.
  3.14.2. Coating System Scoring and Maintenance. All units are required to score aircraft
  coating systems to determine frequency of topcoat application. Fighter units should plan to
  scuff sand and overcoat the entire aircraft between depot cycles as necessary. Fighter aircraft
  may require complete overcoat at 36 months or some may only require touch-up. All aircraft
  painting will be scheduled on a worst first basis to maintain coating system integrity and
  aircraft appearance. All aircraft coating systems except F-22, F-35, and RQ-4 will be
  evaluated/rated every 6 months for appearance/coating system integrity using applicable
  technical data or a locally developed system. The exterior of aircraft must be clean prior to
  paint scoring. Supervisors will use ratings to determine corrosion treatment/paint scheduling
  priority. Units are required to adopt maintenance-painting techniques (i.e., spot painting and
  sectionalized painting as stated in T.O. 1-1-8) to maintain aircraft corrosion protection and
  appearance between overcoats. Partial painting ―sections‖ of the aircraft will help reduce the
  effects of mottling and mismatch. Units should rotate commander’s aircraft to prevent
  excessive paint build-up from too frequent over coating. Fully over coated aircraft will be
  documented in IMDS and the individual aircraft AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data,
  for tracking purposes. Large aircraft units should rely on spot maintenance painting and
  sectionalized painting between depot cycles to maintain the coating system integrity.
  3.14.3. Aircraft Markings. Markings will be applied to aircraft as authorized by specific
  aircraft T.O.s, T.O. 1-1-8, and this instruction. Aircraft markings not previously approved,
  necessitates a waiver from HQ ACC/A4M. Aircraft contracted for repaint at depot facilities
  will be marked IAW specific aircraft T.O.s, T.O. 1-1-8, this instruction, and applicable
  waivers currently approved. MAJCOM/A4M is the point of contact for aircraft painting and
  markings. ACC/A4M is the point of contact for all AF Unit Identifier markings. This listing
  can be found in Attachment 3 of this instruction. All aircraft markings and basic paint
  schemes will be maintained intact, legible and distinct in color. Command standardization of
  markings by mission design series (MDS) is of primary concern.
     3.14.3.1. Stenciling. Markings may be applied using stencils. Refer to T.O. 1-1-8 to
     determine the compatibility of stenciling paints, paint finishes and decal applications.
     3.14.3.2. Command Insignia. The application of the command insignia on aircraft is
     mandatory. The insignia will be applied to both sides of the vertical stabilizer unless
     otherwise specified. Fighter type aircraft will use either full color or subdued insignias as
     specified in Attachment 2. Large aircraft (B-1, C-130, etc) will use subdued insignias
     unless otherwise specified in Attachment 2. Size and location of command insignias by
     MDS are specified in Attachment 2. For Total Force Integration (TFI) locations under
     classic association, the existing command insignia and location, used by the host active
     duty wing will remain on partnering ANG or AFRC designated aircraft.
     3.14.3.3. Organizational Insignia. The application of wing insignia is mandatory. The
     insignia will be applied to both sides of the forward fuselage. The operational squadron
     insignia may be applied on the left side in place of the wing insignia. Wing and squadron
     insignias will be the same color scheme as the command insignia, i.e., subdued for large
     aircraft and full color or subdued for fighter aircraft unless otherwise specified in
     Attachment 2. For TFI locations under classic association, the host active duty Wing

     Commander may authorize specific aircraft to have organization insignia changes. If
     active duty organizational insignias continue to be used on associate unit aircraft, the size
     and location may be altered from Attachment 2.
     3.14.3.4. Distinctive Unit Identifier Marking. The application of the unit identifier is
     mandatory for all CAF aircraft unless otherwise directed. ACC/A4M is the office of
     primary responsibility (OPR) for the assignment of unit designators. The primary factor
     used to determine appointment of unit identifier is the aircraft/unit assignment location.
     T.O. 1-1-8 or the applicable aircraft T.O. will provide color restrictions for the unit
     identifier. The unit identifier will be applied in accordance with guidelines in
     Attachment 2 of this instruction. For Total Force Integration (TFI) locations under
     classic association, the existing distinctive unit identifier and location will remain on
     partnering ANG or AFRC designated aircraft.
     3.14.3.5. Tail Stripe. Tail stripes are applied as a wing option, used to identify aircraft
     operation squadrons. Tail stripes on F-35 aircraft are not authorized. Each operations
     squadron will have a tail stripe unique to that squadron. The use of the same tail stripe by
     two or more squadrons within a wing is not permitted. The tail stripe will be applied at
     the upper portion of the vertical stabilizer, and must be in the form of a straight stripe.
     The width will not exceed 9 inches on fighter and small reconnaissance type aircraft, 15
     inches on large aircraft. The stripe may be any color or pattern, and may contain a logo.
     On aircraft bearing the American Flag, the tail stripe must be solid in color and will not
     contain any logo, name, or lettering. On aircraft with multiple vertical stabilizers, the tail
     stripe may be of either a wrap-around style on both vertical stabilizers or applied to the
     outboard sides of each vertical stabilizer. Units will not repaint tail flashes/stripes during
     deployed operations. Once deployed, aircraft will retain their original paint
     configurations, unless otherwise directed by AFCENT/CC.
     3.14.3.6. Aircrew And Crew Chief Names. Aircrew and crew chief/assistant names
     must be applied to all command aircraft, but must be removed prior to deployment from
     home station in direct combat zones or when participating in contingencies that may
     subject aircraft to hostile fire abroad. Application of nicknames, punctuation, and/or call
     signs is not permitted. Style and size of letters are a unit option but will not exceed 3
     inches in height. All aircraft in the wing will be standard with the exception of the
     designated Commander's aircraft, which may have different lettering but will not exceed
     3 inches in height. A background block for pilot/crew chief names may be used. The
     block should be in contrasting color to the section of the aircraft where applied. To
     further an MDS theme, block may be preceded by a design depicting the MDS i.e., F-15
     eagle head, F-16 falcon head, etc. The name block should give a subdued appearance and
     may be other than rectangular in shape.
     3.14.3.7. Commander's Aircraft Markings. Commander's aircraft referred to in this
     instruction are those designated as Numbered Air Force (NAF), Wing, OG and
     commanders of flying squadrons (Bomber/Fighter/Reconnaissance). The NAF
     Commander may select one wing within the command to have an aircraft specifically
     marked. It will be the only aircraft authorized so marked. Commanders are authorized to
     designate one aircraft each to be marked with standardized commander type markings,
     refer to Attachment 2 for specific markings. Unit identifier and radio call numbers will
     remain on vertical stabilizers as depicted in applicable T.O. and this MAJCOM policy.

     For TFI locations under classic association, the host active duty Wing Commander may
     authorize specific aircraft to be identified as the associate ANG or AFRC Commander’s
     aircraft. These changes are in support of ownership pride and esprit de corps between
     active duty, reserve, and guard partnering wings. Digital photographs must be provided to
     MAJCOM/A4M for review and file for all designated commander’s aircraft. The
     following are markings authorized for use on commander’s aircraft:
        3.14.3.7.1. Wing and/or NAF insignias on the right forward fuselage and a collage of
        assigned flight/operations squadron insignias on the left forward fuselage.
        3.14.3.7.2. Highlighting (shadowing) of unit identifier and standardized commander
        type markings on the tails. All highlighting will be done in contrasting gray, black or
        white as long as it meets primary basecoat gloss requirements e.g., gloss, camouflage
        or gunship.
        3.14.3.7.3. Anniversary markings. This policy is provided to allow latitude for
        application of anniversary logo markings to Wing Commander aircraft only. When
        applied, anniversary markings will not interfere with required aircraft markings and
        must be removed immediately after the anniversary period (1-year maximum).
        Waivers are not required for unit unique markings, however, Wing Commanders
        must approve the markings, and photographs must be provided to MAJCOM/A4M
        for review and file. State flags and logos other than anniversary type are not
        considered unit unique markings and are not authorized.
        3.14.3.7.4. Naming of aircraft. This policy is provided to allow for application of the
        unique aircraft naming on Wing Commander aircraft. This includes markings
        previously considered unit unique and are community related/appreciation types such
        as ―Spirit of,‖ ―City of‖ and ―State of.‖ Naming aircraft is a tradition designed to
        commemorate or honor individuals, geographic locations, or events either for the
        support provided the Air Force on a long-term basis, or because of its significance to
        Air Force history or heritage. Recommendations must include a proposed name,
        aircraft tail number, and detailed justification for the proposed design/name. Size of
        marking is limited to 24 sq inches for fighter type aircraft, 36 sq inches for large
        aircraft (C-130, B-1, etc). Subdued color needs to be considered for certain type and
        mission of aircraft. MAJCOM/PA are designated as the clearinghouse for all requests
        to name CAF aircraft and must ultimately be approved by AF/CV. Route requests
        through wing PA to MAJCOM/A4Ms. MAJCOM/A4M will coordinated with
        MAJCOM/PA before submitting to AF/CV. Contact your wing Public Affairs office
        for details.
     3.14.3.8. Aircraft Travel Pods. Travel pods will be painted the same color and tone as
     the aircraft with no additional markings. Gloss paint may be used to aid in cleaning. Units
     with multicolor aircraft should select one primary color of the aircraft for the travel pod.
     Travel pods designated for commanders may be any color and may contain the position
     and name of the individual and appropriate insignia. Lettering may be of any color and
     style, but shall not exceed 6 inches in height. Demonstration teams have the option to
     paint travel pods gloss black and apply unique markings. The left side of pod will contain

                              F-22 OUTER MOLD LINE AUDIT

A4.1. The Low Observables Section is responsible to perform a Signature Assessment System
(SAS) and aircraft Outer Mold Line (OML) audit on each assigned aircraft annually. The audit is
used to confirm that damage defects entered in the SAS during daily OML inspections or
damages removed from SAS during routine maintenance provide for an accurate representation
of the LO system health. This can only be performed by physically matching aircraft damages
with the entries in SAS. Errors identified during the audit must be recorded in the audit historical
file and corrected in the SAS immediately. Any aircraft audit that results in a +15% or -15% SAS
margin deviation indicates a potential deficiency with the OML inspection process. Maintenance
supervisors with direct oversight of LO processes must ensure significant variances are
understood and corrective actions, e.g., training, additional QA oversight, process changes, etc.
immediately follow. Internal root cause analysis and corrective actions must be documented for
historical purposes any time an audit exceeds the margin percentages outlined above. Units must
also establish a local SAS management policy outlining the frequency of QA evaluations to
ensure SAS data for each aircraft is accurate. Note: There is an unacceptable risk to aircraft radar
cross section and aircraft survivability due to substandard maintenance practices or inaccurate
maintenance documentation into the SAS. Aircraft scheduled for an audit should be identified
during the monthly/weekly shared resources meeting.
   A4.1.1. All aircraft scheduled to support a Theater Security Package/contingency
   deployment must not have an audit due within 30 days of arriving at the deployed location.
A4.2. The following equipment is required to perform SAS margin audit:
   A4.2.1. Miltope or Portable Maintenance Aid (PMA)
   A4.2.2. Black marker
   A4.2.3. Pen or pencil
   A4.2.4. Fuselage station butt line chart
   A4.2.5. Roll of tape (blue 3M 2090)
   A4.2.6. Booties
A4.3. The SAS and OML audit historical files: The SAS and OML audit files will be maintained
for 5 years. Each audit file will include at a minimum:
   A4.3.1. Name of person/s performing the audit
   A4.3.2. Date of audit
   A4.3.3. Pre-audit SAS margin percentage using sector with the highest number
   A4.3.4. Post-audit SAS margin percentage using sector with greatest change, except in the
   case where a decrease in margin is greater than an increase in any sector. Sector increases are
   always more critical than sector decreases
   A4.3.5. Number of new damages identified
   A4.3.6. Number of previously repaired damages not removed from SAS

                          DAILY SAS REPORTING METRICS

A5.1. Fleet SAS margin numbers must be documented in a format similar to the chart below
(Figure A5.1.). Key information includes SAS margin number for each aircraft, fleet SAS
average and number of aero only panels. Fleet SAS average reported must not include non-
possessed aircraft. This information must be disseminated within the wing MXG as required and
MAJCOM F-22 Weapon System Team at least weekly.

                                SAS CREEP DESCRIPTION

A6.1. The chart below (Figure A6.1.) shows a categorization approach to optimize maintenance
activities. It outlines three categories of damages, those with an impact greater than 20% (major
―spikes‖), those between 2% and 20% (moderate ―routine‖) and those less than 2% (minor
―creep‖). Post flight OML inspections accomplished by the crew chief and/or LO personnel must
identify any LO spike damages as soon as possible after flight if the aircraft is on the next day
flying schedule.

Figure A6.1. SAS Creep Description.




   A6.1.1. The damage definition/SAS creep metric must be used to establish a battle rhythm
   for managing LO maintenance. Minor damages are repaired through scheduled SAS redux.
   Moderate damages should primarily be worked in groups in conjunction with other scheduled
   maintenance, e.g., Packaged Maintenance Plans, TCTOs, and panel removals to facilitate
   other maintenance. Any existing moderate damages should be the priority when performing
   scheduled SAS reduction efforts. Large damages driving significant increases in SAS must
   be fixed as soon as possible to manage SAS growth. In some cases it may be prudent to
   define large damages as >10 percent to effectively control SAS margins. This more
   aggressive approach is particularly beneficial prior to major deployments. Units have the
   option to define spikes as >10% if necessary to control spike growth, but the SAS creep
   definition provided above must be used in all cases.
CAFI21-105 5 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              63


  A6.1.2. Use wing analysis and scheduling experts to help balance flying operations and LO
  maintenance events/downtime to best manage LO fleet health. Failure to effectively balance
  flying and LO maintenance requirements could lead to an uncontrollable LO backlog.

                   CANOPY TRANSPARENCY COATING TRACKING

A7.1. Units will track canopy coating data in a format similar to the chart below (Figure A7.1.).
The tracking sheet must also include transparency manufacture and damage information by
placing a flag note in each block used to track canopy hours. This data is tracked to help units
predict reliability. Canopy data must be disseminated to MXG supervisors, MAJCOM weapon
system team and the LM canopy IPT at least weekly.

                               SAS MARGIN DEFINITION

A8.1. The graphic below (Figure A8.1.) depicts the SAS margin scale used to determine mission
capable status for the F-22 LO system.

Figure A8.1. SAS Margin Definition.




   A8.1.1. The LO margin for each aircraft is determined via OML inspection and use of SAS.
   An aircraft is fully mission capable for the LO system when the SAS margin is less than or
   equal to 100 percent. LO restoration is required when 100 percent SAS margin exceeded.
   A8.1.2. Manage fleet LO by taking advantage of opportunistic downtime or scheduling LO
   restoration time when RCS margin approaches unit determined threshold (typically around
   80%). Fleet SAS margin averages should be maintained at or below 60 percent during peace
   time operations to effectively manage SAS margin growth. Utilize a SAS top 5/10 priority
   list or SAS priority screen to schedule LO maintenance events. Any top 5/10 priority list
   must be kept current for other opportunities such as FOM work, aero-coated panel restoration
   if aircraft is down, complete concurrent spike and moderate damage repairs.
   A8.1.3. SAS does not rank-order aircraft in terms of RCS.
   A8.1.4. SAS number does not correlate to an RCS pattern.
   A8.1.5. SAS is not a mission planning tool.
