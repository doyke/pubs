Figure A6.2. Procedures For Dismissals Due to Heat

                     PROCEDURES FOR DISMISSALS DUE TO HEAT

1. Group dismissals due to temperature extremes must be established by reasonable standards of
judgment that conditions are such as to actually prevent working, precautionary measures have
been ineffective, and there are no alternative work sites where employees may be utilized.
Matters such as physical requirements of positions as well as the temperatures of the work areas
must be considered.

2. During periods of no heat/air, uncomfortable temperatures are to be expected. Supervisors
must take appropriate precautionary measures, and evaluate the effectiveness of those
precautions before considering making a request for administrative dismissal. In the event that
the precautions are ineffective and the supervisor concludes that the work environment is not
conducive to reasonable productivity or does not meet reasonable health standards, the
supervisor should attempt to relocate as many employees as possible to alternate work areas
including the utilization of Ad Hoc telework. The supervisor of the area(s) affected will then
report the problem, and efforts to reduce disruption of work, through their chain of command to
the two-letter chief/commander, e.g. AFLCMC/CC, AFRL/CC, 88 MDG/CC, AFIT/CC, etc.

3. If the two-letter chief/commander (or designee) believes administrative dismissal is
warranted, that individual will contact their servicing Human Resources Specialist (Employee
Relations) extension 7-2411 in the Civilian Personnel Office with specific information
concerning a) the nature of the problem, b) recommendations/evaluations from appropriate
offices (e.g. CEOSC), c) precautionary measures taken and their effectiveness, and d) results of
efforts to relocate employees. The Human Resources Specialist (Employee Relations) will then
contact the 88 Air Base Wing (Installation) Commander’s office for a final
determination/approval on the administrative dismissal. The decision as to whether dismissal is
authorized will then be relayed to the requesting organization by the Human Resources Specialist
(Employee Relations). If the two-letter chief/commander receives approval for administrative
dismissal directly from the 88 Air Base Wing Commander, a memorandum for the record should
document a) the nature of the problem, b) recommendations/evaluations from appropriate
offices, c) precautionary measures taken and their effectiveness, d) results of efforts to relocate
employees, e) who approved the administrative leave, f) who was authorized administrative
leave and g) how many hours were authorized. A copy of the memorandum should be provided
to the servicing Human Resources Specialist (Employee Relations) and to your organization’s
Customer Service Representative (CSR).

4. When early dismissal is authorized, those affected employees in a duty status at the time set
for dismissal are given administrative leave, annotated as “LN” on timesheets. For employees
who are scheduled to report for duty after an initial period of leave, and dismissal is given before
the employee can report, leave is charged until the time set for dismissal. Employees who leave
before the scheduled dismissal time, or who are already in a leave status, continue to be charged
leave.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI90-501 12 MARCH 2014                                                      15



5. While the major emphasis of this guidance has addressed temperature extremes, the same
information gathering, coordination, and efforts to relocate employees must be accomplished for
other types of unexpected, adverse work-area conditions such as plumbing and lighting
malfunctions, power outages, etc.
