BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE




OFFICIAL                                     LOREN M. RENO, Lieutenant General, USAF
                                             DCS, Logistics, Installation and Mission Support
2.6. Becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF
Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. For OJT, the tasks in
Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the individual can perform the
task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of
procedures. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.
When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:

       2.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.

              2.6.1.1. Identify current duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph
              number or letter next to the task statement. Additionally, all core (*) and diamond
              () tasks should be circled. Document task completion by annotating columns 3A,
              3B, 3C, 3D and 3E, as appropriate.

              NOTE: All entries shall be made in pencil, if applicable.

              2.6.1.2. Enter the start date of the AFQTP on the AFQTP documentation record.
              Once completed enter the completion date. When hands-on training is started and
              completed annotate the STS accordingly.

              2.6.1.3. Transcribing from old document (paper or automated) to CFETP. Use
              the new STS to identify and certify all current and past task qualifications.

                      2.6.1.3.1. For tasks previously certified and still required in the current
                      duty position:

                             2.6.1.3.1.1. For core and critical tasks, the trainer and certifier
                             evaluate Airman’s current qualifications and validates Airman’s
                             ability to complete the task. Then the trainee initials in the Trainee
                             Column (3C) and the current Task Certifier (i.e., the
                             supervisor/trainer) initials in the Trainer’s Column (3D).

                             2.6.1.3.1.2. For non-core duty position tasks, the trainer evaluates
                             the Airman's current qualifications and validates the Airman's ability
                             to complete the task. Then the trainee initials in the Trainee Column
                             (3C) and the current Task Certifier (i.e., the supervisor/trainer) initials
                             in the Trainer’s Column (3D).

                      2.6.1.3.2. To transcribe previous certification for tasks not required in
                      the current duty position, carry forward only the previous certification dates
                      (not the initials of another person). If and when these tasks become a duty
                      position requirement, recertify with current date and trainee, trainer and
                      certifier’s initials.
