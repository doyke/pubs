                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202 Volume 2
and this volume.
   1.1.1. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) skills will be evaluated along with
   technical skills as outlined in the grading criteria in this chapter. CRM skills are imbedded
   within the appropriate grading criteria; the use of AF Form 4031, CRM Skill Criteria
   Training/Evaluation Form, is not required.
1.2. Waivers.
   1.2.1. Unless otherwise specified, HQ USAF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for this
   instruction. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew
   requirements, but may not approve blanket or group (two or more aircrew) waivers.
   1.2.2. Request waivers through applicable Stan/Eval channels to MAJCOM/A3,(or
   equivalent). As applicable, MAJCOM/A3s will forward requests to HQ USAF/A3O-A, with
   an info copy to HQ USAF/A3O-AT.
   1.2.3. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and
   approved through higher level coordination authority.
1.3. Key Words and Definitions.
   1.3.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. ―Should‖ is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.3.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. ―Note‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
   to emphasize.
1.4. Procedures.
   1.4.1. Stan/Eval Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria in this instruction for
   conducting all flight and emergency procedure evaluations. To ensure standard and objective
   evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
   criteria.
   1.4.2. All evaluations fall under the Instrument (INSTM), Qualification (QUAL), Mission
   (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), or spot check (SPOT) criteria in AFI 11-202V2. INSTM applies
   to pilots only. All evaluation activity will be scheduled to occur on one sortie to the greatest
   extent possible.
   1.4.3. FEs may use video recording (VR) devices to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
   1.4.4. FEs will brief examinees on the evaluation purpose, conduct and the evaluation areas
   prior to flight. Examinees will accomplish required flight planning for the evaluation IAW
 6                                                       AFI11-2MC-12WV2 11 AUGUST 2011


     requirements for their crew position. Examinees will furnish FEs a copy of necessary flight
     logs, target folders, and other required mission materials.
     1.4.5. FEs should not occupy a primary crew position during evaluations except when it
     would afford the best opportunity to conduct INSTR evaluations.
     1.4.6. Areas required to complete an evaluation are indicated with an "R" on applicable
     evaluation criteria tables. When a required area cannot be evaluated in flight, it will be
     evaluated in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD if available) or by oral examination in order
     to complete the evaluation. The use of alternate evaluation methods will be documented in
     the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, comments section. If an alternate
     evaluation method was used in a flight evaluation required area, the next evaluation cannot
     use an alternate method for that area.
     1.4.7. FEs will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. The debrief will include the
     examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified)
     and any recommended additional training.
1.5. Grading Instructions.
     1.5.1. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and this
     instruction.
     1.5.2. FEs will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
     evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the
     area. FEs will derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a
     composite for the observed events and tasks IAW this volume.
     1.5.3. FEs will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered provided the
     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. FEs will consider cumulative deviations when determining an overall grade.
     1.5.4. When grading criteria specify evaluation of airspeed and the flight manual lists only a
     minimum/maximum airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed.
     1.5.5. FEs must exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when
     specific situations are not covered.
     1.5.6. An unqualified grade in any of the critical areas identified by this instruction requires
     an overall unqualified grade.
     1.5.7. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
     1.5.8. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
     performance. The first tier is comprised of the individual areas/subareas (e.g. debriefing,
     mission planning, etc.) where a grade of Q, Q- or U is assigned based on established criteria,
     cumulative grades for each task in an area/subarea on a grade sheet and evaluator judgment.
     The overall area grade will be the lowest of any sub-area grade awarded. The second tier
     consists of the overall qualification level itself (Q-1, Q-2 or Q-3) which is determined from
     the compilation of these individual scores/grades from all the individual areas/subareas.
        1.5.8.1. Qualified (Q). Q is the desired level of performance. Satisfactory knowledge of
        all required information and performed duties within prescribed tolerances.
AFI11-2MC-12WV2 11 AUGUST 2011                                                                     7


      1.5.8.2. Qualified with discrepancies (Q-). Q- Means qualified to perform the assigned
      area tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the evaluator.
      Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or
      jeopardize safety.
      1.5.8.3. Unqualified (U). Performance outside allowable parameters or deviations from
      prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mission accomplishment or
      compromised safety. An area grade of U requires additional training.
      1.5.8.4. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The member demonstrated desired performance
      and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the
      grading criteria. This will be awarded when no discrepancies are noted and may be
      awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
          1.5.8.4.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades in any area(s)/sub-area(s).
          1.5.8.4.2. All discrepancies noted were cleared during the debrief of that evaluation.
          1.5.8.4.3. In the judgment of the evaluator, none of the discrepancies preclude
          awarding an overall Q-1.
      1.5.8.5. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The member demonstrated the ability to perform
      duties but:
          1.5.8.5.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training is
          required.
          1.5.8.5.2. A non-critical area(s)/subarea(s) grade of U was awarded.
          1.5.8.5.3. In the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification based on
          performance in one or more areas/subareas.
      1.5.8.6. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The member demonstrated an unacceptable level of
      safety, performance or knowledge. An overall Q-3 will be awarded for an evaluation
      when:
          1.5.8.6.1. An area grade of U is awarded in a critical area.
          1.5.8.6.2. In the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification based on
          performance in one or more areas/subareas.
1.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).
   1.6.1. EPE may be administered orally or in an ATD. This evaluation will include areas
   commensurate with examinee’s Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) training level or IAW AFI
   11-2MC12W V1 continuation training events.
   1.6.2. The following items will be included on all EPEs.
      1.6.2.1. Aircraft General Knowledge. Pilots, Sensor Operators (SO), and Cryptologic
      Operators (CO) will be evaluated on general aircraft and mission systems knowledge as
      required by their crew position.
      1.6.2.2. Emergency Procedures. All aircrew members will be evaluated on emergency
      procedures knowledge as required by their crew position. Pilots will be evaluated on all
      MAJCOM approved Critical Action Procedures (CAP) at a minimum.

        1.6.2.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM).             Crew coordination will be
        evaluated when applicable.
        1.6.2.4. Unusual attitude recoveries will be evaluated on all pilot EPEs.
     1.6.3. MSN evaluation scenarios will be tailored to unit tasking and will include areas not
     normally evaluated in flight. FEs should include the following additional items on the EPE
     given as a requisite to the MSN evaluation.
        1.6.3.1. Basic sensor systems operation.
     1.6.4. Unqualified EPE.
        1.6.4.1. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised
        status until completing recommended additional training and/or successfully
        accomplishing a reevaluation.
        1.6.4.2. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of unsatisfactory CAP
        accomplishment will not be permitted to fly in their crew position until a successful

   202V2 and this volume. Before the mission briefing, the flight examiner will brief the
   examinee on specific evaluation areas and, if applicable, will inform the pilot in command of
   any special requirements. Criteria in the chapter for the appropriate crew position will be
   used for evaluations. Units may modify evaluation profiles based on local operating
   considerations or FE judgment to complete the evaluation. Evaluations will be accomplished
   concurrently (with other crew positions) whenever practical. CRM skills will be evaluated
   on all evaluations.
   2.1.2. Evaluation Requirements.
       2.1.2.1. FEs must evaluate all required areas in order to complete the evaluation.
           2.1.2.1.1. Use of alternate evaluation methods (ATD / verbal) are authorized and will
           be documented in the AF Form 8, Comments Section.
           2.1.2.1.2. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by
           an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the
           evaluation.
       2.1.2.2. An asterisk (*) indicates critical areas. A grade of U awarded in any critical area
       requires an overall Q-3 for the evaluation.
       2.1.2.3. All observed areas will be graded.
   2.1.3. The Pilot Instrument/Qualification Evaluations (as defined in paragraph 2.2 and
   paragraph 2.3) and the Mission Evaluation (as defined in paragraph 2.4) may be combined
   as a single evaluation. Evaluations flown in this manner must fulfill all INSTM/QUAL and
   MSN evaluation requirements, including ground phase requisites. This combined evaluation
   will have a single expiration date IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.4. SOs and COs will be evaluated on a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation.

      6.1.1.1. Initial/Requalification. Required events include complete equipment preflight;
      a flight profile that includes a realistic scenario of a tactical mission in which the CO
      provides input; and post-flight procedures. Any mission in an actual threat environment
      will satisfy same requirements.
      6.1.1.2. Periodic QUAL/MSN. Requirements for periodic evaluations are the same as
      initial/requalification evaluations.
   6.1.2. Where major areas include sub areas, only one grade will be assigned to the major
   areas. Discrepancies will be annotated on the back of the AF Form 8 by sub area.
