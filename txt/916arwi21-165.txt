       A2.2.2.3. The 916 OSS/CC will monitor compliance with this agreement.
A2.3. Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination (AF Form 2407) Procedures (AFRCI21-165
Para 2.9.):
       A2.3.1. The agency initiating a change to the signed flying schedule is responsible for
       coordinating with the opposite agency in the “Decision” section of the 2407 and then
       generating the 2407. See also Section 2.3.2. below. Until coordination is complete a
       2407 should not be approved or distributed. The name/agency coordinated with will be
       annotated on the 2407.
       A2.3.2. The 2407 will list names of the OG/MXG personnel that have coordinated the
       change in the following blocks of the “Decision” section: OSO and Pro Super.
       A2.3.3. During normal duty hours, changes should be routed between the offices via a
       digitally signed e-mail. See 2.3.6.for after-hours coordination and approval.
       A2.3.4. Day to day scheduling changes such as take off/land times, fuel loads,
       configurations, call sign, etc., must be approved by the affected Squadron CC or
       designated representative; however, coordination with the offices is required prior to
       approval of a 2407.
       A2.3.5. Day to day maintenance change requests for tail interchanges (“Swaps”) can be
       approved by the affected Squadron CC or designated representative as long as the aircraft
       satisfies all requirements in the printed schedule (e.g., configuration/fuel). Any
       maintenance change requests other than tail interchanges should be coordinated thru the
       916 OSS/OSO in advance of approving a 2407.
       A2.3.6. After-hours coordination: The Aircraft Commander (AC) (with Duty IP and
       OG/CC coordination, if necessary) and the Pro Super will make all decisions on after-
       hours changes utilizing the MOC and CP to communicate the necessary changes. The
       Pro Super will annotate a 2407 with the identifier “After Hours” under the affected tail
       number and transmit it via e-mail distribution. This “after the fact” 2407 is required to
       ensure that record copies of the flying schedule are annotated with all changes on the next
       duty day.
       A2.3.7. Additions/deletions of sorties and major changes, after the schedule has been
       signed, must be approved and coordinated at the Squadron CC level or designated
       representative. Note: Changes that significantly impact scheduled maintenance,
       PE/Wash/Major TCTO’s/Off-Station missions, etc, or exceed the AATS commitment
       rate (see attachment 3), should be considered major changes and prior coordination with
       PS&D should be accomplished prior to initiation of the change whenever possible.
       A2.3.8. Outside agencies requesting changes to the printed flying schedule should be
       referred to OSO or PS&D for assistance in initiating a change to the schedule.
A2.4. The OG and the MXG will: Mutually accept responsibility to comply with the
provisions set forth in this agreement. The group commanders or designated representatives
must approve all deviations. Both groups further agree to review the provisions of the agreement
semi-annually or when group commanders change out, in order to allow for continuous
improvements to the quality of support established hereby. No section of this agreement shall be
constructed to limit aircraft generation to meet the needs of operational necessity.
