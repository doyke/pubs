Supersedes:    AFI32-7061, 12 March 2003


This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, Environmental Quality. It
directs the user to the regulatory source that describes the specific tasks and procedures for
successfully conducting the Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). To
ensure a full understanding of the EIAP and terms used, users of this instruction shall familiarize
themselves with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Executive Order
12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions, and their implementing
regulations.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been completely revised. It adopts the current Title 32, Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 989 (32 CFR Part 989), Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), as the
controlling document on the Air Force EIAP. It eliminates the duplicate and/or superceded
language previously included under AFI 32-7061 dated 24 January 1995.

 Regulatory Source. The Department of the Air Force has published its EIAP regulation as a
formal rulemaking at 32 CFR Part 989. That regulation, as may be amended from time to time, is
hereby incorporated by reference as the Air Force Instruction on the EIAP. 32 CFR 989 is
available digitally at Code of Federal Regulations website under: http://www.access.gpo.gov/.

Compliance. To comply with this AFI, users must review and follow the version of 32 CFR
Part 989 that is current at the time the EIAP is begun for the proposed action.
