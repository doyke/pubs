                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Published Operating Hours. The Airfield Operations Flight (436 OSS/OSA) executes the
Airfield Management (AM)/ATC missions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
   1.1.1. AM includes Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops).
   1.1.2. ATC consists of:
      1.1.2.1. Air Traffic Control Tower ATCT (ATCT). ATCT is the USAF military tower
      located on Dover Air Force Base (AFB). All references to tower’s “Class D” in this
      instruction refer to the Dover AFB ATCT airspace, consisting of a 4.6 nautical mile
      (NM) radius centered on the airfield. Vertical airspace limits are surface to 2,500’ Mean
      Sea Level (MSL). The ATCT is operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
      1.1.2.2. Dover Radar Approach Control (RAPCON). Dover Approach Control is the
      USAF military RAPCON, located on Dover AFB, which provides approach control
      service to the base, Georgetown Airport, Delaware Airpark, and 9 additional civilian
      airfields. It is part of the National Airspace System (NAS) and is considered “Class E”
      airspace. All references to RAPCON in this instruction refer to the Dover AFB
      RAPCON. RAPCON’s airspace (Attachment 9) is approximately 3,700 cubic miles,
      centered on the airfield; vertical limits are from the surface to 7,000’ MSL. RAPCON is
      operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
1.2. Description and Use of the Aerodrome.
   1.2.1. Dover AFB Airfield Diagram (Attachment 3). Dover AFB is a Joint-Use Airport
   with the Civil Air Terminal.
   1.2.2. Runways. Dover AFB has two runways:
      1.2.2.1. Runway (RWY) 01/19: 9,602’ long and 200' wide.
          1.2.2.1.1. RWY 01 is the primary instrument runway. RWY 01 is also the calm wind
          runway and will be in use when the wind speed is less than five knots.
          1.2.2.1.2. The runway is asphalt, except for the following portions which are
          concrete: the first 1,000' of RWY 01 approach end and the first 1,000' of RWY 19
          approach end.
      1.2.2.2. RWY 14/32: 12,903' long and 150' wide.
          1.2.2.2.1. RWY 14 has a displaced threshold of 4,300'. The runway is asphalt,
          except for the following portions which are concrete: the first 1,000' of the displaced
          threshold (from the RWY 14 approach end), the first 1,000' from the RWY 14
          threshold, and the first 2,000' of RWY 32 approach end. The runway is grooved
          except midfield intersection.
          1.2.2.2.2. For RWY 32 takeoffs, runway available is 10,070'. For RWY 32,
          intersection "E", takeoffs, runway available is 8,420'. Do not include the displaced
          threshold in takeoff calculations; the obstacle intrusion surface begins where RWY 32
          meets the displaced threshold. The full length of 12,903' is available for full stop

           landing roll-out or rejected take-off. Distance remaining markers indicate distance
           remaining for full runway length (12,903'). A 93' MSL (73' above ground level, or
           AGL) hangar is located 3,750' from end of runway available (10,070' point), 535' left
           of centerline. The hangar is illuminated by ramp lights as well as red obstruction
           lights.
    1.2.3. Taxiways. Dover AFB has eight named taxiways/taxilanes. Taxiways are 75’ wide
    with 25’ shoulders, with the exception of Taxiway (TWY) D from RWY 01/19 to hazardous
    cargo which is 150’ wide with no shoulders. NOTE: TWY F begins at the RWY 01 hold
    lines and is entirely within the CMA.
       1.2.3.1. TWY E has no paved shoulders.
       1.2.3.2. Use of taxiways for takeoffs and landings (i.e., real-world emergency or
       contingency operations during runway closures, etc.) will be coordinated through 436
       OSS/OSA and approved by 436 OG/CC.
       1.2.3.3. Standard wingtip clearance is not present (only on the interior taxilane to main
       ramp from spot E to P). Vehicles must pull over to the far edge from the taxilane to
       ensure proper wingtip clearance from taxiing aircraft.
       1.2.3.4. TWY H is an unlit, uncontrolled, 75’ wide taxiway with no paved shoulders. It
       is suitable for daytime operations and requires a “Follow Me” truck for use at night. The
       pavement is concrete with asphalt patches in good condition for C-130 use only. TWY H
       is not to be used for aircraft operations unless approved by 436 OG/CC.
    1.2.4. Aircraft Parking Plan/Ramps.
       1.2.4.1. There are several aircraft parking areas, as shown in Attachment 3:
           1.2.4.1.1. The Main Ramp consists of 25 aircraft parking spots (E-CC), marked for
           C-17 and C-5 aircraft.
           1.2.4.1.2. The Transient Ramp consists of eight aircraft parking spots. Delta row is
           marked for 747, Bravo 2-3 and Charlie 2-3 are marked for KC-10 and smaller. Bravo
           1 and Charlie 1 are for small aircraft.
           1.2.4.1.3. The Hazardous Cargo Area consists of three aircraft parking spots, and is
           used to park aircraft with hazardous cargo IAW DAFBI 11-205.
           1.2.4.1.4. The South Ramp consists of five aircraft parking spots, marked for C-130
           aircraft. This area is used for transient aircraft.
           1.2.4.1.5. The Christmas Tree consists of seven aircraft parking areas, marked for C-
           130 aircraft, and is utilized by Flight Training Center (FTC) aircraft and transient
           aircraft.
           1.2.4.1.6. The Civil Aircraft Ramp is located adjacent to the Civil Air Terminal.
           This area is utilized by transient civil aircraft under the Joint-Use Agreement with
           Dover AFB. This area is not AF property.
       1.2.4.2. Ramp Road is located on the west side of the Main/Transient Ramps running
       parallel. This drivelane services vehicles transiting the flightline.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                     9


       1.2.4.3. Wingtip clearance reference markers are in place on the airfield to provide pilots
       visual references for training. These markers are placed on TWY G and on the main
       ramp adjacent to spot E. Layouts are depicted on Attachment 13.
           1.2.4.3.1. “Lollypop” signs are placed adjacent to TWY G.
           1.2.4.3.2. Lines are painted on the main ramp for both C-17s and C-5s. Markings are
           placed for main landing gear, wingtip, 10-foot clearance line, and 25-foot clearance
           line. Wingtip lines, 10-foot, and 25-foot markings are all 200 feet in length.
              1.2.4.3.2.1. C-5 markings are painted on the taxilane east of spot E.
              1.2.4.3.2.2. C-17 markings are painted on the taxilane south of spot E.
       1.2.4.4. Non-standard combat offload markings are painted on, and signs are placed
       adjacent to, TWY C for use with combat offload procedures, outlined in para 3.5. Layout
       is depicted in Attachment 6.
   1.2.5. There are several permanently closed/unusable portions of old taxiway pavements on
   the eastern portion of the airfield. These are outlined in Attachment 3.
   1.2.6. As listed in the DoD En Route Supplement, all Prior Permission Required (PPR)
   requests shall be directed through Airfield Management Operations, 436 OSS/OSAA.
   1.2.7. All requests for waivers to airspace/airfield criteria shall be forwarded through 436
   OSS/OSA. Airfield waivers will then be forwarded to 436 CES/CECP for processing.
   Airspace waivers will be handled through MAJCOM, base authorities or local air traffic
   authorities, as required.
1.3. Aircraft Priorities. In addition to the ATC priorities established in Federal Aviation
Administration Order (FAAO) 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, the following local priorities will be
used as a guideline for arrivals and departures at Dover AFB:
   1.3.1. Emergencies (Space Shuttle Recovery constitutes an emergency landing).
   1.3.2. Civilian or military LIFEGUARD or military air evacuation flights (AIR EVAC/MED
   EVAC receive priority when requested).
   1.3.3. Civilian or military search and rescue aircraft.
   1.3.4. Presidential or Treaty Verification aircraft (when notified).
   1.3.5. Flight Check, Semi-Automatic Flight Inspection and Local Functional Flight Check
   aircraft.
   1.3.6. Dignified Transfer (DT) arrivals/departures.
   1.3.7. Distinguished Visitor (DV) arrivals/departures. Code 6 or above arrival or departure.
   1.3.8. REACH Mission departures/arrivals (including contract aircraft).. Mission departures
   nearing controlled departure time (CDT) will have priority over mission arrivals to avoid
   mission departure delays.
   1.3.9. Other aircraft conducting full stop landings (civilian or military).
   1.3.10. Tactical Employment Training operations.
   1.3.11. Non-REACH mission departures (Civilian or Military).
 10                                                      DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


   1.3.12. Additional notes:
      1.3.12.1. Local NVG training will have priority over non-NVG training missions.
      1.3.12.2. Local C-5/C-17 training missions have priority over transient aircraft practice
      approaches.
      1.3.12.3. Aircraft operating to the runway in use will have priority over opposite
      direction aircraft.
1.4. DVs. AM Ops will advise ATCT and Command Post (CP) of any aircraft (arrival or
departure) carrying DVs.
   1.4.1. When requested, RAPCON will advise CP when arriving aircraft carrying
   distinguished visitors are 30 flying miles from the base.
   1.4.2. ATCT will advise AM Ops when an arriving aircraft carrying DVs is 10 flying miles
   from the base.
   1.4.3. Relay of information regarding aircraft carrying DVs by air traffic controllers is
   secondary to providing ATC services. Controllers will relay this information provided it
   does not interfere with primary ATC responsibilities.
1.5. Noise Abatement Procedures.
   1.5.1. RWY 14 should not normally be used for landing purposes, except by Category I & II
   aircraft and helicopters. RWY 14 may be used by all aircraft during closures of RWY 01/19
   or when crosswinds, high winds, emergency, or runway conditions prevent aircraft from
   landing on other runways.
   1.5.2. RWY 32 Procedures: After takeoff, turn to heading 360 at 400' AGL. Delay flap
   retraction until 2000' AGL or visual flight rules (VFR) pattern altitude for noise abatement.
   For missed approach or touch-and-go, turn right heading 360 prior to .8 DME from Dover
   TACAN.
   1.5.3. Aircraft should avoid residential areas in the Dover local area/base housing by 1000’
   AGL.
   1.5.4. ATC will not normally vector a jet aircraft or turboprop aircraft with more than two
   engines over the cities of Dover, Little Creek, Milford, Harrington, Pickering Beach, Kitts
   Hummock, Bowers Beach, or other sensitive noise abatement areas below 3,000’ AGL,
   unless safety of flight is a factor. ATC instructions take precedence over noise abatement
   procedures.
      1.5.4.1. All aircraft avoid over flight of the following historically significant buildings:
      Dickinson Mansion located at N3906.085 W07526.912, approximately DOV 160/2.
      Round Barn located at N3909.067 W07527.413, approximately DOV 020/1. The Manor
      at Cool Springs located at N3843.2 W07514.8, approximately 5 NM southeast of Milton,
      DE.
      1.5.4.2. The areas of Kitts Hummock, Pickering Beach, Bowers Beach, Little Creek, and
      Magnolia have historically generated the most Dover AFB noise complaints. C-5B crews
      should avoid over flight of the those areas. C-17/C-5M crews may overfly these areas
      when executing VFR patterns. However, C-17/C-5M crews should plan low altitude
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                    11


        tactical approaches and departures (below 1,000 feet) to avoid these areas to the
        maximum extent practical.
1.6. Quiet Hours Procedures. When directed by 436 AW/CC, ATC will take steps to limit
noise within the confines of the base proper.
   1.6.1. Four quiet hour plans are published to provide a spectrum of quiet hour options. 436
   AW/CC will tailor noise limitations based on the specific function, attempting to minimize
   the impact on operations.

NOTES:
1. When the airfield is Official Business Only, a PPR number is required for all arriving aircraft
during the proposed quiet hour period. EXCEPTION: SAM missions carrying DV code 6 and
higher do not require a PPR.
2. Emergency landings only.
3. Aircraft that must land during this quiet hour option will taxi as required to clear the runway.
Fuel permitting, the aircraft will hold position, engines running, until the quiet hour period is
over.
4. Aircraft that must land during this quiet hour option will taxi as required to clear the runway.
The aircraft will shut down engines when clear of the runway.


   1.6.2. Quiet Hour Responsibilities:
        1.6.2.1. Agency requesting quiet hours shall: Secure 436 AW/CC approval. The
        requesting agency should research impact on local flying training, mission
        departures/arrivals, and transient arrivals/ departures prior to submitting a quiet hour
        request. Requests should be coordinated through the 436 MSG/CC, 436 MXG/CC and
 12                                                      DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


       436 OG/CC. Once approved by 436 AW/CC, the requesting agency shall forward
       applicable paperwork to CP. See Attachment 12 for a sample Quiet Hour Request Letter.
       1.6.2.2. CP shall: When notified of quiet hour approval by the Wing Commander, send
       out a Copy Format 2 message to inform base organizations impacted by the quiet hours at
       least one duty day prior to the event. CP will call AM Ops directly and relay quiet hour
       operations. AM Ops shall publish the appropriate quiet hour NOTAMs, notify HQ
       AMC/A3AP and update the TACC Airfield Closure Website with the pertinent
       information.
       1.6.2.3. Local training flights will terminate at 2200L (extended until 2300L during
       BASH Phase II) unless approved by 436 OG/CC or 512 OG/CC. Note: Aircraft on the
       local flying schedule are considered approved by the OG/CC. AAR and off-station
       training missions are exempt from quiet hours. Unless prior coordination is accomplished
       with CP, ATC will only approve one approach to a full stop for the following: aircraft
       not on the local flying schedule, aircraft returning from Air to Air Rufueling (AAR), or
       off-station training missions.
1.7. Practice Approaches by Civil Aircraft. Civil aircraft are permitted to use Dover AFB’s
Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) to conduct practice approaches. 436
OG/CC delegates approval authority to Dover ATCT and RAPCON for civilian practice
approaches and must ensure the base mission is not adversely affected. Civil aircraft without
proper authorization for Kent County Aeropark are restricted to low approaches. The 436
OG/CC may rescind this policy at any time.
1.8. Flight Plan Data.
   1.8.1. Instrument Flight Plan data will be available to controllers by way of Airfield
   Automation System (AFAS). In the event that the AFAS is out of service, ATCT will
   receive information on proposed departures and scheduled arrivals via the FDIO printer.
   Note: Airfield Management Operations shall forward Visual Flight Plan data at all times.
       1.8.1.1. Type of flight plan.
       1.8.1.2. Call sign.
       1.8.1.3. Type aircraft.
       1.8.1.4. Proposed departure and/or estimated arrival time.
       1.8.1.5. Destination airport (departures only).
       1.8.1.6. Estimated time en route (round robin and instrument flight rules (IFR) local
       flight plans only).
       1.8.1.7. Special information or instructions relating to hazardous cargo, VIP, medical
       evacuation flights.
       1.8.1.8. Prior Permission Requests (PPRs) procedures will be handled in accordance with
       (IAW) the DOD En route Supplement.
   1.8.2. Flight plans. All aircraft departing Dover AFB must have a flight plan on file with
   AM Ops prior to takeoff. Exception: Civil aircraft (Air Carrier, General Aviation, etc.)
   operating from the Civil Aircraft Ramp are exempt from this requirement.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                13


       1.8.2.1. Local squadrons may send flight plan via fax to AM Ops. Squadron must call
       AM Ops to verify fax was received and for clarity. If fax machine and/or telephones are
       down then flight plans will be hand delivered to AM Ops.
       1.8.2.2. Squadrons will store original flight plans IAW Records Disposition Schedule,
       Table 13-7, Rule 3 available on-line at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.
   1.8.3. Canned flight plans have been developed to simplify the flight planning process. The
   flight plans will use call-signs to identify frequently flown local training profiles. The
   436/512th Combined Aircrew Flimsy is the original source for filing these plans. Actual
   aircrew and AM Ops procedures are detailed in the Airfield Management Operating
   Instructions. No derivative source (enlarged copy, cheat sheet, etc) may be used to load the
   flight plans in to the system, however, unless it has been checked against the latest Aircrew
   Flimsy.
1.9. Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs).
   1.9.1. AM Ops is the central NOTAM issuing agency for Dover AFB. The RAPCON is the
   NOTAM monitoring facility.
   1.9.2. RAPCON shall immediately report all interruptions and malfunctions, with an
   estimated duration of outage of ATCALS and a general description of NOTAM text to AM
   Ops.
   1.9.3. AM Ops will notify RAPCON and ATCT of all NOTAMs dispatched.
1.10. Airfield Operations Board (AOB).
   1.10.1. The 436 OG/CC is the designated representative to chair the base AOB IAW AFI 13-
   204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures And Programs. The AOB will meet quarterly. Board

   may drive or taxi behind aircraft conducting engine runs.
   2.5.5. The ATCT shall immediately notify CP of lost communications with heavy aircraft
   conducting engine runs.
   2.5.6. NOTE: Due to excessive noise in the ATCT, engine runs will not be conducted on B,
   C or D row parking spots without prior approval from the ATCT.
2.6. Aircraft Towing Procedures. Aircraft tows will comply with DOVERAFBI 13-213,
Dover Flightline Driver’s Familiarization Program and the following procedures:
   2.6.1. The ground controller will require any vehicle towing an aircraft across a runway to
   inform the ATCT when the crossing is complete. The crossing is considered complete when:
      2.6.1.1. The tow vehicle and entire aircraft in tow are past the hold line on the side of the
      runway to which they have crossed.
 22                                                     DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


      2.6.1.2. From TWY D, the ground controller will advise the tow vehicle to proceed
      across both runways. At no time will the tow vehicle be permitted to hold short of a
      runway while on TWY D in-between the runways. On TWY D, crossing is considered
      complete when the tow vehicle and the entire aircraft in tow are across the hold line.
      2.6.1.3. Going to Hazardous Cargo from Main Ramp – crossing past the hold line across
      RWY 01/19 on TWY D.

                                           Chapter 3

                CONTROL OF GROUND TRAFFIC ON THE AIRPORT

3.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA consists of the following: all runways,
including 200’ from all runway edges, all overruns including 200’ from overrun edges
(Exception: inner marker at RWY 01 approach end and perimeter road at RWY 32 approach end
is not part of the CMA), infield areas between TWY B and RWY 01/19, and the following
taxiways: TWY B, TWY D, TWY F, and TWY C (except between TWY B CMA boundary line
to RWY 14 hold lines). See Attachment 4.
   3.1.1. All aircraft, vehicles and personnel must establish and maintain two-way radio
   communications with the ATCT and obtain ATCT approval prior to entry into the CMA.
   Operators must contact ATCT via the Tower Net or Crash Net when operating in the CMA.
   Only vehicles in direct support of mission essential activities are authorized to operate within
   the CMA. See Chapter 10 and Attachment 3 for additional information.
   3.1.2. Aprons, parking areas and the following taxiways are Uncontrolled Movement Areas
   (UMA): TWY A, TWY C from TWY B CMA boundary line to RWY 14/32 hold lines, and
   TWY E between the hold lines of RWY 01 and RWY 32. The Christmas Tree ramp begins
   south of TWY F hold lines. Radio contact with the ATCT and approval are not required in
   these areas.
   3.1.3. Personnel and Vehicle Recall Procedures. When personnel and vehicles are recalled
   from the CMA, they will withdraw to a safe distance (at least 200 feet from the runway
   edge). If radio contact is lost, the ATCT will use light gun signals or turn the runway lights
   on and off to have the vehicle exit the runway. The ATCT will notify Airfield Management
   Operations to meet the personnel or vehicles with lost communications to resolve the
   situation.
   3.1.4. There are no runway hold lines/signs on TWY D between the runways. At no time
   will any aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians be permitted to hold short of either runway while on
   TWY D between the runways.
      3.1.4.1. When utilizing TWY D between the runways for taxiing aircraft, vehicle
      movements, and towing operations traveling to main/transient ramp or hazardous cargo
      area, ATCT shall deem both runways occupied until all aircraft/vehicles are beyond
      applicable runway hold lines located on TWY D on either main/transient ramp or
      hazardous cargo area.
      3.1.4.2. When aircraft, vehicles, and towing operations request to cross both runways,
      the ground controller will advise to proceed across both runways. At no time will the
      aircraft, vehicle, or towing operation proceed across one runway on TWY D and hold
      short of the other runway.
      3.1.4.3. When vehicles are given permission to proceed and operate on RWY 01/19 or
      14/32, they shall not proceed past the runway sidestripe closest toTWY D between the
      runways without specific permission from ATCT. This procedure protects TWY D
      between the runways in lieu of a hold line.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                    25


      3.1.4.4. Only restricted low approaches will be permitted to either runway until towing
      operations, vehicles and aircraft are beyond applicable hold lines on runways. All
      applicable advisories will be issued by ATC.
   3.1.5. Based on the wingspan of locally-assigned aircraft and the width of our runways,
   sufficient wingtip clearance does not exist for vehicles, equipment or personnel to operate up
   to the edge of a runway during aircraft operations. For runway operations involving a C-130
   or larger, all vehicles, equipment, and personnel must be established at least 200 feet from
   the edge of an active runway prior to an aircraft crossing the threshold or beginning departure
   roll.
   3.1.6. Specific procedures for operating vehicles on the airfield are contained in DAFBI 13-213.
3.2. Movement of Aircraft (Aircraft Taxiing Requirements).
   3.2.1. AM Ops shall advise ATCT of arriving and departing aircraft as soon as possible
   before the aircraft’s estimated time of arrival and proposed departure time.
   3.2.2. ATCT will:
      3.2.2.1. Relay landing and takeoff times to AM Ops on all arriving and departing
      aircraft.
      3.2.2.2. Coordinate with AM Ops on all arrivals that contact ATCT without flight plans
      prior to landing.
      3.2.2.3. If a transient aircraft’s parking area is unknown or the marshaller/follow-me
      vehicles have not arrived, hold the aircraft at the entrance to the parking ramp until a
      marshaller/follow-me vehicle arrives.
      3.2.2.4. Ensure all transient aircraft use the services of a follow-me vehicle before
      taxiing on unlit taxiways between sunset and sunrise.
   3.2.3. LOCAL EXEMPTIONS.             The following local exemptions to standard wingtip
   clearance criteria apply:
      3.2.3.1. When taxiing on the Main Ramp on the yellow line, the wingtip is within 25 feet
      of the ramp road. Vehicles are required to pull over to the west side of the road and stop
      until the aircraft has passed in accordance with DAFBI 13-213.
      3.2.3.2. Wingtip clearance between C-5s parked on designated spots on the Main Ramp
      is 20 feet. A wingtip marshaller is required anytime an airplane is parked on an adjacent
      spot, to make sure there is adequate clearance, per AFI 11-2C-5V3 DOVERAFBSUP, C-
      5 Operations Procedures.
      3.2.3.3. Aircraft on the Main Ramp taxi line may taxi without a wing walker past
      vehicles parked inside the white boxes in front of parking spots E through CC.
      3.2.3.4. When following the taxi line behind the C-5s parked on the main ramp (spots E
      through CC), adequate wingtip clearance is provided to any vehicle parked between the
      white line and the tails of the airplanes. A wing walker is required for a C-5 when a
      vehicle is parked on the taxiway side of the white line.
   3.2.4. RESTRICTIONS:        The following local restrictions to aircraft ground movement
   apply:
 26                                                      DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


       3.2.4.1. Aircraft will not taxi in or out of a Dover parking spot unless the appropriate
       number of marshallers/wing walkers are present.
       3.2.4.2. Aircraft will not taxi through Dover parking spots without prior coordination
       with the Dover CP and Dover Ground Control, making sure the spot is cleared of all
       obstacles.
       3.2.4.3. The transient ramp is not marked for C-5 parking.
       3.2.4.4. If a B-747 is parked on Delta row and is being nose loaded with K-loaders, fork
       lifts, etc. no taxing between spots D and E is allowed since the required 25-foot clearance
       is not guaranteed.
       3.2.4.5. During taxiing, avoid all perpendicular yellow lines and hash marks on the
       taxiway shoulders indicating unstressed pavement. Note: Use only necessary taxi power
       for all taxi operations.
       3.2.4.6. Civil Air Patrol (CAP) aircraft only may use the decontamination parking pad.
       3.2.4.7. Aircraft are prohibited from movement on closed, unsuitable or non-operational
       (runways, taxiways and aprons) areas.
       3.2.4.8. Aircraft will not normally utilize RWY 14/32 for taxi operations to protect
       pavement on the interior portion of the runway. Back taxi procedures will be authorized
       for operational necessity only.
   3.2.5. Engines Running Crew Change (ERCC) Procedures. The primary ERCC area is on
   TWY Alpha abeam Bravo row facing east. The alternate is on TWY Charlie, south of RWY
   14 facing TWY Alpha. Crews will coordinate with ATCT if they wish to hold for an
   extended period at an ERCC location.
3.3. Movement of Vehicles. Vehicle operators shall repeat all ATCT instructions verbatim.
ATCT shall add the words “WITHOUT DELAY” to their instructions when appropriate. Do not
use the words “clear,” “cleared” or “clearance” together with instructions to control vehicular
traffic. Additional airfield driving procedures are outlined in DAFBI 13-213.
3.4. Parking Aircraft with Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo. Aircraft with explosive/hazardous
cargo to be uploaded/downloaded will park IAW DAFBI 11-205, Support of Aircraft
Transporting Hazardous Cargo. Hot Armament/Hung Ordnance procedures are addressed in
para 9.9 of this instruction.
3.5. Combat Offload Operations. TWY C is the primary combat offload area. Combat
Offloads on TWY C will be accomplished with aircraft facing west as depicted in Attachment 6.
Non-standard signs and painted lines are placed on/around TWY C to provide visual reference to
pilots, as outlined in para 1.2.4.4, and Attachment 6. ATC shall not allow non-participating
aircraft to use TWY C, TWY B north, and RWY 01/19 for departures/landings during the actual
combat offload. Aircraft will request approval from Ground Control prior to commencing the
procedure and advise once offload is complete.
   3.5.1. ATCT shall suspend TWY C operations following a combat off-load until a FOD
   sweep is performed by AM Ops.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                 27


3.6. Dignified Transfer (DT) Procedures. Dover AFB supports the Air Force Mortuary
Affairs Operations (AFMAO) mission. All DTs will be conducted IAW AFMAO Instruction
34-242-02 and the following procedures:
   3.6.1. CP shall make the following notifications to AM Ops:
      3.6.1.1. Approximately 30 minutes prior to projected start of DT. Notification shall
      contain all pertinent info (including, but not limited to, parking spot and number of DTs).
      3.6.1.2. Start of the DT.
      3.6.1.3. All DT pauses.
      3.6.1.4. Completion of the DT.
      3.6.1.5. AM Ops will relay all DT notifications to ATCT.
   3.6.2. Normal flightline activities (including but not limited to aircraft start, movement,
   maintenance, transiting vehicles, and cargo upload/download) are not permitted during DTs
   on TWY B south and certain areas of the ramp, depending on the location of the DT aircraft.
   These “flightline sterile areas” are depicted in diagrams on file at 436 AW/CP. Every effort
   should be made to minimize all noise and movement on the remainder of the ramp during
   DTs whenever possible. If aircraft movements, servicing, and/or loading/unloading will be
   required during a DT, the aircraft should be positioned as far away from the DT/outside the
   sterile area as possible to minimize DT impact. It is imperative that all airfield drivers
   maintain situational awareness while operating in the ramp environment and do not disrupt
   DT procedures.
   3.6.3. All aircraft engine starts/runs and aircraft movements during a DT will be coordinated
   with CP prior to execution (this includes aircraft engine starts immediately preceding a DT
   start if the engines will be running during the DT). The CP will coordinate all requests with
   AFMAO and/or the Dignified Transfer Host (DTH) to ensure minimal mission and DT
   impact.
   3.6.4. CP, ATCT, AM Ops and AFMAO shall coordinate pauses between multiple DTs, as
   needed, to allow for mission departures/arrivals.
   3.6.5. The non-movement area depicted in Attachment 14 defines the area where aircraft
   are not allowed to taxi during DTs, regardless of DT aircraft location. Taxiing at other
   locations on the airfield will be coordinated with the CP. 3.6.6. During a DT, the CP will
   coordinate with aircrew, AFMAO, MOC and ATOC to help ensure normal operations
   continue to the maximum extent possible with minimal impact upon the DT. Takeoffs,
   landings, and approaches are permitted but should be conducted during DT pauses whenever
   possible.
   3.6.6. 436 AW/CP may choose to work in concert with the aircrew, MOC and ATCT to
   allow aircraft parked inside the aircraft non-movement area (Attachment 14) to be towed to
   another parking spot or to a location where they can start and taxi out for departure. Tow
   operations will not be conducted inside the Sterile Area once the DT starts (except during DT
   pauses).

                                           Chapter 4

                             TERMINAL AREA PROCEDURES

4.1. Traffic Patterns. Local traffic patterns and altitudes are depicted in Attachment 8 and
Attachment 9. Left-hand traffic will be used for RWYs 14 and 19. Right-hand traffic will be
used for RWYs 01 and 32. Flight Training Center (FTC) aircraft traffic will normally be left-
hand for RWYs 01 and 32 and right-hand for RWYs 14 and 19. ATC may direct other traffic
patterns as necessary due to traffic or airspace restrictions. There are no VFR training areas for
military assigned aircraft. See Chapter 8 for a description of Flight Training Center areas.
   4.1.1. 360 degree overhead pattern – 2500’ MSL.
       4.1.1.1. Protection of the 360 overhead pattern. When the overhead pattern is in use,
       ATCT shall direct departing aircraft to maintain at or below 2000’ MSL until departure
       end to ensure overhead pattern protection.
   4.1.2. Radar traffic pattern - 3000’ MSL (ATC may use 2000’ MSL as necessary).
   4.1.3. Conventional rectangular pattern – 1500’ MSL.
   4.1.4. Small aircraft weighing 12,500 lbs or less, with single or twin-propeller driven
   engine(s) (including all Dover FTC aircraft) and helicopter traffic pattern - 1000’ MSL.
4.2. Local Departure Procedures/Breakout/Go-Around Instructions.
   4.2.1. Local Departure Procedures. When issuing climbout instructions to Dover-based
   aircraft conducting local training sorties, controllers may use the term “Standard Climbout”
   in lieu of the instructions below. Exception: “Standard Climbout” is not to be used when
   overhead pattern is in use. See para 4.1.1.1.
       4.2.1.1. RWY 01/19: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 3000’, FLY RUNWAY HEADING.”
       4.2.1.2. RWY 32: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 3000’, AT DEPARTURE END (.8 DME)
       TURN RIGHT HEADING 360.”
       4.2.1.3. RWY 14: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 3000’, FLY RUNWAY HEADING.”
   4.2.2. Breakout procedures. Unless specified otherwise, breakout procedures shall be used
   for aircraft at or greater than three (3) mile final. The following instructions shall be used
   unless otherwise coordinated.
       4.2.2.1. RWY 01: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2000’, LEAVING 1700’ TURN LEFT
       HEADING 280.”
       4.2.2.2. RWY 19: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2000’, LEAVING 1700’ TURN RIGHT
       HEADING 280.”
       4.2.2.3. RWY 32: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2000’, LEAVING 1700’ TURN RIGHT
       HEADING 040.”
   4.2.3. Go-around procedures. Unless specified otherwise, go-around procedures shall be
   used for aircraft inside three (3) mile final.
       4.2.3.1. RWY 01/19: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 3000’, FLY RUNWAY HEADING.”
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                    29


       4.2.3.2. RWY 32: “CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 3000’, FLY RUNWAY HEADING
       UNTIL DEPARTURE END (.8 DME off DOV TACAN), THEN TURN RIGHT
       HEADING 360.”
       4.2.3.3. RWY 14: ATCT will coordinate on an as-needed basis. NOTE: Pilots must
       inform the controlling facility immediately if unable to comply with ATC instructions.
4.3. Standard Circling Instructions.
   4.3.1. RAPCON shall ensure standard IFR separation for aircraft executing circling
   approaches IAW FAAO 7110.65.
   4.3.2. An arriving aircraft executing a TACAN/RNAV RWY 32 circling to RWY 19
   approach shall proceed no closer than four (4) mile final until a simultaneous RWY 19 IFR
   departure has crossed the departure end of the runway or a simultaneous RWY 19 IFR arrival
   (full stop landing) has crossed the landing threshold, unless visual separation is applied.
4.4. VFR Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for VFR practice approaches are:
   4.4.1. 2000 foot ceiling (AGL) and 3 miles visibility for conventional rectangular pattern.
   4.4.2. 3000 foot ceiling (AGL) and 3 miles visibility for 360 degree overhead pattern.
   4.4.3. Basic VFR weather conditions are required for Tactical Employment Training
   Procedures described in Chapter 6 and Attachment 10. For Random Steep approaches and
   Spiral-Up departures, aircraft must be able to maintain VFR, to or from the prescribed
   altitudes.
   4.4.4. ATCT must be able to maintain visual contact with aircraft in the VFR pattern. ATCT
   Watch Supervisors will close the rectangular and overhead VFR pattern when controllers
   cannot maintain visual contact with aircraft, regardless of reported weather. If the aircraft
   commander can cancel IFR and proceed straight-in, full-stop, with the pattern closed, ATCT
   will approve the VFR approach for landing.
4.5. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures. Pilots of aircraft under radar control may request
vectors to initial. Vectors will be provided to intercept initial at 3-5 nm from the approach end of
the landing runway. IFR service is automatically cancelled once the aircraft reaches initial.
4.6. Intersection Departures. Intersection departures are authorized with ATCT approval.
Distances remaining from each intersection are shown in Attachment 3.
4.7. Opposite Direction Procedures. Specific opposite direction cutoff procedures between
ATCT and RAPCON are contained below:
   4.7.1. All communications between controllers shall include the phrase: “OPPOSITE
   DIRECTION ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE, RUNWAY (Number).” Tower and RAPCON shall
   coordinate with the opposite facility prior to approving opposite direction traffic.
   4.7.2. Opposite Direction Departure Coordination: Tower shall coordinate opposite direction
   departures at the time of pilot request or prior to taxiing the aircraft to allow RAPCON time
   to adjust the arrival sequence.
   4.7.3. IFR Arrival vs. IFR Arrival: An opposite direction IFR arrival shall proceed no closer
   than ten (10) mile final from landing threshold before the preceding IFR aircraft lands.
 30                                                      DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


   4.7.4. IFR Arrival vs. IFR Departure: An opposite direction IFR arrival shall proceed no
   closer than ten (10) mile final from landing threshold before an opposite direction IFR
   departure becomes airborne and has turned to avoid to ensure required separation.
   4.7.5. VFR Arrivals: An opposite direction VFR arriving aircraft shall proceed no closer
   than six (6) mile final from the landing threshold before an opposite direction IFR/VFR
   arrival has landed or IFR/VFR departure becomes airborne and has turned to avoid to ensure
   required separation.
   4.7.6. VFR Departures: A VFR departing aircraft must be airborne and turned to avoid prior
   to an arriving IFR/VFR aircraft proceeding to six (6) mile final from the landing threshold to
   ensure required separation.
   4.7.7. Tactical Approaches: VFR separation standards outlined in paragraph 4.7.5. and
   4.7.6. will be maintained at all times when authorizing opposite direction tactical approaches.
4.8. Separation Standards. The separation standards listed in FAAO 7110.65 apply except as
follows:
   4.8.1. An aircraft making an altitude restricted low approach over personnel or equipment in
   the airport movement area shall be instructed to maintain at or above 530’ MSL. Controllers
   will instruct heavy jet aircraft to maintain at or above 1000’ MSL. ATCT shall inform the
   personnel in the movement area that the approach will be conducted over them.
   4.8.2. Visual Separation: ATCT may apply visual separation IAW FAAO 7110.65. ATCT
   shall advise RAPCON when visual separation is being used. Controllers will not initiate
   visual separation when wake turbulence separation requirements apply.
   4.8.3. Category separation for departures will be IAW FAAO 7110.65.
4.9. Civil Aircraft.
   4.9.1. In order to ensure safe operations of civil aircraft, and to provide safeguards to local
   aircraft, practice approaches are not authorized when:
       4.9.1.1. More than one military turbojet aircraft is in the IFR or VFR traffic pattern
       unless ATC determines such operations will not impede the departure or arrival of
       military aircraft.
       4.9.1.2. The practice approach may cause the delay of mission aircraft (arrival or
       departure).
       4.9.1.3. At any time ATC Watch Supervisor deems it necessary for flight safety.
   4.9.2. Civil aircraft are permitted to use the ILS in order to land (with permit IAW the Joint

DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                               31


       4.10.1.1. Delay Start Time: The latest time that an aircraft can become airborne without
       being in delayed status. Late being 14 minutes past the allowed ground time IAW AMCI
       10-202 Vol 6, Mission Reliability Reporting System (MRRS).
       4.10.1.2. Controlled Departure Time (CDT): The exact time an aircraft should be
       airborne to meet AAR mission criteria. The AAR aircraft will have a delay start time in
       addition to a CDT.
   4.10.2. The Dover CP shall:
       4.10.2.1. Notify ATCT at least 30 minutes before the aircraft’s delay start time when
       necessary to avoid conflict between other traffic and home station departures.
       4.10.2.2. If there is more than one AMC mission departure (home station departure),
       notify ATCT and identify which one has priority.
   4.10.3. Controlled Departure Time. The aircraft commander shall notify Ground Control of
   the controlled departure time on initial contact. This will allow ATCT to adjust the traffic
   flow as required to accommodate the CDT.
4.11. Clearance Delivery. Dover RAPCON provides ATC clearance delivery functions on
frequencies 289.4 and 125.55. Computerized IFR flight plans are received approximately 30
minutes before the aircraft’s proposed departure time. Pilots should contact clearance delivery
not earlier than 30 minutes before their proposed departure time for their clearance.
4.12. Category (CAT) II Instrument Landing System (ILS) Procedures.
   4.12.1. When RWY 01 (CAT II runway) is in use and RVR decreases to 3000 feet or less,
   ATCT personnel will place airfield lighting on backup power. Also, if an aircraft requests a
   CAT II ILS approach to RWY 01 and RWY 01 is not in use, but the RVR is 3000 feet or
   less, ATCT personnel will place the airfield lighting on backup power.
   4.12.2. ATCT personnel will contact AM Ops, RAPCON and CE service desk to advise
   them anytime the airfield lighting back-up power generator is in operation, and subsequently
   when the generator is turned off.
   4.12.3. If the generator fails to start when activated from ATCT, ATCT personnel will report
   the discrepancy to the CE service desk. Civil Engineering Squadron Power Production (436
   CES/CEOIP) personnel will report to the lighting vault to manually start the generator.
   4.12.4. Power Production personnel shall:
       4.12.4.1. Advise ATCT personnel anytime the remote generator switch in the ATCT is
       not operational.
       4.12.4.2. Coordinate with ATCT before activating the CAT II control switch for
       simultaneous generator start and power transfer.
       4.12.4.3. Assume responsibility for activating airfield lighting back-up generator for
       CAT II ILS operations when ATCT does not possess the capability to activate it.
   4.12.5. AM Ops shall notify the RAPCON immediately, when any component of the airfield
   ground environment does not meet CAT II ILS standards.

   4.12.6. RAPCON will advise AM Ops to NOTAM the ILS CAT II to CAT I status when the
   Remote Status Indicator (RSI) fails or the radar facility is required to vacate, leaving no RSI
   monitoring capability.
4.13. Protection of Precision Approach Critical Areas. ATCT will protect critical areas
depicted in Attachment 5 (i.e. ILS, Precision Obstacle Free Zone, etc.) IAW AFI 13-204V3,
Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs and applicable FAA orders. All aircraft will be
held at instrument hold lines when CAT II ILS procedures are in effect.
   4.13.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2 miles, but
   at or above 200 feet and/or visibility at or above 1/2 mile (RVR 2400), restrict all aircraft
   larger than fighter type size. Vehicles in support of fighter type aircraft are authorized to
   proceed up to the VFR hold lines under these conditions.
   4.13.2. When the ceiling is less than 200 feet or visibility is less than 1/2 mile (RVR 2400),
   all aircraft and vehicles are restricted from crossing the instrument hold lines until
   specifically cleared by ATCT to proceed.
   4.13.3. When an aircraft is conducting an ILS approach during CAT II operations, aircraft
   shall not taxi or proceed on TWY D from the Hazardous Cargo area.
4.14. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). The ATIS is a 24-hour, continuous
broadcast of recorded non-control information for Dover AFB. Its purpose is to relieve
frequency congestion by automating the repetitive transmission of essential but routine
information.
   4.14.1. The ATIS can be received on frequency 135.05 or 273.5 or by telephone 302-677-
   ATIS (2847).
   4.14.2. Pilots will use the ATIS to the maximum extent possible and report the current ATIS
   “code” to either ATCT or RAPCON upon initial contact.
   4.14.3. Dover has Digital ATIS (D-ATIS) capability.
   4.14.4. Problems or comments on the ATIS should be reported to 436 OSS/OSA.
4.15. Tower Display Workstation (TDW) Outage Limitations. During periods when the
certified ATCT radar display is unusable, non-standard operations including Tactical
Employment Training, NVG operations, etc, may be limited and/or disapproved based on traffic
conditions and controller workload.
4.16. Non-Radar Limitations. When Dover Radar is out-of-service, IFR flight operations will
be limited to single approach to a full stop (multiple approaches may only be approved by the
RAPCON Chief Controller and OG/CC based on traffic density and controller workload).
Expect delays due to non-radar NAVAID-based routing and holding.
4.17. Secondary Radar Feed. Dover RAPCON has secondary radar feed capability from 2000’
MSL and above. This provides a limited backup for the on-site Digital Airport Surveillance
Radar (DASR) feed.

                                           Chapter 6

                                TACTICAL PROCEDURES

6.1. Tactical Approach/Departure Procedures. To ensure maximum training for all aircraft in
the Dover pattern, maximum coordination is required between all parties involved.
   6.1.1. Tactical Approach diagrams: Located in Attachment 10 of this publication. The
   diagrams are intended to provide mutual understanding of the expected ground track between
   the pilot and ATC. The diagrams are not intended to be an exact depiction of the ground
   track a pilot is expected to fly. Note: All tactical approaches shall not overfly base housing
   below 1000’.
   6.1.2. Cancellation of IFR clearance: IFR clearance will automatically cancel at 6 mile final
   for each tactical approach and aircraft will proceed VFR. Pilots are not required to cancel
   IFR with ATC.
   6.1.3. Altitudes: High/Steep 5000’; Low 500’- 1000’(as requested in approach request,
   unless otherwise coordinated with ATC).
      6.1.3.1. If altitude changes throughout approach, coordination is required with ATCT
      (e.g. pitch up on break or downwind).
   6.1.4. Tactical Approach Phraseology:
      6.1.4.1. Abeam:       “REQUEST        ABEAM       RUNWAY__         RIGHT/LEFT       BASE
      RUNWAY__,             FEET.”
      6.1.4.2. Midfield Abeam:      “REQUEST MIDFIELD ABEAM TO RUNWAY____,
      FEET.”
      6.1.4.3. Teardrop: “REQUEST TEARDROP RUNWAY__ RIGHT/LEFT BASE
      RUNWAY____, ___        FEET.”
      6.1.4.4. 90/270: “REQUEST 90/270 RUNWAY __ RIGHT/LEFT BASE RUNWAY
      ___, ____ FEET.”
      6.1.4.5. Low Straight-In:     “REQUEST A LOW STRAIGHT-IN RUNWAY ___,
      FEET.”
      6.1.4.6. Steep Straight-In: “REQUEST A STEEP STRAIGHT-IN RUNWAY__.”
      6.1.4.7. Random Steep:       “REQUEST A RANDOM STEEP LEFT/RIGHT BASE
      RUNWAY __.”
      6.1.4.8. Random Steep with Circle: “REQUEST RANDOM STEEP RUNWAY __
      LEFT/RIGHT BASE RUNWAY __.”
      6.1.4.9. Curvilinear: “REQUEST HIGH LEFT/RIGHT BASE RUNWAY__.”
      6.1.4.10. Tactical Overhead: “REQUEST TACTICAL OVERHEAD RUNWAY____,
      ____FEET.”
      6.1.4.11. Wyoming Abeam: “CMDEN, REQUEST ABEAM ARRIVAL, LEFT/RIGHT
              BASE RUNWAY __, FULL STOP/TOUCH AND GO/OPTION”
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                  35


6.2. Sector Overlay. Pilots may use the sector overlay depicted in Attachment 11 to simulate
conditions they are likely to face in the tactical environment. Communication with local ATC
may be done with reference to the overlay. Aircraft will report entering each sector to ATC (ex.
“BOLAR11 entering sector 1”, or “ BOLAR11 entering sector D”). Aircraft will also report
cancellation of IFR prior to entering the sector from which the approach is being conducted.
Communication with non-participating aircraft will need to be done in the clear. If there is ever
any question about the location of traffic or the intentions of any aircraft, both ATC and aircrew
will communicate in plain language.
   6.2.1. Sector Overlay Phraseology:
       6.2.1.1. Abeam: “REQUEST SECTOR ___ FOR THE ABEAM RUNWAY___
       RIGHT/LEFT BASE RUNWAY___, ___FEET.”
       6.2.1.2. Midfield Abeam: “REQUEST SECTOR___ FOR THE MIDFIELD ABEAM
       TO RUNWAY___, ___FEET.”
       6.2.1.3. Teardrop: “REQUEST SECTOR___ FOR THE TEARDROP RUNWAY__
       RIGHT/LEFT BASE RUNWAY____, ___ FEET.”
       6.2.1.4. 90/270: “REQUEST SECTOR ___ FOR THE 90/270 RUNWAY __
       RIGHT/LEFT BASE RUNWAY ___, ____ FEET.”
       6.2.1.5. Low Straight-In: “REQUEST SECTOR___ FOR A LOW STRAIGHT-IN
       RUNWAY___, __ FEET.”
       6.2.1.6. Steep Straight-In: “REQUEST SECTOR___ FOR A STEEP STRAIGHT-IN
       RUNWAY___.”
       6.2.1.7. Random Steep:        “REQUEST SECTOR___ FOR A RANDOM STEEP
       RUNWAY___.”
       6.2.1.8. Random Steep with Circle: “REQUEST SECTOR___ FOR A RANDOM
       STEEP RUNWAY___ LEFT/RIGHT BASE RUNWAY___.”
       6.2.1.9. Curvilinear: “REQUEST SECTOR___ FOR A HIGH LEFT/RIGHT BASE
       RUNWAY___.”
6.3. VFR Holding. Although tactical training has priority over transient aircraft and other non-
critical flight ops, circumstances may arise where it is necessary to hold aircraft conducting
tactical approaches VFR at a location and altitude outside the Class D airspace to prevent
repetitive break-outs of other aircraft and degradation of ATC service. The following VFR
holding/reporting points may be used as depicted in Attachment 11.
   6.3.1. Kevin: DOV 030/10
   6.3.2. Tom: DOV 090/10
   6.3.3. Jared: DOV 150/10
   6.3.4. Paul: DOV 210/10
   6.3.5. Jorge: DOV 270/10
   6.3.6. Mario: DOV 330/10
 36                                                    DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


6.4. Tactical Departure Procedures. If accomplishing a tactical departure, make sector and
altitude request with tower or approach prior to take-off or touch and go.
   6.4.1. All tactical departures will climb to 5000’ MSL unless otherwise requested by the
   pilot. Attachment 10.10. shows an optional spiral up departure for tactical aircraft.
   Phraseology example: “REQUEST DEPARTURE SECTOR_____, ____FEET”
   6.4.2. The Accel Departure is used as an efficient transition to the Monster Mile VFR Stereo
   Routes. See Attachment 10.11.
   6.4.3. The Wyoming TAC Departure enables better sequencing and planning by providing a
   consistent ground track to the VFR fix CMDEN. At CMDEN, holding procedures exist to
   set up for the Wyoming Tactical Arrival. See Attachment 10.12.
6.5. Monster Mile Routes. The Monster Mile North/South routes are two 10-minute stereo
VFR routes designed to facilitate local low-level training requirements IAW AFI 11-2C-17V1.
Each route is completely contained within the vertical and lateral confines of Dover AFB
Approach airspace. See Attachment 15 for route depiction and additional details.
6.6. Noise Abatement. All noise abatement procedures will be upheld IAW AFI 11-2C-
MDSV3 DAFB SUP and Dover Aircrew Flimsy. Compliance with noise abatement restrictions
is the pilot’s responsibility.
6.7. Assault Landing Zone (ALZ). RWY 32 is painted with a series of non-reflective white
markings, measuring 10 feet by 5.5 feet, to indicate a 3500’ ALZ. See ETL 09-6 for marking
configuration.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                 37

   8.5.1. Areas offshore, beyond power-off gliding distance to land.
   8.5.2. Airspace restricted areas R4006, R4001A, and R4001B.
   8.5.3. For solo student pilots, that area within 25NM from Dover AFB.
8.6. Flight Training Area. Flight training areas for FTC pilots are established to provide
designated airspace for club members to perform the flight maneuvers necessary to fulfill FAA,
USAF and Flight Training currency and training requirements. These areas are not “protected”
airspace. Collision avoidance is the pilot’s responsibility. They provide a common reference for
Dover Approach Control and club members to streamline entry to and exit from Dover AFB.
Pilots will normally enter and exit these areas from over the town of Camden-Wyoming. There
are two designated areas: ALPHA and BRAVO.
   8.6.1. Area ALPHA is bounded on the East by US 13, on the West by US 301, North by the
   C&D canal and on the South of Delaware (DE) Route 8. Area ALPHA includes the airspace
   from the ground to 5000 feet MSL.
   8.6.2. Area BRAVO is bounded on the East by US 13, on the West by US 301, on the North
   by DE Route 8, and on the South by DE Route 404. Area BRAVO includes the airspace
   from ground to 5000 feet MSL.
8.7. Weather Minimums for FTC Flight Training Operations.
   8.7.1. Day, VFR--1500 feet AGL ceiling, three statute mile visibility.
   8.7.2. Night, 2500 feet AGL ceiling, five statute mile visibility.
8.8. FTC Anti-Hijack Procedures. If an unauthorized FTC aircraft taxi is observed, the ATCT
will follow procedures outlined in para 9.16.
8.9. Taxi Procedures. Flight Training aircraft shall contact “Dover Ground” on frequency
118.875 before taxi. FTC pilots do not need to contact ground to move/taxi the aircraft to the
refueling area to and from the FTC parking location. Specific taxi procedures shall be issued by
Dover Ground Control. Normal routes:
   8.9.1. RWY 32. TWY F to TWY E to the approach end of RWY 32 or intersection
   departure via TWY B.
   8.9.2. RWY 14. TWY F to TWY E to the approach end of RWY 32 for back taxi on the
   Runway to the midfield intersection, traffic permitting, the alternate taxi route is via the
   approach end of Runway 01 then north on TWY B to the midfield intersection.
   8.9.3. RWY 19. Taxi via TWY F and proceed as directed by ATCT. Normally, the pilot
   will back taxi, but each situation could dictate other instructions.
   8.9.4. RWY 01. Taxi via TWY F.
8.10. Wake Turbulence/Taxi Restrictions.
   8.10.1. Due to the unpredictable nature of wake turbulence and its potentially disastrous
   effect on light aircraft, use extreme caution at all times when taxiing or conducting flight
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                     41


   operations behind heavy aircraft that conduct regular flight operations at Dover AFB. Large
   aircraft may also cause wake turbulence effects.
   8.10.2. FTC pilots shall not request to waive the required wake turbulence separation behind
   heavy aircraft.
   8.10.3. FTC pilots shall not taxi closer than 500 feet behind a large aircraft that has any of its
   engines running. FTC pilots shall not stop for engine run-ups or other purposes in a position
   where a passing large aircraft’s jet or propeller blast will be directed at the aircraft from a
   distance of less than 500 feet.
   8.10.4. FTC pilots will not taxi at speeds greater than a fast walking pace. Upon landing,
   taxi speed can be a controlled, faster pace in order to clear the runway for other operations.
8.11. Engine Run-Up Procedures. FTC aircraft shall conduct engine run-ups on the ramp or
taxiway. Conduct a normal run-up on the taxiway at least 50 feet from the runway hold lines.
8.12. Operations within Class D Surface Area.
   8.12.1. Due to heavy jet traffic at Dover AFB, multiple approaches or landing practice is
   permitted at the discretion of ATC, if such operations will not impede the departure or arrival
   of military aircraft. At those times deemed appropriate by ATC, FTC pilots may be directed
   to depart or vary their traffic patterns. Except for emergencies, FTC pilots will not delay the
   departure or arrival of military aircraft.
   8.12.2. Traffic patterns are to the west or southwest of all runways unless directed by the
   ATCT.
   8.12.3. Traffic pattern altitude is 1000 feet MSL. Except in an emergency, aircraft will not
   be operated below this altitude over Dover AFB or its housing area.
   8.12.4. Do not turn out before passing the departure end of the runway unless directed by
   ATC.
8.13. VFR Departures and Arrivals.
   8.13.1. Departures will contact Dover Ground Control and state:
       8.13.1.1. Identification (call sign).
       8.13.1.2. Location on the airfield.
       8.13.1.3. Destination.
       8.13.1.4. Altitude.
   8.13.2. Arrival Procedures for Local Flights.
       8.13.2.1. FTC pilots will contact Dover Approach Control on frequency 132.425 MHz
       when ready to return to base (RTB) and state, “DOVER APPROACH, IRONY (#),
       BRAVO TRAINING AREA, ‘altitude’, LANDING DOVER”.
       8.13.2.2. When returning from training areas ALPHA or BRAVO, entry into the Class D
       surface area will normally be over the entry point (approx. 1/2 mile south of intersection
       of US 13 and DE Route 10). FTC pilots will cross the entry point at 1500 feet MSL and
       then descend to 1000 feet (pattern altitude), contact Dover Tower and state, “IRONY (#),
       HOLDING AT WALMART, REQUEST TO PROCEED INBOUND.”
 42                                                   DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


       8.13.2.3. The ATCT may direct FTC pilots to hold at Moore’s Lake Shopping Center
       (intersection of DE Route 10 and State Street). “IRONY (#), HOLD AT MOORES
       LAKE.” Maintain 1000 feet MSL while in holding.
   8.13.3. Arrival Procedures for Cross Country Flights. When returning from a cross country
   flight, contact Dover Approach Control no later than 15 miles from Dover AFB and state:
   Identification, position from Dover AFB, altitude, and intentions.
8.14. IFR Departures and Arrivals.
   8.14.1. FTC pilots shall contact Dover Clearance Delivery on frequency 125.55 MHz and
   state: Identification, destination, and clearance on request.      Example: “DOVER
   CLEARANCE DELIVERY, (TAIL #), IFR TO WHITE PLAINS, CLEARANCE ON
   REQUEST.”
   8.14.2. After obtaining clearance: Contact Ground Control and state, “DOVER GROUND,
   (TAIL #), IFR TO WHITE PLAINS, READY TO TAXI.” Aircraft will follow taxi
   instructions to include holding short when directed by ground control.
8.15. Overdue FTC Aircraft: Flight plans will be monitored by the FTC manager or
representative to permit timely action in the event an aircraft is overdue or involved in an
emergency. Subsequent actions will be dictated by the situation and established FAA and USAF
procedures.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                               43


                                          Chapter 9

                    ABNORMAL AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

9.1. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). The purpose of the base PCAS is to alert and
activate those agencies needed to perform lifesaving functions at the time of a known or
suspected on or off base aircraft accident. Ground and in-flight emergencies also require
activation of the PCAS. The ATCT, Airfield Management Operations, Base Clinic and Fire
Emergency Services are PCAS members. In event of an on or off-base accident, the Incident
Commander will work with affected units IAW 436 AW EM (Emergency Management) Plan 10-
2. Note: PCAS Members are the only agencies authorized to have two-way communication
capabilities on the Crash Network.
9.2. Secondary Crash Network (SCN). The purpose of the base SCN is to establish a
communication system for rapid dissemination of information during in-flight emergencies,
aircraft accidents/incidents, ground aircraft emergencies and exercises with base support
agencies. AM Ops, CP, Security Forces, FD, Weather, Disaster Preparedness, Safety, Explosive
Ordnance Disposal, Bioenvironmental, Clinic, Public Affairs and Fire Marshall are SCN
members. When the PCAS is out of service, ATCT will direct AM Ops to activate the SCN. If
the SCN is out of service, there is a backup located on the telephone console at AM Ops labeled
SCN BU. The backup has every agency that is on the SCN call list. The backup line will be
tested quarterly per AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs (conducted on
the first duty day of the quarter) and documented on the daily events log.
   9.2.1. Requests for additions/deletions to SCN must be coordinated through the AFM and
   forwarded to the 436 OSS/CC for approval/disapproval IAW AFI 13-204V3, Airfield
   Operations Procedures and Programs.
   9.2.2. Airfield Management Operations conducts a roll call each day during the morning test
   to ensure operational capability. Any station failing to respond will receive an immediate
   phone call to determine reason for response failure. Individuals who answer the crash
   network should be familiar with the phonetic alphabet and use it when responding with their
   initials. Individuals answering will remain silent until the activating agency has completed
   the message and conducted roll call. Questions may then be asked. Note: All stations on the
   SCN must use a noise reduction feature such as push-to-talk handset or Confidencor
   (Trademark of National Communications Inc.), that filters out background noise.
   9.2.3. Stations on the crash network are expected to receive and disseminate information in
   minimum time. During actual emergencies use DOVERAFB Form 22, Emergency
   Notification/Hazardous Cargo Movement, to record information in the proper format and
   sequence.
   9.2.4. Airfield Management Operations will relay verbatim the information received from
   the ATCT.
9.3. Air Evacuation Notification Procedures. When informed of an inbound air evac aircraft,
ATCT will notify AM Ops if further actions are required. Actions may include activating the
primary and secondary crash network, calling transient alert of no notice arrivals, and up
channeling information to Wing leadership. Normally, CP is initially notified of inbound air
evac missions and they in turn, notify ATCT.
 44                                                       DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


9.4. Suspending/Resuming/Closing Runway Operations. The ATCT will suspend air traffic
operations to all runways when an emergency aircraft lands. The ATCT will advise Dover
RAPCON of the suspension. After a runway check, AM Ops will advise the ATCT when
runway operations are safe to resume. AM Ops has authority to close the runway due to hazards
affecting flight safety. Wing leadership will receive immediate notification during these
occurrences. Once the hazard is no longer a factor, AM Ops will declare the runway open. A
FOD check may be required prior to commencing operations.
9.5. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) and Personnel Locator Beacon (PLB) Signals.
   9.5.1. ELT/PLB signals received by Dover AFB facilities shall trigger the following actions:
   9.5.2. RAPCON:
       9.5.2.1. RAPCON will notify Washington ARTCC.
   9.5.3. ATCT:
       9.5.3.1. Shall activate the PCAS only if, through visual observations or upon receipt of a
       radio transmission, an emergency exists. ATCT will not activate the PCAS without first
       coordinating with Airfield Management Operations. If no emergency exists, notify
       Airfield Management Operations of the ELT/PLB.
       9.5.3.2. Shall advise Airfield Management Operations when an ELT/PLB signal ceases,
       is located, or when additional information becomes available.
   9.5.4. AM Ops:
       9.5.4.1. Shall, upon notification of an ELT/PLB signal, take action to locate the signal
       source.
       9.5.4.2. If an actual emergency exists, ensure ATCT activates the PCAS. Activate the
       (SCN), passing on the information verbatim. Complete Dover Form 22.
       9.5.4.3. Notify the Search and Rescue Center at DSN 523-5955 / Commercial 850-283-
       5955 / toll free 800-851-3051.
       9.5.4.4. Review Accident Response Procedures QRC 10-1 and QRC 10-2 IAW the 436
       AW Basic Unit Supplement.
       9.5.4.5. Terminate procedures if the source of the signal is identified or the signal ceases.
       Notify ATCT, RAPCON, Maintenance Operations Center and any other agencies
       previously notified. Log all actions and notifications onto AF Form 3616, Events Log.
       NOTE: ELT/PLB testing is authorized during the first five minutes of every hour, for no
       more than three sweeps.
       9.5.4.6. If an ELT/PLB signal is received with no other evidence of an emergency, notify
       Maintenance Operations Center (hotline through CP or DSN 445-5436 / Commercial
       302-677-5436) of the beacon signal and ask them to initiate beacon search procedures.
       Maintenance notifies the radio shop, which in turn conducts intensive searches with
       direction finding equipment.
       9.5.4.7. If the signal cannot be located by Maintenance, ask RAPCON to contact
       Washington ARTCC and assist in locating the beacon signal.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                 45


9.6. Evacuation of ATCT/RAPCON/AM Ops.
   9.6.1. In event of any man-made or natural hazards that require ATCT evacuation, personnel
   will relocate to the RAPCON. ATCT functions cannot be performed from the RAPCON and
   the airfield will be uncontrolled. The ATCT shall be evacuated for high winds when
   sustained wind speed reaches 70 knots (55 knots if a window is cracked). Detailed controller
   responsibilities in the event of an evacuation can be found in Dover OSAT OI 13-204.
   9.6.2. In the event RAPCON evacuates, navigational aid status will be unmonitored and
   Washington Air Traffic Control Center will provide limited IFR services for arriving aircraft.
   RAPCON personnel will evacuate to AM Ops. Additional instructions can be found in
   Dover OSAR OI 13-204.
   9.6.3. If both ATC facilities require evacuation, AM Ops is the next location for
   accountability.
   9.6.4. In the event of a facility evacuation of Bldg 501, the alternate location for AM Ops is
   Bldg 502 (ATC Complex). If ATC and AM Ops are both required to evacuate, personnel
   will meet at the Wing flag pole for accountability. Note: Dover does not have an alternate
   ATCT, AM Ops or RAPCON facility.
9.7. Radar/ATCALS Emergency Warning and Evacuation Alarm. The emergency warning
and evacuation alarm system is used to notify individuals in and around certain runway
shelters/sites that an emergency aircraft is approaching to land. The ATCT shall activate the
alarm anytime an aircraft with a known/suspected emergency condition has commenced
approach and is 10 flying miles from the runway. Known or suspected emergencies include, but
are not limited to: a declared, observed or reported emergency, no radio (NORDO) aircraft and
aircraft accidents. ATCT shall deactivate the alarm when the hazard no longer exists.
9.8. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals. When an unauthorized and unannounced aircraft lands at
Dover AFB, the ATCT shall, when possible, tell the aircraft to hold in one of the following
areas, as appropriate:
   9.8.1. Run-up pad at the approach end of RWY 19.
   9.8.2. Run-up pad at the approach end of RWY 01.
   9.8.3. TWY C.
9.9. Hot Armament/Hung Ordnance. Aircraft landing at Dover AFB with hot armament (i.e.
arm-de-arm area for guns, rockets, flares) on board will be directed by the ATCT to the RWY 19
hammerhead (see Attachment 3). The ATCT shall direct the aircraft to position itself in a 010
compass heading to afford maximum safety to personnel and equipment. RWY 01/19 shall be
closed during all de-arming operations.
   9.9.1. Aircraft landing RWY 19 shall be instructed to make a left 180 degree turn and back
   taxi to the de-arm area.
   9.9.2. Aircraft landing RWY 01 shall proceed directly to the end of the runway and turn left
   onto the de-arm area.
   9.9.3. Aircraft landing RWY 32 shall proceed to the de-arm area via TWY B.
9.10. Jettison Of External Stores/Cargo.
 46                                                     DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


   9.10.1. The VFR external stores/cargo jettison area is located east of Dover AFB over the
   Delaware Bay. The pilot is responsible for visually clearing the area before jettisoning
   external stores/cargo.
   9.10.2. The IFR external stores jettison/cargo area is located in Warning Area W-107. The
   RAPCON will obtain clearance from Washington Center when an aircraft requests IFR
   clearance into this area.
9.11. Bailout. Aircraft abandonment location will be established with Washington Center.
Aircraft will be routed over the Delaware Bay to Warning Area W-107 if feasible. Aircraft
coordinates will be plotted as practical by Dover ATC and forwarded to leadership and
Washington Center.
9.12. Hot Brakes Procedures. Aircraft with an emergency for hot brakes will be directed by
the ATCT to the hammerheads on RWY 01/19, TWY G for RWY 32, or TWY E for RWY 14
operations. ATCT shall activate the Primary Crash Phone.
9.13. Ground Fuel Dumping. After a pilot advises that ground fuel dumping is necessary,
ATCT shall activate the Primary Crash Phone.
9.14. Airborne Fuel Dumping.
   9.14.1. The airborne fuel dump area is located to the east of Dover over the Delaware Bay at
   7,000‘ MSL. Based on the intentions of the pilot, this area shall be used to the maximum
   extent possible for all fuel dumping in the Dover Radar Approach area, except when the
   delay incurred going to the area or altitude would compromise flying safety. Higher altitudes
   are coordinated with ATC Center control as needed.
   9.14.2. The aircraft commander must obtain approval (time permitting) from the 436 OG/CC
   through CP, and the appropriate air traffic control agency prior to dumping fuel. Advise
   RAPCON prior to operations commencing and when terminating.
9.15. Hydrazine Procedures. In the event a fighter aircraft activates its Emergency Power Unit
(EPU), there is a potential for a hydrazine leak. Hydrazine is a caustic substance that has the
potential to cause harm if fumes are breathed in. The FD will be called for this emergency and
will have the pilot hold the aircraft at the RWY 01/19 hammerheads or on TWY G if landing
RWY 32, TWY E, if landing RWY 14. The FD or IC may dictate aircraft holding at other than
identified locations if the winds dictate. See Attachment 3 for location.
9.16. Hijack Procedures. In the event of a suspected or confirmed hijack, the ATCT will
immediately activate the Primary Crash Net. Ground control should first attempt contact the
pilot on ground and emergency frequencies for aircraft not authorized taxi. All parties will be
notified of the current position and other pertinent information. ATC will assist the IC by
forwarding updated information and relaying any orders and/or instructions. The IC will be the
single point-of-contact in the event of an aircraft being hijacked. Refer to the Installation
Security Plan for other information.
9.17. Lost Communications Procedures.
   9.17.1. ATCT Pattern: Aircraft experiencing lost communication while in the ATCT pattern
   will rock wings (daytime) or flash landing lights (nighttime) while on downwind and proceed
   to a full stop landing on last assigned runway, exit the runway expeditiously and continue to
   follow light gun signals. Aircrew will watch the ATCT for light gun signals.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                 47


   9.17.2. Radar Pattern: Aircraft will squawk 7600 and fly the instrument approach that they
   were cleared for or filed for. If the ILS becomes unusable on approach and the pilot cannot
   proceed to land VFR, the pilot will fly to TIDEY and execute the TACAN approach to the
   active runway. Aircraft will land, exit the runway expeditiously and follow ATCT light gun
   signals.
   9.17.3. Ground Traffic.
      9.17.3.1. Vehicles experiencing lost communication while within the CMA will
      immediately exit the movement area and face vehicle towards the ATCT and flash
      headlights. The vehicle will then wait for light gun instructions from the ATCT. The
      ATCT may also flash runway lights to signal vehicle to exit runway immediately.
      Vehicle will proceed to nearest phone and notify AM Ops when off of CMA.
      9.17.3.2. Aircraft experiencing lost communications while on the ground will flash
      landing lights and wait for light gun instruction from the ATCT.
   9.17.4. Lost communications with Flight Training Center aircraft.
      9.17.4.1. On the ground: If the radio fails after clearance to taxi, FTC pilots will:
          9.17.4.1.1. Make a 180-degree turn and taxi back to parking before reaching the
          approach end of RWY 01.
          9.17.4.1.2. In the event that radio communication is lost past the runway hold line,
          execute the following steps: Turn the aircraft to face the ATCT and flash the landing
          lights on the taxiway before taxiing onto the departure runway. Upon receiving a
          flashing white light gun signal from the ATCT, taxi back on the same route that was
          used to get to the departure runway. Aircraft will hold short of any intersecting
          runway and face the ATCT to receive a flashing green light gun signal.
      9.17.4.2. In-flight:
          9.17.4.2.1. If radio failure occurs or is suspected, squawk 7600 on the transponder
          and proceed via normal arrival routes. Proceed directly to a holding pattern over the
          base golf course. When given a flashing green light gun signal go to the appropriate
          runway; depending on prevailing winds or other traffic in the traffic pattern, enter a
          left downwind for RWY 01 and RWY 32 or a right downwind for RWY 14 and RWY
          19. Rock the aircraft’s wings on downwind and watch the ATCT for light gun signals
          when turning final. If a steady green light gun signal is not received on final, go
          around and repeat the procedure.
          9.17.4.2.2. After landing, exit the runway, turn toward the ATCT and wait for an
          appropriate light gun signal before taxiing. Before crossing a runway, turn toward the
          ATCT for a light gun signal to cross.
          9.17.4.2.3. At all times during actual or suspected radio failures, visually check for
          other aircraft and give way.
9.18. DASR Antenna Free Wheeling. 436 CS/SCMF maintenance personnel will place the
DASR antenna into free wheel mode when the winds exceed 85 knots IAW ATCALS Operations
Letter.

9.19. Flight Line Operations during Lightning Conditions. Currently during weather
conditions where lightning is present within 5 nautical miles, all maintenance, aerial port and
fuel truck operations on the flight line are suspended. All flight line personnel are directed to
vacate the flight line until lightning passes. Note: Maintainers do not vacate the flight line
during lightning, but they find shelter inside a vehicle, aircraft or building nearby. The following
procedures will be adhered to by all aircrew members when lightning conditions are observed by
Base Weather and announced by CP:
   9.19.1. If the aircraft engines are running, all crew members will remain on the aircraft, to
   include the scanner. If the aircraft is currently not in an approved parking spot, the crew may
   continue to parking, but will hold on the taxiway and not turn into the parking spot until the
   lightning hold is lifted and marshallers are present.
   9.19.2. If aircraft engines are not running, all external preflight and loading operations will
   cease immediately. All crew members outside of the aircraft will either vacate the flight line
   to seek shelter or go inside the aircraft for cover. Once the lightning hold is lifted, the crew
   may resume preflight and load duties.
9.20. Wear of Hats. The flight line is a no-hat area.
9.21. Flightline/Airfield Photography. All flightline/airfield photography shall be conducted
IAW AFI 31-101_AMCSUP_DOVERAFBSUP.
9.22. Weight Bearing Capacity Waivers. IAW AFI 13-204V3 OG/CC approves weight
bearing capacity waivers. Obtain a recommendation from CE through the AFM prior to
requesting approval from the OG/CC.
9.23. Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Procedures. UAS do not operate at Dover AFB.
9.24. Reduced Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Capability. In the event ARFF
capability is reduced, refer to procedures in Attachment 16. OSAA and OSAT personnel will
document ARFF changes on AF Form 3616.
9.25. Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD). Normally, operations on the EOD range will not
affect airfield operations. Cordons vary based on the type of operation being conducted. If
airfield operations will be affected, the range Team Leader will advise the Tower WS.

                     AIRCRAFT RESCUE FIRE-FIGHTING (ARFF)

A16.1. Steady State. The Steady State ARFF capability for Dover AFB is Optimum Level of
Service (OLS) based on at least 18 firefighters on duty and 13,000 gallons of available
firefighting agent.
A16.2. Notifications. Fire Emergency Services (FES) personnel will notify AMOPS, MOCC
and CP daily on aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) capability. This is normally
accomplished via the Daily Status Report.
   A16.2.1. Capability for each primary resource (firefighting agent and firefighters) is
   described in terms of optimum level of service (OLS), reduced level of service (RLS), critical
   level of service (CLS), and inadequate level of service (ILS).
   A16.2.2. Overall capability is based on the lowest ARFF resource available. For example, if
   firefighting agent is OLS and firefighters are CLS, the overall capability would be CLS.
   A16.2.3. FES personnel will articulate the Level of Service (LOS) by identifying the LOS
   for each locally-assigned aircraft category. For example: If the LOS is reduced for C-5 to
   RLS, but LOS for C-17 remain at OLS then the Fire Chief or Senior Fire Officer will report
   RLS for C-5/OLS for C-17. This description is intended to reflect the LOS IAW the Crash
   Fire Fighting Matrix found in Table A16.1.
   A16.2.4. CP notifies Wing leadership of ARFF capability changes. CP will relay all
   requested operational restrictions to the appropriate agency for implementation.
A16.3. Changes in LOS.
   A16.3.1. The Fire Chief or FES personnel will ensure AMOPS, MOCC and CP are notified
   immediately of changes in ARFF capability.
   A16.3.2. If ARFF response times cannot be met due to another emergency or equipment
   limitation, declaration of CLS will be automatic and reported via NOTAM. FES personnel
   will make notifications IAW A16.3.1. when these conditions exist.
   A16.3.3. Installation leadership will make an ORM determination for curtailing operations
   and/or accepting additional risks when ARFF is other than OLS based on the ARFF/crash
   firefighting rescue (CFR) matrixes, mission requirements, and other risk control measures as
   appropriate. Consider:
      A16.3.3.1. Minimizing, restricting, or stopping normal flying operations.
      A16.3.3.2. Minimizing or stopping aircraft maintenance and/or fueling operations.
      A16.3.3.3. Restricting flying operations to the landing surface that is closer to fire dept.
      A16.3.3.4. Stopping transition training.
      A16.3.3.5. Stopping any concurrent servicing operations.
      A16.3.3.6. Minimizing or stopping local exercises.
      A16.3.3.7. Seeking relief from higher headquarters exercises or taskings.
DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012                                                                89


     A16.3.3.8. Minimizing or stopping wide-body aircraft traffic.
     A16.3.3.9. Diverting in-flight emergencies if time permits.
     A16.3.3.10. Expediting parts ordering and implementing after-hour vehicle maintenance.
     A16.3.3.11. Restricting      passenger      processing/movements/VIP        and/or     DV
     arrival/departures.
     A16.3.3.12. Restricting specific category(s) of transient aircraft.
  A16.3.4. When notified of an ARFF capability that is less than OLS, AMOPS will send a
  NOTAM IAW with the following format: QFFCG ARFF is Reduced or Critical Level (as
  appropriate) of Service USAF CAT (#) due to (vehicles, agent, and/or personnel) ####
  gallons remaining (for vehicle or agent reduction).
  A16.3.5. Factors which impact the unit’s ability to provide ARFF capability are the
  availability of manning, vehicles, firefighting agent, and the unit’s response time to
  emergencies on the airfield. ARFF capabilities may also be reduced when resources are
  committed to other aircraft and non-aircraft related incidents or emergencies.
  A16.3.6. ARFF categories below were developed to aid commanders in making operational
  decisions when capability is degraded.
     A16.3.6.1. Optimum Level of Service (OLS). This LOS is achieved when 18 personnel
     and at least 12,626 gallons are available. This includes vehicles set to provide required
     agent, required discharge capacity and required manpower for fire/ground capability. At
     OLS a maximum level of service can be continuously provided, as determined
     appropriate by the Fire Chief. During OLS, firefighting forces are capable of providing
     all services continuously throughout an event with reasonable expectation of successful
     offensive fire attack operations, search and rescue, and property conservation.
     A16.3.6.2. Reduced Level of Service (RLS). The LOS that exceeds the critical but is
     less than the optimum level of service. During this level adequate firefighting capability
     can be provided by utilizing cross staffing, selective response and sound fire/ground
     tactics. At the RLS, firefighting forces should be successful in offensive fire attack
     operations, search and rescue, and property conservation; however, operations may not be
     sustainable throughout an event without additional resources.
     A16.3.6.3. Degraded RLS. This is a local determination for the LOS achieved with 8-14
     personnel. All of the restrictions of RLS are still applicable, however certain services
     cannot be offered due to reduced manpower (i.e. interior aircraft firefighting and rescue
     services).
     A16.3.6.4. Critical Level of Service (CLS). This LOS is when there are 5-7 personnel
     and between 2,589-7,507 gallons of agent available. At this level firefighting forces can
     provide exterior rescue and quick fire attack operations for a short duration. Firefighting
     crews may provide limited search and rescue, and property conservation during this
     period; however, these operational capabilities cannot be sustained without additional
     resources.
     A16.3.6.5. Inadequate Level of Service (ILS). This level of capability is when
     manpower drops to 4 or less or any reduction in ARFF capability beyond the CLS level.
                90                                                                             DOVERAFBI13-201 26 APRIL 2012


                         This level represents extreme risk, and should only be encountered when operating at
                         reduced levels and an emergency occurs that exhaust all available and reserve resources.
                         Firefighting crews will have inadequate resources for initial or sustained exterior
                         firefighting, and interior firefighting and rescue operations will not be attempted or
                         supported.
