     program for the wing. The EXCOM is ultimately accountable to ensure each individual in
     the military treatment facility meets job qualifications and is competent to meet his/her
     responsibilities and performance expectations. In addition, the leaders ensure that members’
     competencies are assessed, maintained, demonstrated and continually improved. When
     indicated by competency evaluations, the EXCOM may direct group commanders to take
     actions to limit services provided at 59 MDW to protect the safety of patients.

   equipment or clinical practice.
      2.5.1. A quarterly Competency Assessment Report is completed by the unit ETRs,
      reviewed and signed by the officer in charge (OIC) and/or the noncommissioned officer
      in charge and forwarded to the ETOs.
   2.6. Individual personnel are responsible to acquire, maintain, and improve job competency
   to meet performance expectations as outlined in AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management and
