1. 10 U.S.C. 516. EFFECT UPON ENLISTED STATUS OF ACCEPTANCE OF
APPOINTMENT AS A CADET OR MIDSHIPMAN.
     1.1. (a) The enlistment or period of obligated service of an enlisted member of the armed
     forces who accepts an appointment as a cadet at the United States Military Academy, the
     United States Air Force Academy, or the United States Coast Guard Academy, or as a
     midshipman at the United States Naval Academy or in the Navy Reserve, may not be
     terminated because of the acceptance of that appointment. However, while serving as a cadet
     or midshipman at an Academy, he is entitled only to the pay, allowances, compensation,
     pensions, and other benefits provided by law for such a cadet or midshipman, or if he is a
     midshipman in the Navy Reserve, to the compensation and emoluments of a midshipman in
     the Navy Reserve.
     1.2. (b) If a person covered by subsection (a) is separated from service as a cadet or
     midshipman, or from service as a midshipman in the Navy Reserve, for any reason other than
     his appointment as a commissioned officer of a regular or reserve component of an armed
     force or because of a physical disability, he resumes his enlisted status and shall complete the
     period of service for which he was enlisted or for which he has an obligation, unless he is
     sooner discharged. In computing the unexpired part of an enlistment or period of obligated
     service for the purposes of this subsection, all service as a cadet or midshipman is counted as
     service under that enlistment or period of obligated service.
2. 10 U.S.C. 533(d)(2). SERVICE CREDIT UPON ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT AS A

     service performed, or education, training, or experience obtained, before graduation from
     such Academy.
3. 10 U.S.C. 541. GRADUATES OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, NAVAL, AND

     3.1. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each cadet at the United States Military
     Academy or the United States Air Force Academy, and each midshipman at the United States
     Naval Academy, is entitled, before graduating from that Academy, to state his preference for
     appointment, upon graduation, as a commissioned officer in either the Army, Navy, Air
     Force, or Marine Corps.
     3.2. (b) With the consent of the Secretary of the military department administering the
     Academy from which the cadet or midshipman is to be graduated, and of the Secretary of the
     military department having jurisdiction over the armed force for which that graduate stated
     his preference, the graduate is entitled to be accepted for appointment in that armed force.
USAFAPAM51-202 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                               5


  However, not more than 12 1/2 percent of any graduating class at an Academy may be
  appointed in armed forces not under the jurisdiction of the military department administering
  that Academy.
  3.3. (c) The Secretary of Defense shall, by regulation, provide for the equitable distribution
  of appointments in cases where more than 12 1/2 percent of the graduating class of any
  Academy request appointment in armed forces not under the jurisdiction of the military
  department administering that Academy.
4. 10 U.S.C. 641. APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER (PROMOTION, SEPARATION, AND

  period of not less than six years nor more than eight years, as provided in regulations
  prescribed by the Secretary of Defense for the armed forces under his jurisdiction and by the
  Secretary of Homeland Security for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in
  the Navy, unless such person is sooner discharged under such regulations because of personal
  hardship. Any part of such service that is not active duty or that is active duty for training
  shall be performed in a reserve component.
  5.2. (b) Each person covered by subsection (a) who is not a Reserve, and who is qualified,
  shall, upon his release from active duty, be transferred to a reserve component of his armed
  force to complete the service required by subsection (a).

        entitled to any pay under section 203(c) of title 37 for the period of the leave.
        6.2.3. (3) Return of an academy cadet or midshipman to a pay status at the Academy
        concerned from involuntary leave status under paragraph (1) does not restore any
        entitlement of the cadet or midshipman to pay for the period of the involuntary leave.
     6.3. (c) Inapplicable Leave Provisions.â€”Sections 701, 703, and 704 of this title and

      official distance between the:
          51.1.1.1. 1. abode,
          51.1.1.2. 2. home, or
          51.1.1.3. 3. school,

        51.1.2.1. 1. Officer Leaves Academy. An officer who, upon graduation from a

        and travel period.
     51.1.3. C. Separation Other Than by Commission. A cadet or midshipman of a Service

     authorized the PCS allowances prescribed in Chapter 5 for travel from the academy to the
     abode, home, or proper PDS.
     51.1.4. D. Rejected Applicants. A prospective cadet or midshipman (other than
     enlisted), who travels to a Service academy at the Governmentâ€™s invitation to accept an
     appointment and is rejected for admission, is authorized the PCS allowances prescribed
     for officers in Chapter 5. The allowances are authorized for the round trip travel

        51.1.4.1. 1. abode,
        51.1.4.2. 2. home, or

     beginning on the day after the arrival day and ending on the day before the departure day.
     51.2.2. B. GOVâ€™T Meal Rate for Cadets/Midshipmen. Effective 1 October 2008 the
