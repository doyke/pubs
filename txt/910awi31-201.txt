    1.3. Funds Escort Procedures. Security Forces personnel escort government funds only
    when contractor services are not available. Funds escort procedures will be determined
    locally and publish in the ISP. NOTE: Commissaries, AAFES facilities, on-base banks and
    NAF (Non- Appropriated Funds) facilities are encouraged to contract escort facilities. If
    contractor services are not available, or the ISC determines the threat level is such that
    contractor services are impractical, the ISC will determine if security forces personnel will
    perform escorts for non-government funds.
       1.3.1. Transporting funds. Escorted funds will not be transported in any vehicle operated
       by or carrying security forces personnel.
       1.3.2. Security Forces Escorts. Security forces personnel will occupy a trail vehicle
       during all funds escorts
    1.4. Funds Container Requirements and procedures.

           chosen carefully or the use of Intrusion Detection Equipment (IDE) to compensate for
           construction deficiencies.
    1.8. Alarms. IDE protection should be installed during the unattended storage of funds and
    accounting and finance cashier’s cages; equip these facilities with a duress alarm that
    annunciate at the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC).
    1.9. Anti-robbery Procedures.
       1.9.1. Step 1: Remain calm; do not resist; do not excite the robber

       1.9.7. Step 7: Ensure all doors to the facility are secured; do not let anyone enter or exit.
       1.9.8. Step 8: Go to the door where the robber has departed and attempt to obtain a
       vehicle description, license plate number, additional personnel and direction of travel.
       DO NOT EXIT THE FACILITY………THIS IS AN UNSAFE ACT!
       1.9.9. Step 9: Cease all business and keep any customers away from the crime scene and
       exits. Separate all witnesses and have them remain until the arrival of Security Forces.
       (SECURE THE CRIME SCENE).
       1.9.10. Step 10: Protect the crime scene; secure the immediate area where the robbery
       occurred, preventing the possible tampering and destruction of evidence, i.e. the robbery
       note. DO NOT LET ANYONE ENTER THE CRIME SCENE AREA!
       1.9.11. Step 11: Telephone Security Forces using base ext 609-1277 or 609-1299 while
       simultaneously completing AF Form 439, Robbery Checklist.
910AWI31-201 2 APRIL 2012                                                                      7

      1.9.14. A single person, in most cases, cannot reasonably be expected to perform all 13
      steps; teamwork is the key to successful implementation of these steps. The use of an
      internal alerting code, known only to facility employees and pre-designated anti-robbery
      tasks is highly recommended. All Security Forces anti-robbery exercises will be
      conducted with as much realism as is safely allowable. However, during an exercise, DO
      NOT attempt to give any money or valuable items to the exercise robber.

       receiving agency must notify security forces where firearms are to be located upon arrival
       and who will be responsible for the firearms until they are properly secured in an
       authorized storage facility.
       2.2.2. Very high-risk weapons will be moved under protection of armed guard
       surveillance and security escort vehicle service. Armed guard surveillance is protection
       that provides two drivers, one of which is armed, to maintain constant surveillance of the
       weapons. The Air Force standard for being “Armed” is having a 9mm handgun with a
       basic load of ammunition. Drivers will have portable communication capable of
       contacting an emergency response force. Security escort vehicle service provides a
       separate trail vehicle to maintain discreet surveillance of the weapons movement. (Not
       required on base). Drivers will have portable communication with the cargo vehicle and
       emergency response force. Cargo and trail vehicles will each have at least one armed
       individual. The shipment must be moved under the supervision of a TSgt or above or
       equivalent civilian. If military, the custodian may be one of the drivers.
       2.2.3. High risk Weapons. Sixteen or more weapons are moved under the protection of
       armed guard surveillance. Only constant surveillance is required for fifteen or fewer
       weapons. Constant surveillance is defined as an individual who remains within 10 feet
       and within unobstructed view of the shipment to maintain constant surveillance.
       2.2.4. Medium and low risk Weapons. Sixteen or more weapons are moved under the
       protection of dual driver protection service. The dual driver protective service is defined
       as providing continuous responsibility, attendance, and surveillance (within 10 feet and in
       unobstructed view) of the shipment through the use of two drivers. Drivers must have

         feasible.
  2.3. Non-Nuclear Munitions Movements: During all munitions movements, the shipper or
  owner must notify security forces before removing munitions from storage facilities. The
  receiving agency must notify security forces where munitions are to be located upon arrival
  and who will be responsible for the munitions until they are properly secured in an
  authorized storage facility.
     2.3.1. Very High-risk munitions (off base). Armed guard surveillance and security escort
     vehicles are required. Munitions custodian must remain in radio contact with law
     enforcement authorities.
     2.3.2. High Risk munitions (off base). During off base operations, armed guard
     surveillance is required. At least two personnel must be in the vehicle and one must be
     armed. One of the guards must remain in the vehicle at all times. Portable
     communications capability must be maintained with an emergency response force.
     2.3.3. On base munitions movements. Armed guard surveillance is required. Portable
     communications capability must be maintained with an emergency response force. For
     medium and low risk munitions, one person must be assigned to continuously attend the
     shipment.
  2.4. Transportation of AA&E during Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS).
     2.4.1. FPCON ALPHA. Conduct liaison with civilian authorities to review local threat
     before movement off base. Convene Threat Working Group to advise the installation
     commander.

4. Intrusion Detection Equipment.
   4.1. General guidelines IDE funding is the responsibility of the unit that owns or is the
   primary user of the facility requiring the IDE. Use of commercially leased or purchased IDE
   is permitted; however, it is strictly limited to the Advantor System and components.
   Coordinate all purchases of commercial IDE with the civil engineer squadron (910
   CES/CEOII) and the security forces Electronic Security Systems (ESS) NCO (910 SFS/S3A)
   to ensure compatibility.
       4.1.1. The owner/user is required to fund replacement parts (back up batteries, motion
       detectors, duress buttons etc.) that are found to be non-operational during routine testing
       or Preventative Maintenance Inspections. Cost of replacements parts can be obtained
       from the ESSNCO.
   4.2. Testing IDE. The owner/user must conduct quarterly alarm checks as required by AFI
   31-101 and document the results on AF Form 2530, Alarm System Test Record, or a
   computer generated version of the form. Note: All duress alarm(s) will be tested on the first
   duty day of the month. All other devices (motion detector, BMS door contacts, etc.) will be
   tested monthly (preferably on the first duty day of the month or UTA) by ESSNCO.
   4.3. Posting IDE Warning Signs. For all facilities protected by IDE, post AFVA 31-232,
   Warning IDS Signs. Mark entry points of large facilities containing numerous IDE, such as
   non-nuclear munitions storage areas (NMSA).
   4.4. Unit Requirements. Units with IDE must follow the following requirements:
       4.4.1. Specify, by letter to the security forces electronic systems section who may
       activate or deactivate alarms systems and who may pick-up authentication codes. The
       Advantor Alarm Authorization List meets this requirement and must be forwarded
       annually or immediately when changes occur to the 910 SFS ESSNCO. The list will be
       used to update alarm operator access and issue pin-codes to those authorized access to the
       area. Note: Contact the ESSNCO for a properly formatted Advantor Alarm Authorization
       List
       4.4.2. Ensure the letter is current by updating personnel changes.
       4.4.3. Post personnel to guard the area if there is an IDE failure.
5. Deviations to the Installation Security Program.
   5.1. General Guidelines
       5.1.1. Use AF Form116, Request for Deviation from Security Criteria, to document all
       deviations. Deficiencies within 10% of the standard and deficiencies the responsible
       activity can correct within 90 days do not require a deviation request. Consolidate
       multiple deviations caused by a single deficiency on AF Form 116.
20                                                           910AWI31-201 2 APRIL 2012


     5.1.2. The owner/user must prepare AF Form 116 and coordinate all AF Forms 116 with
     the Defense Force Commander. Deviations are approved by the installation commander
     and forwarded to AFRC/A7S for review. There are three types of requests:
        5.1.2.1. Temporary deviations (waivers) for 1 year. The approving authority may
        grant extensions after conducting a review.
        5.1.2.2. Permanent deviations (exceptions) for a 2 year period.
     5.1.3. Temporary deviations must contain compensatory measures. Compensatory
     measures compensate for the specific vulnerability created by the deficiency.
     Compensatory measures include;
        5.1.3.1. Additional protective forces.
        5.1.3.2. Procedures
        5.1.3.3. Facilities
