       (Col Harry F. Laws II)                                               (Lt Gen Alexander M. Sloan)
                                                                                                  Pages: 8
                                                                                           Distribution: F

1. The Air Force depends on its Medical Service to help maintain a fit and vital force, save life and limb,
prevent undue suffering, and preserve military strength during contingencies. As much as possible, the
Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) must also care for authorized beneficiaries who are not on active duty.
This directive outlines policies needed to carry out these responsibilities.

2. The AFMS will use resources efficiently while making sure people get appropriate health care--from
the right source and for the proper amount of time. The Air Force will also use these resources to pro-
mote health and a healthy environment, and to support the goals and objectives of the AFMS.

3. In delivering health care, the AFMS will meet or exceed Federal or state requirements and industry
standards.

4. The AFMS will make sure military medical units are ready to respond to contingencies.

5. The organizational structure and environment within the AFMS will promote personal development
and career satisfaction for its personnel.

6. Following are established responsibilities and authorities:
   6.1. The Office of the Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG) provides policies governing health
   care, delivery of health services, and medical readiness. HQ USAF/SG determines and validates
   resource requirements, and allocates resources to complete AFMS missions. HQ USAF/SG also
   ensures AFMS’s readiness, evaluates resource use and policy, and offers the Air Force’s medical views
   on policies or    legislation to the Department of Defense (DoD).
   6.2. Major command (MAJCOM) surgeons allocate resources to military treatment facilities (MTF)
   to make sure personnel are organized, trained, and equipped for peace and war. MAJCOM surgeons
   guide and monitor the MTFs to obtain the best health care possible with available resources. They
   also help collect and report data to higher headquarters.

    6.3. MTF commanders are responsible for all MTF resources and collections. They identify needs
    and manage resources to care for eligible people under priorities prescribed by law. Through the
    MAJCOM surgeons, they also identify unresourced patient needs and priorities to HQ USAF/SG.
    They make sure medical personnel are trained and other resources are available for contingencies in
    peace and war.
    6.4. HQ USAF/REM and NGB/SG develop and maintain standards for medical readiness within their
    respective components.

7. This policy applies to HQ USAF/SG, MAJCOM surgeons’ offices, Air Force MTFs, and the Air
Reserve’s medical components.

8. See Attachment 1 for measures of compliance to this policy.

9. See Attachment 2 for a listing of terminology.

10. See Attachment 3 for a listing of related directives and instructions.

                                         Surgeon General
 15 APRIL 1994                                                                                        3

                   Attachment 1MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY


A1.1. HQ USAF/SG will measure success in making efficient use of medical resources by evaluating
efficiency as measured by the Cost Per Medical Work Unit (MWU) and the overall rate of expenditure
growth through the use of Expenditure Targets. Also, the overall health of personnel will be measured by
the noneffectiveness rate.
   A1.1.1. The Air Force can collect information on the Cost Per MWU (attachment 1) from the Medi-
   cal Expense and Performance Reporting System, Retrospective Case Mix Analysis System
   (RCMAS), and the Operating Budget Ledger (OBL). Specifically, financial obligation information
   will be derived from Program Element Code (PEC)        87792 (Station Hospitals and Clinics) and PEC
   87711 (Medical Centers) of the OBL. The Cost Per MWU using PECs 87792 and 87711 reflect those
   costs most closely associated with the delivery of health care. The Air Force will measure Cost Per
   MWU as a ratio of costs to MWUs generated.
   A1.1.2. To determine the health status of the forces on active duty, HQ USAF/SG can use the RCS:
   HAF-SG(M)7118, Report of Patients, which shows the number of bed days per 1,000 active duty
   members. It will display this noneffectiveness rate as monthly lost days per 1,000 active duty mem-
   bers. The goal is a downward trend, which reflects fewer noneffective days lost to hospitalization
   Attachment 2.
   A1.1.3. After the Air Force has established Expenditure Targets (ET) or spendline Attachment 3,
   obligation information can be collected from the CHAMPUS Catchment Area Billing Report and the
   Operating Budget Ledger (OBL). The ET will involve establishment of a predetermined budget
   (combination Direct Care and CHAMPUS dollars) for the health services provided to a defined popu-
   lation (eligible beneficiaries as derived from the Defense Medical Information System (DMIS) for a
   given time period (fiscal year). The Air Force will measure a percentage deviation (plus or minus)
   from the established targets.

Case Mix Index (CMI).—The sum of all the case weight (CW) divided by the number of patients. This
number is the average CW for all patients and reflects the average relative resource consumption per
patient. This is a numeric way to calculate the complexity and level of resource intensity of the care
delivered.
Case Weight (CW).—An adjustment to the diagnostic related group (DRG) relative weight to account
for individual patient differences within the same DRG. Differences could be a prolonged length of stay
or a transfer in or out of a facility. For example, an uncomplicated DRG 9, Spinal Disorders and Injuries,
has a CW of 3.2092, but a prolonged complicated DRG 9 might have a CW of 15.1824 or higher.
Diagnostic Related Group (DRG).—A set of related diseases and disorders of the body. There are over
500 DRGs that encompass all diagnostic categories and diagnoses.
Diagnostic Relative Weight.—Based on historical cost data, each diagnostic related group (DRG) is
assigned a numeric value that reflects the relative resource consumption for that DRG.
Dollars/Relative Case Mix Index.—This ratio provides the cost of the overall patient load adjusted for
the average complexity of care needed. Improvements, such as more efficient use of money for the same
complexity of cases, or for providing care to more complex cases with the same amount of money, are
reflected in a downward trend.
Relative Case Mix Index (RCMI).— Changes in current medical practice may dictate change in
diagnostic related group (DRG) weights. DRG weights are periodically adjusted to reflect these changes,
limiting the ability to compare case mix indexes (CMI) over time. DoD Health Affairs provides an
adjustment factor that statistically corrects each adjustment back to a base year, thus allowing comparison
over time. The RCMI is the CMI divided by this adjustment factor.
