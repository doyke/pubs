PART I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training
document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and
minimum core task requirements for the Diet Therapy specialty. The CFETP provides supervisors,
trainers, and trainees a clear career path. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part
II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and control training
within the career field.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains
how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. Section C associates each level with specialty
qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other). Section D indicates resource constraints
(Examples: funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities). Section E identifies transition training guide
requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and
includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command
(AETC) conducted training, core tasks, and correspondence course requirements. Section B contains
the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfy
training requirements. Section C identifies a training course index. Supervisors can use to determine
resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. Section
D identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional
training required for the associated qualification needs. Section E provides guidelines for managing and
documenting enlisted training (medical specific). Section F provides guidelines and examples of proper
documentation of all enlisted medical personnel training.

3. Guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan will enable us to train today’s work
force for tomorrow's jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and
conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM Functional
Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop,
manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. This plan outlines the training
that individuals in the 4D0X1 specialty should receive in order to develop and progress
throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and
proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFSC specific training an individual receives
upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.
Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.

1.1. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and
correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.
Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an
Airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the
upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge
required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.
Proficiency training is additional training provided to personnel to increase their skills and
knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes, some
are:

1.1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
individual’s career.

1.1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty
and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

1.1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the
training delivery method.

1.1.4. Identifies major resource constraints, which impact full implementation of the desired
career field training process.

2. Uses. MFMs and supervisors at all levels will use the plan to ensure comprehensive and
cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and
exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of
the CFETP. AETC training personnel and MFMs will also work with the AFCFM to develop
acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable
courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC
must be identified for inclusion into plan.


                                                  8
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.
The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
training requirements. The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual
review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of
courses in Part II, AETC and MFMs will eliminate duplicate training.

mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training do his or her part to plan, develop, manage,
conduct, and evaluate an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP
will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate points in their careers. The following


                                                    11
narratives, and the AFSC 4D0X1 career field flowcharts, identify the training career path. The career
path defines the training required in an individual's career.

4.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Initial skill training in this specialty consists of the tasks and knowledge
training provided in the 3-skill level resident course located at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA)-Fort Sam
Houston, TX. Initial skills training requirements were identified during the 4D0X1 U&TW held 12
March 2014 at JBSA-Fort Sam Houston. The decision to train specific tasks and knowledge items in the
initial skills course is based on a review of the OAR data, training requirements analysis data, and
4D0X1 SME input. Task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the specialty training
standard Part II, Sections A and B. Individuals must complete the initial skills course to be awarded
AFSC 4D031.

4.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in this specialty consists of
completing (1) Core tasks and (2) CDC 4D051. Individuals must attend the Airman Leadership School
(ALS) prior to promotion to SSgt (E-5). Once upgraded to the 5-skill level, a journeyman will maintain
proficiency by completing all continuation training required or specified by command or local policies.
Individuals will use their CDCs (and other indicated training references) to prepare for testing and
promotion under the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). They should also consider
continuing their education toward a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.

4.3. Craftsman (7) Level. Upgrade training to the 7-skill level in this specialty consists of completing:
(1) Core tasks (2) CDC 4D071. A Diet Therapy craftsman can be expected to fill various supervisory
and management positions within Nutritional Medicine such as Noncommissioned Officer in Charge
(NCOIC) of the Nutritional Medicine or a particular section. In addition, they may develop work
schedules for subordinate personnel and ensure necessary manning levels are maintained at all time
during hours of Nutritional Medicine activity operation. Seven-levels should take courses or obtain
added knowledge on management of resources and personnel. Membership in Association of Nutrition
& Foodservice Professionals is highly encouraged and provides career enhancement and professional
development opportunities through completion of annual continuing education hours. Completion of the
Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA) Course 14, when applicable, and a CCAF degree
program is highly encouraged. In addition, when promoted to Technical Sergeant, individuals may be
selected to attend the Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA).

4.4. Superintendent (9) Level. To be awarded AFSC 4D091, an individual must be an E8, complete
requirements specified in Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). A 9-level can be
expected to fill positions such as Superintendent of Nutritional Medicine and various staff positions
within a medical group. Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel
management should be pursued through continuing education. Additional higher education and
completion of courses outside their career AFSC are also recommended.

5. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass
the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 4D0X1 career field. The spectrum includes a
strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and
affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.




                                                   12

PART II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC beginning in June
2015

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 this STS:

2.1. Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks,
knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-
skill level. Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1. Tasks identified in Column 2
identified with an (R) are RSVP training tasks for Active, Guard and Reserve personnel. Core tasks are
identified in Column 3 by a 5 or 7 depending on what level of upgrade training the Airman is in.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Columns 4 through 8 are used to record completion of tasks and
knowledge training requirements. Use the automated Air Force Training Record (AFTR) to document
technician qualifications.

2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Columns 9 through 11 show
the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the
task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. See
CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit-training manager for current CDC listings.

2.4. Qualitative Requirements. The proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and
knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

2.5. Documentation. Use the automated system to document all technician qualifications. NOTE:
An Air Force Job Qualification Standard may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon
approval of the AFCFM. The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as
needed or deemed necessary for their Career Field.

2.5.1. Transcribing a new or revised CFETP. The 4D0X1 CFM will provide transcription
instructions to the AFTR program manager and field users. This process will be seamless to the field
user as all existing trainee records will be auto-transcribed.

2.5.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available the supervisor identifies STS
training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that
trainees cover the mandatory items in the AFECD.

2.5.3. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task
previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor deletes the previous AFTR documented
certification. Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record
Continuation Sheet identifying the reason for decertification. Upon subsequent recertification,
document AFTR as for any other training qualification.



                                                  23
2.6. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and
correct use of procedures.

2.7. The CFETP serves as a guide for development of promotion tests used in the WAPS. Senior
Noncommissioned Officers (SNCO) with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop
Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) at the Airman Advancement Division. The tests sample knowledge
of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for
promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions
Reference and Requirements Catalog. Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, Air Force
Military Personnel Testing System.

3. Recommendations. Identify inadequacies and recommend changes to this training standard through
channels to 937 TRG/TTS, 2931 Harney Road, JBSA-Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 or use the Customer
Service Information Line, DSN 420-1080 or Commercial (210) 808-1080 to report your findings.

                                               41
Section E – Training Documentation

1. AFTR serves as the single, automated repository for all medical enlisted specialty training.
Consult the most current AFTR training message for detailed instructions regarding automated
training documentation requirements.

2. Master Training Plan (MTP) (Reference AFI 36-2201).

2.1. The MTP is a reference guide developed for each section that includes all facets of training for
individuals assigned. It is to be used as a reference source for the type of training and documentation
pertaining to each assigned member. The MTP is used to standardize training and to provide an
overview of the training process for the duty section. The MTP is also used as a means to reduce the
amount of paperwork previously required during the training process

2.2. The MTP is an overview of training for the duty section. It should include all documents
involved in the training process for the duty section. Training will vary from section to section and
person to person, but there are certain documents that will be a standard requirement for all MTPs. As
a minimum the training plan must include:

2.2.1. Master Task List.

2.2.2. CFETP.

2.2.3. Locally developed AF Form 797s, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS.

2.2.4. Milestones for tasks and CDC completion (Reference to AFI 36-2201).

3. To ensure all initial and on-going work center training meets required standards, each work center
will maintain a training binder (electronic or hard copy). This training binder will be utilized by
supervisors and trainers and will be set up in the following order:

3.1. Work center Description. This includes daily work center mission, responsibilities, and any age
range of patients cared for in this work center.

3.2. Work center training monitor appointment letter identifying primary, alternate and roles and
responsibilities.

3.3. Roster identifying work center trainer(s)

3.4. Job Description/performance standards for each work center duty position.

3.5. Current CFETP and associated change(s) as found on Air Force E-Publishing for each AFSC
assigned to the work center.

3.6. Copy of the master training plan, as found in AFTR, for each duty position that includes: STS,
797s, 1098s, 623II, 623III, and schedule.

3.7. Copies of all QTPs and/or ISD checklist(s) used during orientation and or location(s) of any
training plans/evaluation tools used to validate trainee qualifications.
                                                   42
3.8. Work center orientation checklist. In addition to minimum requirements stated in AFI 36-
2201, include milestones for each task identified.

3.9. AF Form 623a sample entry of supervisor initial evaluation of trainee qualification. Minimum
information required in statement can be found in AFI 36-2201.

3.10. AF Form 623a sample entry of annual job description/job performance standards review.




                                                 43
Section F - Documentation of Training.

1. Work Center Training Plans. The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples
of proper documentation for the many electronic forms used in training of all enlisted medical
personnel. Training documentation helps to assess readiness capability as well as individual strengths
and weaknesses. It also aids compliance with all The Joint Commission, Accreditation Association for
Ambulatory Health Care, and Health Services Inspections regulatory requirements. The enlisted
training documentation has migrated from the hard copy to electronic AFTR. AFTR is accessible
from the Advance Distance Learning Service via the Air Force Portal. Refer to your unit training
manager (UTM) for the most current policies and guidance on training documentation.

2. Air Force Training Record. The AFTR is an enterprise-wide custom training management
system designed to replace the paper-based training records system. It is the electronic equivalent of
an AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, and will be used by career fields within the
AFMS to document all training actions. The AFTR allows training plans to be established by; Career
Field/AFSC, duty position/team member, trainee/trainer/certifier, and any group of tasks that require
management, tracking, and documentation. The AFTR components managed by the supervisor are:

2.1. Master Task List (MTL). The MTL is a list containing all the tasks that are to be trained in a
work center and is often broken out by specialty. The MTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II
and III; AF Form 797 and AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training; and
Qualification Training Packages (QTPs). The supervisor creates the MTL by selecting tasks from the
Unit Task List produced by the UTM and the STS.

2.2. Master Training Plan (MTP). The MTP is a list containing a schedule of training for all tasks
within a particular duty position. The MTP consists of the STS; 623 Parts II and III; AF Force Forms
797 and 1098 tasks; and QTPs. The supervisor creates the MTP by assigning training times and
methods to tasks in the duty position. Refer to AFI 36-2201 and AFH 36-2235, Volume 11,
Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Unit Training, for guidance in
developing the MTP.

2.3. Duty Task List (DTL). The DTL is a list containing all the tasks to be trained on in a duty
position. The DTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Force Forms 797 and 1098
tasks; and QTPs. The supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL.

2.4. Individual Training Record (ITR). All training is documented in the ITR. This is the
electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder. The ITR is made up of the
AF Form 623 Parts I, II and III; AF Forms 623a, 797, 803 and 1098; QTPs and the JQS. This record
is automatically populated based upon the duty position the individual is assigned to. Refer to AFI 36-
2201 for guidance in documenting training on the various forms contained within the ITR.
Maintenance of the CFETP is mandatory for all assigned MSgts and below.

2.4.1. The AFTR provides the capability to incorporate training source documents and/or to manually
enter completed training into the ITR. The following documents will be incorporated into the ITR:

2.4.1.1. The member’s initial MTF and clinic orientation checklists.

2.4.1.2. Recurrent training such as Basic Life Support and Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act.
                                                  44
2.4.1.3. AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action.

2.4.1.4. Medical Education & Training Campus (METC) Student Training Report (STR). METC
STR documents the level of success, strengths, and weaknesses that a student demonstrated during
technical school. It is emailed to the base training manager shortly after the graduate arrives at his/her
duty station. This form is maintained in the record until 5-skill level upgrade training is complete.

2.4.1.5. AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluation. AF Form 803 is used to conduct and document
completion of task evaluations during training staff assisted visits, when directed by the commander,
or when a task certification requires validation.

2.4.1.6. Other forms as appropriate.

3. Documentation of Training. The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of
proper documentation on the many forms used in training medical materiel personnel. Training
documentation helps to assess mission capability and readiness, individual strengths and weaknesses,
resources needed to support quality patient care, and defines requirements for individual career
progression.

3.1. AF Form 797. The AF Form 797 (Figure 3.1) will be used to record training for tasks that are
not otherwise documented in the CFETP.




                                                    45
                        Figure 3.1. Sample, AF Form 797 Documentation

3.2. AF Form 1098 (Figure 3.2.). Mandatory training requirements may vary from facility to facility.
At a minimum, these requirements should be reviewed on an annual basis and updated as required.

3.3. Qualification Training Progress Records were developed to enhance OJT. It provides the trainer
with a breakdown of task performance skills to aid in performance evaluation. The evaluations of
each task results in either a satisfactory or unsatisfactory score (Figure 3.3).

3.4. AF Form 623a (Figures 3.4. thru 3.7.). Use the AF Form 623a available in the AFTR to
document all progress of individual training. Document on AF Form 623a the start and completion
dates of unit orientation, and reference the date of the orientation checklist. In addition, document the
member’s entry into upgrade training, initial evaluation results, and periodic evaluations of training
progress to include CDC progress. Information on extensions, waiver requests, or breaks in training
                                                    47
should be clearly documented. Document on the AF Form 623a any decertification proceedings,
including dates, reasons for decertification, and other applicable information. Accomplish an initial
evaluation when a new person arrives to the unit or when an individual changes duty positions.
Document all other actions pertaining to training IAW AFI-36-2201. NOTE: Templates for
documentation of orientation, initial upgrade training brief, upgrade training documentation, sample
job description review, and etcetera are housed in AFTR.
