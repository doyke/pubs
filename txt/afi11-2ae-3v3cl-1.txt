This checklist establishes procedures for Aeromedical Evacuation on mobility aircraft
employed by Mobility Air Forces (MAF) to accomplish their worldwide missions.
This checklist complements AFI 11-2AE-V3, Operations Procedures, and is printed
on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper, and trimmed to size, to fit the standard plastic
aircrew checklist binders. This checklist is intended to provide quick and reliable
references to aid the AEC while mission planning and for use in-flight. All AE
crews will carry this annex. Section IV and V will be carried as applicable to crew
position.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change
of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate chain of
command.
