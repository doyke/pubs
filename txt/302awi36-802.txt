SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes were made in paragraphs 2.1., 2.1.1.1. and 2.1.2.

1. Office of Primary Responsibility. The host base, 21 Space Wing (SW)/DPC is the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) for policy guidance regarding determination of overtime work and
timecard guidance for civilian employees of the 302 AW. The 302 AW/Financial Management
(FM) is the Office Primary Responsibility for timecard audits and any timecard related training.

2. Definitions.
2                                                     302AWI36-802 8 DECEMBER 2008

*2.1. Premium Pay: NSPS has limitations that govern the amount of premium pay that
employees receive. Categories of premium pay covered by these limitations include: Overtime
pay (except overtime pay earned by nonexempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act);
Compensatory time off (except compensatory time off for travel); Premium pay for regularly
scheduled standby duty (applies to certain firefighters and emergency medical technicians);
Availability pay for criminal investigators; Holiday pay, Night pay and Sunday pay. NSPS
biweekly cap on premium pay is the same as the General Schedule biweekly cap: both are the
biweekly salary for GS-15, step 10, including locality pay. Authorized management officials
may waive the biweekly limitation by applying the annual premium pay limitation if the
employee is performing work in connection with an emergency or its aftermath, or critical to the
mission. Annual premium pay limitation caps the sum of premium pay plus salary at no more
than the annual salary of GS-15, step 10, for the employee’s location.

2.1.1. Overtime.

*2.1.1.1. Regularly Scheduled. Regular overtime work means overtime work that is scheduled
prior to the beginning of an employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek. Under
NSPS the payable overtime rate is calculated from an employee’s adjusted salary (base salary +
local market supplement). Based on the pay band level to which the employee is assigned, the
overtime hourly rate is either the employee’s hourly adjusted rate of pay or the hourly adjusted
rate of pay multiplied by 1.5.

2.1.1.1.1. The employee’s adjusted rate of pay serves as the overtime hourly rate for:

2.1.1.1.1.1. Pay band 3 of the following schedules:

2.1.1.1.1.1.1. (YA) Professional and Analytical

2.1.1.1.1.1.2. (YD) Engineering and Scientific Professional

2.1.1.1.1.1.3. (YH) Medical Professional

2.1.1.1.1.1.4. (YK) Investigative and Analytical

2.1.1.1.1.2. Pay band 4

2.1.1.1.1.2.1. (YL) Fire Protection

2.1.1.1.1.3. Pay bands 2 and 3 of the Supervisor/Manager pay schedule

2.1.1.2. Irregular/Occasional. Irregular or occasional overtime work is overtime work that is not
part of an employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek.

*2.1.2. Compensatory Time: Eligible employees, including FWS employees, can have
compensatory time off from their scheduled tour of duty instead of payment for an equal amount
of time spent in irregular or occasional overtime work. Compensatory time worked must be
302AWI36-802      8 DECEMBER 2008                                                            3

approved in advance in writing by filling out Air Force Form 428, Request for Overtime,
Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time. Exempt GS employees may choose to earn
compensatory time in place of payment for an equal amount of time spent in occasional or
irregular overtime work. Compensatory time cannot be earned for holiday work. With
supervisory approval, employees whose religious beliefs require time off from work for
observances may work additional hours, either before or after the religious observance, to cover
the time. While Department policy is to grant employee requests to use religious compensatory
time, the request may be denied if the absence would interfere with mission accomplishment.
Religious compensatory hours worked do not create any entitlement to premium pay (such as
overtime pay). In addition, if an employee separates from federal service, payment cannot be
received for any unused religious compensatory time off. Employees who are required to travel
away from their official worksite with travel occurring outside the regular tour of duty are
eligible for compensatory time off. Compensatory time off applies to employees who are not
otherwise compensated for their time (e.g. employees who receive overtime pay for travel).
The following conditions apply:

2.1.2.1. Travel time is credited on an hour-for-hour basis, including the time employees actually
spend traveling and the usual waiting time that precedes or interrupts travel.

2.1.2.2. The time that employees spend at a temporary worksite between arrival and departure
(i.e., the period of temporary duty) is not considered.

2.1.2.3. If employees travel on a regular workday (typically Monday-Friday) directly between
their homes and a temporary worksite, then the normal home-to-work commuting time is
deducted from the creditable travel time. If the travel occurs on a day that is normally a day off,
home-to-work commuting time is creditable.

2.1.2.4. With certain exclusions, compensatory time off for travel must be used within 26 pay
periods after the pay period in which it is credited, or it is forfeited.

2.1.3. Credit hours: Not required to be documented on the AF Form 428. Credit hours should
be performed with the coordination of the supervisor and documented on the employee’s time
and attendance worksheet.

3. Responsibilities.

3.1. Wing Commander will:

3.1.1. Ensure local procedures are established to properly request and obtain approval for
overtime/compensatory time and to require self-inspections of premium-time usage (reference
AFI 36-802, chapter 3, paragraph 3.1.1.2 and Head Quarters (HQ) Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC)/Commander (CC) Memorandum dated 26 June1998).

3.1.2. Be the approving official for all paid overtime within the 302 AW and for compensatory
time for members of the 302 AW HQ Section staff and the 302 Aero medical Staging Squadron.
4                                                   302AWI36-802 8 DECEMBER 2008

3.1.3. During periods when the 302 AW/CC is away from home station due to temporary
duty/leave, the 302 AW/CC can delegate this approval authority to the designated representative
acting for the commander (Attachment 2).

3.2. Group Commanders will:

3.2.1. Ensure their units comply with required semiannual audits.

3.2.2. Appoint individuals to conduct audits of overtime and compensatory time usage, one
internal, and the other external. Because of familiarity with work schedules common to a group,
a unit within the same group will normally conduct the external audits. Units may also utilize
Staff Assistance Visits or similar inspections from outside agencies to meet this audit
requirement.

3.2.3. Review a summary of Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) reports: P6602R04,
Overtime/Compensatory time review; P6602R05, Overtime/Compensatory Time Usage
Report; and P6605R01, Control of Hours Report, to identify trends in overtime/compensatory
time and note any discrepancies in hours worked versus hours paid. These reports will also
identify when the compensatory time must be used. Exempt employees must use their
compensatory time by the end of the 26th pay period after it was earned or they will forfeit the
earned compensatory time. Nonexempt employees must use their compensatory time by the end
of the 26th pay period after it was earned or the employee shall be paid for the worked
compensatory time at the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime rate in effect at the time it
was worked.

3.2.4. Be the approving official for all compensatory time within their respective groups.

3.3. Supervisors will:

3.3.1. Ensure overtime work of civilian employees is held to the minimum consistent with
essential operations and emergency peak workload of a temporary nature.

3.3.2. Utilizing the AF Form 428, request approval prior to permitting any
overtime/compensatory work to be performed by any subordinate employees (Attachment 2).

3.3.3. Request telephonic approval for any emergency overtime/compensatory time and ensure
the AF Form 428 is forwarded for approval by the next business day (Attachment 2).

3.3.4. Ensure specific detailed justification, to include the hours expected to be worked, is
included on the AF Form 428 for overtime/compensatory time requested. Requests for
compensatory/overtime for six (6) hours or more must show a minimum of a 30-minute lunch
hour on the AF Form 428 (Attachment 2).

3.3.5. Ensure any changes that exceed the number of hours requested on the original AF Form
428 are annotated and forwarded to the appropriate approving official and financial services for
recertification/revalidation by the next business day.
302AWI36-802       8 DECEMBER 2008                                                         5



3.3.6. Forward the AF Form 428 through the appropriate supervisory chain and to Finance for
funds certification prior to forwarding to the appropriate approving official for signature
(Attachment 2).

3.4. Financial Services will:

3.4.1. Conduct audits quarterly and forward any findings reported to the 302 AW/CC and
appropriate Group Commander.

3.4.2. Develop and implement self-inspection checklist to audit premium pay, compensatory
time, and overtime.

3.4.3. Assist wing auditors in performing annual reconciliation on premium-time approved on
overtime requests and timecards, and provide Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Master
Military Pay Account Calendar.

3.4.4. Provide training on the AF Form 428 to ensure the form is approved by appropriate
personnel, fully justified, and filled-out correctly.

3.4.5. Serve as the certifying official for funds availability on all AF Form 428’s.

3.4.6. Provide units with leave availability reports on a bi-weekly basic.

3.5. Wing Timekeepers will:

3.5.1. Verify that the approved AF Form 428 and the time and attendance worksheet agree prior
to entering premium pay, overtime and compensatory time hours into the DCPS reports.

3.5.2. Maintain attendance records and other supporting documents and ensure these records are
kept available for audit, or for six (6) years, whichever occurs first.

4. Adopted Forms: AF From 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, AF Form 428,
Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time.
