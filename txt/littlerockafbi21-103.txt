1. General Responsibilities.
     1.1. Operations, Maintenance, Mission Support Group supervision will:
        1.1.1. Ensure flight line, support, and in-shop personnel are thoroughly briefed on
        requirements and responsibilities in the event of a severe weather watch or warning.
        1.1.2. Ensure all actions required to secure aircraft and Aerospace Ground Equipment
        (AGE) in accordance with the predicted weather severity are accomplished.
        1.1.3. Be prepared to initiate recall actions to ensure required personnel are available to
        effectively evacuate aircraft, save lives and protect government property as directed by
        the wing commander or Crisis Action Team (CAT).
     1.2. Squadron production superintendents and flight line/in-shop supervisors will:
        1.2.1. Take every opportunity to ensure safety of Air Force property and personnel.
        1.2.2. During weather watches and warnings, ensure aircraft not being worked are
        moored, flaps raised, doors, windows and hatches are closed, and fire bottles are secured.
        When aircraft are being worked, fire extinguishers will be properly positioned and not
        secured.
        1.2.3. Ensure all unnecessary equipment/AGE is moved outside the circle of safety, to
        await transportation off the line. As soon as mission permits, all unnecessary
        equipment/AGE will be removed from the flight line to designated storage locations and
        all brake/locking devices engaged. If this cannot be accomplished, the equipment will be
        towed to an area away from the flight line and secured by the best means possible. Power
        units left on the flight line will be rolled up and moved outside the circle of safety. The
        flight line will be cleared of all unnecessary equipment/AGE and fire bottles will be
        chained down under the wing prior to releasing personnel for the weekend regardless of
        weather conditions.
        1.2.4. Production and shop superintendents have the authority to shut down work and
        close their portion of the flight line if, in their opinion, personnel are in immediate danger
        and cannot safely complete assigned work and secure aircraft. The key is "be prepared.‚Äù
        Storms can move in with little or no warning!
        1.2.5. Ensure aircraft not on the weekly flying schedule or undergoing maintenance,
        requiring aircraft to be unmoored, are moored in accordance with technical orders
        according to the predicted weather severity. As a minimum, weekly fliers will have nose
        chains installed until crew show. All aircraft will be fully moored prior to releasing
        personnel for the weekend regardless of weather conditions.
        1.2.6. Production superintendents and expediters will plan for the immediate ground
        handling requirements of aircraft not fully parked on assigned spots once lightning is
        beyond a 5 nautical mile radius and or winds are below prescribed limits.
     1.3. The respective Maintenance Operation Center (MOC) controller will, upon the receipt
     of any weather watch advisory or warning for lightning, thunderstorm, wind, or freezing
     precipitation, notify the following:
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-103 26 AUGUST 2013                                                            3

Watch and/or Warning.
   2.1. Everyone will:
      2.1.1. When frost, ice, snow, precipitation, high winds or other severe weather watches
      are evident or in effect, supervisors must constantly weigh the hazards inherent in
      performing aircraft maintenance against the necessity to perform or continue the task(s)
      at hand. Operations activities may continue during a weather watch; however, all
      personnel must implement lightning, thunderstorms, or freezing precipitation procedures
      without delay when required. If operational needs or priorities arise, production
      supervisors will evaluate the situation and direct the use of elevated platforms, work
      stands, or other appropriate equipment to accomplish the task.
      2.1.2. Be aware of, and adhere to, specific weather restrictions in applicable technical
      orders, check lists, job guides, operating instructions, and AFI 91-203, Air Force
      Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction.
      2.1.3. Be alert for rapidly changing conditions, thunder, or unreported lightning.
   2.2. Winds at or above 31 knots:
      2.2.1. Comply with procedures listed in paragraph 2.1.
      2.2.2. No maintenance will be performed on top of the aircraft when winds are above 35
      knots. Use of stands will be limited to mission-essential requirements only.
      2.2.3. All loose equipment around facilities will be anchored, secured or placed in the
      building includes: trash receptacles, butt cans, barbeques, etc.
      2.2.4. Keep hangar and building doors closed to the maximum extent possible.
      2.2.5. Anchor all Non-Powered AGE (NPA) to tie-down cables and lock all serviceable
      wheels. NPA that cannot be readily tied-down will have wheels locked and jack-pads
      lowered. If this cannot be accomplished, the equipment must be towed to an area away
      from the flight line and secured by the best means possible.
      2.2.6. Vehicles with towing capabilities will be used to remove all unused support
      equipment from the flight line.
      2.2.7. All shops will comply with specific requirements in applicable technical orders or
      operating instructions.
      2.2.8. Completely moor all aircraft, to include raising flaps, and close APU and landing
      gear doors. If an aircraft is scheduled to fly, it will remain moored up to 1 hour prior to
      crew show, then as a minimum, a nose chain will remain in place until the crew shows.

       prevent this.
    2.5. Lightning warning.
       2.5.1. Complete paragraphs 2.1.-2.1.3.
       2.5.2. No flight line maintenance, aircraft servicing or fuel cell in-tank maintenance will
       be performed when lightning is within 5 nautical miles. All other in-shop activities may
       continue unless prohibited by specific directives. Production Supers can close down
       flight line operations if lightning is observed, but not called within 5 nautical miles by the
       MOC.
       2.5.3. Maintenance personnel will not leave their vehicle to chock or ground the aircraft
       until lightning is reported outside a 5 nautical mile radius by MOC.
       2.5.4. If caught on the flight line during a lightning storm, remain in the aircraft until all
       clear or transportation arrives. Do not walk across the flight line. Wait for
       transportation.
       2.5.5. No maintenance of any kind will be performed on aircraft in hangars 222N/S, 245,
       255N/S, or 280 due to the grounding danger to personnel if the exposed empennage was
       struck by lightning.

     on sealed spares, unless a maintenance condition exists.
     2.7.3. Walkways around buildings and work areas will be clear of snow or ice
     accumulation.
  2.8. Transient Alert (TA) section responsibilities.
     2.8.1. For the Transient Alert section, aircraft moor/mooring is defined as: securing
     aircraft nose landing gear and wings or main landing gears and tail section if applicable
     with aircraft cargo chains and devices or straps unless coordinated and approved different
     by the Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE).
         2.8.1.1. Transient Alert will determine what mooring equipment will be used for
         aircraft when specific airframe technical orders are not on-site, and when specific
         airframe technical orders are on on-site but the correct mooring equipment is not. The
         QAE may at any time disapprove mooring equipment used and request the use of
         another type, example; chains and devices versus straps.
     2.8.2. Moor or hangar transient aircraft and remove AGE and secure fire extinguishers
     when requested and determined by the QAE that the potential for moderate to severe
     weather conditions are probable during TA non-duty hours.
