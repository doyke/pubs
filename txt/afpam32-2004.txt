This pamphlet provides planners guidance for contingency response operations lasting a
maximum of 120 days. Planners use this guidance to determine the minimum number of Fire
Emergency Services (FES) aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) manpower and vehicles
necessary to provide fire suppression for Air Force (AF) aircraft during major exercises and real
world contingencies. These operations may include exercises for training purposes, disaster
response, humanitarian relief operations, or other non-combat type operations. Determining
requirements is based on the type and size of aircraft being protected. For the purposes of this
document, applicable AF ARFF vehicle sets and requirements are found in Allowance Standard
(AS) 010, Vehicle Fleet (Registered) All MAJCOM Common, and are based on National Fire
Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 403, Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Services at
Airports, and AF NFPA 403, Technical Implementation Guide. These sets are used as a baseline
and modified to meet exercise and contingency requirements. The capabilities outlined in this
pamphlet provide ARFF fire suppression and limited rescue capability, but do not include
structural fire protection or other emergency response capabilities. This guidance applies to all
AF Active, Reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG) Civil Engineer (CE) units. Ensure that all
records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
addresses changes contained in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services
(FES) Program and provides consistency with WMP 1.
1. Scope. This pamphlet provides guidance for operations lasting a maximum of 120 days and
is used for small scale operations. It does not apply to long term ongoing operations or wars.
FES guidance for those requirements is found in AFI 32-2001 and WMP 1, CE Supplement,
Appendix 5.
2. Responsibility. The aircraft user provides ARFF capability at locations other than
established AF installations. If the aircraft user cannot provide the minimum ARFF capability
listed in Table 1, the user should request support through Air and Space Expeditionary Force
Operations or the aircraft provider’s Major Command (MAJCOM) Director of Operations (DO).
In this case the user may also be responsible for providing funding.
3. Risk Management (RM). Fire fighting capability is dependent on three primary resources:
fire fighting vehicles, agent, and personnel. The assumption is that only one major fire incident
will occur at a time. This document approaches RM from a perspective of requiring the local
risk managers to determine the acceptable levels of risk based on local risk factors. Generally,
local risk factors include historical fire experience (if available) and the type and duration of the
operation. Refer to Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 90-803, Risk Management Guidelines and
Tools, for guidance on conducting a risk assessment.
     3.1. The maximum length of time this document covers is 120 days in any one-year period.
     For operations that exceed 120 days, arrangements must be made for permanent FES
     capability as prescribed in AFI 32-2001 (permanent installations) or WMP 1 (deployed
     locations).
     3.2. In principle, the shorter the exposure time, the lower the risk. Theoretically, operations
     of very short duration present lower risk than operations approaching 120 days. This
     exposure time should be a factor when determining the FES resources required.
     3.3. ARFF capability is dependent on vehicles, agent and personnel available to conduct
     operations at an incident scene. Capability for each primary resource (vehicles, agent and
     personnel) is described as Optimum Level of Service (OLS), Reduced Level of Service
     (RLS), Critical Level of Service (CLS) or Inadequate Level of Service (ILS). Overall FES
     capability is the lowest level of service available for either resource. For example, when
     agent is OLS and personnel are CLS, the overall capability is CLS.
     3.4. The fundamental purpose of fire fighting operations is to save lives and property.
     Therefore, the resources necessary to deliver the various levels of service are calculated
     based on scenarios that may be encountered. OLS is the highest level of service providing
     the capability to perform rescue from a large fire (exterior and interior) involving an aircraft.
     Resources are provided to knockdown, extinguish or control the exterior fire and fight
     interior fires enabling rescue to be performed. OLS provides the highest probability of
AFPAM32-2004 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    3


   success. Conversely, if CLS is provided fire crews would not be expected to perform rescue
   from a large fire scenario. They may be successful in extinguishing a small fire on one
   side/one location or perform rescue from a fighter-type aircraft. However, these operations
   would have to be prioritized since they would not have capability to perform these operations
   simultaneously.
   3.5. Saving lives is the primary objective. The probability of saving property diminishes as
   the fire grows. Fire crews focus on early intervention so they can intervene in time to avoid
   major damage. When early intervention does not occur it is not always possible to save
   property.
4. Planning Guidance. Local risk managers determine the quantity of agent required based on
the risk assessment discussed in paragraph 3 above. The quantities discussed in this document
may be less than that available at a permanent installation due to the short exposure time (less
than 120 days).
   4.1. The amount of agent required is based on the type and size of aircraft. Aircraft are
   grouped into 6―ARFF Vehicle Sets described in Table 1. Fire fighting agent is delivered by
   ARFF vehicles with capacities of 500, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000 or 3,300 gallons. Table 1
   indicates the quantity of agent required for various levels of service. Ideally the quantity of
   agent required to provide OLS should be provided; however, for short-duration operations
   RLS or CLS may be provided with the appropriate notices to Airmen and waivers.
       4.1.1. The Fire Chief or Senior Fire Officer (SFO) should discuss the risk associated with
       each level of service with the Commander and ensure the risk they are accepting is fully
       understood.
       4.1.2. OLS is when all authorized resources are available for emergency response within
       response time standards. OLS provides sufficient capability for quick response and
       sustained operations after arrival on scene. During OLS, emergency response forces shall
       accomplish all objectives when responding to emergency incidents.
       4.1.3. RLS is when the Emergency Response Capability (ERC) is less than OLS but
       greater than CLS. Sufficient capability is provided for initial response, scene assessment
       and implementation of mitigation tactics. This level of service represents increased
       risk/loss potential due to lack of ERC to perform rescue and sufficient mitigation tactics
       simultaneously. FES objectives may not be successful during situations where
       simultaneous rescue and fire fighting activities are required.
       4.1.4. CLS capability exists when 7 firefighters are available to respond to an emergency
       within the response time standards. Upon arrival, the Incident Commander will determine
       the appropriate actions to be taken depending upon their initial evaluation of the situation.
       Successful outcomes can only be expected when the incident can be quickly mitigated.
       Firefighters are expected to revert to defensive operations when the emergency cannot be
       quickly contained. This level of service represents limited rescue capability and increased
       risk/loss potential due to limited resources. Due to exhaustion and resource limitations,
       CLS is considered a “one shot” capability that cannot be sustained for more than
       approximately 15 minutes.
 4                                                                                          AFPAM32-2004 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


             4.1.5. ILS capability represents an amount of agent less than CLS and the property
             involved in fire is expected to be destroyed. Except at fires in the incipient stage, entry
             for fire fighting purposes is not permitted.
     4.2. Regardless of available manpower, CLS agent in Table 1 represents increased risk to
     aircrews and reduces the probability that the fire can be extinguished. The RLS column is a
     safer alternative and provides increased capability. CLS is the minimum level of agent
     acceptable and should be limited to very short duration operations. This level of protection is
     necessary before operations begin.
     4.3. See Attachment 2 for actual Department of Defense (DoD) Aircraft Quantity (Q)1, Q2,
     and Q3 Factor Calculations. Actual Q Factor Calculations should also be considered when
     developing RM plans or making risk-based decisions. For more information regarding RM
     see AFI 32-2001.

     4.4. FES planners should select the largest vehicles available to minimize the number of
     drivers required to operate them.
     4.5. Recommend 6 firefighters per operational period with two P-19s or Rapid Intervention
     Vehicle (RIV)s for contingency airfields supporting Category 1 Remotely Piloted Aircraft
     (RPA) operations. The absence of a rescue requirement warrants the reduced capability.
AFPAM32-2004 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                5


   4.6. Installation or deployed Commander, Air Force Forces should consult with the
   MAJCOM or Area of Responsibility (AOR) Fire Chief to establish capabilities for operations
   not addressed in this document.
   4.7. A minimum of two ARFF vehicles are recommended for all locations in case of vehicle
   failure.
   4.8. Required agent may be provided in water tankers so long as at least one ARFF vehicle
   with turret capability is also provided.
   4.9. When operating at locations with multiple types of aircraft the largest aircraft
   determines the ARFF requirement.
   4.10. When the required fire fighting capability is temporarily not available due to
   unavoidable circumstances for periods more than 72 hours, the Fire Chief will develop a RM
   plan and provide it to the responsible Commander for their review and approval.
5. Personnel Requirements. The previous paragraphs discussed the fire fighting agent
required. This section addresses the manpower necessary to accomplish tasks in order to achieve
OLS, RLS and CLS.
   5.1. Note: The personnel numbers listed in Table 1 would constitute firefighters working 24
   hours a day/7 days a week. If flying operations increase, personnel numbers listed in Table 1
   may need to be increased. The Fire Chief or SFO will determine how firefighters will be
   utilized.
   5.2. If structural fire protection is required, consult with the AOR or MAJCOM Fire Chief to
   provide appropriate structural fire protection requirements. This can be provided by adding
   structural fire fighting vehicle(s). Cross-manning (staffing) should be used to minimize the
   need for additional personnel.
6. Exceptions. The responsible commander may exclude fire protection for infrequent flying
operations including:
   6.1. USAF Vehicle Sets 1 through 3: Not more than four takeoffs and four landings within
   seven consecutive days.
   6.2. USAF Vehicle Sets 4 through 6: Not more than two takeoffs and two landings within
   seven consecutive days.
   6.3. AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations, requires a minimum of one AF P-19 or
   equivalent and manpower for locations where aircraft carrying special weapons are operated,
   loaded or unloaded. This is required regardless of the number of takeoffs and landings
   occurring.
7. Waivers. When protection capability is at or below CLS, the airlift provider MAJCOM/DO
or ANG/DO must grant waivers for operations. For exercises and contingency operations, the
Director of Mobility Forces and the Joint Force Air Component Commander must waive ARFF
requirements. When time does not permit formal (written) waiver action, the MAJCOM/DO
(waiver authority) files an after-action summary. The MAJCOM/DO provides information
copies of all waivers to the MAJCOM Fire Protection Office. A waiver shall include:
   7.1. Date(s) and type of operations.

     7.2. Type aircraft involved.
     7.3. Description of available ARFF assets to include dedicated manpower, amount of fire
     fighting agent available, and number of ARFF vehicles.
     7.4. Mission Impact Statement. A mission impact statement must accompany all waiver
     requests.
NOTE: No waiver is required for the first aircraft in and the last aircraft out carrying ARFF
equipment.

Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) Vehicle— A vehicle intended to transport personnel
and equipment to the scene of an aircraft emergency for the purpose of rescuing occupants and
conducting rescue and fire fighting operations. ARFF vehicles are equipped with at least one
external turret that enables rapid agent application without exposing personnel.
Critical Level of Service (CLS)— The absolute minimum level of FES capability available at a
given time. This level of service is only acceptable for short durations and should not be
diminished.
