                 DOD PROGRAM FOR STABILITY
               OF CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES MESSAGE
                                             Since the mid-1960s, the DoD has operated the
                                             most effective outplacement program in the Federal
                                             service. This outplacement service is the DoD
                                             Priority Placement Program. This program came
                                             into being when a significant number of military
                                             bases were being closed. Every Secretary of
                                             Defense since has endorsed this program as an
                                             effective tool to address adverse impact to DoD
                                             employees who are subjected to a reduction-in-
                                             force (RIF).

                                             The downsizing of DoD and the Air Force and
                                             the challenges of competitive sourcing and
                                             privatization reflect on-going efforts to incorporate
                                             efficiencies into our business processes and
                                             personnel management. In that regard, I fully
                                             support the placement of civilian employees under
                                             the employment protections of this program when
                                             conditions warrant.
Supervisors are required to comply with both the spirit and intent of the policy and procedures of
the DoD Priority Placement Program when filling civilian positions.
