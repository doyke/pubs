This instruction implements AFPD 36-7, Employee and Labor-Management Relation . It        s confirms the
statutory conclusion that collective bargaining with duly-recognized labor organizations is in the public
interest. This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and members.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision aligns the instruction with AFPD 36-7 and replaces AFR 40-711/AFMC Supplement 1.

1. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) meets at reasonable times to consult and bargain in good faith
with the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Council 214 and the National Office of
the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) as exclusive representatives for certain AFMC
employees as previously determined by appropriate authority.

2. In the course of bargaining with respect to conditions of employment, AFMC and AFGE Council 214
or the IAFF may agree to the development and use of certain forms for purposes of facilitating compli-
ance with the terms of such agreements. To that end, this instruction authorizes the publication, use, and
maintenance of the following forms which resulted from bargaining heretofore with the above cited labor
organizations: AFMC Form 192, Exchange of Kelly Days, which is used by IAFF units to record Kelly
Days/Time; AFMC Form 196, IAFF Standard Grievance Form, which is used by IAFF units to record
grievance information; AFMC Form 913, Standard Grievance Record, which is used by AFGE field
units to record grievance information; and AFMC Form 949, Union/Employee Official Time Permit,
which is used by field units to record union/employee use of official time.
