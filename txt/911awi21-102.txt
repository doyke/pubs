Supersedes 911AWI21-102, 11 September 2003                                                    Pages: 5

This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Maintenance Management of Aircraft. It estab-
lishes procedures for the Dropped Object Prevention Program (DOPP). It is applicable to all personnel
assigned to the 911 Airlift Wing to ensure dropped objects are reported and identified.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Paragraphs 2.1., 2.4., 3.1., 4.1., and 6., were rewritten. A (|) indicates revisions from the previous edition.


1. Terms Explained: A dropped object is any aircraft component, cowling, door, and panel, part, surface
or other items lost or inadvertently released during aircrew operations from the beginning of engine start
through flight to engine shutdown and recovery.

2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. MXG/CC will appoint the Dropped Object Prevention Program Monitor (DOPP monitor); an
   individual assigned to MXQ (Maintenance Quality Assurance). That individual will be assigned to
   report/coordinate Dropped Object investigations. Each dropped object must be thoroughly investi-
   gated by the unit MXQ as soon as the loss is discovered/reported. Every effort must be taken to deter-
   mine the root cause for the loss so trend analysis can be performed and permanent corrective action
   can be taken. The goal is to make every possible effort to identify root cause. Dropped object inci-
   dents resulting from maintenance malpractice are referred to the applicable GP/CC for action. Ensure
   a Product Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR) is submitted (if applicable).
   2.2. Ensure that if an object has fallen at home-station the Command Post Center is notified immedi-
   ately. If it occurs while off station, the Command Post Center nearest the arrival destination will be
   notified immediately and the home-station command post center will be notified secondly.
2                                                                         911AWI21-102 3 APRIL 2005


    2.3. It is the responsibility of all to immediately report objects that have inadvertently fallen from an
    aircraft. Aircrew and/or maintenance personnel who observed or discover that an object has been
    dropped from an aircraft will make appropriate entries in the Aircraft 781 Form, Maintenance Dis-
    crepancy and Work Document (immediately upon landing). Reporting process is implemented imme-
    diately starting with the Aircrew, Debriefer and/or Crew Chief, Expediter, Maintenance Operations
    Center (MOC), Command Post (if not notified earlier), Maintenance Quality Assurance (MXQ),
    Safety, OG, OGV, and the Airfield Manager.
    2.4. An impoundment may be warranted when an item has been dropped from an aircraft. Refer to
    911 LGOI 91-204 on Impoundment Procedures and AFI 21-101.

3. Prevention Procedures:
    3.1. Ensure the Aircraft 781 forms are documented prior to removal and/or installation of aircraft
    components per TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Poli-
    cies, and Procedures.
    3.2. Individuals must ensure aircraft parts fit properly. Check serviceability of the hardware (i.e. nut
    plates or attaching devices). Also, ensure all panels, doors and cowlings are fastened upon completion
    of a task.
    3.3. Special attention must be given to last minute maintenance actions.

4. MXQ Reporting Procedures.
    4.1. Report to MAJCOM and NAF/LGMA Weapon System Manager immediately by telephone or
    e-mail whenever it occurs. Also, notify the Unit Safety Office.
    4.2. A formal report must be sent to MAJCOM/LGMA and NAF/LGMA no later than *three duty
    days after the incident.
    4.3. Maintain the Dropped Object Reports for 2 years.

5. Report Format. See Attachment 1 Dropped Object Format Report Worksheet report formatting.

6. Command Post Reporting Procedures. The Command Post will report per AFI 10-207, Command
Post, AFRCI 10-203, United States Air Force Reserve Command and Control and AFMAN 10-206,
Operational Reporting. Command Post reports will be prepared and submitted (when required).

7. Safety Reporting Procedures. The 911th AW Safety Office will submit a report (when required).

8. Training Requirements. Supervisors will ensure maintenance personnel are trained properly within
their areas of responsibility and knowledgeable of command and unit requirements to prevent in-flight
occurrence. Ensure they are made aware of all the references available and how to locate them. Also,
ensure individuals are trained and understand the importance of proper documentation of the Aircraft 781
Forms.

9. Transient Aircraft Requirements. The local unit will be responsible to investigate a dropped object
from a transient aircraft. The local unit will then provide the home station with sufficient data to generate
a report.
