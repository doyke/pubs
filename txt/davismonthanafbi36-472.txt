1. Community and Airman Partnership Program. The Davis-Monthan Air Force Base
(DMAFB) Community and Airmen Partnering (CAMP) Program encourages retired and prior
military officers, noncommissioned officers, Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, and
community civilian families to become sponsors to DMAFB Airmen. The CAMP Program goals
are to grow Airmen as individuals by pairing them with positive adult role models, to improve
Airman Resiliency by providing them with a home away from home, and to increase community
relationships. Sponsors should develop an individual, yet professional, relationship and bond
with their Airmen as it is an essential piece for program success. This relationship and bond will
provide participants the opportunity to benefit from counseling and advice on the aspects of
being a productive individual in the military and in civilian life. The program will give first
