Safety Investigations and Reports, provides additional guidance for investigating and reporting
nuclear, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, and directed energy mishaps. AFMAN
91-222, Space Safety Investigations and Reports, provides additional guidance for investigating
and reporting space mishaps. AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports,
provides additional guidance for investigating and reporting aviation mishaps. AFMAN 91-224,
Ground Safety Investigations and Reports, provides additional guidance for investigating and
reporting afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty military, and ground and industrial mishaps. AFI 91-
204 implements AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs, and DODI 6055.07, Accident Investigation,
Reporting and Record Keeping. AFI 91-204 applies to commanders, managers, supervisors, and

                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose of Safety Investigations and Reports.
1.1. (AFMC)See AFMCI 90-103, Incident Investigations and Reports, for details and
additional information regarding jurisdiction, briefings and reports.
   1.1.1. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future
   mishaps. Safety investigations take priority over any corresponding legal investigations
   (paragraph 4.11.1). If initiated, OSI investigations take precedence over safety investigations
   until criminal activity, natural causes, and suicide have been ruled out as possible causes of
   damage, injury, or death. Safety investigations can be done concurrently with other
   applicable investigations, if necessary. Conduct safety and legal investigations separately to
   protect privileged safety information in the safety report. Privileged safety information will
   be used solely for mishap prevention.
   1.1.2. Legal investigations provide a publicly releasable report of the facts and
   circumstances surrounding a mishap. Legal investigations may include a statement of
   opinion on the cause of the accident, gather and preserve evidence for claims, litigation,
   disciplinary and adverse administrative actions, and for all other purposes. An Accident
   Investigation Board (AIB) is one type of legal investigation and is convened for many space,
   aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV/UAS), and missile mishaps IAW AFI 51-503,
   Aerospace Accident Investigations. A Commander-Directed Investigation (CDI) is another
   type of legal investigation that may be convened. A CDI may not be used in lieu of a safety
   investigation. Ground Accident Investigation Boards are convened for many ground
   accidents IAW AFI 51-507, Ground Accident Investigations.
1.2. Waivers to this Instruction. Waivers to this instruction will be requested through the
MAJCOM/SE to AF/SE, unless otherwise specified in this instruction.
1.3. Mishaps and Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports.
   1.3.1. A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage
   or injury as described in paragraph 1.3.1.1 and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting
   criteria IAW paragraph 1.9 All mishaps require a safety investigation and report. Reference
   AFMAN 91-22X for more specifics on mishaps that meet reporting requirements.
       1.3.1.1. Damage or injury includes: damage to DoD property; occupational illness to
       DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to on- or off-duty DoD military personnel;
       injury to on-duty DoD civilian personnel; damage to public or private property, or injury
       or illness to non-DoD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
       1.3.1.2. Although motor vehicle mishaps often result from some form of misconduct
       (e.g., speeding, driving while intoxicated, and reckless driving) they will be reported in
       accordance with this instruction.
   1.3.2. An event is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet
   mishap reporting criteria as defined in paragraph 1.3.1 Class E events require a safety
 8                                                 AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     investigation and report (see paragraph 1.10.5). Reference AFMAN 91-22X for more
     specifics on events that meet reporting requirements.
1.4. Exceptions to mandatory reporting requirements for this AFI. The following
occurrences do not need to be reported under this instruction. However, other instructions may
require their reporting and the absence of a requirement for a safety report does not relieve the
need to conduct an investigation.
     1.4.1. Damage or injury by direct action of an enemy or hostile force. This does not include
     suspected cases of Friendly Fire, which will include a safety investigation and report in
     accordance with paragraph 4.11.1
     1.4.2. Intentional, controlled, in-flight jettison or release of canopies, cargo, doors, drag
     chutes, hatches, life rafts, auxiliary fuel tanks, aerial refueling hoses, missiles, drones,
     rockets, explosive munitions, and externally carried equipment nonessential to flight unless
     ensuing reportable damage occurs. This includes intentional activation of flares, manually or
     by automatic countermeasure systems, with normal system function and no damage to
     property on the ground. NOTE: Report intentional jettison of missiles, drones, rockets, and
     munitions when the reason for jettison is their malfunction. Report all release of missiles or
     explosives that impact off range. If any of these caused damage to non-DoD property refer
     to paragraph 1.10.3.
     1.4.3. Intentional or expected damage to DoD equipment or property incurred during
     authorized testing or combat training, including missile and ordnance firing or destruction of
     DoD property to prevent capture by an enemy or hostile force, to include the following:
        1.4.3.1. Intentional electro-explosive device activation when part of a normal missile test
        or launch sequence, the launch is aborted, and there is no other reportable damage.
        1.4.3.2. Expected damage or destruction of equipment, pallets, parachutes, etc., during
        airdrop operations.
        1.4.3.3. Damage to or destruction of Air Force equipment or property during authorized
        testing, including missile and ordnance firing, and UAV/UASs used as targets or on
        critical profile missions, provided all of the following conditions exist:
            1.4.3.3.1. The extent of the damage or destruction was an expected or desired result
            of the test.
            1.4.3.3.2. The damage or destruction occurred at planned times and for anticipated
            reasons.
1.4.4. Damage or destruction of a UAV resulting from a deliberative risk acceptance decision by
an appropriate command authority to employ the vehicle in an environment or condition where
the risk of loss of the vehicle is outweighed by operational requirements.
     1.4.4.1. Although not an AFSAS reportable mishap, the accountable MAJCOM safety
     office will report this loss to HQ AF/SEI via e-mail. The report will contain the date,
     location (when available), object identifier, short narrative, and the approval authority which
     accepted the risk.
     1.4.5. Except when required to be reported as a Class E event, a safety report is not required
     when all of the following three conditions are true:
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                                9


     1.4.5.1. The failed item is a component part or line-replaceable unit (LRU). Examples
     include flight line replaceable engine components and electronic boxes, air cycle
     machines, pumps, tires, and drag braces. The following are major assemblies and not
     component parts nor LRUs: aircraft subsystems such as engines, engine modules,
     landing gear, and gearboxes.
     1.4.5.2. All damage and/or wear is confined to that component part or LRU. (If not
     confined, all associated damage costs must be added to determine if the occurrence is a
     reportable mishap.)
     1.4.5.3. The failed item is maintained as fly-to-fail or reached pre-determined wear limits
     due to normal wear and tear, as defined by the applicable technical order or Single
     Manager (SM).
  1.4.6. Engine foreign object damage (FOD), discovered during scheduled engine
  disassembly (e.g., depot overhaul for maximum operating time, not for known or suspected
  FOD), to aircraft, air-breathing missiles, or drone/UAV/UAS engines. NOTE: FOD may be
  reportable under TO 00-35D-54, USAF Materiel Deficiency Reporting and Investigating
  System.
  1.4.7. Property damage, death, or injury as a result of vandalism, riots, civil disorders,
  sabotage, terrorist activities, or criminal acts (e.g., arson) unless these events occur in the
  work environment. NOTE: Although motor vehicle mishaps often result from some form of
  misconduct (e.g., speeding, driving while intoxicated, and reckless driving) they will be
  reported.
  1.4.8. Natural phenomena ground mishaps where adequate preparation, forecasting, and
  communication actions were taken and there were no injuries to DoD personnel.
  1.4.9. Normal residual damage as a result of a missile launch.
  1.4.10. Pre-existing injuries or illnesses sustained before entry into military service or
  employment by the US Government, unless significantly aggravated by current tenure of
  service. See OSHA Recordkeeping Handbook, Section 1904.5 to determine work-
  relatedness.
  1.4.11. Injuries or fatalities to persons in the act of escaping from or eluding military or
  civilian custody or arrest.
  1.4.12. Pre-existing musculoskeletal disorders unless aggravated or accelerated by U.S.
  Government employment. See OSHA Recordkeeping Handbook, Section 1904.5 and
  1904.12 to determine work-relatedness.
  1.4.13. Injury or occupational illness to contractor personnel or damage to contractor
  property or equipment unless caused by DoD operations.
  1.4.14. ANG state employee (Title 5) injury or illness on- or off-duty unless their injury or
  illness involved Air Force personnel, contractor operations, or property. See paragraph 1.12.
  1.4.15. Injuries or illness from animal, insect, or reptile bites to military personnel while off-
  duty.
 10                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   1.4.16. Adverse bodily reactions resulting directly from the use of drugs under the direction
   of competent medical authority unless the drugs were prescribed for an injury or illness that
   is work-related.
   1.4.17. Hospitalization for treatment where the patient is retained beyond the day of
   admission solely for administrative reasons.
       1.4.17.1. Hospitalization for observation or administrative reasons not related to the
       immediate injury or occupational illness.
       1.4.17.2. Observation and/or Diagnostic Procedure. Hospitalization or restriction from
       assigned work activities for observation or diagnosis is not a "lost time case," "no lost
       time case," or "first aid case" provided no treatment or medication is given for the
       suspected injury or occupational illness and competent medical authority determines the
       individual could have returned to his or her normal job without impairment or
       disability. This classification also applies where an individual is temporarily restricted
       from regularly assigned duties to prevent exceeding time-weighted exposure limits.
   1.4.18. Death due to natural causes that is unrelated to the work
   environment. NOTE: However, the following deaths by natural causes must be reported
   under this AFI:
       1.4.18.1. An aircrew member during flight.
       1.4.18.2. A missile crewmember on alert.
       1.4.18.3. A training-related death.
   1.4.19. Death or injury resulting solely from illegal use of drugs or other substances unless
   occurring in the work environment.
   1.4.20. Attempted or consummated suicide or intentionally self-inflicted injuries.
1.5. Work-Relatedness. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event
or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or
significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for
injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment,
unless an exception in 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies.
   1.5.1. Injuries or illnesses will not be considered work-related if, at the time of the injury or
   illness, the employee was present in the work environment as a member of the general public
   rather than as an employee.
   1.5.2. Injuries or illnesses will not be considered work-related if they involve symptoms that
   surface at work but result solely from a non-work-related event or exposure that occurs
   outside the work environment.
   1.5.3. Injuries and illnesses will not be considered work-related if they are solely the result
   of employees doing personal tasks (unrelated to their employment) at the establishment
   outside of their assigned working hours.
   1.5.4. Injuries and illnesses will not be considered work-related if they are solely the result
   of personal grooming, self-medication for a non-work-related condition, or are intentionally
   self-inflicted.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                                11


   1.5.5. Common colds and flu will not be considered work-related even if contracted while
   the employee was at work. However, in the case of other infectious diseases such as
   tuberculosis, brucellosis, and hepatitis C, employers must evaluate reports of such illnesses
   for work relationship, just as they would any other type of injury or illness.
   1.5.6. Mental illness will not be considered work-related unless the employee voluntarily
   provides the employer with an opinion from a physician or other licensed health care
   professional with appropriate training and experience (psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric
   nurse practitioner, etc.) stating that the employee has a mental illness that is work-related.
1.6. Acting on Critical Safety Information. If safety personnel or investigators discover
information that seriously impacts the operations of a weapons system, the continuation of an
exercise, or other operations, they must immediately notify the convening authority by telephone
and follow up with a confirming e-mail, regardless of whether or not such information is
associated with a mishap currently under investigation. Convening Authority Safety Offices will
take action IAW paragraph 2.6.7
1.7. Accounting for Losses. The Air Force records each mishap to the command (MAJCOM)
that experienced the loss or a majority of the loss of an owned asset (personnel or property). For
statistical purposes, the occurrence is recorded as a mishap in that command (or in the Air Force
at large, when applicable) regardless of any determination as to the responsibility for the mishap.
Generally, the mishap is recorded in the command that has investigative responsibility for the
mishap (Chapter 4). Mishap accounting in no way implies blame or mishap responsibility.
NOTE: For purposes of this instruction, the term "MAJCOM" includes ANG, Direct Reporting
Units (DRUs), and Forward Operating Agencies (FOAs).
   1.7.1. For all engine-confined non-FOD mishaps, the mishap accounting organization is
   assigned to the ―Air Force at large.‖
1.8. Mishap Categories. The Air Force categorizes mishaps based upon the material involved
(e.g., space systems, weapons, aircraft, motor vehicles, person, etc.) and the state of the involved
material (e.g., launch, orbit, existence of intent for flight, on- or off-duty, etc.) when the mishap
occurs. Mishap categories and subcategories are defined below and diagramed in Figure 1.1
For the purposes of reporting and data collection, select the one category and subcategory that
best defines the mishap under investigation using the order of precedence in paragraph 1.8.1.
Normally mishaps involve only one category and subcategory; see paragraph 1.8.3
   1.8.1. Specific Mishap Categories.
       1.8.1.1. Nuclear. An Air Force mishap involving a nuclear weapon system, nuclear
       reactor, or other radioactive material.
           1.8.1.1.1. Nuclear Weapon System. A mishap that involves destruction of, or serious
           damage to, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons systems, or nuclear weapons
           components, resulting in an actual or potential threat to national security or life and
           property. Reportable nuclear surety violations and damage to support equipment
           listed in the Air Force Master Nuclear Certification List (MNCL) will be reported
           under this subcategory.
12                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


        1.8.1.1.2. Reactor. Mishaps involving fissile material used in a self-supporting chain
        reaction (i.e., nuclear fission) to produce heat and/or radiation for both practical
        application and research and development.
        1.8.1.1.3. Radiological. Mishaps involving radioactive material not related to a
        nuclear weapon or fissile radioactive material.
     1.8.1.2. Space. An Air Force mishap involving a space system and/or ground based
     space systems. Refer to AFMAN 91-222 for reporting and investigation requirements.
        1.8.1.2.1. Development/Testing/Pre-Launch.        Space mishaps occurring during
        development, pre-operational testing, ground handling, processing, transportation
        operations, or involving launch vehicles or spacecraft prior to launch (T=0).
        1.8.1.2.2. Launch/Range. Space mishaps involving launch vehicle operations (after
        T=0), including upper stages, or involving range support equipment. This includes
        payloads that do not obtain orbit, range safety system failures, and range support
        failures.
        1.8.1.2.3. Orbital Mishaps. All mishaps that occur after successful separation from
        all launch vehicle components, including upper stages and transfer/kick motors, are
        considered orbital mishaps. Refer to AFMAN 91-222 for reporting and investigation
        requirements.
        1.8.1.2.4. Ground Based Space Systems. Space mishaps involving ground based
        space systems not involved with supporting launch or orbital operations.
        1.8.1.2.5. Cross Categories.
           1.8.1.2.5.1. High Altitude Operations (HAO). Due to the similarities with small
           satellite payloads, a mishap involving a HAO payload should be investigated as a
           joint aviation/space mishap.
           1.8.1.2.5.2. Directed Energy (DE). Mishaps involving directed energy systems
           that illuminate, interfere, damage or destroy a space system should be investigated
           as a joint directed energy/space mishap.
     1.8.1.3. Aviation. An Air Force mishap involving a DoD aircraft or DoD UAV/UAS.
        1.8.1.3.1. Aircraft Flight. Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and
        reportable damage to a DoD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided
        missile mishaps that cause damage in excess of $20,000 to a DoD aircraft with intent
        for flight, as defined in this instruction, are categorized as aircraft flight mishaps to
        avoid dual reporting. This is the only aviation mishap subcategory that contributes to
        the flight mishap rate.
        1.8.1.3.2. Aircraft Flight-Related. Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and
        no reportable damage to the DoD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality,
        reportable injury, or reportable property damage. Parachuting injuries fall under this
        subcategory (refer to paragraph 4.4 and Attachment 6 for mishaps involved multiple
        services). A missile or UAV/UAS that is launched from a DoD aircraft, departs
        without damaging the aircraft, and is subsequently involved in a DoD mishap is
        reportable as a guided missile mishap or UAV/UAS mishap, respectively.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                                13


          1.8.1.3.3. Aircraft Ground Operations (AGO) mishap or event (Non-Flight Rate
          Producing). Aircraft Ground Operations are mishaps that involve DoD aircraft with
          no intent for flight that result in reportable damage to DoD aircraft, injury, or fatality.
          1.8.1.3.3. (AFMC) Flight Safety Officers (FSO) and Ground Safety Managers
          (GSMs) will investigate AGOs as determined by convening authority.
              1.8.1.3.3.1. The Convening Authority will determine the size and scope of the
              safety investigation and appoint appropriate members to the SIB or a single
              investigator IAW the AFMAN 91-223 or AFMAN 91-224 guidance.
              1.8.1.3.3.2. Generally, mishaps involving maintenance will use AFMAN 91-224
              procedures and mishaps involving operations (ex: taxi mishap) will use AFMAN
              91-223 procedures. The Convening Authority will determine which procedures
              are more appropriate. AFMAN 91-224 investigations will be cross-categorized as
              Ground and Industrial, Industrial mishaps.
              1.8.1.3.3.3. Damage to a missile prior to the completion of weapons upload
              procedures, or after initiation of weapons download is a Missile mishap.
              1.8.1.3.3.4. Damage to an aircraft, when it is being handled as a commodity or
              cargo, is not reportable as an aircraft accident.
          1.8.1.3.4. UAV/UAS. Any mishap involving a DoD UAV/UAS as defined in this
          instruction, but not involving another DoD aircraft. Damage to a DoD UAV/UAS,
          when it is being handled as cargo, is a ground and industrial mishap.
NOTE: If damage is first discovered during inspection or maintenance, determine the most
likely time of occurrence and corresponding subcategory.
          1.8.1.3.4. (AFMC) BQM-167 subscale aerial targets and ADM-160 Miniature Air
          Launched Decoys (MALD) will be considered subscale RPVs (i.e. UAS) for mishap
          categorization purposes.
       1.8.1.4. Guided Missile, including Ground Launched Missile. An Air Force mishap
       involving guided missiles or unique missile support equipment. Missiles that are
       unintentionally damaged or destroyed after launch from an aircraft, but cause no aircraft
       damage, will be classified as a guided missile mishap.
       1.8.1.4. (AFMC) Missiles that are intentionally damaged after launch (e.g., through
       activation of a flight termination system) will not be classified as mishaps unless either
       ensuing reportable damage occurs or missile debris impacts off range. See section 1.4.3
       and consult Figure 1.1 in AFMAN 91-221.
       1.8.1.5. Explosives and Chemical Agents.        An Air Force mishap fitting one of the
       subcategories below.
          1.8.1.5.1. Explosives. An on-duty mishap involving DoD-owned explosive items
          resulting in damage to, or damage or injury meeting reportable criteria caused by:
              1.8.1.5.1.1. An explosion or functioning of explosive materials or devices (except
              as a result of enemy action) to include small arms (50 Cal or less). Unintentional
              discharges of small arms ammunition where the round and weapon functioned as
              designed and no injuries or property damage were involved are not reportable
14                                             AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


            under this manual unless circumstances support a Class E HAP. Mishaps not
            meeting reportable mishap criteria will still be investigated for Class E HAP
            consideration. For example: carts fire with no damage, however the investigation
            reveals a bad micro-switch or needed procedural changes. Small arms accidental
            discharges which result in injury or reportable property damage will be reported
            as explosive mishaps, per the mishap category hierarchy. In the event of death, if
            the provisions of AFMAN 91-224 are more applicable, the MAJCOM may
            request the use of AFMAN 91-224 to investigate and report the mishap. The
            convening authority will appoint the appropriate safety expertise to investigate.
            1.8.1.5.1.2. Inadvertent actuation, jettisoning, releasing or launching of explosive
            devices.
            1.8.1.5.1.3. Impacts of ordnance off-range.
        1.8.1.5.2. Chemical Agent. Any unintentional or uncontrolled release of a chemical
        agent when:
            1.8.1.5.2.1. Reportable damage occurs to property from contamination or costs
            are incurred for decontamination.
            1.8.1.5.2.2. Individuals exhibit physiological symptoms of agent exposure.
            1.8.1.5.2.3. The agent quantity released to the atmosphere is such that a serious
            potential for exposure is created by exceeding the applicable maximum allowable
            concentration-time levels for exposure of unprotected workers or the general
            population or property.
     1.8.1.6. Directed Energy. An Air Force mishap fitting one of the subcategories below.
        1.8.1.6.1. Directed Energy Weapon. A mishap involving a directed energy weapon
        and/or unique directed energy weapon support equipment.
        1.8.1.6.2. Directed Energy Device. A mishap involving a directed energy device.
        An example would be damage to an optical device by an aircraft laser range finder.
     1.8.1.7. Afloat. An Air Force mishap occurring on board, or as the result of, a DoD
     vessel. This also includes DoD diving or swimmer operations. This term includes
     mishaps occurring while loading and/or off-loading or receiving services at dockside and
     mishaps occurring up to the high water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare
     training operations. It applies also to all injuries to DoD personnel occurring on board,
     whether or not job-related. Fatalities and/or injuries occurring on board that result from
     shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations are not afloat mishaps.
     1.8.1.8. Motor Vehicle. An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a motorized
     land vehicle operated by Air Force personnel. An Air Force mishap involving the
     operation of a DoD-owned or leased motorized land vehicle by non-Air Force personnel
     while operationally controlled by a DoD component. The above are all categorized as a
     motor vehicle mishap. Fatalities or injuries to pedestrians or bicyclists involving moving
     motor vehicles are included in this category. This category does not include ground and
     industrial mishaps such as injuries occurring while loading or unloading, mounting or
     dismounting a non-moving vehicle; cargo damaged by weather; damage to a properly
     parked DoD vehicle, unless caused by an operating DoD vehicle. Additionally, damage
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           15


     to an Air Force vehicle caused by objects thrown or propelled into it by weather or
     natural phenomena, or by fire when no collision occurred or damage to an Air Force
     vehicle when it is being handled as cargo and not operating under its own power and is
     properly parked, are not categorized as motor vehicle mishaps. Motor vehicle mishaps
     are divided into the following subcategories:
         1.8.1.8.1. Government Motor Vehicle (GMV). A motor vehicle mishap involving
         the operation of a GMV as defined in this instruction.
         1.8.1.8.2. Private Motor Vehicle (PMV). A motor vehicle mishap, regardless of the
         identity of the operator, that does not involve a GMV but results in a fatality or lost
         time case injury (involving days away from work) to military personnel on- or off-
         duty or to on-duty civilian personnel, or reportable damage to DoD property.
         Fatalities and injuries to bicyclists and pedestrians in the traffic environment are
         included in this category.
     1.8.1.9. Ground and Industrial. An Air Force mishap that occurs to on-duty DoD civilian
     or on- or off-duty DoD military personnel and does not meet the mishap category
     definition of nuclear, space, aviation (except as required in paragraph 1.8.1.3.3), guided
     missile, explosives and chemical agents, directed energy, afloat, or motor vehicle as
     defined by this instruction. NOTE: A mishap involving both on- and off-duty military
     personnel is categorized as an on-duty mishap. This category also includes old ground
     mishaps categories such as fire, combat training, physical and athletic conditioning,
     contractor, and natural phenomena. These categories have been replaced with questions
     in Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS).
         1.8.1.9.1. Industrial. A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work
         environment. This also includes categories for fire, combat training, and natural
         phenomena. This category also includes inadvertent releases of Class I Ozone
         Depleting Substances (ODS). (The work environment, as defined in 29 Code of
         Federal Regulations 1960, is "The establishment and other locations where one or
         more Air Force employees are working or are present as a condition of their
         employment; this would include those areas or locations where persons are TDY for
         training purposes. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but
         also the equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her
         work.")
         1.8.1.9.2. Sports and Recreational. Mishaps involving injuries that occur during
         participation in some form of recreational or athletic activities. The activity may be
         for leisure, designed to develop an Air Force member‘s physical ability or to maintain
         or increase individual/collective combat and/or peacekeeping skills (see Training
         Related Death, Attachment 1).
         1.8.1.9.3. Miscellaneous. On- or off-duty mishaps that do not fit into the industrial
         or sports and recreational subcategory. Also included in this subcategory are
         reportable mishaps occurring while using a commercial carrier such as a commercial
         bus, airplane, or taxicab.
  1.8.2. Multiple Occurrence Mishaps. Damaging occurrences that happen in logical
  succession are considered to occur in a single mishap and will result in a single safety
 16                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   investigation, unless there is clearly no possible initiating or sustaining relationship between
   occurrences. For example, an emergency vehicle responding to a mishap that collides with
   another motor vehicle is a separate mishap. MAJCOM/SE should contact AF/SE for
   resolution of questions regarding whether occurrences constitute a single or separate
   mishaps.
   1.8.3. USAF Mishaps Involving Multiple Categories.                Occasionally mishaps have
   characteristics that relate to two or more mishap categories.                For the primary
   category/subcategory, the mishap must meet the category definition in its entirety. For
   mishaps that completely meet more than one category definition, use the hierarchy in
   paragraph 1.8 and Figure 1.1. to select the primary category, and select the other categories
   as cross-categories. If a mishap relates to a category definition, but does not completely meet
   the definition, up to two related cross-categories/subcategories may be selected. For
   example, an inadvertent release of a conventional weapon from an aircraft in flight that does
   not damage the aircraft would be categorized as an aviation/aircraft flight-related mishap
   with, explosives and chemical agents/explosives cross-category.

Figure 1.1. Mishap categories




1.9. Non-USAF Mishaps. Periodically the Air Force investigates mishaps that do not fit the
definition of an Air Force mishap. The Air Force generally investigates non-USAF mishaps
because of an existing agreement with the involved party or because it has unique expertise or
interest in the mishap, and has agreed to lead an investigation. For example, the Air Force, by
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              17


way of an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU), may have previously agreed to investigate any mishap involving the equipment of a
foreign nation occurring on US soil. Non-USAF mishap categories are defined below and
diagramed in Figure 1.2 For the purposes of reporting and data collection, select the one
category that best defines the mishap under investigation. NOTE: Non-USAF mishaps fall into
one of three categories while USAF mishaps fall into one of ten DoD categories previously
discussed in paragraph 1.7 and diagramed in Figure 1.1
   1.9.1. Non-USAF Aviation. Aviation mishaps involving:
       1.9.1.1. A non-DoD aircraft or non-DoD UAV/UAS, regardless of the existence of intent
       for flight, which only results in damage to non-USAF equipment or injury to non-USAF
       personnel. An Air Force pilot who is uninjured during a successful ejection from a
       foreign-owned, single-seat fighter that is subsequently destroyed is categorized as a non-
       USAF aviation mishap since there was no damage to Air Force equipment or injury to
       Air Force personnel.
       1.9.1.2. A DoD aircraft or DoD UAV/UAS, regardless of the existence of intent for
       flight, resulting in damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1) and another DoD
       component is responsible for reporting. An Air Force person killed in an aircraft
       belonging to another DoD component typically would be investigated and reported by the
       DoD component owning the aircraft. However, if the Air Force wrote its own limited
       report, usually to document and report the loss of life, it would be categorized as a non-
       USAF aviation mishap.
   1.9.2. Contractor. Instances where contractor operations on government property during the
   execution of a government contract result in significant damage to contractor-owned
   equipment or injury to contract employees but not reportable damage to DoD property or
   injury to DoD personnel.
   1.9.3. Other. Mishaps that do not fit into the non-USAF aviation or contractor categories.

Figure 1.2. Non-USAF Mishap categories




1.10. Mishap and Event Classifications. Classify mishaps by total direct mishap cost and the
severity of injury/occupational illness. EXCEPTION: Classify Class D mishaps and Class E
events according to the definitions below. Calculate direct cost of a mishap IAW paragraph 1.11
NOTE: Severity of injury/occupational illness, not injury/occupational cost, is used to classify
mishaps.
   1.10.1. Class A Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.10.1.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $1,000,000 or more.
18                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     1.10.1.2. A fatality or permanent total disability.
     1.10.1.3. Destruction of a DoD aircraft (Attachment 1). NOTE: A destroyed UAV/UAS
     is not a Class A mishap unless the criteria in paragraphs 1.10.1.1 or 1.10.1.2 are met.
  1.10.2. Class B Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
     1.10.2.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $200,000 or more but less than $1,000,000.
     1.10.2.2. A permanent partial disability.
     1.10.2.3. Inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel. Do not count or include
     individuals hospitalized for observation, diagnostic, or administrative purposes that were
     treated and released.
  1.10.3. Class C Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
     1.10.3.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $20,000 or more but less than $200,000.
     1.10.3.2. Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or more
     days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the
     mishap is a Lost Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was
     unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the person
     was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other
     days off are included in the total number of days, if the employee would not have been
     able to work on those days. Injuries or illnesses resulting from an employee eating,
     drinking, or preparing food for personal consumption are not reportable unless the
     employee is made ill by ingesting food contaminated by workplace contaminants (such as
     lead) or gets food poisoning from food supplied by the employer. NOTE: Occurrences
     that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational
     activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball will be reported as required by
     appropriate mishap class determination and to comply with DODI 6055.07 paragraphs
     5.2.1 and E2.1.38.1
     1.10.3.3. An occupational injury or illness resulting in permanent change of job.
  1.10.4. Class D Mishap. Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does not meet the
  definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational illness,
  the employee only works partial days, has restricted duties or was transferred to another job,
  required medical treatment greater than first aid, or experienced loss of consciousness (does
  not include GLOC). In addition, a significant injury (e.g. fractured/cracked bone, punctured
  eardrum) or occupational illness (e.g. occupational cancer (mesothelioma), chronic
  irreversible disease (beryllium disease)) diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health
  care professional must be reported even if it does not result in death, days away from work,
  restricted work, job transfer, medical treatment greater than first aid, or loss of
  consciousness. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and
  fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball
  will be reported to comply with DODI 6055.7 paragraphs 5.2.1 and E2.1.38.1. A duty
  classification of Duties Not Including Flying (DNIF) alone that does not affect the unit's
  flying schedule does not require reporting as a Class D mishap (i.e. a sprained toe that was
  buddy taped (does not meet criteria for medical treatment greater than first aid), no lost duty
  time, person is DNIF, is not reportable) unless other reporting criteria are met.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                             19


   1.10.5. Class E Events. These occurrences do not meet reportable mishap classification
   criteria, but are deemed important to investigate/report for mishap prevention. Class E
   reports provide an expeditious way to disseminate valuable mishap prevention information.
       1.10.5.1. Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Events. Any air traffic or hazardous
       movement area occurrence that endangers the safety of an aircraft or UAV/UAS.
       1.10.5.2. High Accident Potential (HAP) Events. Any hazardous occurrence that has a
       high potential for becoming a mishap that does not fit the definition of a HATR.
       1.10.5.3. Wildlife Strike (BASH) Events. Any wildlife strike to an aircraft or UAV/UAS
       that does not meet Class A, B, or C mishap reporting criteria.
       1.10.5.4. Property Damage Events (Non Aviation). Mishaps that do not have an injury
       or illness and the direct cost is totaling $2,000 or more but less than $20,000.
       1.10.5.5. Physiological Events. Report episodes of abnormal physical, mental or
       behavioral conditions or symptoms. See AFMAN 91-22X for specifics.
       1.10.5.6. Laser or Radio Frequency (RFR) incidents or accidents. All incidents or
       accidents involving alleged or suspected exposures of laser radiation need to be
       investigated according to AFOSH Std 48-139 Laser Radiation Protection Program
       paragraph 2.6, immediately reported via the Laser Injury Hotline (1-800-473-3549 or
       DSN 240-4784) and reported in AFSAS. Similarly, alleged or suspected RFR exposures
       in excess of exposure limits will be investigated and reported as prescribed in AFOSH
       48-9, and reported in AFSAS.
           1.10.5.6.1. (Added-AFMC) As a minimum, center commanders/directors will
           convene a Class E High Accident Potential (HAP) investigation for all inadvertent,
           unintentional or otherwise unplanned directed energy radiations off range and those
           that exceed the thresholds published in AFOSH-STD 48-139, Laser Radiation
           Protection Program or AFOSH-STD 48-9, Radiofrequency Radiation Safety
           Program. Per AFMAN 91-221, Figure 1.1, all directed energy events not meeting
           reportable mishap classification criteria shall be addressed as a Class E HAP.
       1.10.5.7. Other occurrences as directed in the discipline specific safety manuals
       (AFMAN 91-22X).
       1.10.5.8. (Added-AFMC) RPAs or UAS departing controlled flight unexpectedly. All
       such vehicles that do not reply properly to operator input, or are damaged beyond a
       flyable condition (unless destruction before flight was intended) will be reported in
       AFSAS.
1.11. Mishap Costs. It is DoD policy to determine the total direct mishap cost in order to
provide a factual basis for the allocation of resources in support of DoD mishap prevention
programs. Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DoD and Non-DoD),
associated repair labor costs, and environmental cleanup costs. The direct cost does not include
the cost of implementing corrective actions. All other costs (ex: investigation and transportation
costs) are indirect costs.
   1.11.1. Determining DoD Property Damage Costs. This includes damage or loss of material
   and the cost of labor to repair material.
20                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     1.11.1.1. Field Level Repair.
         1.11.1.1.1. Materiel Cost. If an item is repaired locally by unit personnel, calculate
         the cost of the materiel used to repair the item. When determining the cost of Class I
         Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS), use the value of $100.00 per pound for the
         inadvertent release of Class I ODSs.
         1.11.1.1.2. DoD Labor Costs (DoD military and civilian personnel). Determine the
         number of hours of labor to repair the damaged materiel. Obtain the field level
         hourly rate from: http://afsafety.af.mil/, Labor Rates for Safety Reporting. Multiply
         the number of hours of labor expended by DoD personnel by the hourly rate.
         1.11.1.1.3. Contractor Repairs. Use the actual cost charged to the government for
         repairs performed by contractors. Costs to repair damage must be reported even if the
         Air Force is reimbursed or if the repair is accomplished under warranty. If the
         contractor considers itemized costs to be proprietary information, request and report
         only the sum total. Contact the Single Manager (SM) for assistance in obtaining
         contractor repair costs.
     1.11.1.2. Depot Level Repair.
         1.11.1.2.1. Materiel. Obtain the exchange cost for each stocklisted item requiring
         depot level repair from the Air Force Master Item Identification Data Base (D043A).
         If the item is not stock listed, contact the SM. If the sum total of the exchange costs
         is equal to or greater than $1,000,000, obtain an estimated cost of repair based upon
         actual damage from the depot/repair facility. Report this estimated cost. If the
         depot/repair facility cannot provide an estimated cost of repair based upon actual
         damage, revert to using exchange cost from D043A. If the sum total of the exchange
         costs is less than $1,000,000, report this cost. The Base Supply Representative has
         access to D043A. Exception: If the sum total of the exchange costs for FOD is equal
         to or greater than $1,000,000, a depot/repair facility estimated cost based on field
         damage description may be reported.
         1.11.1.2.2. Depot Labor Costs. Determine the number of hours of labor to repair the
         damaged materiel. Obtain the depot level hourly rate from: http://afsafety.af.mil/,
         Labor Rates for Safety Reporting. Multiply the number of hours of labor expended
         by depot personnel by the hourly rate.
         1.11.1.2.3. Contractor Repairs. Use the actual cost charged to the government for
         repairs performed by contractors. Costs to repair damage must be reported even if the
         Air Force is reimbursed or if the repair is accomplished under warranty. If the
         contractor considers itemized costs to be proprietary information, request and report
         only the sum total. Contact the Single Manager (SM) for assistance in obtaining
         contractor repair costs.
  1.11.2. Destroyed Assets.
     1.11.2.1. Determining destroyed conventional aircraft/UAV/UAS cost. If the
     aircraft/UAV/UAS is destroyed, obtain flyaway cost from the Air Force Cost Analysis
     Agency (AFCAA/FMS) at DSN 664-0409 or Commercial 703-604-0409. Get the unit
     flyaway cost and contact the SM to get the cost of all modifications done to the
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                             21


       aircraft/UAV/UAS up to the mishap date. NOTE: An aircraft/UAV/UAS that is damaged
       but will not be repaired is not automatically a destroyed aircraft/UAV/UAS. In this case,
       calculate repair cost IAW paragraphs 1.11.1.1 and/or 1.11.1.2
       1.11.2.2. Other destroyed or lost assets with no item to exchange. Use the standard
       (unit) cost from D043A or the SM. The Base Supply Representative has access to
       D043A.
   1.11.3. Determining Costs to Non-DoD Property Damage. If Air Force operations result in
   damage of non-DOD property, calculate and report the damage cost. Determine non-DOD
   property damage costs using official estimates, such as from security police reports, civil
   police reports, and/or logistics readiness offices.
   1.11.4. Determining Environmental Clean-Up Costs. Obtain these costs from the local civil
   engineering environmental section. The end cost of this type of clean up may not be
   available inside the nominal 30 day investigation timeframe. Use the best estimate available
   at the time of the final message. Environmental clean-up costs include costs for:
       1.11.4.1. Clean up.
       1.11.4.2. Environmental decontamination.
       1.11.4.3. Restoration of private and government property.
1.12. Mishap Injury and Occupational Illnesses. Report the type of person (paragraph 1.12.1)
and the severity of injury/occupational illness (paragraph 1.12.2).
   1.12.1. Type of person: rated officer, nonrated officer, enlisted, cadet, DoD civilian, DoD
   contractor, Foreign Nationals, or non-DoD civilian. NOTE: Foreign Nationals include
   military (rated or non-rated) officer, military enlisted, or civilian.
   1.12.2. Severity of injury or occupational illnesses: fatality, permanent total disability,
   permanent partial disability, lost time case, or no lost time case. (See Attachment 1 for
   definitions.) For lost time cases, also report the number of days hospitalized and the number
   of days of lost time beyond the days hospitalized. In cases when the actual number of days
   hospitalized or lost time is not known at the time the safety report is submitted, the best
   official estimates made by a competent medical authority will be used.
1.13. Recording Injuries and Occupational Illnesses. Use AFSAS to create the OSHA Form
300, Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses, for recording injuries and occupational illnesses
to civilian and military personnel meeting Class A, B, C, or D criteria. See AFMAN 91-224,
Chapter 6, for specific guidance. Note. Military and civilian personnel are recorded on separate
logs.
   1.13.1. Contractor employees hired by the Air Force via a non-personal services contract, as
   defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, are under the contractor‘s day-to-
   day supervision. The contractor, not the Air Force, will be responsible for reporting
   contractor injuries and illnesses to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
   (OSHA), even if the contractor‘s employees are co-located with an Air Force organization.
   1.13.2. Contractor employees hired under a personal services contract, as defined by FAR
   37.104, are under the day-to-day supervision of the Government and its employees. The Air
   Force will be responsible for reporting injuries to these contractor employees
 22                                                AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   1.13.3. If uncertain as to the type of contract employee, contact the Contracting Officer.
1.14. Obtaining and Using Health Information.
   1.14.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). DoD
   Regulation 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation, implements Public Law
   104-191, HIPAA within the DoD. Mishap investigation and reporting requires the gathering
   and limited distribution of specific protected health information as defined by HIPAA.
   1.14.2. Safety officials at all levels are responsible to establish a liaison with the installation
   medical agencies to ensure an information flow has been established (see paragraph 2.3.).
   DoD Regulation 6025.18-R, Chapter 7, provides for release of information for safety related
   mishap investigation and reporting as required by law, as defined in DoD Regulation

      involved, the weapons system lead command, (AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command
      Weapon Systems Management) and AFSC. These action agencies must evaluate the
      nature and seriousness of the information, determine the proper response, and issue
      required instructions.
      2.6.7.2. Ensure the SM has access to specific technical information and other critical
      information as it becomes available so the SM can meet Operational Safety, Suitability,
      and Effectiveness (OSS&E) responsibilities required by AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems
      Engineering.
      2.6.7.3. Ensure originating units send critical safety hazard information to appropriate

      Technical Order System.
      2.6.7.4. Forward to AFSC/SEF as quickly as practical all critical safety information
      related to military variants of civil aircraft and commercial off-the-shelf aircraft.
      AFSC/SEF will ensure all such information contributing to the promotion of aviation
      safety is forwarded to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and/or
      the Chairperson of the National Transportation Safety Board for appropriate action.
2.7. The Commander of the Active Duty Air Force installation nearest a mishap (or
alternate organization as designated by the convening authority) will:
28                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


  2.7.1. Respond to a mishap involving DoD assets IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
  Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, and AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency
  Response Operations.
  2.7.2. Provide logistical and investigative support as required. Air Reserve Component
  installations, if nearest the mishap, will respond with available resources to the maximum
  extent possible, in coordination with the responding active duty installation. NOTE: All
  mishap response and SIB support MOAs/MOUs between active duty and ARC units will be
  established by the active duty installation and maintained by the MAJCOM/SE, HQ
  AFRC/SE, and NGB/SE.
  2.7.3. Appoint an Incident Commander when required by AFI 10-2501.
  2.7.4. Appoint an Interim Safety Board (ISB) to preserve evidence and gather factual data
  related to the mishap until the convening authority appoints a safety investigation board or
  single investigating officer to conduct an investigation. Depending on the mishap, an Interim
  Safety Board (ISB) may consist of one individual or several depending on the judgment of
  the installation commander.
     2.7.4.1. Do not appoint personnel involved in the mishap to the ISB.
     2.7.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Personnel assigned as Interim Safety Board (ISB) will not be
     released and will not return to primary duties until relieved of their responsibilities by the
     convening authority.
  2.7.5. Ensure toxicology testing is immediately accomplished following a mishap, if
  required or deemed necessary. Evidence gathering and toxicology testing should be balanced
  with operational requirements. For example, during UAS scenarios where one crew is
  controlling multiple vehicles, operational need may delay replacement of the crew and
  toxicology testing until remaining vehicles are safely recovered. A legally defensible chain
  of custody must be maintained. At a minimum direct observation and documentation of the
  sample collection (i.e.) name of observer, date/time of collection) should be maintained by
  the submitting base. Guidelines for the collection and shipment of specimens for
  toxicological analysis are available at http://www.afip.org/consultation/AFMES/
  Toxicological analyses should be directed toward controlled substances, any medications as
  indicated by the medical history, and environmental substances (such as carbon monoxide) as
  indicated by the nature of the mishap or event. Samples should be sent to Armed Forces
  Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Division of Forensic Toxicology (see Attachment 2) to the
  maximum extent possible. Blood testing is superior and the preferred method for all
  categories of safety investigations over urine testing since it provides an opportunity to
  determine the concentration of the substance and thus the expected performance decrement.
  Also, not all substances are excreted in the urine. Coordinate with the Civilian Personnel
  Office or Contracting Officer before requiring blood samples from DoD civilian or contractor
  employees, since they may only be required to complete a urinalysis.
     2.7.5.1. Military Members. For all Class A and B aviation mishaps, commanders must
     test all military crewmembers on the flight orders (includes UAV/UAS crew). For all
     classes and categories of mishaps, commanders have the discretion to test any involved
     military members whose actions or inactions, in their judgment, may have been factors in
     the mishap sequence. Because the evidence is perishable, commanders should test all
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          29


     involved personnel (includes UAV/UAS crew) for aviation mishaps that have the
     potential of meeting the Class B threshold. When ARC personnel are involved in a
     mishap, coordinate with the ARC unit commander and/or AFRC/NGB SE offices to
     resolve any issues that may arise due to duty status issues (i.e., ARC personnel flying in
     civilian or Inactive Duty for Training status). Blood will be used for toxicological
     testing of military members for aviation safety investigations and is the preferred method
     for all safety investigations.
     2.7.5.2. DoD Civilians. DoD civilians will be subject to testing when their action or
     inaction may have contributed to the mishap subject to the limitations and guidance in
     The Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Plan (available in the Civilian Personnel Office).
     Coordinate with the Civilian Personnel Office to assist as needed.
     2.7.5.3. Government Contract Employees. Government Contract Employees (includes
     UAV/UAS crew) will be tested IAW the terms and conditions of the applicable contract
     or if they consent, when their actions or inaction in the commander's judgment may have
     been a factor in the mishap sequence. Coordinate with the Contracting Officer to assist
     as needed.
  2.7.6. Make the Appropriate Military Notifications:
     2.7.6.1. Inform the public affairs (PA) officer of non-privileged information. Release
     safety information only as authorized by this instruction.
     2.7.6.2. Notify the home installation commander of all casualties, both military and
     civilian, and ensure the casualties are reported as outlined in AFI 36-3002, Casualty
     Services.
     2.7.6.3. Notify the departure and destination bases for aviation mishaps (or the departure
     base for missile mishaps) and the commander of the unit that had the mishap.
     2.7.6.4. Notify the home installation of the persons involved in a United States Army
     (USA), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), or United
     States Coast Guard (USCG) mishap or, if the home installation is unknown, the nearest
     installation of the responsible service.
     2.7.6.5. Notify AFIP whenever there is a fatality of an Air Force member.
     2.7.6.6. Notify the Air Force Communications Agency‘s Hammer ACE (Adaptive
     Communications Element) if communications support is deemed necessary. Hammer
     ACE is funded to provide services to safety investigations at no cost to MAJCOMs or Air
     Force wings.
     2.7.6.7. Notify the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command‘s Defense
     Transportation Tracking System (attachment 2) when a mishap involves explosives or
     other dangerous articles being transported or handled by a commercial motor or rail
     carrier under Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.
     2.7.6.8. Notify local Command Post (Command Post may have reporting requirements
     IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting).
  2.7.7. In The United States, make the Appropriate Civilian Notifications:
 30                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


       2.7.7.1. Notify the nearest National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regional or
       field office or the nearest Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic facility if a
       civil aircraft is involved in a mishap on their installation (see contact information in
       AFMAN 91-223).
       2.7.7.2. Notify the FAA at FAA/AST Combined Operations Center (Attachment 2) if
       licensed commercial space systems are involved in the mishap. During launch of a
       commercial space vehicle from an Air Force facility, the on-site FAA/AST representative
       will fulfill this notification requirement and up-channel as required.
       2.7.7.3. Notify the nearest Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) area
       or regional office within 8 hours of the on-duty mishap when the mishap results in an Air
       Force civilian employee fatality or involves the inpatient hospitalization of three or more
       people (one of which must be a DoD civilian employee). If unable to contact the nearest
       OSHA area or regional office within the required 8-hour time frame, contact the OSHA
       24-hour toll-free hot line (Attachment 2). Although outside OSHA‘s investigative
       jurisdiction, overseas locations are required to notify AFSC/SEG of these types of
       incidents.
       2.7.7.4. Notify federal, state, and local environmental officials, as required, of
       environmental hazards and spills associated with the mishap.
       2.7.7.5. Notify appropriate medical or law enforcement authorities as soon as possible in
       case of non-Air Force injury or property damage.
2.8. The Interim Safety Board (ISB) President or Interim Safety Officer will:

AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              33


                                             Chapter 3

                          PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION

3.1. General Information. Violations of the prohibitions in paragraph 3.3.1 of this
instruction are punishable under Article 92, UCMJ and may be grounds for disciplinary
actions according to civilian personnel regulations, or may lead to contract actions. All
safety reports contain privileged safety information, but not all information in a safety report is
privileged. EXCEPTION: preliminary messages, HATRs, Wildlife Strike Class E Reports, and
non-DoD aviation safety reports do not contain privileged safety information. Also ground and
industrial, and explosive and chemical agents safety reports regarding mishaps that occurred
before 3 Oct 00 do not contain privileged safety information (paragraph 3.8).
3.2. Identifying Privileged Safety Information. Privileged safety information refers to
information that is exempt by statute or case law from disclosure outside the Air Force safety
community. The military safety privilege is judicially recognized and protects the investigative
process. The Air Force treats this information confidentially to ensure commanders quickly
obtain accurate mishap information thereby promoting safety, combat readiness, and mission
accomplishment. NOTE: Safety investigations of non-DoD aviation mishaps are conducted
using this instruction as guidance and do not contain privileged safety information.
   3.2.1. Privileged information includes:
       3.2.1.1. Findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations, analysis, and the deliberative
       process of safety investigators. Diagrams and exhibits if they contain information which
       depicts the analysis of safety investigators. This includes draft versions of the above
       material.
       3.2.1.2. Information given to safety investigators pursuant to a promise of confidentiality
       (paragraph 3.4).
       3.2.1.3. Computer generated animations, simulations, or simulator reenactments in which
       safety investigator analysis is incorporated. Animations made exclusively from recorder
       data (including Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance data) are not privileged.
       3.2.1.4. Photographs, imagery, and animations that reveal the deliberative process of the
       board, including photographs with markings.
       3.2.1.5. Life Sciences Material that contain analysis by a safety or life sciences
       investigator. NOTE: 72-hour histories, 14 day histories and interview narratives by
       Medical Officer are only privileged if privilege was granted.
3.3. Prohibited Uses of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. These prohibitions apply
to Part 2 of formal safety reports, status and final safety messages, and any other reports or
documents containing privileged safety information.
   3.3.1. Air Force civilian employees, military members, and government contractors will not
   wrongfully use, permit the use of, gain access to, or allow access to the privileged
   information in any safety report, or portions thereof, for other than officially authorized
   mishap prevention purposes.
 34                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   3.3.2. The Air Force does not use privileged safety information as evidence for punitive,
   disciplinary, or adverse administrative actions, for determining the misconduct or line-of-
   duty status of any person, in flying evaluation board hearings or reviews, to determine
   liability or liability in claims for or against the United States, or in any other manner in any
   action by or against the United States.
       3.3.2.1. Adverse administrative actions include, but are not limited to, letters of
       reprimand, counseling, or admonishment, referral EPRs/OPRs, promotion propriety
       actions (not qualified for promotion, delay and/or denial), administrative separations,
       selective reenlistment denials, or evidence before any evaluation board and other similar
       actions. Commanders and supervisors will use other sources of information which are
       not privileged to take punitive or adverse administrative actions.
       3.3.2.2. While privileged safety information may not be used as evidence for punitive,
       disciplinary, or adverse administrative actions, information from other sources may be
       used. Sources include information from Accident Investigation Board reports under AFI
       51-503, Ground Accident Investigations under AFI 51-507, Commander Directed
       Investigations (CDIs), safety mishap participant interviews when promises of
       confidentiality are not authorized (Article 31, UCMJ, rights advisement may be
       necessary), Security Forces and/or AFOSI information gathered for criminal matters.
       Consult your local JA for further guidance.
   3.3.3. Controlling and Handling Privileged Safety Reports and Information. Personnel
   having access (authorized access or unauthorized access) to privileged safety reports and
   information have a duty to control the reports to prevent their use for anything other than
   mishap prevention. When these reports and information are no longer needed for mishap
   prevention purposes, dispose of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
   located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil
       3.3.3.1. All persons (except the convening authority, his or her staff, safety office staff,
       and AFSC personnel) given or provided access to privileged safety information by the
       ISB or SIB prior to the convening authority briefing must have a Safety Investigation
       Non-Disclosure Agreement (Figure A3.2), Witness Promise of Confidentiality and
       Non-Disclosure Agreement (Figure A3.3) or Promise of Confidentiality and Non-
       Disclosure Agreement for Contractor Representatives Serving as Technical Experts
       to Safety Investigations (Figure A3.5) on file with the ISB or SIB.
3.4. Promise of Confidentiality.
   3.4.1. Purpose. The Air Force gives a promise of confidentiality to encourage frank and
   open communications with individuals who provide witness statements to a safety
   investigator and with government contractors who built, designed, or maintained the
   equipment and participate in the safety investigation. However, if an individual provides a
   false statement to a safety investigator under a promise of confidentiality, that statement (and
   any other information that witness gave to the safety investigator) loses its privileged status
   and can be used to support disciplinary and/or adverse administrative actions.
   3.4.2. Promises of Confidentiality Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are only
   authorized in investigations of Air Force nuclear, space, aviation, guided missile, directed
   energy, and friendly fire mishaps. However, there may be occasions, such as mishaps
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                            35


   involving complex systems, military-unique items (such as armored vehicles), or military-
   unique operations or exercises, where a witness or involved contractor will not provide a
   statement or information without a promise of confidentiality. When this appears to be the
   case, contact AFSC/SEG or AFSC/JA who will forward your request to AF/SE or AFSC/CD
   for approval to grant confidentiality to those witnesses.
   3.4.3. Promises of Confidentiality Not Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are not
   authorized for explosives and chemical agents, afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty military, and
   ground and industrial mishaps (see the exception for complex systems, military-unique items,
   or military-unique operations or exercises in paragraph 3.4.2). Promises of confidentiality
   are also not authorized for HATRs.
   3.4.4. Persons Authorized to Make Promises of Confidentiality. Only the ISB President,
   SIB President or Investigating Officer (IO) or a SIO may offer promises of confidentiality
   and only during safety investigations where promises of confidentiality are authorized.
   When conducting safety investigations in which promises of confidentiality are authorized,
   the SIB President and IO have the discretion to decide who will be offered a promise of
   confidentiality. The SIB President and IO‘s decision should be based upon a witness or
   contractor‘s reluctance to cooperate or apparent self-interest in not disclosing information.
   Promises of confidentiality will only be given as needed to ensure forthright cooperation of
   the witness and may not be given on a blanket basis to all witnesses. Limiting the persons
   authorized to make the promises of confidentiality does not mean that the SIB President or
   the IO must be present at all witness interviews.
   3.4.5. Persons to Whom Promises of Confidentiality May be Offered. Promises of
   confidentiality may be offered to any witness and contractors who built, designed or
   maintained the equipment in order to encourage their full cooperation and candid statements.
   3.4.6. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses provide statements without a
   promise of confidentiality, ensure they are informed that their statement will be provided to
   the accident investigation board (if applicable) and/or may be released to the public pursuant
   to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Non-privileged witness statements are
   placed in Part 1 of the safety report. Consult the Host Installation SJA or a labor relations
   officer for guidance before interviewing any federal civilian employees covered by a
   bargaining unit.
3.5. Marking and Documenting Safety Information.
   3.5.1. The cover and individual pages of documents containing privileged information will
   be clearly marked with the privileged warning statement in Figure A3.1 All media
   containing privileged information (audiotapes, videotapes, animations, simulations, computer
   generated profiles, etc.) will be clearly marked with the warning statement in Figure A3.1
   See paragraph 3.6.2 for further information on email. Part 1 (Factual Information and
   Releasable Material) of a formal report will not be marked with the privileged warning
   statement in Figure A3.1
   3.5.2. Safety reports are for official use only (FOUO), DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security
   Program, if they are not classified. However, not each document in the report is FOUO.
   The factual documents in Part 1 of formal safety reports are not typically considered FOUO
   by this AFI, and should not be marked as such. However, documents from other sources
 36                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   included in Part 1 may already be marked FOUO. For instance, Part 1 documents may
   warrant protection based on Privacy Act or the Export Control Act. Only the OPR for the
   document may authorize removal of FOUO markings.
   3.5.3. Promises of Confidentiality (Witness and Contractor Personnel). If a promise of
   confidentiality is offered and accepted, it must be documented. Use the Witness Promise of
   Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement in Figure A3.3 or Promise of
   Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor Representatives Serving
   as Technical Experts to Safety Investigations (Figure A3.5) where applicable. Read,
   record, and transcribe the statement in Figure A3.6 for recorded interviews of witnesses.
   Use Figure A3.8 as a cover sheet for confidential technical reports and analysis provided by
   contractors.
   3.5.4. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses provide statements (written or
   verbal) without a promise of confidentiality, it must be documented by using the Non-
   Privileged Witness Statement(s) in Figure A3.4 Read, record and transcribe the statement
   in Figure A.3.7
3.6. Transmitting Safety Information.
   3.6.1. To protect the privileged status and to ensure the correct handling of safety reports,
   originating organizations will use the AFSAS reporting system to transmit messages.
   AFSAS is a CAC required system ensuring the protection of privileged information. If
   AFSAS is not available (paragraph 6.1), use e-mail and the addressing requirements of this
   instruction. All e-mail safety messages containing privileged safety information or Privacy
   Act information must be password-protected. Send the applicable password in a separate
   message or by another mode of transmission.
   3.6.2. If AFSAS and e-mail are not available, use one of the following ways to send
   privileged safety reports and information:
       3.6.2.1. Use AMHS and the addressing requirements of this instruction.
       3.6.2.2. Fax the document ensuring that the recipient will receive the faxed document
       immediately upon receipt.
3.6.3. Classified Mishap Reporting, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports. In order
to collect classified mishap reports for the Weapons Safety Community (e.g. Dull Swords,
Broken Arrow, etc.) all classified mishaps must be submitted via SIPRNET to AFSC/SEW for
mishap reporting, tracking and prevention.
   3.6.3. (AFMC) 1 (Added) Potential Dull Swords (PDS) worksheets originating in an
   AFMC MUNSs must be coordinated with the host wing weapons safety office. If there is a
   disagreement between the host and tenant on whether or not a Dull Sword Report will be
   submitted via AFSAS, the MAJCOM Weapons Safety Office must be contacted and they
   will make a recommendation to the host Wing Commander of report or not to report.
3.7. Authorized Use and Release of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. In order to
help ensure courts honor the assertion of privilege, the rules described in this paragraph must be
followed. The Air Force ensures privileged safety reports and information are used only by
persons and agencies whose duties include relevant mishap prevention responsibilities
(paragraphs 3.7.2 and 3.7.3). All personnel and agencies authorized access to privileged safety
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                            37


reports and information will follow the policy in paragraphs 3.3 and 3.3.3 Unique circumstances
described in paragraphs below allow certain authorized individuals to release privileged
information outside the Air Force. Privileged safety information remains Air Force property.
Questions regarding access to privileged safety information should be referred to AFSC/JA.
Access is limited to information that is necessary for and consistent with mishap prevention.
Whenever privileged safety information is requested, first determine whether or not mishap
prevention goals can be met by sanitizing the information (paragraph 3.7.1). If the answer is no,
then provide only the necessary information to the authorized persons or agencies with the
restrictive markings affixed.
   3.7.1. Sanitizing Privileged Safety Reports. Sanitizing reports or extracts from reports
   means obscuring the relationship between the identity of a mishap and the findings,
   conclusions, causes, recommendations, deliberative processes resulting from the
   investigation, and statements made under a promise of confidentiality. Wing safety officers
   or their designated representatives (that are properly trained) may sanitize privileged safety
   reports and other media for unit use and for use by authorized contractor personnel. Some
   mishaps, because of widespread publicity or unique circumstances, cannot be fully sanitized.
   After a report has been sanitized, the remaining portions of the findings, causes,
   recommendation, conclusions, or opinions of the investigation are no longer privileged.
   (Note: Sanitized reports are not necessarily releasable to the public since they may still
   contain contractor proprietary information or information protected by the Privacy Act, Arms
   Export Control Act, or Export Administration Act. Ensure sanitized reports are appropriately
   labeled.) Sanitizing a report involves separating the following identifying information from
   related safety investigator findings, causes, recommendations, conclusions, or opinions:
       3.7.1.1. Date and place of the mishap.
       3.7.1.2. Aircraft, UAV/UAS, missile, vehicle, or weapon serial number.
       3.7.1.3. Names and social security numbers (SSN), if included, of persons involved.
       3.7.1.4. Any other detail identifying the mishap.
       3.7.1.5. Remove identifying information and markings identifying the documents as
       privileged or FOUO before reproducing sanitized reports or extracts of reports.
       3.7.1.6. Do not release statements or contractor reports obtained with a promise of
       confidentiality.
   3.7.2. Limiting Release within the Air Force. Safety officers and their staffs, duly appointed
   safety investigators, AFSC personnel and AF/SE and his or her staff, are authorized access to
   and use of privileged safety information based on their safety duties. Other Air Force
   officials, when their duties include mishap prevention and when it is necessary to develop,
   take, or review preventive actions, may obtain access to privileged safety information. See
   paragraphs 3.3., 3.3.3., and 3.7. MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of Safety are
   authorized, when sanitized information is inadequate, to provide privileged safety
   information as lessons learned to Air Force members on a need-to-know basis and solely for
   mishap prevention. They will ensure members are instructed on properly protecting
   information and their responsibilities to prevent further, unauthorized release, and that they
   sign non-disclosure agreements. Lessons learned will not include confidential statements or
   contractor reports.
38                                             AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     3.7.2.1. AF/SE; AFSC/CD and division chiefs; MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of
     Safety; SIB Presidents or SIOs; are authorized to disclose privileged safety information to
     AF officials as described in paragraph 3.7.2.
     3.7.2.2. Accident Investigation Board (AIB) investigators with a safety need to know
     (e.g., pilots, commanders, operations personnel) may have access to privileged safety
     information from the corresponding safety investigation only after final approval of the
     AIB report. AIB investigators must first coordinate with the convening authority JA and
     SE if the AIB report has not been released to the public. The convening authority will
     determine if access is appropriate before next-of-kin are briefed following a fatal mishap.
     3.7.2.3. Part 1 of the two-part formal safety report and certain factual information is
     given to the AIB president (paragraph 5.14 and the discipline specific safety manual
     AFMAN 91-22X).
     3.7.2.4. ANG and AF Reserve Personnel. Apply the test for releasing privileged safety
     information that is described in paragraph 3.7 Do not withhold privileged safety reports
     from ANG and AF Reserve personnel who have a need to know when sanitized
     information is not adequate to develop, take, or review corrective action. Persons having
     a need to know include, but are not limited to, those involved in mishap prevention;
     whose duties include the preparation, dispatch, or internal distribution of safety reports;
     and those who act in response to mishap prevention recommendations. Releasing
     information under this paragraph does not constitute release outside the Air Force.
     3.7.2.5. Other Air Force officials such as a Staff Judge Advocate (other than AFSC/JA),
     criminal investigative agencies such as the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
     (OSI), Security Forces, Historian and Public Affairs do not normally receive privileged
     safety information because of possible conflicts of interest and because use of such
     information by such officials would not be for mishap prevention purposes.
  3.7.3. Limiting Release Outside the Air Force. In certain cases, the Air Force has agreed to
  exchange privileged safety information with other DoD agencies solely for mishap
  prevention purposes. Also, the Air Force shares certain mishap prevention information with
  other entities in the interests of the general safety community. See paragraphs 3.3., 3.3.3.,
  and 3.7
     3.7.3.1. Responding to Subpoenas and Legal Process. Upon receipt of a legal process
     requiring participation in a court proceeding, including depositions and requests for
     production of documents, contact AFSC/JA and the nearest Air Force base legal office.
     Fax a copy of the legal process to AFLOA/JACC (DSN 426-9009; commercial (703)
     696-9009). Encourage requesters to ask the MAJCOM/JA for the AFI 51-503 accident
     investigation report if one has been prepared.
     3.7.3.2. Responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests under Title 5,
     United States Code, section 552. Send FOIA requests for all safety reports to AFSC/JA
     (attachment 2).
     3.7.3.3. Historical Safety Reports. AF/SE or AFSC/CD may release the findings of a
     Safety Board, contained in historical safety reports prepared IAW DODI 6055.07 (or its
     predecessors), provided no national defense or safety interest exists. For the purpose of
     this provision, historical reports shall be defined as those concerning mishaps more than
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           39


     25 years old. (Note: Safety Reports on pre-1956 mishaps are not protected by the safety
     privilege and are stored at the Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB.)
     3.7.3.4. For Investigations Where Safety Investigators are Not Authorized to Grant
     Promises of Confidentiality (see paragraph 3.4.3). AF/SE or AFSC/CD is designated by
     the Secretary of the Air Force to assert the privilege to oppose any court-ordered release
     of privileged safety information for all investigations where promises of confidentiality
     are not authorized. Further, upon determination by AF/SE or AFSC/CD that no safety or
     national defense interest is jeopardized, AF/SE or AFSC/CD may authorize the release of
     safety investigation findings.
     3.7.3.5. Limiting Release to Contractors. Contractors may need access to privileged
     safety information when they are performing an Air Force function involving mishap
     prevention. Contractors may also need access to privileged safety information if they
     designed, built, maintained or operated Air Force weapon systems, their components, or
     other Air Force equipment, in order to correct defects or other problems and help prevent
     future mishaps. When contractors need access to privileged safety information either the
     Safety Investigation Non-Disclosure Agreement (Figure A3.2) or Promise of
     Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor Representatives
     Serving as Technical Experts to Safety Investigations (Figure A3.5) must be signed
     and stored at the safety office. Access will be limited to what is needed to prevent future
     mishaps. Contractors will not release the information to personnel who do not have
     safety responsibilities; for example, privileged safety information will not be released to
     the general counsel‘s office or public relations personnel. The number of contractor
     employees who have access to the information shall be strictly limited to only those
     individuals who have a need to know the information in order to enhance the safety of the
     Air Force weapon systems. After a project is complete, contractors will not maintain the
     information in their files and will ensure all items are destroyed. Contractors must
     understand and agree to their responsibilities to treat such information as confidential.
     See paragraphs 3.3., 3.3.3., and 3.7
        3.7.3.5.1. Contractors who built, designed, or maintained equipment involved in
        mishaps send representatives to support Air Force SIBs at the request of the Air
        Force. SIB presidents and safety investigators will ensure those representatives
        understand that the Air Force may, at the contractor‘s request, extend a claim of
        privilege over documents provided by the contractor representatives to the SIB when
        the Air Force maintains sole possession or control. A claim of privilege may not be
        sustained over notes, documents, and other matter produced during the SIB
        investigation by the contractor but retained by the contractor representatives. SIB
        president grants these contractors access to privileged safety information only if it is
        essential to assist the SIB.
        3.7.3.5.2. Contractors providing weapon system maintenance support are performing
        an Air Force function. The wing chief of safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, or AFSC
        may provide the contractors safety information for AF safety purposes.
        3.7.3.5.3. Air Force operations conducted at contractors‘ facilities require privileged
        safety information handling.

        3.7.3.5.4. Contractors providing weapon system crew training are performing an Air
        Force function, and need privilege safety information from safety reports, videos, and
        other similar media to build training scenarios. The wing chief of safety, NAF/SE,
        MAJCOM/SE, or AFSC may provide the contractors privilege safety reports for this
        function.
        3.7.3.5.5. Contractors who instruct safety programs in mishap investigation or safety
        program management contracted by the Air Force or ARC require access to
        privileged safety information. The wing chief of safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, or
        AFSC may provide the contractors safety reports for this function.
        3.7.3.5.6. Contractors who build, design, maintain, or operate Air Force weapon
        systems, their components, or other Air Force equipment may need privileged safety
        information to correct defects or other problems and prevent future mishaps. The
        wing chief of safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, System Program Office safety officer
        or equivalent, or AF/SE or AFSC/CD may provide contractors privileged safety
        information for this function. This includes Space System Contractors, Space
        Technical Support Contractors, Advisory & Assistance Services (A&AS), and
        Federally Funded Research & Development Centers when they are performing an Air
        Force function.
        3.7.3.5.7. Contractors performing AF safety mission may require privileged safety
        information. Wing Chief of Safety, NAF/SE, MAJCOM/SE, or AFSC authorize
        access to privileged safety information for this function.
        3.7.3.5.8. Any other release of privileged safety information to contractors will first
        be approved by AF/SE or AFSC/CD.
     3.7.3.6. Limiting Release to Other Services and DoD Agencies. Other US military
     services and DoD agencies responsible for flying, supporting or maintaining Air Force
     aircraft may receive privileged safety information when needed for mishap prevention.
     Approval authority for exchanging formal safety reports with other military services is
     AF/SE, AFSC/CD or AFSC/JA. Joint project or program offices may share privileged
     safety information with members of other DoD agencies working on the same project or
     program without prior approval
     3.7.3.7. Limiting Release to Foreign Military Organizations. All agreements regarding
     the release of safety information to foreign military organizations are subject to the
     limitations and guidance found in DODI 6055.07. Release of safety information to
     NATO military organizations is governed by NATO STANAGs 3101, Exchange of
     Safety Information Concerning Aircraft and Missiles, and 3531, Safety Investigation and
     Reporting of Accidents/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft and/or UAVs (with US
     reservations).
        3.7.3.7.1. Foreign Nationals Flying USAF Aircraft or Participating in USAF
        Training. Release of safety information to foreign nationals is governed by DODI
        6055.07. Note that foreign national military personnel assigned to the DoD
        Components are defined as DoD military personnel by DODI 6055.07
        3.7.3.7.2. Comparable persons and offices within EPAF countries may have access to
        privileged information pertaining to F-16 mishaps only. These countries are
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                            41


          participants in the multinational fighter program of co-production of the F-16 with the
          United States, which predated DoDI 6055.7. The release authority (AF/SE) delegates
          to F-16 SIBs the authority to release applicable sections of F-16 final mishap message
          reports solely to the EPAF via password protected data transfer. This information is
          for mishap prevention purposes only.
      3.7.3.8. Limiting Release of Nuclear Safety Reports to Agencies outside the Air Force.
      AF/SE may approve the release of extracts of nuclear safety reports to US governmental
      agencies with statutory jurisdiction, such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency
      (DTRA); and operations offices or authorized contractors of the Department of Energy.
      The MAJCOM commander may provide DULL SWORD reports about weapons and
      common equipment deficiencies to the unified commander as deemed appropriate and
      necessary for the theater commander to accomplish his or her role in nuclear surety.
      Send this information by inclusion of the appropriate unified command address in the
      message report as provided by the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction. The unified
      commander ensures the information is treated as privileged information and not released
      or distributed outside the respective headquarters without first obtaining permission from
      AF/SE. The Air Force releases this information only to reach its nuclear surety goals.
      3.7.3.9. Limiting Release to NTSB and FAA. AFI 91-206, Participation in a Military or
      Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation governs the release of safety information to
      the NTSB and FAA for aviation mishaps. For other mishaps, use AFI 91-206 as a guide.
      3.7.3.10. Limiting Release to NASA and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).
      Applicable space safety reports will be distributed to NASA and NRO upon completion.
3.8. Handling and Disclosing Reports on Ground and Industrial, and Explosives and
Chemical Agents Mishaps that occurred before 3 Oct 00.
   3.8.1. The purpose of these reports is mishap prevention. The reports were normally
   considered general-use reports in that witnesses were not promised confidentiality, and the
   reports were not considered privileged. However, they are FOUO and are handled according
   to DoD Regulation 5400.7-R/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom Of Information Act Program.
   3.8.2. Do not disclose the identities of involved personnel in educational or promotional
   materials.
   3.8.3. These reports can be released outside the Air Force safety community and outside the
   Air Force once protected information, including Privacy Act information, findings, and
   recommendations are removed. The installation chief of safety is the release authority for
   providing these reports to other Air Force personnel. The reports may not be used for any
   purpose other than mishap prevention, with the exception that the complete report may be
   released to Air Force claims personnel to assist them in evaluating claims for damages filed
   against the Air Force. When release will be made outside the Air Force, AFSC/JA is the
   release authority.
   3.8.4. To control reports retain only one copy of each safety report at wing or base,
   intermediate command, and MAJCOM safety offices. Air Force and unified command
   agencies may view these reports for official purposes, but they do not release copies without
   approval of the appropriate disclosure authority. Advise personnel viewing these reports that
   findings of cause, conclusions, recommendations, corrective actions, and witness statements
 42                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   taken by safety investigators in the course of the investigation are used primarily for mishap
   prevention purposes. Refer all requests for release to AFSC/JA.
   3.8.5. Upon written request, AFSC/JA provides the releasable portions of ground and
   explosive safety reports to the requester.
3.9. Technical Orders (TOs) and Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs). TOs and
TCTOs, including maintenance manuals and flights manuals, are usually limited release
documents. They are often protected by Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22
U.S.C. 2778); the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C app. 2401-2420); or the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). Written approval (E-
mail is acceptable) must be obtained from the technical content manager prior to including
extracts of these documents in SIB reports. Include a copy of the approval in the formal report.
3.10. Actual or Potential Compromise of Privileged Safety Information
3.10.1. Policy.
       3.10.1.1. It is Air Force policy that unauthorized releases of privileged information will
       be thoroughly investigated to minimize any possible damage to national security and to
       continue to ensure safety privilege is protected. The investigation will identify
       appropriate corrective actions that will be immediately implemented to prevent future
       unauthorized releases.
       3.10.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of privileged safety
       information shall be reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and
       circumstances of the unauthorized disclosure, the extent of the disclosure, and any
       ramifications on protecting it from further release, and the corrective and disciplinary
       action to be taken.
       3.10.1.3. A compromise of privileged safety information occurs when unauthorized
       individuals are knowingly, willfully, or negligently given access to privileged safety
       information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals who do not have a
       safety need-to-know. Refer to paragraph 3.7
3.10.2. Reporting and Notifications
       3.10.2.1. Personnel who learn of an unauthorized release of privileged safety information
       should immediately report it to their MAJCOM Safety office, who will in-turn report the
       incident to the Air Force Safety Center.
3.10.3. Formal Investigation
       3.10.3.1. The convening authority of the safety investigation board responsible for the
       unauthorized release (or his or her subordinate commander), or the staff agency chief of
       the activity responsible for the incident, will appoint an investigating officer to conduct a
       formal investigation to determine if privileged safety information was improperly
       released, the extent of the unauthorized release, and the circumstances surrounding the
       release.
       3.10.3.2. A formal investigation is a detailed examination of evidence to determine the
       extent and seriousness of the unauthorized release of privileged safety information. The
       formal investigation will identify responsibility for any disregard (deliberate or
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                            43


      inadvertent) of governing directives which led to the unauthorized release. The
      investigating official must be senior to all individuals suspected of an unauthorized
      release.
      3.10.3.3. The guidelines for selection of the investigating officer are:
         3.10.3.3.1. The investigative official is the personal representative of the Convening
         Authority and/or the Commander. The investigative official must be impartial,
         unbiased, objective, thorough, and available. The investigative official must also
         understand protecting privileged safety information and should receive a briefing
         from AFSC/JA on protecting privileged information.
         3.10.3.3.2. The investigative official must be a commissioned officer, senior NCO
         (E-7 and above), or a civil service employee equivalent (GS-9 or NSPS equivalent
         and above).
         3.10.3.3.3. The investigation will be the investigative official‘s only duty (unless the
         Convening Authority determines otherwise) until the report is completed and
         approved by the Convening Authority.
         3.10.3.3.4. Appointing Authorities will not appoint an investigative official who is
         retiring, separating, being deployed, or being reassigned within 180 days.
      3.10.3.4. The investigating officer should specifically address:
         3.10.3.4.1. When, where, and how the incident occurred.
         3.10.3.4.2. Was privileged safety information released improperly?
         3.10.3.4.3. If unauthorized release occurred, what specific information and/or
         material was involved?
         3.10.3.4.4. In what specific media article or program did the privileged information
         appear?
         3.10.3.4.5. To what extent was the privileged safety information disseminated?
         3.10.3.4.6. Was the information properly marked and password protected before
         being disseminated?
         3.10.3.4.7. Was the information officially released?
         3.10.3.4.8. Are there any leads to be investigated that might lead to the identification
         of the person responsible for the release?
      3.10.3.5. Investigating officers must complete the investigation within 30 duty days from
      appointment, unless the Convening Authority grants an extension.
3.10.4. Management and Oversight.
      3.10.4.1. The investigating officer will route the completed report through Safety
      channels before forwarding it to the Convening Authority.
      3.10.4.2. The Convening Authority will:
         3.10.4.2.1. Close the investigation unless MAJCOM/FOA/DRU directives indicate
         otherwise.

     3.10.4.2.2. If an unauthorized release has been found, the Convening Authority or
     commander will take appropriate administrative or disciplinary action pursuant to the
     UCMJ, civilian personnel rules, or governing contract provisions.
     3.10.4.2.3. Debrief anyone who has had unauthorized access.
     3.10.4.2.4. Forward a copy of the completed report to the Convening Authority/SE
     with courtesy copy to AFSC/JA identifying corrective actions taken.
     3.10.4.2.5. Dispose of the report according to the instructions in WebRims Records
     Disposition Schedule.

                                           Chapter 4

                  DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY

4.1. General Information. The Air Force generally assigns mishap investigative
responsibilities to the command (MAJCOM) that experienced the loss of an assigned/owned
asset (personnel or property). The command (MAJCOM) with investigative responsibility may
or may not have Operation Control (OPCON) over the asset (property). In some cases, mishaps
may involve assets or individuals from multiple agencies. Follow the guidance in this chapter to
determine investigative responsibility.
4.2. Convening Authority Determination. The convening authority is the individual who has
the authority to order a safety investigation. The MAJCOM/CC of the organization that owns
the asset is considered to be the convening authority unless: AF/SE assumes investigative
responsibility, another MAJCOM/CC assumes investigative responsibility (with the concurrence
of the owning organization and AF/SE), or investigative responsibility is delegated to a lower
level of command.
   4.2.1. For all on-duty Class A, all nuclear Class A, and all NUCFLASH, BROKEN
   ARROW or BENT SPEAR mishaps, the MAJCOM/CC is the convening authority. This
   authority will not be delegated to a subordinate commander. EXCEPTION: ARC Class A
   mishaps that are not aviation mishaps (paragraph 4.5)
   4.2.2. For all other mishaps and events, convening authority may be delegated to an
   appropriate level of command.
   4.2.2. (AFMC) EXCEPTION: The applicable center commander is the convening
   authority for Class B, C, and D mishaps, and Class E events unless assumed by the
   AFMC/CC. The center commander may delegate convening authority for Class C and D
   mishaps, and Class E events to the applicable wing commander provided they have a wing
   safety office. Center commanders/directors may not delegate convening authority for
   directed energy Class C and D mishaps or Class E events.
   4.2.3. The Owning Unit is that unit which has permanent possession and mishap-reporting
   accountability for the assets and personnel involved in the mishap. For mishaps involving
   multiple ―owning‖ units within the same command, the units involved will mutually agree
   who will assume convening authority and mishap reporting responsibilities. In cases where
   agreement cannot be reached, the MAJCOM/CC will determine the accountable
   organization.
   4.2.4. For UAS mishaps where damage is confined to the UAV, the owning MAJCOM is the
   organization that owns the UAV, regardless of the controlling organization.
4.3. Mishaps Involving Multiple Commands. Involved MAJCOM/CCs will determine which
command will assume investigative responsibility and advise AF/SE within 24 hours. In
general, the command whose asset initiated the mishap will assume investigative responsibility.
If mishap initiation is initially unclear, the command sustaining the highest level of loss in the
mishap will assume investigative responsibility. MAJCOM/CC may determine other compelling
reasons exist for assigning investigative responsibility differently. If MAJCOMs cannot reach
agreement, AF/SE will determine mishap investigation responsibility.
 46                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Mishap accountability must be clearly established prior to test
   operations. When tests involve multiple MAJCOMS, mishap accountability is generally
   assigned to the MAJCOM whose asset initiated the event. Due to the nature of testing,
   mishap initiation may be unclear. (e.g., did the test widget, the test procedures or the
   participating aircrew cause the mishap?) Therefore, MOAs are preferred for tests involving
   multiple MAJCOMs and should assign accountability to AFMC during test events when
   AFMC is the responsible test organization. HQ AFMC/SE is the coordinating OPR for
   MOAs related to mishap investigation responsibility. HQ AFMC/A3F is the coordinating
   OPR for all MOAs related to aircraft possession, assignment and loans.
4.4. Mishaps Involving Multiple Services. For a multi-service or joint operational mishap,
follow most current Memorandum of Understanding among the US Army, Air Force and Naval
Safety Centers, Headquarters Marine Corps (Safety Division) and the US Coast Guard Health
and Safety Directorate for Safety Investigation and Reporting of Joint Service Mishaps (see
Attachment 6).      MAJCOM/SE should contact AFSC/SEF to determine investigative
responsibility.
4.5. Mishaps Involving Air Reserve Component Assets. The convening authority for all ARC
Class A aviation mishaps is the gaining MAJCOM/CC. For all other mishaps and events,
convening authority is determined by the AFRC/CC or NGB/CF as applicable.
4.6. Mishaps Involving NATO Systems or Personnel. Investigate and report mishaps
involving Air Force aircraft, space vehicles, or missiles according to this instruction. Comply
with NATO STANAG 3102, Flight Safety Co-operation in Common Ground/Air Space, 3318,
Aeromedical Aspects of Aircraft Accident/Incident Investigation, 3531, Safety Investigation and
Reporting of Accidents/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft and/or UAVs (with US
reservations), and AIR STD 85/02A, Investigation of Aircraft/Missile Accidents/Incidents (with
US reservations). The investigation required under STANAG 3531 is in addition to, and
conducted separately from, the investigation required by this instruction.
4.7. Mishaps Involving Non-NATO Foreign Military Equipment or Personnel in
CONUS. It is desirable to conduct only one safety investigation that has the full support and
participation of all involved nations. However, separate investigations are authorized if
necessary due to law, agreement, or procedure.
   4.7.1. When a mishap/event involves only foreign military assets and/or personnel, the
   foreign nation military authorities are responsible for the investigation. The USAF generally
   reserves the right to participate as an observer on the foreign safety investigation or, if no
   investigation is conducted, the right to conduct its own safety investigation.
   4.7.2. When a mishap/event involves a foreign military aircraft and a US civilian aircraft in
   the CONUS, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has priority over the
   investigation. See paragraph 4.8
   4.7.3. When a mishap/event involves both USAF and foreign assets and/or personnel
   (military or civilian), the Air Force will conduct a safety investigation. Depending on the
   circumstances the NTSB may take priority over the investigation.
4.8. Mishaps Involving Civil Aviation or Commercial Spacelift and/or Federal Air Traffic
Services.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                         47


   4.8.1. The NTSB investigates mishaps involving both Air Force and civil aircraft that occur
   within US jurisdiction. The Air Force may send an observer to the NTSB investigation
   and/or may conduct a separate investigation. However, the NTSB has priority over all
   evidence.
   4.8.2. Air Force mishaps that occur within US jurisdiction involving commercial spacelift
   may be investigated by the NTSB, the FAA/AST, and the commercial vendor depending on
   the extent of the mishap. The Air Force may send an observer to any of these investigations
   and/or may conduct a separate investigation. If the NTSB leads the investigation, the NTSB
   has priority over all evidence. See AFMAN 91-222 for more information.
   4.8.3. See AFI 91-206 for guidance on NTSB, FAA, and Air Force cooperation in these
   investigations.
4.9. Mishaps Involving Contractors.
   4.9.1. Government contractor involvement.
      4.9.1.1. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable
      damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1), the MAJCOM/CC administering
      the contract is the convening authority. Convening authority may be delegated IAW
      paragraph 4.2 The convening authority will ensure the mishap is investigated and
      reported IAW this instruction and the terms of the contract.
      4.9.1.2. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable
      damage or injury to another DoD agency (paragraph 1.3.1.1), the MAJCOM/CC
      administering the contract will ensure all mishap information is sent to the involved
      agency with an information copy to AFSC.
      4.9.1.3. If another DoD agency administers the contract and the mishap involves
      reportable damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1), the MAJCOM who
      suffered the loss will ensure the mishap is investigated and reported according to this
      instruction.
   4.9.2. Mishaps Involving Non-Accepted Air Force Aerospace Vehicles. The MAJCOM/CC
   who negotiates the contract for the aerospace vehicle is the convening authority. Convening
   authority may be delegated IAW paragraph 4.2 The convening authority is responsible for
   the safety investigation and reporting, although the aerospace vehicle may not be under the
   operational control of the Air Force. The aerospace vehicle loss is recorded as a mishap to
   the Air Force at large (paragraph 1.7).
   4.9.3. Mishaps involving Aerospace Vehicles Leased to a Non-DoD Organization for
   Modification, Maintenance, Repair, Test, Contract Training, or Experimental Project for a
   DoD Component, when the Government has assumed Ground and Flight Risk. The
   MAJCOM/CC who negotiates the contract for the aerospace vehicle is the convening
   authority. Convening authority may be delegated IAW paragraph 4.2 The convening
   authority is responsible for the safety investigation and reporting, although the aerospace
   vehicle may not be under the operational control of the Air Force. The aerospace vehicle
   loss is recorded as a mishap to the Air Force at large (paragraph 1.6).
 48                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


      4.9.3.1. AFMC centers normally negotiate all aircraft and engine leases. If another
      agency negotiates a lease, the agency and HQ AFMC shall determine who the convening
      authority will be prior to executing the lease.
   4.9.4. Other Aerospace Vehicle Contractor Mishaps. If a mishap involves government-
   furnished or leased aerospace vehicles, or new production aerospace vehicles (accepted by
   the Air Force on a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, but not yet
   delivered), the MAJCOM/CC of the command negotiating the contract/lease is the convening
   authority unless otherwise specified in the contract/lease agreement. In cases where
   contract/lease agreements specify investigative jurisdiction, follow the terms of such
   agreements. In no case will a non-Air Force agency have safety investigation jurisdiction.
4.10. Civilian Occupational Mishaps.
   4.10.1. OSHA will be notified when an on-duty mishap resulting in an Air Force civilian
   employee fatality, to include heart attack victims, or involving the inpatient hospitalization of
   three or more people (one of which must be a DoD civilian employee) within 8 hours of an
   on-duty mishap (paragraph 2.7.7.3).
   4.10.2. OSHA officials may accompany Air Force safety investigators as observers, or they
   may conduct a separate investigation of occupational mishaps involving either a DoD civilian
   fatality or the inpatient hospitalizations of three or more civilian personnel (one of which
   must be an on-duty DoD civilian employee). Ensure Air Force personnel accompany OSHA
   officials.
4.11. Special Circumstances.
   4.11.1. Mishaps Involving Friendly Fire. Unless otherwise agreed, the Service whose forces
   suffer the preponderance of loss or injury will conduct a safety investigation at the discretion
   of the Combatant Commander and, after consultation and coordination with the Combatant
   Commander, through the Combatant Commander‘s Service Component. For mishaps
   involving other friendly nations, the involved Service Safety Chief shall consult with the
   DUSD (Installations and Environment) and the Combatant Commander to determine what
   role the other involved nations will play in the investigation. In those circumstances where
   the only forces lost or injured are those of other friendly nations, the Service conducting the
   safety investigation will be determined at the discretion of the Combatant Commander.
   Refer to DoDI 6055.07 and the Joint Service MOU (Attachment 6) for specific guidance on
   command relationships and reporting requirements.
   4.11.2. Mishaps Involving Potential Criminal Acts. If safety investigators discover evidence
   of criminal acts causal to the mishap, they must immediately stop the investigation and notify
   the convening authority. The convening authority shall notify the responsible Military
   Criminal Investigative Organization, IAW DoDI 6055.07 (change 1), paragraphs 5.2.6.2 and
   E4.7.3, when he or she determines there is credible evidence of criminal activity. The
   convening authority will, after coordinating with AF/SE, determine whether the safety
   investigation should continue or be suspended pending the criminal investigation. Safety
   investigators will contact AFSC/JA to discuss this issue.
      4.11.2.1. If the convening authority decides to suspend the safety investigation,
      investigators will give all non-privileged material to the legal investigators, provide them
      with the names of all known witnesses and safeguard all privileged material.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                               49


                                            Chapter 5

                                 SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General Information. The convening authority determines the depth of investigative effort
required for each mishap, subject to this instruction and the appropriate discipline specific safety
manual (AFMAN 91-22X). Several factors influence the depth of investigative effort required:
severity of injury or occupational illness, future mishap potential, and whether another agency‘s
investigation will produce a report the Air Force can use for mishap prevention. Other agencies,
such as the local police or NTSB, may investigate mishaps that occur within their jurisdiction. A
separate Air Force investigation will be completed when required by this instruction, however,
the safety investigator may use the other agencies‘ reports and information when applicable.
5.2. Investigation Timeline. The safety investigation should be completed within 30 days of
the mishap (See Table 6.2 for reporting time lines and exceptions). The investigation should
place a greater priority on a complete and accurate safety report than on trying to finish in the 30
day timeline. If the investigation cannot be completed within this 30 day period, the SIB/SIO
will request an extension from the convening authority. The SIB/SIO will annotate the extension
and who it was approved by (office symbol) in each status message. EXCEPTION: There may
be standing agreements for certain types of mishaps where the 30 day suspense is extended (see
the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X)).
5.3. Investigation Funding.
   5.3.1. Local Support. The commander of the Air Force installation hosting the SIB funds all
   in-house support even if the host installation is not assigned to the investigating MAJCOM.
   See paragraph 5.3.5 for expenses that exceed the resources of the host installation.
   Occasionally, SIBs are required to work in areas where military support is not available.
   When civilian services are required, the Mission Support Group Commander at the
   installation supporting the SIB should assign imprest and contracting officers. The imprest
   officer will have authority and funds to pay for all support requirements (DoD Financial
   Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 5, Disbursing Policy & Procedure, Chapter 2,
   Section 0209, Imprest Funds). The contracting officer must have a warrant (authority) to
   purchase equipment and services for the board.
       5.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/FM developed the Emergency and Special
       Program (ESP) code of SI (Sierra India) to identify safety investigation expenditures.
       Use this ESP code on all safety investigation-related TDY orders and funding, to include
       technical assistance. Consult local FM office for specifics.
   5.3.2. TDY Travel. Each MAJCOM, via their respective wings/units, funds TDY of its
   assigned personnel who are Air Force SIB members or technical experts. TDY SIB members
   should be placed on full per diem for the duration of the SIB. Dual billeting, variations
   authorized, and rental car should be authorized. For joint service boards, each service funds
   its own members‘ TDY. The investigating MAJCOM funds travel costs of members from
   another service appointed to an Air Force SIB. Observers to an Air Force SIB fund their own
   TDY.
   5.3.3. Contractor support. Normally contractors travel via their own funding. To provide
   easier access to the base and its facilities required during the investigation, the contractor
 50                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   may request a Letter of Identification from the Contracting Officer. The convening authority
   will honor these requests. The Letter of Identification will not have a fund cite, i.e., no cost
   to the government. Joint Travel Regulations, Volume 2, Appendix E, Part I, paragraph D and
   E are applicable.
   5.3.4. Other Support. The convening authority funds leasing of special equipment/vehicles,
   leased communications, and other contractual services. For technical assistance and
   laboratory analysis (paragraph 5.5) from non-Air Force specialist, the convening authority or
   SM may have to provide funding to obtain a response.
   5.3.5. Cost Overruns. Request an operating budget authority (OBA) adjustment per AFI 65-
   601, Volume 2, Budget Management for Operations, if investigation costs cannot be
   financed through reprogramming within the OBA.
5.4. Investigation Options. The size and membership of the investigation depends on the
category and complexity of the mishap being investigated. The investigation must have the
correct complement of members to properly complete the investigation. Investigations may be
made up of multiple members (SIB), or a single member (SIO). Refer to the discipline specific
safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for requirements. The SIB will inform the convening authority
of all members of the investigation (SIB members, observers, and technical experts).
   5.4.1. Safety Investigation Boards (SIB). SIBs are made up of multiple members assigned to
   investigate a mishap. Contractor representatives will not be primary members of a SIB.
   They are technical experts providing assistance to the SIB.
       5.4.1.1. At least one SIB member must be equal to or senior in rank to the senior person
       directly involved in the mishap. Normally, the SIB president is the senior SIB member.
       5.4.1.2. Select SIB members who do not have a personal interest in the investigation and
       who are able to act impartially. SIB members will be selected from outside the mishap
       wing whenever possible.
       5.4.1.3. Select a SIB member qualified in safety investigation for each safety discipline
       involved in the mishap.
       5.4.1.4. Do not assign foreign exchange officers or other foreign officers serving with the
       USAF as formal SIB members. This exclusion does not apply to AFSC SIB
       representatives. Comply with provisions in standing international agreements.
       5.4.1.5. ARC participation in SIBs. Convening authority may appoint Reservists/Air
       National Guardsmen to SIBs with the concurrence of the AFRC/National Guard Bureau
       (NGB). Ensure SIB duties do not create a conflict of interest with the individual's
       civilian occupation or interests. MAJCOMS may execute MOUs/MOAs with AFRC and
       NGB to outline processes for nominating SIB members as needed on ARC-involved
       mishaps.
          5.4.1.5.1. AFRC. Air Reserve Technicians may elect to participate in either military
          or civilian status, as appropriate. Traditional reservists will be in a military status.
          5.4.1.5.2. ANG. ANG personnel may elect to participate in either military or
          technician status, as appropriate.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           51


       5.4.1.6. All safety investigations involving ARC assets that are conducted by a SIB shall
       be permitted to have at least one member selected by the AFRC or NGB, as applicable.
       5.4.1.7. (Added-AFMC) Civilians assigned to center/wing safety offices who have
       previous Air Force aircraft qualification (pilot or navigator) and are graduates of the
       AMIC or FSO course may perform IO duties on a flight SIB.
   5.4.2. Single Investigating Officer (SIO). Depending on the circumstances of the mishap, an
   individual investigator may be appointed to conduct the investigation.
   5.4.3. Air Force Participation in Non-Air Force Investigations.           When Air Force
   representation to another Service‘s investigation is desired, AFSC will contact the
   MAJCOM(s) that can best meet the requirement. The MAJCOM/SE will coordinate the
   selection with AFSC. Once AF/SE approves the nominee, AFSC will provide a fund site to
   the MAJCOM and establish direct communication with the individual. Air Force
   representatives to Joint Safety Investigations should be graduates of formal Air Force safety
   training courses.
   5.4.4. Participation in Air Force Investigations by Non-Air Force Personnel. Sometimes a
   mishap involves weapon systems or equipment common to another US military service or
   agency (FAA, NASA, etc.). In these cases personnel from the other service or agency may
   request to observe the Air Force investigation. AFSC forwards these requests to the
   convening authority. Refer to AFI 91-206 and applicable MOAs/MOUs for interagency
   involvement. Observers are authorized to observe SIB activities and may participate to the
   extent authorized by the SIB president and published guidance. An observer is not a member
   of the Air Force SIB. Non-DoD observers may participate to the extent authorized by the
   SIB president. This should not include non-DoD observers‘ participation in or access to
   direct confidential testimony. EXCEPTION: For NTSB and FAA observers, see AFI 91-
   206.
   5.4.5. UAS operations often require the creation of two ISBs to preserve evidence. The
   primary ISB is located at the base with the aircrew controlling the mission of the aircraft.
   The second ISB is located at the launch and recovery ground control station. The primary
   ISB will collect all of the supporting evidence from the second ISB.
   5.4.6. In accordance with USD (AT&L) policy memo, all system-related Class A and B
   mishap investigation reports must include the System Program Office analysis of hazards that
   contributed to the accident and recommendations for materiel risk mitigation measures,
   especially those that minimize potential human errors.
5.5. Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance and Laboratory Analysis. When the
investigation is beyond the expertise of the SIB/SIO, request technical assistance.
5.5. (AFMC)Program managers provide their installation center safety office with updated
rosters of qualified technical expert members semiannually (January, July). The roster will
have, as a minimum, a primary and alternate member for all major areas needed to support each
weapon system (when staffing levels at the installation permit).
   5.5.1. For all Class A and B mishaps, technical assistance and laboratory analysis will be
   requested through AFSC IAW published convening authority procedures. For all other
52                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


  mishap classes, technical assistance and laboratory analysis are available through AFSC.
  NOTE: See Attachment 2 for technical assistance contact information.
  5.5.2. Using Technical Experts.
     5.5.2.1. Technical experts supporting an investigation are under the control and authority
     of the SIB president or SIO. This applies to DOD military and civilian personnel as well
     as contractor representatives. The SIB president or SIO should include technical experts
     in deliberations to formulate valid findings and viable recommendations.
     5.5.2.2. Upon completion of their investigations, technical experts must provide a written
     report detailing results of their work. Suggested (but not mandatory) report formats are
     detailed in Figures 5.1 and 5.2.
     5.5.2.3. SIB presidents and SIOs must ensure a "non-disclosure statement" on protection
     of privileged data is prepared (Figure A3.7.) and endorsed by all non-Air Force SIB
     members (e.g., contractors, NTSB, FAA, etc.) offered a promise of confidentiality or
     provided access to privileged information. NOTE: See paragraph 3.2.5.2. for safety
     investigations where a promise of confidentiality is authorized. This memorandum is not
     required from Air Force civilian employees.
  5.5.3. Reports from Technical Experts.
     5.5.3.1. Reports from technical experts will be written for Part I, Part II, or both parts of
     the SIB report.
     5.5.3.1.1. A technical report written for Part I will contain observations, analysis, and
     conclusions based solely on physical evidence, other factual information, and statements
     provided without a promise of confidentiality. This includes factual information
     presented during SIB discussions where the technical expert is present. This also
     includes focus on key factual data, detailed system descriptions or background
     information when it supports a technical expert‘s conclusions. Conclusions may address
     causes of the observed or documented conditions, but will NOT address the causes of the
     mishap. This does not preclude stating an opinion that a failure would likely create a
     certain condition, even if the mishap was inevitable under such a condition.
     Recommendations which relate to preventing the observed conditions may be included,
     but they will NOT address preventing the mishap. The SIB/SIO will thoroughly review
     all Part I reports from technical experts to ensure they do not contain privileged
     information. See Figure 5.1 for the suggested Technical Expert Report Format, Part I.
     5.5.3.1.2. A technical report written for Part II may contain analysis, conclusions and
     recommendations based on privileged information to include confidential statements,
     appointed SIB member deliberations, or proprietary company information. Part II of the
     technical report is not meant to duplicate information provided in Part I, but to provide
     supplemental analysis and conclusions to assist the SIB in determining causes and
     recommendations. A Part II report is not required if technical expert analysis and
     conclusions can be based solely on physical evidence, other factual data, and statements
     made without a promise of confidentiality. See Figure A3.8. for the cover sheet on
     privileged reporting.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                               53


            5.5.3.1.3. Contractor representatives requesting a claim of privilege/confidentiality of
            technical reports may submit a Part II only report, provided the Air Force maintains
            sole possession or control (paragraph 3.3.3.5.1). In this case, follow the Figure 5.2
            Technical Expert Report Format, Part I and mark the entire document as a privileged
            report.
       5.5.3.1.4. If conflicting reports from different technical experts or laboratories are
       received, include both reports in the formal report. In the investigative narrative, provide
       rationale explaining why one report is more applicable and why opposing views were
       discounted.
   5.5.4. (Added-AFMC) When laboratory analysis or DR is required for a component, the
   SIB president has the option to designate an individual (fully briefed on all factors involved
   in the mishap) to accompany the item. This individual will observe the laboratory analysis or
   DR and will request a preliminary written evaluation for the SIB.

Investigator: Name, organizational address, and phone numbers.
INTRODUCTION: Factual Report of (state the intent of the report or analysis; purpose).
BACKGROUND: Not always required. If used, a statement of the mishap scenario, limited to
facts.
OBSERVATIONS: Investigator observations of physical evidence, other factual data, and
statements made without a promise of confidentiality.
ANALYSIS: Investigator evaluation of physical evidence, other factual data and statements
made without a promise of confidentiality. Describe strong and weak points of analysis if
appropriate. Examples:
CONCLUSIONS: Investigator conclusions and opinions based on analysis of physical evidence,
other factual data and statements made without a promise of confidentiality. Do not include any
opinion as to whether a particular failure contributed to or caused the mishap. This does not
preclude stating an opinion that a failure would likely create a certain condition, even if the
mishap was inevitable under such a condition. For example, an opinion could be expressed that a
widget failure would have caused trim to move to the full nose up position, without making the
connecting statement that such a trim position would inevitably cause a crash. Other examples?
Example 1
OBSERVATIONS: Three of the four right wing leading edge flap (LEF) actuators were
recovered intact but separated from the wing. Measurement of each actuator‘s angular position
revealed the following: 19.2 degrees down, 20.3 degrees down, and 19.8 degrees down.
ANALYSIS: The right wing LEF actuator positions correlated well with the expected LEF
position of 19.6 degrees down based on the Mach, altitude, and AOA recorded by the CSFDR
 54                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


system just prior to impact.
CONCLUSION: The LEF on the right wing was properly positioned.
Example 2
OBSERVATIONS: The radome was found separated from the fuselage with relatively minor
impact damage. The right AOA probe was bent; however, the slots appeared to be rotated up
farther than normal, even taking into account impact damage. The left AOA probe sustained
only minor damage and rotated freely. The left probe mid-range positioning differed
significantly from what is expected of a correctly aligned probe. The pitot probe was not
recovered.
ANALYSIS: The left and right AOA transmitters were removed to determine the actual mid-
range (boresight) angle. The right AOA transmitter mid-range angle, as determined by
alignment ring location, was 25.5° up; this is approximately 45° higher than the required mid-
range value of 20° down. The right AOA alignment ring was incorrectly positioned. Removal
of the left transmitter revealed it was also improperly installed. Only one of the two dowel pins
was seated into the alignment ring. In addition, the left AOA alignment ring was also incorrectly
positioned. The mid-travel angle of the left probe, as boresighted, was determined to be
approximately 117° down, producing a positioning error of 97° down. The alignment and
installation errors combined to produce a mid travel range of approximately 55° up or a total
position error of 75°.
CONCLUSIONS: Both AOA transmitters were incorrectly installed. The position of the right
AOA transmitter would cause an erroneously large AOA signal to be supplied to the flight
control computer. The position of the left AOA transmitter would also cause an erroneously
large AOA signal to be supplied to the flight control computer. Since a mid-value AOA
selection process is used by the flight control computer, an erroneously large AOA signal was
used by the flight control computer.

5.6. Controlling Information Collected by the SIB/SIO. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure that
all information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators, is not released outside safety
channels except in accordance with this instruction or upon approval of the convening authority.
The SIB president/SIO is the final point of release for all information (including
electronic/digital media, photographs, etc.) from the safety investigation.
   5.6.1. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure that everyone working on their team is briefed on the
   restrictions. Every member of a safety investigation team that produces a formal report will
   sign the memorandum at Figure 5.3 acknowledging the guidance and restrictions placed on
   information gathered during a safety investigation. The memorandum will be filed in Tab A
   of the formal report.
5.6.2. The SIB/SIO is not prohibited from sharing information with technical experts who,
although not members of a board, analyze information or wreckage on behalf of safety
investigators.
   5.6.3. Part 1 information is releasable to the AIB. However, portions of Part 1 are not
   releasable to the public since it may include information protected by the Privacy Act or
   Export Control Act contained in Part 1.

Figure 5.3. Memorandum Documenting Guidance to Investigators on Controlling
Information.
1. The members, whose names and signatures appear below, of the safety team formed to
investigate the mishap on (date of mishap) involving (aircraft/vehicle/equipment/etc.) have been
advised by (name of board president/SIO) of the following:
a. This investigation is being conducted under the provisions of AFI 91-204 for the purpose of
mishap prevention within the United States Air Force and to determine all factors relating to the
mishap in order to prevent future mishaps.
b. It is very important that the investigating team avoid: tainting potential witnesses for this or
any subsequent investigation; contributing to speculation about mishap causes; or releasing
potentially offensive images to friends and/or families of those involved in a mishap.
c. All information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators, will not be released
outside safety channels except in accordance with AFI 91-204 or upon approval of the convening
authority. The SIB president is the final point of release for all information (including
electronic/digital media, photographs, etc.) from the safety investigation.
2. We understand and acknowledge the guidelines for controlling information collected by
safety investigators. We understand unauthorized release of safety privilege information is
 56                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


punishable under Article 92(1), UCMJ, and may be grounds for disciplinary actions according to
civilian personnel regulations, or may lead to contract actions.
5.7. Investigative Evidence.
   5.7.1. Impounding Air Force Materiel/Wreckage. ISB/SIB/SIO have inherent priorities over
   other activities and investigations connected to the mishap (except criminal), including the
   right to impound Air Force property involved in the mishap. Group commanders or higher
   are required to act on their impoundment requests. However, safety of personnel (to include
   emergency response forces) and control of hazardous materials always take precedence over
   safety investigations, even at the risk of losing evidence. An installation commander in
   coordination with the ISB president or SIB president may choose to remove wreckage
   interfering with essential mission activities or causing a hazard at the mishap scene.
   Wreckage may need to be removed or destroyed to prevent interference with operations or
   vital civil functions. If wreckage must be moved prior to the arrival of the SIB/SIO,
   thoroughly document the site (photographs, video) prior to moving if time permits.
   5.7.2. Life Sciences Evidence. The SIB will have access to many forms of Life Sciences
   evidence, including protected and personal medical information. This SIB will comply with
   safety privilege and with the Privacy Act of 1974 to protect this information. Include only
   that medical and personal information that is relevant to the mishap or incident to avoid
   unnecessary violation of the individual(s) privacy. This includes the physical exam,
   laboratory and radiological testing of survivors, personal equipment, life support equipment,
   medical/dental/mental health/substance abuse/family advocacy charts and past histories and
   initial medical interviews, and other information which points to the mental and physical
   capability of the personnel involved in the mishap. Human remains are also evidence. The
   SIB medical member should be aware of where all remains are and what their status is, i.e.,
   awaiting autopsy, return to family, etc. Consult the mortuary officer of the supporting base
   to determine if civil authorities have jurisdiction over human remains. The mortuary officer
   should have an MOA/MOU with civil authorities according to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs
   Program. Safety personnel, ISB and SIB medical members shall ensure AFIP is notified and
   given contact information for civil authorities exercising jurisdiction over human remains
   when a fatal mishap occurs.
   5.7.3. Witnesses. Use the following guidelines for witnesses:
       5.7.3.1. Do not administer truth serums, hypnotic techniques, drugs, or polygraph tests.
       If a witness provides a statement while under medication, add a notation of what
       medications they are taking to their statement.
       5.7.3.2. If a witness refuses to testify, contact the commander, MAJCOM/SE,
       MAJCOM/JA and AFSC/JA.
       5.7.3.3. Do not have witnesses testify under oath. Ensure witnesses understand that they
       are obliged to give honest, good faith testimony. See paragraph 3.4.5 for a discussion on
       the promise of confidentiality.
       5.7.3.4. If a safety investigator believes Air Force personnel questioned in the
       investigation may be guilty of criminal misconduct, refer to paragraph 4.11.2
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                            57


     5.7.3.5. Interviewing witnesses suspected of criminal misconduct. If, after suspending a
     safety investigation because of potential criminal acts, the convening authority decides to
     continue the safety investigation, safety investigators may have to interview witnesses
     suspected of criminal misconduct. Contact AFSC/JA if the SIB is required to interview
     suspected criminals.
     5.7.3.6. Retaining Access to Participants. Safety investigators may need frequent access
     to or multiple interviews with participants in a mishap. Commanders will make all
     participants available to the investigation upon request of the SIB president/SIO. The
     SIB president/SIO will advise the commander when participants are no longer needed.
     5.7.3.7. Returning Participants to Duty. Safety investigators make no determinations
     regarding the fitness of participants to be returned to normal duties. Commanders decide
     if and when participants are to be returned to duty.
     5.7.3.8. Commercial Space Launch Mishap. Refrain from interviewing witnesses until
     the FAA/ NTSB representative has arrived, unless there is a compelling reason to take the
     witness‘ statement(s) immediately.
     5.7.3.9. This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the
     Privacy Act of 1974 as authorized by Title 10 United States Code, section 8013 and
     Executive Order 9397.
         5.7.3.9.1. Safety investigators will request the SSN of military members and civilian
         employees involved in reportable mishaps. Inform individuals that Title 10 USC
         8013 and EO 9397 are the legal authority for requesting the SSN and that the SSN
         will be used for safety mishap investigating and reporting.
  5.7.4. Disposing of Evidence.
     5.7.4.1. Operational assets. Once the investigation has recovered all necessary evidence
     from the asset involved in the mishap, the safety investigator will, at an appropriate time,
     advise the convening authority (after coordinating with the legal board if required) when
     the asset can be turned over to the operating unit. The legal board is responsible for
     operational assets given to them by the SIB. The convening authority is the final
     authority to release the asset to the operating unit. EXCEPTION: All wreckage from
     Class A space, aviation, and guided missile mishaps require a formal release from
     AFLOA/JACC before being released to the operating unit.
     5.7.4.2. Wreckage.
         5.7.4.2.1. After the SIB has gathered all necessary information from the wreckage,
         and there is a legal investigation, transfer custody of the wreckage to the legal board
         president in writing IAW AFMAN 91-22X.
         5.7.4.2.2. Release wreckage not needed in support of depot, laboratory, or the legal
         investigation to the host installation commander in writing for storage until the
         wreckage is released for disposal. AFLOA/JACC is the release authority for Class A
         space, aviation, and guided missile mishaps. The host legal office is the release
         authority for all other mishaps.

          5.7.4.2.3. All reasonable actions must be made to remove and properly dispose of
          wreckage. Special care must be given to the removal of all wreckage on private or
          state owned property.
      5.7.4.3. Other Evidence.
          5.7.4.3.1. For Class A mishaps, or when notified there will be a legal board for other
          mishaps, provide all non-privileged evidence (photographs, videotapes, data,
          documentation, and other evidence) to the legal board in writing IAW AFMAN 91-
          22X. The legal board will be responsible for final disposition of all material released
          to them by the SIB. For other than Class A mishaps, or when there is no legal board,
          contact the host installation staff judge advocate for guidance on disposing of
          materials that may be needed in potential claims or litigation. If there are no such
          requirements, reproduce enough copies for the safety report and then return the
          original documents and records used by the SIB to their proper custodian.
          5.7.4.3.2. In the case of fatalities, the disposition of human bodies and human tissue
          is dependent on who has legal jurisdiction over the remains; often this may be a local
          civilian coroner or medical examiner. Work with Mortuary Affairs and the local JA
          to clarify jurisdiction and disposition of human remains.
5.8. Identifying Hazards.
   5.8.1. The requirements in this section apply to all Class A and B mishaps. These same
   requirements can be applied to other occurrences if desired.
   5.8.2. Identify and document hazards that played a role in the mishap sequence. Hazards are
   defined as "any real or potential condition that can cause injury or occupational illness to
   personnel; damage to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or damage to the
   environment." Determine whether individuals or management addressed these hazards
   during preparation and execution of the mishap sequence.
   5.8.3. For system-related mishaps, determine whether the System Program Office previously
   identified the hazards that played a role in the mishap sequence and had included those
   hazards in its Systems Engineering System Safety ESOH risk management efforts.
5.9. Determining and Documenting Findings.
   5.9.1. Findings are based on the weight of evidence, professional knowledge, and good
   judgment.
   5.9.2. Each finding is a single event or condition. Each finding is an essential step in the
   mishap sequence, but each finding is not necessarily causal. Do not include any more
   information than is necessary to explain the event.
   5.9.3. Each finding must have a logical connection to preceding findings. If no logical
   relationship exists, the sequence of the mishap has not been correctly described.
   5.9.4. Ensure critical events required to sustain the mishap sequence have not been omitted.
   Conversely, do not include events interesting to the reader, but not necessary to sustain the
   mishap sequence.
   5.9.5. In some cases the sequence begins long before the actual mishap sequence with such
   things as design problems, improperly written directives, or an inadequate training program.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                             59


  5.9.6. Ensure the sequence continues to the point where all damage or injury has occurred
  and the initial rescue or recovery actions are completed.
  5.9.7. Include injuries occurring in the mishap, at the appropriate chronological point in the
  event sequence. For example, insert ejection injury events occurring before the aircraft-
  ground impact finding at the proper chronological point. Injuries or fatalities suffered by
  persons on the ground following a crash would be at the end of the main sequence, (e.g., "the
  Range Safety Officer successfully initiated the self-destruct sequence; debris from the launch
  booster crashed into a fishing boat, fatally injuring two people" or "the pilot ejected
  successfully; the aircraft crashed in a parking lot adjacent to the runway, fatally injuring two
  persons").
  5.9.8. Findings are arranged in chronological order. Number the findings consecutively.
  Precede each number with the word "Finding" (e.g., Finding 1, Finding 2, etc.).
  5.9.9. Write findings as full sentences, not bullet points. Use past tense, since the events
  occurred in the past. (Example: Incorrect – Crew chief clears pilot from chocks and the pilot
  taxis to runway. Correct – The crew chief cleared the pilot from the chocks and the pilot
  taxied to the runway.)
  5.9.10. When the safety investigator cannot pinpoint a correctable event in a sequence, list as
  much of the sequence as can be supported and insert a statement relating to the undetermined
  area. If there are supportable alternatives identify them as such and list them. Show them as
  subordinate to the applicable finding by using a format such as "event X most likely occurred
  due to one or more of the following reasons."
     5.9.10.1. The reasons should be listed from most probable to least probable.
     5.9.10.2. Do not list all of the possible alternatives that could have existed merely
     because they cannot be eliminated. Place this sort of conjecture in the analysis and
     narrative.
  5.9.11. Do not include people‘s names, call signs, names of Air Force bases or companies in
  the findings. Use terms such as "the aircraft," "the flight lead," "the wingman," "the F-16
  pilot," "the pilot," "the crew," "the instructor loadmaster," "the evaluator boom operator," or
  "the crewchief." Be specific, but do not include supporting evidence in the findings. The
  report narrative includes supporting evidence and conclusions.
  5.9.12. Findings shall not include new material not addressed in the narrative. If the finding
  is not identifiable in the narrative, you have not written the narrative completely.
  5.9.13. After developing the findings, apply the following "Findings Test" for validation:
     5.9.13.1. Is the Finding necessary to sustain the mishap sequence?
     5.9.13.2. Is the Finding a single event or condition?
     5.9.13.3. Is the Finding specific enough without including supporting evidence?
     5.9.13.4. Does the Finding logically connect to the preceding finding? Read the last
     finding; ask "why"? Does the finding above answer the "why"? Continue for each
     finding.
     5.9.13.5. Is the Finding relevant or simply interesting to the reader?
 60                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


5.10. Determining and Documenting Causes.
   5.10.1. A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely have
   prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury. Cause does not imply
   blame. The intent is to identify the point where corrective action is needed.
   5.10.2. Findings that sustained the mishap sequence, but were normal to the situation as it
   developed are not causal. In most instances a causal finding is correctable by commanders,
   supervisors, or individuals.
   5.10.3. Apply the reasonable person concept when determining a cause. If a person‘s
   performance or judgment was reasonable considering the mishap circumstances, do not
   assign cause. It is not appropriate to expect extraordinary or uniquely superior performance
   in such cases. Human factors (physiological or psychological) may be causal even though
   they are reasonable. These are often the unavoidable effects of a preceding cause.
   5.10.4. Do not list a party as causal for not taking an action unless they should reasonably
   have been expected to take such action, but they did not. Similar rationale applies to lack of
   a system or procedure. Do not list failure to provide a system or procedure as causal unless a
   party should reasonably have been expected to do so given the information available prior to
   the mishap.
   5.10.5. Risk management is an expected function for all organizations, and improper risk
   management is considered a deficiency that can be causal in a mishap. (See guidance in AFI
   91-202 and AFI 90-901). In cases where a mishap has identified hazards, there is a
   responsibility to assess the associated risks, evaluate risk mitigation options, implement risk
   management measures, evaluate the residual risks, document approval at the appropriate
   level (see AFI 91-202, chapter 11) to accept the expected residual risks in terms of
   consequences and probability of occurrence, and monitor the effectiveness of the risk control
   measures implemented. Each recurrence of a mishap requires a reassessment of the prior risk
   management decisions. Do not cite risk acceptance as a causal finding when all risk
   management functions were properly accomplished and a quantified level of risk was
   accepted at the appropriate level.
   5.10.6. Not every finding is causal. Some are effects or the expected result of a previously
   identified cause even though their inclusion sustains the sequence leading to the mishap. An
   engine flameout precipitated by a fuel boost pump failure is the expected result of the boost
   pump failure and is not causal. The boost pump failure may have been a result of an even
   earlier cause such as a bearing failure.
   5.10.7. Environmental conditions such as a bird strike, lightning, high wind, solar wind,
   meteorites, or flood, may be causal only if all reasonable avoidance and damage/injury
   mitigation actions were taken.
   5.10.8. An individual, group or organization is virtually always responsible for a failure.
   Publications or objects should almost never be found causal. Rather, the party responsible
   for ensuring the publications are correct or the party responsible for ensuring an object does
   not fail with catastrophic consequences is causal, unless the party took all reasonably
   expected actions. In such cases, there may be process or organizational failures, and
   appropriate parties may be identified as responsible for these failures.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                            61


      5.10.8.1. The intent of identifying causal parties in an investigation is to identify the
      point where corrective action is needed, not to place blame. As such, safety investigators
      need to ensure they identify the correct causal agent. This can be done by asking "Why"
      something occurred until the investigator comes to a "dead end."
   5.10.9. Occasionally, an investigator may not be able to conclusively determine a specific
   causal event. In these special cases, the investigator may choose to list two or three most
   probable causes for each option. In rare instances the causal event may be unknown.
   5.10.10. Causal findings should always be worded in active voice, clearly identifying the
   actor(s) and causal action (deficiency), along with any necessary explanation. Examples:
   Passive – No safety pins were installed in the widget. Active – The crew chief failed to
   install safety pins in the widget as required by tech orders. Passive – Mission planning did
   not cover en-route obstacles. Active – The crew failed to address en-route obstacles in
   mission planning as required.
   5.10.11. Identify causal findings by adding the word "CAUSE" to the beginning of the
   finding statement. Do not list causes under a separate heading. Word a causal finding as a
   clear and simple statement of a single condition or event.
   5.10.12. Causal findings should identify the causal agent ("Who") and the action taken
   ("What"). Why the action (or lack of action) occurred should be fully explained in the
   narrative and may be included in the causal finding if appropriate.
   5.10.13. After determining the causal findings, apply the following "Cause Test" for
   validation:
      5.10.13.1. Is the Causal Finding correctable by commanders, supervisors or individuals?
      5.10.13.2. Is the Causal Finding a clear and simple statement of a single condition or
      event?
      5.10.13.3. Is the Causal Finding in the active voice and does it follow the format: Who
      did what to whom/what and why?
      5.10.13.4. If the Causal Finding is an effect or an expected result of a previously
      identified cause, even though its inclusion sustains the mishap sequence, it is not causal.
5.11. Determining and Documenting Recommendations.
   5.11.1. Recommendations are feasible and effective solutions to eliminate identified hazards,
   or if the hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard‘s potential consequences. With
   few exceptions, all safety investigations (including Class E reports) should include
   recommendations to prevent or mitigate future mishaps. If no recommendations are made,
   investigators will explain their rationale in the report narrative. Ensure the investigation
   supports the recommendations. Do not make recommendations for the sole purpose of
   having recommendations.
   5.11.2. Developing feasible and effective recommendations is a methodical process, which
   seeks to identify risk mitigation alternatives. It is essential to know precisely what
   deficiency, or identified hazard, one is addressing and to stay focused on it.
   5.11.3. Developing sound recommendations also requires recognition of the "order of
   precedence" concept, which recognizes that not all risk mitigation alternatives are equal.
62                                                AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


  Design fixes are the most preferable solution because they can often completely eliminate the
  hazard, but these types of fixes often have the highest upfront costs. They may require
  unacceptable operational constraints so additional alternatives must be considered. Along
  with design fixes, one should look for potential fixes that incorporate safety and warning
  devices. Lastly, look at changes to procedures and training.
  5.11.4. All recommendations should target one or more of the hazards identified during the
  investigation. It is also sometimes prudent to make two or more recommendations against
  one hazard. In all cases use the order of precedence to develop risk mitigation alternatives.
  As an example, to eliminate or mitigate the identified hazard of "pilot‘s failure to command
  landing gear extension," which results in a gear-up landing of a training aircraft, one might
  consider the following:
     5.11.4.1. Design: Implement a fixed gear.
     5.11.4.2. Incorporate Safety Devices: Implement an auto-extend system.
     5.11.4.3. Provide Warning Devices: Implement cockpit warning lights, warning tone or
     voice.
     5.11.4.4. Develop Training and Procedures: Improve the written checklist, or its use via
     training with instructors and in simulators.
  5.11.5. Based upon the specific information discovered during the investigation, selected
  alternatives should be formulated into feasible and effective recommendations and other
  alternatives discarded. The purpose of using the ‗order of precedence‘ is to ensure
  investigations consider the entire range of available options and not just the cheap and easy
  ones – which usually have the least mishap prevention value.
  5.11.6. A great deal of debate usually surrounds what is feasible and effective. Sometimes a
  risk mitigation alternative is technically feasible and effective, but it is clearly not
  economically feasible or has unacceptable mission consequences. In this case, discard the
  alternative. In other cases it may not be clear that an alternative is either technically feasible
  or economically feasible. In these cases, include a recommendation for formal evaluation.
  5.11.7. Most causal findings should have recommendations for future prevention or
  mitigation, although exceptions are permitted. Likewise, findings that are not causal may
  also have recommendations written against them.
  5.11.8. Recommendations may also vary in scope. Some actions can be taken at unit level.
  Other recommendations require MAJCOM or other agency actions.
  5.11.9. If a recommendation depends on tests or analyses that are incomplete when the
  report is transmitted, explain this and provide a reference to the tests or analyses (such as
  deficiency report, study, or contract number).
  5.11.10. Recommendations should require the action agency to correct a deficiency rather
  than to implement a particular solution. The action agency normally has greater expertise
  than the investigators and should be given the opportunity to develop the optimal solution for
  a problem. The following examples illustrate this point: Poor – Move the right engine fire
  pushbutton to the right side of the cockpit. Better – Implement changes to the engine fire
  pushbuttons to help preclude engine shutdown errors.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          63


  5.11.11. Avoid recommendations that only require a study or evaluation. Action should be
  required based upon results of any recommended study. In most cases, it is not necessary to
  recommend a study or evaluation, since studies or evaluations are implicit in the process.
  The recommendation can simply require corrective action. Examples: Poor – Evaluate the
  feasibility of changes to the anti-lock system. Better – Implement changes to the anti-lock
  system to prevent loss of feedback.
  5.11.12. General, vague, sweeping, or open-ended recommendations that cannot be closed
  by the action agency are not appropriate. Write recommendations that have a definitive
  closing action.
  5.11.13. Do not recommend briefing personnel on the mishap. Such a briefing is a basic
  commander responsibility and a normal function of safety offices at all levels of command.
  5.11.14. Do not recommend reminding (or CC‘s reminding/briefing/publishing an FCIF to
  remind) personnel of the importance of simply doing their jobs properly. However,
  recommendations to place CAUTIONS and WARNINGS in TOs guidance relating the
  adverse consequences of not doing one‘s job properly may be appropriate.
  Recommendations for specific action such as refresher training, implementing in-process
  inspections, etc., to ensure job duties are being properly performed, may also be appropriate
  since they are specific and can be closed.
  5.11.15. Number recommendations consecutively and precede each number by the word
  "Recommendation." (e.g., Recommendation 1, Recommendation 2, etc.). Include only one
  statement for each recommendation. Rather than sub-grouping recommendations (e.g., 1a,
  1b, 1c, etc.) use a new recommendation number.
  5.11.16. Recommendations to Change Publications.
     5.11.16.1. Recommendations may be made to change publications, technical orders,
     flight manuals, or checklists. Submit AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
     Publication (flight publications), according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program.
     Submit AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply,
     according to TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System. Utilize local base support
     personnel (Stan Eval and/or QA) for assistance in completing the forms. If the proposed
     change is time sensitive, use the emergency critical safety hazard message format in AFI
     11-215 or the emergency report format in TO 00-5-1.
     5.11.16.2. Obtain tracking number from MAJCOM Stan Eval for AF Forms 847 and unit
     QA for AFTO Forms 22. Place the tracking number and the mishap‘s AFSAS number on
     submitted Forms 847 or 22, to ensure these recommendations receive the appropriate
     levels of review. Also, place the tracking number after corresponding recommendation in
     the final message/report. Submit completed forms to the MAJCOM Stan Eval or LG
     Command Control Point (CCP), as applicable after the investigation is complete
     (paragraph 6.5).
     5.11.16.3. In all cases, protect privileged safety information by sanitizing (paragraph
     3.3.1) the "reason for recommended change" section of AFTO Form 22 or AF Form 847.
     The SIB/SIO will place copies of the submitted forms in the applicable formal report tab.
  5.11.17. Determining the appropriate action agencies for each recommendation.
64                                             AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     5.11.17.1. Assign action agencies for all recommendations. An office of primary
     responsibility (OPR) is required for every recommendation. Although an office of
     collateral responsibility (OCR) is not required, they are appropriate for many
     recommendations. List only one OPR per recommendation. More than one OCR may be
     listed for an individual recommendation. Limit OPR and OCR assignment to two or
     three-digit organizational levels to ensure proper management level attention.
     5.11.17.2. Assign OPRs and OCRs based upon the lead command and user command
     philosophy. The Air Force assigns responsibility for overall management of each system
     to a "lead command" to ensure that all requirements associated with every system receive
     comprehensive and equitable consideration. This lead command provides primary input
     into the process of developing and maintaining a force structure with a balance of
     complementary capabilities, and it establishes a basis for rational allocation of scare
     resources among competing requirements. See AFPD 10-9, for more information.
     5.11.17.3. Normally, if a recommendation requires funding to effect changes to a
     weapon system (e.g., performing risk analyses or engineering studies, developing aircraft
     or component modifications, obtaining new test or support equipment, etc.), assign the
     appropriate office for the mishap weapon system, within the lead command as OPR. If
     the lead command only provides funds for the effort and another organization is
     responsible for performing or managing the work, assign these organizations as OCRs.
     For example: Implement changes to the B-1 to reduce the probability of encountering
     "hot brake" temperatures. OPR: ACC/A8 OCR: OC-ALC/XXX. In this example
     ACC/A8A is assigned as OPR because, as the appropriate office in the lead command,
     they would be responsible to arrange for the funding required to effect changes to the
     aircraft. Assuming that funding is provided, the B-1 system program office at OC-
     ALC/XXX is assigned as OCR since they would either perform the required work in-
     house or manage the contracted effort.
     5.11.17.4. Not all funding comes from the lead command. Sometimes it is possible for a
     system program office, item management office, laboratory or other organization to fund
     efforts through separate budgets. If a recommendation does not require funding from the
     lead command to effect changes to a weapon system (e.g., performing risk analyses or
     engineering studies, developing and obtaining preferred spares, developing inspection
     techniques and procedures, simple modifications and testing of software in conjunction
     with scheduled updates, limited flight and ground testing, etc.), assign the appropriate
     office that has the funding as OPR. Assign OCRs as required.
     5.11.17.5. Although changes to training programs, training equipment, and publishing
     new or changed paper documents (e.g., Air Force Policy Directives, Air Force
     Instructions, flight manuals, technical orders, etc.), require funding, assign the
     organization responsible for controlling the content of these products as OPR. Assign
     OCRs as required.
     5.11.17.6. Sometimes the responsibility for a recommendation lies outside the Air Force
     (e.g., the FAA for various air traffic control issues). Since the Air Force may not have
     the authority to task such agencies to perform recommended actions, do not assign non-
     Air Force agencies as OPRs or OCRs. In these cases, write the recommendation as an
     Air Force action and assign the appropriate Air Force organization as OPR. This Air
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              65


       Force organization is typically responsible for interaction with or contractual oversight of
       the outside agency and will ensure proper recommendation evaluation and disposition.
       Assign OCRs as required.
       5.11.17.7. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) normally accomplish Air Force-level
       actions. For example, air traffic issues are managed by the Air Force Flight Standards
       Agency (AFFSA), not the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations
       (AF/A3/5). Similarly, Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) is the
       manager for civil engineering issues in the Air Force. However, the Air Staff may be
       tasked as an OPR/OCR, where appropriate.
       5.11.17.8. SIB/SIO is responsible for coordinating all recommendations with their
       proposed action agencies (OPR and OCR). Ensure the correct OPR and OCR(s) are
       identified through positive contact (call or email them) prior to publishing the formal
       report or final message.
           5.11.17.8.1. Include the office symbol, commercial telephone number, and email
           address of one OPR action officer for each recommendation. Place this information
           in the dedicated data field provided by AFSAS.
           5.11.17.8.2. Do not include recommendations without listing contact information for
           each OPR. Contact the convening authority safety office to ensure proper action
           agencies have been identified.
   5.11.18. In accordance with USD (AT&L) policy memo, all system-related Class A and B
   mishap investigation reports will consider System Program Office recommendations for
   materiel risk mitigation measures, especially those that minimize potential human errors.
5.12. Determining and Documenting Other Findings and Recommendations of
Significance (OFS, ORS). Guidance for developing and documenting primary findings and
recommendations applies similarly to OFSs and ORSs.
   5.12.1. Other Findings of Significance (OFS) are findings that the safety investigators
   believe could contribute to future mishaps and/or which warrant command attention, but
   were not part of the mishap sequence. OFS should be listed following the mishap
   recommendations in message and formal reports.
   5.12.2. Other Recommendations of Significance (ORS) are recommendations resulting from
   OFS. Each OFS will be followed by its corresponding ORS. Assign an OPR(s) to each
   ORS.
5.13. Releasing Investigative Information. It is Air Force policy to keep the public informed
of Air Force mishaps and safety investigations and to release non-privileged information, both
favorable and unfavorable. Air Force policy complies with the requirements of Title 10, United
States Code, Section 2254(b) regarding the public disclosure of certain non-privileged aircraft
accident investigation information. The SIB president is the final point of release for all
information (including electronic/digital media, photographs, etc) from the SIB, but will not
communicate directly with the media or other members of the public. The release of non-
privileged information to news media, relatives, and other agencies is through the AIB president,
Survivor Assistance Program point of contact, Family Liaison Officer, or Public Affairs
representative as appropriate.
 66                                                AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   5.13.1. The convening authority or designated information officer releases factual
   information about a mishap, including photographs, only as directed in AFI 35-101, Public
   Affairs Policies and Procedures, and AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations.
   Officials involved in the safety investigation are not permitted to be the officials releasing the
   information to the media or other members of the public.
   5.13.2. The AIB, in accordance with AFI 51-503 or Ground AIB, in accordance with AFI
   51-507, can release factual mishap information upon request. If an AIB is not formed, the
   local commander, through the public affairs or legal office, will release factual information.
   Information will not be released if it will jeopardize national defense, impede an ongoing or
   pending investigation (including the SIB or AIB), or if it is privileged safety information.
   The SIB president will coordinate with the AIB president as to whether the release of
   information will impede the SIB‘s investigation.
   5.13.3. Following mishaps where AFI 51-503 does not apply (nuclear, explosives and
   chemical agents, directed energy, afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty, ground and industrial) the
   convening authority through the public affairs or legal office may release factual information.
   Information will not be released if it will jeopardize national defense, impede an ongoing or
   pending investigation (including the SIB or legal investigation) or if it is privileged safety
   information. The SIB president will coordinate with the legal board president as to whether
   the release of information will impede the SIB‘s investigation.
5.14. Coordinating with the Legal Board.
   5.14.1. The SIB president provides Part 1 of the formal report and certain factual
   information to the AIB President as soon as possible (prior to completion of the
   investigation). See discipline specific safety manual for further guidance.
      5.14.1.1. Examples of information given to the legal board president include (this list
      contains examples only); a list of witnesses, cockpit and tower audio recordings, data
      recorders, coroner‘s report, autopsy report, toxicology test results, police reports,
      personnel and medical records.
   5.14.2. Persons occupying full-time safety positions routinely examine privileged
   documents. They are not permitted to serve on legal investigations as long as they are
   performing full-time safety duties. Legal investigators will not attend SIB/SIO proceedings,
   or meetings, or have access to or discuss any Part 2 privileged information with the SIB/SIO
   or Air Force safety officials. This prohibition also applies to the briefing given to the
   convening authority on the safety investigation results.
   5.14.3. ISB/SIB/SIO members will not be witnesses for other boards investigating the same
   mishap except to provide Part 1 factual information or to provide purely factual information
   within their knowledge that is not otherwise available.
   5.14.4. ISB/SIB/SIO members and technical advisors will not act as investigators or
   technical advisors for a legal investigation of the same mishap.

                                           Chapter 6

                                REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information. Safety reports include message reports (preliminary, status, and
final), formal reports, and injury and occupational illness forms and logs. Whenever possible,
safety reporting will be via the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Use the following
URL for AFSAS: https://afsas.kirtland.af.mil. If AFSAS is not available, see paragraph 3.6.
The timeline for reporting mishaps and flag words are covered in Table 6.2 For Class A, B and
other investigations requiring a formal report, the convening authority briefing (if required)
should be delivered not later than 45 days post-mishap or 15 days after completing the
investigation, whichever is later. All Class A and B mishaps require a formal report unless
waived by the Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE). The convening authority or AF/SE may also
require a formal report for any other mishap if determined necessary. The formal report (if
required) will be published 3 days after the convening authority briefing or 30 days post mishap
if no briefing to convening authority was required. Briefing investigation results are covered in
paragraph 6.4 The convening authority will determine what investigations can be briefed to the
NAF/CC and COMAFFOR (paragraph 6.4.1) and what investigations will be briefed to the
convening authority. Aviation mishaps involving fatalities or other mishaps when requested,
require a briefing to the CSAF and SECAF. AF/SEI will be the focal point for scheduling all
briefings to the CSAF and SECAF. If a final message or formal report needs to be changed after
it is completed, all primary SIB members must coordinate on all changes, as only the primary
SIB members are authorized to change the report. The discipline specific safety manuals
(AFMAN 91-22X) provide guidance on primary SIB members.
   6.1.1. Report classified mishap information (the classified portion of safety reports) via
   AMHS. Report the unclassified portion of the report using AFSAS with classified data
   masked.
   6.1.2. On initial response, use the highest reasonably-expected cost estimate to determine the
   mishap class and downgrade if additional cost information indicates a lower class is
   warranted.
6.2. Safety Message Reports. These safety reports are licensed as a part of the "Mishap
Message Reports" group (RCS: HAF-SE(AR)9402). Produce safety messages during declared
or war emergency conditions (emergency status code C2) IAW AFI 33-324, The Information
Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency
Air Force Information Collections.
   6.2.1. Guidelines
       6.2.1.1. Messages will be marked with appropriate privileged markings IAW paragraph
       3.5
       6.2.1.2. Table 6.2. and the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) provide
       message reporting requirements.
       6.2.1.3. Do not include Privacy Act information in messages, to include but not limited
       to, names and social security numbers.
68                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     6.2.1.4. Message Reports During MINIMIZE. During emergency condition MINIMIZE,
     send only the following messages by electronic transmission:
         6.2.1.4.1. Preliminary and status messages on nuclear mishaps and safety
         deficiencies resulting in a significant degradation of nuclear surety or having a serious
         operational impact (such as a possible code compromise).
         6.2.1.4.2. Preliminary and status messages on Class A and B on-duty mishaps.
         6.2.1.4.3. Send all other messages by first-class mail within 7 working days of the
         established timeline until MINIMIZE is canceled. MAJCOMs may consolidate
         messages from their units and subsequently mail them to addressees outside their
         command within 15 working days.
  6.2.2. Preliminary Message. The first electronically transmitted safety message advising of
  a non-nuclear mishap or event is entitled Preliminary Message. Preliminary messages are
  fully releasable. They will contain factual information only and will not contain safety-
  protected or privileged information. Although OPREP-3 reports do not satisfy this
  requirement, safety personnel are encouraged to assess safety-related information released in
  OPREP-3 reports, since OPREP-3 reports are often the first avenue of communication to
  senior leadership.
  6.2.3. Status Messages: Status messages are sent to explain report delays/extensions and
  relay new information discovered since the previous message. Status messages may include
  investigative conclusions such as what areas are considered to be factors and areas
  considered unlikely to be factors. If the status message is explaining a safety report
  delay/extension, explain the reason for the delay and the expected completion date. Safety
  investigators may send status messages as they deem necessary. Required status messages
  are listed in Figure 6.2 Status messages are normally privileged.
     6.2.3.1. The convening authority‘s safety staff will closely follow mishaps that have
     damage estimates close to the threshold limits or injuries/occupational illnesses that have
     the potential for improving or worsening.
     6.2.3.2. A status message is required when a mishap class or category changes, e.g., due
     to updated damage cost figures, a subsequent death from mishap injuries, or erroneous
     initial categorization.
         6.2.3.2.1. When a mishap classification increases, issue a status message within 1
         day.
         6.2.3.2.2. When a mishap classification decreases, issue a status message within 10
         days.
  6.2.4. Final Message. This message provides a narrative of the mishap/event sequence,
  states the mishap cause, and recommends preventive actions. It contains the investigation,
  analysis, and conclusions of the safety investigator. It is written so the reader clearly
  understands how the findings and causes were determined and clearly states the role of the
  individuals found causal in the mishap sequence. Include logic in how the recommendations
  were chosen as well as OPR/OCRs for the recommendations. The message may also include
  other findings and recommendations of significance, which do not relate directly to the
  causes of the mishap, but can be of value in risk management and mishap prevention. The
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                           69


   final message is privileged. Complete the investigation and prepare the final message within
   the specified time limits in Figure 6.2 The convening authority will release the final
   message after the investigation is complete (paragraph 6.5). The convening authority may
   delegate this responsibility to the SIB/SIO. DO NOT delay release of the final message for
   internal command staffing or costing/injury analysis.
6.3. Formal Reports. Formal reports present detailed factual and analytical information about
mishaps. They are made up of Air Force Form 711-series forms and attached exhibits. All
forms in the Air Force Form 711-series are licensed as "Safety Investigation Reports" (RCS:
HAF-SE(AR) 9404). Formal reports will be released during declared or war emergency
conditions (emergency status code C2) IAW AFI 33-324.
   6.3.1. Privileged formal reports contain two-parts: Part 1, Factual Information and
   Releasable Material; and Part 2, Board Conclusions and Non-releasable Material. There may
   also be supplemental information such as comments messages for MOFE, MOFE, and any
   other significant information that was received after the MOFE was released.
       6.3.1.1. Part 1 contains factual information that may be disclosed outside the Air Force;
       Part 2 contains privileged safety information and will not be displayed/disclosed outside
       Air Force Safety channels (ref. Chapter 3). Questions about handling and/or distribution
       of safety report information should be referred to AFSC/JA.
       6.3.1.2. Tabs. Figure 6.1 contains Tab designations for Parts 1 and 2. See discipline
       specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for specific guidance on tab usage and
       contents.
          6.3.1.2.1. No tab data available. Investigations that have no data for certain tabs do
          not require waivers for those tabs. Example: Tab N, Transcripts of Voice
          Communications. If there are no recorded communications, the SIB will include a
          memo in the Tab N stating there was no such information available.
          6.3.1.2.2. Not-applicable tab data. If the SIB/SIO determines the content of a tab in
          Part 1 is not applicable to the mishap, that tab may be waived by the convening
          authority. If waived, the SIB/SIO will include a memo in the tab stating that the
          convening authority waived the content of that tab (reference Figure 6.2) and briefly
          explain, in Tab T, why the tab content was omitted. Waiver authority to exclude tabs
          from Part 2 is AF/SE.

   6.3.2. MAJCOMs or AFSC may direct preparation of a formal report for any mishap, even
   under circumstances where this instruction does not specifically require one.
   6.3.3. Formal reports will be formatted and assembled IAW with the discipline specific
   safety manual AFMAN 91-22X.
   6.3.4. Distributing the Formal Report
       6.3.4.1. The convening authority will distribute privileged formal reports to those in the
       Air Force with a need to know. Distribute the formal report to addressees as listed in the
       discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X). If there is a requirement to brief the
       convening authority, do not distribute the formal report prior to that briefing. Do not
       provide copies or extracts to agencies outside the Air Force. If an agency outside the Air
       Force needs a copy of the formal report for mishap prevention, corrective actions, or
       other purpose, notify AFSC/JA by message or telephone before sending copies to these
       organizations.
       6.3.4.2. Do not produce "information only" copies of formal reports.
       6.3.4.3. The SIB president may keep a complete copy of the formal report (for briefing
       purposes) for 60 days. List this copy on the distribution memorandum and return it to the
       convening authority safety office for disposition.
       6.3.4.4. Formal reports will be maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363, Management of
       Records and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
       https://webrims.amc.af.mil.
   6.3.5. All system‑ related Class A and B mishap formal reports must include the System
   Program Office analysis of hazards that contributed to the accident and recommendations for
   materiel risk mitigation measures, especially those that minimize potential human errors.
6.4. Briefing Investigation Results. Once the SIB completes the investigation and finalizes the
formal report and the final message, the SIB will provide briefings at the discretion of the
convening authority. All briefings will be given with no prior screening of content. Board
independence is critical to the integrity of the SIB process. Historically, SIB independence is a
Congressional interest item, periodically reviewed by Government Accountability Office (GAO)
and DoD/IG. The convening authority will dictate briefing attendance. Prior to this briefing, the
MAJCOM/NAF Chief of Safety will brief the convening authority on rules set forth in
Paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 of this regulation.                  Briefing slides are available at
http://afsafety.af.mil/SEF/SEFF_SIB.shtml.
   6.4.1. When the MAJCOM is the convening authority and with MAJCOM/CC approval, the
   SIB may brief the NAF/CC (or equivalent such as the Air Warfare Center Commander) and
   the affected COMAFFOR for a contingency mishap, for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES
   ONLY, prior to briefing the MAJCOM/CC. All other briefings or disclosures of the report
   content are prohibited. Prior to this briefing, the NAF Chief of Safety will brief the NAF/CC
   on rules set forth in Paragraph 6.4 of this regulation. Briefing slides are available at
   http://afsafety.af.mil/SEF/SEFF_SIB.shtml.
       6.4.1.1. The NAF/CC (and COMAFFOR) and those invited per this instruction to the
       informational briefing will not direct changes to the SIB report or direct further
72                                             AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     investigation. The briefing must be free from the appearance of undue command
     influence that advice and directions can sometimes create.
     6.4.1.2. Except as noted below, the only personnel authorized to attend the informational
     NAF/CC briefing are the NAF/CC, and with NAF/CC concurrence, the NAF/SE and the
     mishap Wing Commander. In the case of an ANG mishap, in addition to the above
     authorized attendees, the Director of the Air National Guard, and the mishap units‘ state
     Adjutant General may attend. In the case of an AFRC mishap, in addition to the above
     authorized attendees, the mishap AFRC NAF/CC, AFRC NAF/SE and the mishap Wing
     Commander may attend. For COMAFFOR information briefings, authorized attendees
     are the COMAFFOR, and with COMAFFOR concurrence, the AFFOR/SE, and the
     mishap air expeditionary wing commander.
     6.4.1.3. In instances where the convening authority has been delegated, there will be no
     intermediate or informational briefings prior to briefing the convening authority.
  6.4.2. Safety investigation briefings will be afforded the same protection given the formal
  report. The following format is a guide to building the briefing:
     6.4.2.1. Title Slide. Include mishap type, unit, vehicle or material, date, time of
     occurrence, and SIB president.
     6.4.2.2. SIB Composition. Show SIB members as well as technical experts consulted
     and used at the mishap scene.
     6.4.2.3. Overview. In bullet format present the basic circumstances of the mishap and
     give the bottom line cause(s) of the mishap.
     6.4.2.4. Personnel Background. Give a chronological list of assignments for personnel
     involved and their experience. Include skill and training qualifications. List the
     member‘s name on the slide. Consider a subjective appraisal of the personnel if
     appropriate.
     6.4.2.5. Mishap Sequence. Use as many slides as necessary. Map/route segments,
     vertical view of maneuvers, artist‘s conceptions, or models can be helpful. Explain what
     should have happened if things had gone right, who was in charge, the rules of
     engagement and if they were followed, where things went wrong and what the involved
     persons should have done.
     6.4.2.6. Areas Investigated and Determined Not To Be a Factor. Do not dwell on these.
     A listing is usually adequate.
     6.4.2.7. Areas Found To Be Factors in the Mishap. Discuss each in detail in follow-up
     slides. Be sure to discuss training, supervision, discipline, tactics, and weather, as
     appropriate.
     6.4.2.8. Findings and Causes. Use the number of slides necessary without overcrowding.
     6.4.2.9. Conclusions and Recommendations. Use the number of slides necessary without
     overcrowding.
     6.4.2.10. Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance. Number sequentially.
     Place "Other Finding of Significance One" followed by "Other Recommendation of
     Significance One."

       6.4.2.11. Comments. Convening authority comments.
       6.4.2.12. Backup slides as determined by the SIB president. May include:
           6.4.2.12.1. 72-Hour and 14-Day Medical History. Be prepared to brief the 72-hour
           and 14-day history.
           6.4.2.12.2. Maintenance History on Aircraft or Vehicle. Include significant write-
           ups, Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO), and material problems.
           6.4.2.12.3. Any other pertinent information that supports the findings, conclusions,
           and recommendations.

4 = Input of OSHA injury information required by day 6.
5 = If there is a delay in reporting the mishap the reporting time will begin upon notification to the
safety office.
NOTE: Class A and B off-duty military mishaps normally do not require a formal report. See
AFMAN 91-224 for additional guidance.
6.5. Convening Authority Actions. The convening authority has two options upon the
completion of an investigation. The investigation is considered complete when the final
message, formal report (if required), and briefing to the convening authority (if required) are
accomplished.
   6.5.1. Accept the report as written and release the final message and formal report (if a
   formal report was required). Do not staff the final message or formal report before release.
   It is important the SIB results remain free from any appearance of influence.
 74                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


   6.5.2. Direct the SIB president and its members to conduct additional investigations. The
   convening authority will provide additional guidance to the SIB to ensure the report fulfills
   the purpose, intent, and requirements of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
       6.5.2.1. After the SIB re-examines the areas identified by the convening authority and
       completes their reinvestigation, the convening authority will have the same two options
       outlined above. Once this sequence is completed, the convening authority will release
       the final message. Do not delay release of the final message or formal report for internal
       command staffing or final costing/injury determination.
6.6. Notifying Person(s) Found Causal in Formal Reports. When a formal report mentions a
USAF individual (military member or civilian employee) as causal in the findings, that
individual (i.e., causal individual) will be given an opportunity to submit a witness statement
commenting on the findings. This statement is in addition to any other witness statements or
testimony provided by the individual. The statement is considered privileged safety information
and will be handled and protected IAW this instruction. Use the guidelines below to notify
causal individuals and forward their comments:
   6.6.1. Use the memorandum in Figure 6.1 to notify the causal individual(s).
   6.6.2. The SIB President/SIO will provide the convening authority safety office with the
   notification memorandum for individuals found causal in their investigation. Once the
   convening authority accepts the formal report and releases the final message, the convening
   authority will send a copy of the memorandum to the mishap unit safety office. Individuals
   must not be notified until after the SIB out briefs the convening authority and the final
   message is released. The mishap unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of Safety will notify the
   causal individual(s).
   6.6.3. The causal individual(s) may use only the final message to make additional comments.
   The individual(s) will not be allowed access to the formal report. The individual(s) may not
   remove the final message from the safety office nor copy portions of any of the safety reports
   pertaining to the mishap naming that individual causal.
   6.6.4. The individual(s) has 15 days to submit the statement back to the mishap unit (wing or
   equivalent) safety office. The individual(s) must submit a statement, though the statement
   may simply acknowledge the opportunity to comment and decline to do so.
   6.6.5. The unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of Safety will forward any statements to the
   convening authority SE and a copy to AFSC for use in preparation of the MOFE.
   6.6.6. If the causal individual is attached or assigned to another MAJCOM, the convening
   authority sends a copy of the final message and the memorandum in Figure 6.1 to the
   person‘s immediate commander with a cover memorandum. Provide information copies to
   the individual‘s MAJCOM/SE. The cover memorandum should caution the commander
   against taking any disciplinary or other adverse action based upon the safety investigation
   and instruct the commander to:
       6.6.6.1. Notify the person of their opportunity to review relevant findings and to provide
       a witness statement within 15 days.
       6.6.6.2. After obtaining causal individual‘s statement forward it to AFSC with a copy to
       the convening authority.

   6.6.7. Notifying Non-Air Force Military Personnel and Civilians Outside Air Force
   Jurisdiction. Non-Air Force personnel are not offered the opportunity to review Air Force
   safety investigation messages or formal reports, nor to submit witness statements in these
   cases. This includes Air Force personnel serving outside the Air Force, such as with the
   Defense Logistics Agency or NATO. EXCEPTION: Those Non-Air Force personnel
   assigned to fly Air Force aircraft and afforded safety privilege IAW paragraph 3.3.3, are
   authorized to submit a witness statement as long as they still meet the previously mentioned
   criteria.

                                           Chapter 7

                                  FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

7.1. Review Process. Follow-up actions start when the final message is released. Reviewing
authorities for safety reports include AFSC, and higher levels in the investigative chain of
command (e.g., NAF/Center and MAJCOM).
   7.1.1. The reviewing authority is tasked to assess the final message/formal report and
   determine the overall adequacy. If the narrative, findings, causes, or recommendations
   (including OPR/OCR assignments) do not meet the standards set forth in this instruction,
   they will reject the message.
   7.1.2. If during the review process the convening authority or higher authority learns facts
   that were not available to safety investigators or that shed new light on the published
   findings, causes, and recommendations, he or she may do one of the following:
       7.1.2.1. Reopen the safety investigation.
       7.1.2.2. Include the new facts in the Comments Message for Memorandum of Final
       Evaluation (MOFE).
   7.1.3. The review process should be accomplished within seven days of the convening
   authority releasing the final message.
7.2. Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE). Organizations will review Class A and B
final message/formal reports and send their response back to AFSC within 45 days after final
message release by the convening authority. Comments received after the 45 day deadline may
not be considered in the MOFE unless an extension is granted through AFSC/SEFO.
   7.2.1. AFSC will publish a MOFE on all on-duty Class A safety reports within 90 days after
   release of the final message. Additional MOFE requirements and exemptions are specified in
   AFMAN 91-22X.
   7.2.2. AFSC will consider inputs from the following in preparation of the MOFE:
       7.2.2.1. Convening authority.
       7.2.2.2. Lead command of weapons system (AFPD 10-9).
       7.2.2.3. Air component commanders of unified commands when the mishap occurred
       during contingency operations. NOTE: The unified command staff offices must agree to
       safeguard the information according to rules contained in this instruction.
       7.2.2.4. Designated action agencies (OPR/OCRs).
       7.2.2.5. Commander of the mishap wing.
       7.2.2.6. Statements of person(s) found causal in the formal report.
       7.2.2.7. Air Force agencies outside the investigating command if their functions were
       involved in the mishap (e.g., HQ AFFSA/A3A for air traffic services and airfield
       management, DCMA for mishaps involving contracts managed by DCMA).
 78                                              AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


      7.2.2.8. Unsolicited comments. Agencies and organizations reviewing the final message
      report may comment on the investigation, findings, causes, and recommendations even
      though they are neither in the chain of command nor a designated action agency.
   7.2.3. AFSC prepares the MOFE as an evaluation of the formal report/final message. AFSC
   considers the comments provided by the convening MAJCOM and all other inputs as listed
   in paragraph 7.2.2 The MOFE may make changes to the findings, causes, and
   recommendations (including OPR/OCR assignments). However, the MOFE will not make
   changes to the narrative or the other findings/recommendations of significance.
      7.2.3.1. If the MOFE adds a person to a causal finding or significantly changes a
      person‘s role in the findings, AFSC will notify the individual‘s MAJCOM safety office
      and will provide the individual an opportunity to submit a witness statement, following
      the procedures in paragraph 6.6
   7.2.4. AF/SE is the releasing authority of the MOFE. AFSC will normally release the
   MOFE via AFSAS. When transmitted, the MOFE becomes the official Air Force position on
   findings, causes, and recommendations.
7.3. Managing Recommendations.
   7.3.1. Release of the final message is an official tasking for agencies identified as OPRs for
   corrective actions. MAJCOMs will use AFSAS to effectively manage final disposition of
   recommendations and ORSs resulting from mishaps and events. If a recommendation is
   discovered to have applicability beyond the identified OPR, MAJCOM/SEs should notify
   AFSC/SE so additional appropriate recommendations can be created.
   7.3.2. To determine closure approval authority for primary recommendations and other
   recommendations of significance use Tables 7.1 and 7.2. For on-duty Class A and B
   recommendations, AFSC is the approval authority for closure of primary recommendations.
   The OPR must request closure from the approval authority who decides if the closing action
   is acceptable. For Class A and B mishaps, if the action taken is different from the proposed
   actions of the recommendation, the OPR‘s MAJCOM CC/CV (or Materiel Safety Task
   Group Chair/System Safety Group Chair/Center Commander in AFMC) must approve the
   request for closure. For Class C, D and E mishaps, if the action taken is different from the
   proposed actions of the recommendation, the OPR‘s commander (or 2-letter director for
   recommendations at MAJCOM level) must approve the closing action. (Ex: If the OPR for a
   Class C recommendation is the MAJCOM/A4M and they choose an alternate method of
   mitigating the hazard, the MAJCOM/A4 must approve the closing action. If the OPR is in
   the Maintenance Group the Wing/CC must approve the closing action.)

   7.3.3. Other safety offices are afforded the opportunity in AFSAS to coordinate on a
   recommendation's closing action. Coordination must occur within 30 calendar days of the
   OPR requesting closure.
   7.3.4. The OPR must provide updates in AFSAS every 6 months until closed. The following
   are examples of acceptable updates toward closing actions:
                         7.3.4.1. Actions planned or taken.
                         7.3.4.2. Results of development or testing.
                         7.3.4.3. Significant problems encountered.
                         7.3.4.4. Delays experienced.
                         7.3.4.5. Rationale for decision made, to include details of supporting risk analysis.
                         7.3.4.6. Concurrence and non-concurrence by other agencies.
                         7.3.4.7. Estimated completion date.
   7.3.5. The following examples are acceptable closing actions with proper annotation:
80                                             AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


     7.3.5.1. Recommended changes to all applicable publications were issued/fielded.
     Corrective action annotations must include, as a minimum, the name and/or designation
     of the publication changed (i.e. 1B-2A-1), the date of the publication, and the affected
     page numbers.
     7.3.5.2. Recommended modifications to all applicable systems or items were completed.
     Corrective action annotations must include, as a minimum, that the design change has
     been fielded and/or what percentage of the affected parts within the fleet have been
     modified. In most cases, the design change must have been implemented on all affected
     systems to warrant closure.
     7.3.5.3. Recommended studies or evaluations were completed, conclusions were
     validated, and actions on all validated requirements were completed. In these cases, the
     OPR shall include detailed rationale, to include a risk analysis, to support their
     conclusions.
  7.3.5.4.    Recommended changes to training were completed. If the training changes were
  captured in a publication, see 7.3.5.1 above. Otherwise corrective action annotations must
  include, as a minimum, the implementation method of the new training, the date
  implemented, and the currency requirement for the training.
     7.3.5.5. Recommended actions were not implemented due to resource constraints,
     operational constraints. Corrective action annotation must include, as a minimum, a
     statement that a risk analysis was performed, a description quantifying residual risk, and
     a statement of risk acceptance at the appropriate level. For Class A and B mishaps, risk
     acceptance will include MAJCOM CC/CV concurrence. If the recommendation is not
     implemented due to a completed programmed removal/retirement of the system or item
     from service then the completion date of the removal/retirement must be annotated. If
     the system is not completely removed from service at the time of the closure request then
     a risk analysis and risk acceptance statement is required.
  7.3.6. Request closure only after all actions have been completed and properly annotated.
  7.3.7. Lead MAJCOM/A3 will brief and advocate SIB recommendations at the flight manual
  and technical order review boards. For Class A and B mishaps, if recommended changes are
  disapproved by the flight manual or technical order review boards, MAJCOM/SE will ensure
  the appropriate directorate (A3/A4) is aware of the disapproval. Forward copies of
  completed changes to AFSC/SEFO for AF/SE review.
  7.3.8. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/NGB will establish a Mishap Review Panel (MRP) or
  equivalent process (e.g., Materiel Safety Task Group) for all safety disciplines to ensure
  Class A and B mishap recommendations, for which they are OPR, are methodically
  addressed and risks are accepted at the appropriate level in accordance with AFI 91-202. The
  MRP or similar process will meet once every six months. The MRP should also address
  recommendations waiting for the MOFE. A consolidated recommendation status report is
  due to AFSC on 15 Nov and 15 May every year. The report will be compiled using data as
  of 30 Sep and 30 Mar each year (end of FY and end of second quarter). This report will
  cover all disciplines.
  7.3.8. (AFMC) AFMC uses Materiel Safety Task Groups (MSTGs) to manage open
  materiel safety recommendations for which an AFMC Center is an OPR or OCR. MSTGs
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                          81


  provide input to program managers to improve the safety of their products by ensuring
  adequate and timely actions are taken to correct open materiel safety recommendations.
  MSTGs develop and review responses to open safety recommendations, and monitor
  responses to related recommendations. MSTGs ensure lessons learned are appropriately
  exchanged.
     7.3.8.1. (Added-AFMC) Required members of an MSTG are:
        7.3.8.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Chairman.   The chairman will be the wing
        commander/director. The wing commander/director may designate an alternate
        chairman.
        7.3.8.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Assistant Chairman.           The MSPM is the assistant
        chairman.
        7.3.8.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Program representatives (safety office representatives,
        program managers, engineers, equipment specialists, anyone MSTG or commander
        deems necessary to complete recommended actions, etc.).
     7.3.8.2. (Added-AFMC) Updates to open safety recommendations in AFSAS will
     include an evaluation (concur, nonconcur, or concur with intent), date of the update,
     action taken, estimated completion date (ECD), and POC/office symbol/DSN.
     7.3.8.3. (Added-AFMC) Do not request closure for open safety recommendations until
     all actions are complete. Open safety recommendations pending continuing action
     (extended PDM scheduling, TCTO in progress, document awaiting publication, etc.) need
     not be reviewed at every MSTG. However, recommendations tracking TCTO
     accomplishment must be updated in February and August. All other open safety
     recommendations will be updated at least semi-annually, to satisfy AF/SE‘s semi-annual
     (March and September) review of open safety recommendations.
     7.3.8.4. (Added-AFMC) When a program manager "nonconcurs" on a Class A or B
     open materiel safety recommendation for which they are the OPR or OCR, the PEO will
     be the final reviewing authority. The PM will coordinate nonconcurrence staff packages
     through the center safety office and the PEO for approval. The nonconcurrence text
     should be succinct and include feasible alternatives, if available, or rationale for
     nonconcurrence. Upon PEO approval, submit the PEO position via AFSAS.
        7.3.8.4.1. (Added-AFMC) When the PM concurs, put "CONCUR" in the
        appropriate field of the safety record. Identify who made the update. Provide an
        Estimated Completion Date (ECD).
        7.3.8.4.2. (Added-AFMC) When the PM nonconcurs, put "NONCONCUR" in the
        appropriate field of the safety record. Provide solid rationale for the nonconcurrence.
        Identify who made the update.
     7.3.8.5. (Added-AFMC) Managing All Other Recommendations. The center/wing
     safety office will track open safety recommendations for all (Class A, B, C, and D)
     mishaps and Class E events for which the center/wing is an OPR or OCR. This includes
     open safety recommendations validated through the MOFE as well as all others.
     Center/wing safety offices will report the semi-annual status of all open safety

mishap. Aircraft Ground Operations are mishaps that involve DoD aircraft with no intent for
flight that result in reportable damage to DoD aircraft, injury, or fatality.
AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and reportable
damage to a DoD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided missile mishaps that cause
damage in excess of $20,000 to a DoD aircraft with intent for flight are categorized as aircraft
flight mishaps to avoid dual reporting. This is the only aviation mishap subcategory that
contributes to the flight mishap rate.
AIRCRAFT FLIGHT—RELATED MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight
and no reportable damage to the DoD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality, reportable
injury, or reportable property damage. A missile or UAV/UAS that is launched from a DoD
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                             93

employees; Youth or Student Assistance Program employees; foreign nationals employed by the
DoD Components; and Army-Air Force Exchange Service employees. Foreign national
employees fall into two categories: 1) Direct Hire – Under the direct hire system, the U.S. Forces
are the legal employer of the foreign national and assumes responsibility for all administrative
and management functions with foreign national employment; 2) Indirect Hire – The host
government serves as the legal employer of U. S. Forces‘ foreign nationals. Although the host
government is the official employer for the foreign national personnel, it grants operational
control to the U. S. Forces for the day-to-day management of such personnel. See DoD 1400.25-
M, Sub-Chapter 1231 for additional information.

including ANG and AFRC technicians, unless in military duty status. Includes non-appropriated
fund (NAF) employees who are not military personnel working part time. This includes Youth
Opportunity Program (YOP) and Student Assistance Program employees. This includes foreign-
national civilians employed by Air Force (Air Force Foreign Nationals (AFFN)). This includes
Air Force responsibility for any compensation claims arising from employment injury. Air Force
Foreign National employees fall into two categories (see Department of Defense Civilian
Personnel). Mishaps involving an AFFN employee who is a direct hire will be investigated and
reported via AFSAS. Indirect hire employee mishaps will normally be investigated by the host
nation however safety will work with the host nation to ensure violations or hazards that are
indentified as causal are corrected.
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE (DAF) MILITARY PERSONNEL—These are Air
Force personnel on active duty with the Air Force or ANG and AFRC personnel on military duty
status. Includes US Air Force Academy cadets, US Air Force Academy Preparatory School
cadet candidates and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets engaged in directed training
activities. Includes members of other US military services serving on extended active duty with

DESTROYED AIRCRAFT/UAV/UAS—Aircraft/UAV/UAS will be considered destroyed
when the man-hours required to repair the aircraft/UAV/UAS exceed the maximum stated in the
"major repair man-hours" column of TO 1-1-638, Repair and Disposal of Aerospace Vehicles. A
damaged aircraft/UAV/UAS not repaired is not automatically a "destroyed" aircraft/UAV/UAS.
The decision not to return a damaged aircraft/UAV/UAS to service is independent of the mishap
class. When the aircraft/UAV/UAS will not be returned to service, classify the mishap damage
according to the total estimated repair cost as if it had been returned to service. The SIB must
submit detailed repair cost estimates through MAJCOM channels to AFSC/SEF for validation if
an aircraft/UAV/UAS will not be returned to service but is not considered destroyed.

system, or a crew module.
ENGINE—CONFINED (Added)—Applies when an aircraft or UAV/UAS turbine engine
experiences reportable damage (Class C or higher) that is confined to the engine and integral
engine components. Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than Class C
damage external to the engine. If the total cost of all damage external to the engine is equal to or
greater than the Class C damage cost threshold, then the mishap is not engine-confined,
regardless of the comparative extent of engine damage cost.
ENGINE—CONFINED FOD MISHAP (Added)—A mishap in which an aircraft or
UAV/UAS turbine engine experiences reportable foreign object damage (Class C or higher) that
is confined to the engine and integral engine components. Damage is considered FOD if it is
caused by inanimate objects external to the engine (i.e. rocks, tools, safety wire, ice, etc.).
Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than Class C damage external to the
engine. If the total cost of all damage external to the engine is equal to or greater than the Class
C damage cost threshold, then the mishap is not engine-confined, regardless of the comparative
extent of engine damage cost.
EVENT—An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet the reporting
criteria of a mishap.

           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HUMAN FACTORS ANALYSIS AND
                  CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (DOD HFACS)

A5.1. Introduction The information in this attachment rescinds and replaces the human factors
taxonomy in Attachment 8 of AFPAM 91-211, ―USAF Guide to Aviation Safety
Investigation.‖ This information applies to all safety disciplines. Department of Defense Human
Factors Analysis and Classification System (DOD HFACS) implements portions of DoDI
6055.07, Accident Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping. The DODI directs DOD
components to ―Establish procedures to provide for the cross-feed of human error data using a
common human error categorization system that involves human factors taxonomy accepted
among the DoD Components and U.S. Coast Guard.‖ All investigators who report and analyze
DoD mishaps will use DOD HFACS. Human Factors is not just about humans. It is about how
features of people‘s tools, tasks and working environment systemically influence human
performance. This model is designed to present a systematic, multidimensional approach to
error analysis.
A5.2. Purpose A thorough mishap investigation is absolutely necessary to determine the
cascading events causal to a mishap, and to recommend corrective actions to prevent recurrence.
This guide provides the mishap investigator with a template that aids in organizing the
investigation. Mishaps are rarely attributed to a single cause, or in most instances, even a single
individual. The goal of a mishap or event investigation is to identify these failures and
conditions in order to understand why the mishap occurred and how it might be prevented from
happening again. This attachment is designed for use by all members of an investigation board
in order to accurately capture the complex layers of human error in context with the individual
and mishap or event.
A5.3. Description As described by James Reason (1990), active failures are the actions or
inactions of operators that are believed to cause the mishap. Traditionally referred to as "error,"
they are the last "acts" committed by individuals, often with immediate and tragic consequences.
For example, an aviator forgetting to lower the landing gear before touch down will yield
relatively immediate, and potentially grave, consequences. In contrast, latent failures or
conditions are errors that exist within the organization or in the chain of command that affect the
sequence of events characteristic of a mishap. For example, it is not difficult to understand how
tasking Security Forces crews or teams at the expense of quality rest can lead to fatigue and
ultimately errors (active failures). Viewed from this perspective then, the actions of individuals
are the end result of a chain of factors originating in other parts (often the upper echelons) of the
organization. These latent failures or conditions may lie dormant or undetected for some period
of time prior to their manifestation as a mishap. The question for mishap investigators is how to
identify and mitigate these active and latent failures or conditions. Reason's "Swiss Cheese"
model describes the levels at which active failures and latent failures/conditions may occur
within complex operations (see Figure A5.1). Organizations implement controls to mitigate
hazards. Dr. Reason philosophized four layers of controls in an organization. The holes in the
layers represent failed or absent controls. Working backward from the mishap, the first level of
Reason's model depicts those Unsafe Acts of Operators (operator, maintainers, facility personnel,
etc.) that ultimately lead to a mishap. Traditionally, this is where most mishap investigations
have focused their examination of human error, and consequently where most causal factors are
 118                                               AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011


uncovered. After all, it is typically the actions or inactions of individuals that can be directly
linked to the mishap. What makes Reason's model particularly useful in mishap investigation is
it forces investigators to address latent failures and conditions within the causal sequence of
events.     Latent failures or conditions such as fatigue, complacency, illness, and the
physical/technological environment all effect individual performance, but can be overlooked by
investigators with even the best of intentions. These particular latent failures and conditions are
described within the context of Reason's model as Preconditions for Unsafe Acts. Likewise,
Supervision can promote unsafe conditions of operators and ultimately unsafe acts will occur.
For example, if an Operations Officer were to pair a below average team leader with a very
junior/inexperienced crew, the result is increased risk of mission failure. Reason's model does
not stop at supervision; it also considers Organizational Influences that can impact performance
at all levels. For instance, in times of fiscal constraints, funding may be short and may lead to
limited training opportunities. The investigation process endeavors to detect and identify the
"holes (failed or absent defenses) in the cheese" (see Figure A5.1). Each mishap is not unique
from its predecessors. In fact, most mishaps have very similar causes. If we know what the
failures or "holes" are, we can better identify their roles in mishaps -- or better yet, detect their
presence and develop a risk mitigation strategy correcting them before a mishap occurs.

AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              119


A5.4. Application When we analyze a mishap with this framework we get a system that can
identify the acts of the mishap individual, but acts of others (wingman, team/crew member,
dispatcher, etc.) end up being Preconditions or Supervisory/Organizational factors. This can lead
to a poor analysis of individual failures outside those of the mishap individual. When we look at
real mishaps we find the dynamic looks more like a complex web of failures/errors and
contributing failures/errors of multiple individual as well as failures in the ―system.‖ (See Figure
A5.2). Chain of events models encourage notions of linear causality and do not account for the
indirect, non-linear, and feedback relationships common for accidents in complex systems.
When the mishap is investigated as an interdependent system, any person whose actions or
inactions impacted the outcome of the mishap should be investigated as a mishap person. Those
individuals will have their acts and preconditions identified. The context in which these acts and
preconditions occurred will be captured in the supervisory and organizational factors. The
supervisory and organizational factors will be identified against the mishap or event and not a
specific person. Mishap factors can cross all four tiers of the model and the investigator can
apply this model by entering at any tier. DOD HFACS is based on human error causation
models in systems and will be used to investigate Weapons, Ground, Space, and Aviation
mishaps.

Figure A5.2. Diagram of Complex Factors within a Mishap




A5.4.1. Person Level. The Acts and Preconditions Tiers are defined as the Person Level within
the AFSAS. If a person‘s actions or inactions directly impacted the outcome of the mishap,
capture this person‘s Acts and Preconditions. These are the actions or inactions of operators that
tend to be close in time and space to the mishap occurrence. Traditionally referred to as "error,"
they are the last "acts" committed by individuals, often with immediate and tragic consequences.
Capture the Preconditions for each individual who led to that person‘s actions or inactions.
A5.4.2. Mishap Level. Supervision and Organization Tiers are captured at the Mishap Level
within AFSAS and are not coded against a specific person; they are assigned against the mishap
or event. Actions or inactions at these tiers are conditions that exist within the organization or
elsewhere in the supervisory chain of command that affect the mishap. For example, inadequate
or non-existent technical order guidance which contributes to the mishap sequence is captured at
the mishap level.
A5.4.3. Rating. Each human factor code identified must be rated for its influence on the
mishap as causal, contributory or outcome.
   A5.4.3.1. Causes are deficiencies which if corrected would likely have prevented or
   mitigated damage and/or injury. Cause does not imply blame. Events/conditions that are
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              121


   highly probable results of other events/conditions are not causes. They should be rated as
   either contributors or outcomes.
   A5.4.3.2. Contributors are single events/conditions that are essential to the mishap
   sequence. They offer an independent contribution or allow the progression of other
   events/conditions. If an event/condition is both contributory and causal, rate it only as
   causal.
   A5.4.3.3. Outcomes are single events or conditions that are present during the mishap and
   are highly probable results of one or more contributors/causes. All outcomes are not findings
   – some are present but have no material effect upon the progression of the mishap sequence.
   If an outcome is also a contributor or cause, rate it only as a contributor or cause.
A5.4.4. Relationships. Within the context of this model, failed or absent controls at one level
led to failed or absent controls at another level. For example, fatigue can lead to a procedural
error. If the investigator identifies that one code contributed to another code, then that
relationship will be identified in AFSAS. Usually a code at a higher tier will relate to the code at
the lower tier. For instance, in the example above, the investigator would relate fatigue to the
procedural error. The investigator does not need to identify a relationship both up and down the
chain for two related codes. One relationship is all that is required. Relationships can exist
between codes in the same tier and can skip tiers. For example, a code at the Supervision Tier
can be related to a code at the Acts tiers.

   nanocode shown in its position within the hierarchy.

ACTS

Acts are those factors that are most closely tied to the mishap, and can be described as active
failures or actions committed by the operator that result in human error or unsafe situation.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                                123



Errors are factors in a mishap when mental or physical activities of the operator fail to achieve
their intended outcome as a result of skill-based, perceptual, or judgment and decision making
errors leading to an unsafe situation. Errors are unintended.

Skill-Based Errors are factors in a mishap when errors occur in the operator‘s execution of a
routine, highly practiced task relating to procedure, training or proficiency and result in an unsafe
a situation.

AE101 Inadvertent Operation
Inadvertent Operation is a factor when individual‘s movements inadvertently activate or
deactivate equipment, controls or switches when there is no intent to operate the control or
device. This action may be noticed or unnoticed by the individual.

AE102 Checklist Error
Checklist Error is a factor when the individual, either through an act of commission or omission
makes a checklist error or fails to run an appropriate checklist and this failure results in an unsafe
situation.

AE103 Procedural Error
Procedural Error is a factor when a procedure is accomplished in the wrong sequence or using
the wrong technique or when the wrong control or switch is used. This also captures errors in
navigation, calculation or operation of automated systems.

AE104 Overcontrol/ Undercontrol
Overcontrol/Undercontrol is a factor when an individual responds inappropriately to conditions
by either overcontroling or undercontroling the aircraft/vehicle/system. The error may be a
result of preconditions or a temporary failure of coordination.

AE105 Breakdown in Visual Scan
Breakdown in Visual Scan is a factor when the individual fails to effectively execute learned /
practiced internal or external visual scan patterns leading to unsafe situation.

AE106 Inadequate Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM)
Inadequate Anti-G Straining Maneuver is a factor when the individuals AGSM is improper,
inadequate, poorly timed or non-existent and this leads to adverse neurocirculatory effects.

Judgment and Decision-Making Errors are factors in a mishap when behavior or actions of the
individual proceed as intended yet the chosen plan proves inadequate to achieve the desired end-
state and results in an unsafe situation.

AE201 Risk Assessment – During Operation
Risk Assessment – During Operation is a factor when the individual fails to adequately evaluate
the risks associated with a particular course of action and this faulty evaluation leads to
inappropriate decision and subsequent unsafe situation. This failure occurs in real-time when
formal risk-assessment procedures are not possible.
 124                                                AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011



AE202 Task Misprioritization
Task Misprioritization is a factor when the individual does not organize, based on accepted
prioritization techniques, the tasks needed to manage the immediate situation.

AE203 Necessary Action – Rushed
Necessary Action – Rushed is a factor when the individual takes the necessary action as dictated
by the situation but performs these actions too quickly and the rush in taking action leads to an
unsafe situation.

AE204 Necessary Action – Delayed
Necessary Action – Delayed is a factor when the individual selects a course of action but elects
to delay execution of the actions and the delay leads to an unsafe situation.

AE205 Caution/Warning – Ignored
Caution/Warning – Ignored is a factor when a caution or warning is perceived and understood by
the individual but is ignored by the individual leading to an unsafe situation.

AE206 Decision-Making During Operation
Decision-Making During Operation is a factor when the individual through faulty logic selects
the wrong course of action in a time-constrained environment.

Perception Errors are factors in a mishap when misperception of an object, threat or situation,
(such as visual, auditory, proprioceptive, or vestibular illusions, cognitive or attention failures,
etc), results in human error.

AE301 Error due to Misperception
Error due to Misperception is a factor when an individual acts or fails to act based on an illusion;
misperception or disorientation state and this act or failure to act creates an unsafe situation.

Violations are factors in a mishap when the actions of the operator represent willful disregard for
rules and instructions and lead to an unsafe situation. Violations are deliberate.

AV001 Violation - Based on Risk Assessment
Violation- Based on Risk Assessment is a factor when the consequences/risk of violating
published procedures was recognized, consciously assessed and honestly determined by the
individual, crew or team to be the best course of action. Routine ―work-arounds‖ and unofficial
procedures that are accepted by the community as necessary for operations are also captured
under this code.

AV002 Violation - Routine/Widespread
Violation - Routine/Widespread is a factor when a procedure or policy violation is systemic in a
unit/setting and not based on a risk assessment for a specific situation. It needlessly commits the
individual, team, or crew to an unsafe course-of-action. These violations may have leadership
sanction and may not routinely result in disciplinary/administrative action. Habitual violations
of a single individual or small group of individuals within a unit can constitute a
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011                                                              125


routine/widespread violation if the violation was not routinely disciplined or was condoned by
supervisors. These violations may also be referred to as ―Routine Violations.‖

AV003 Violation - Lack of Discipline
Violation - Lack of Discipline is a factor when an individual, crew or team intentionally violates
procedures or policies without cause or need. These violations are unusual or isolated to specific
individuals rather than larger groups. There is no evidence of these violations being condoned
by leadership. These violations may also be referred to as ―exceptional violations.‖ (NOTE:
These violations may also carry UCMJ consequences. Boards should consult the Judge
Advocate of the convening authority.)


PRECONDITIONS

Preconditions are factors in a mishap if active and/or latent preconditions such as conditions of
the operators, environmental or personnel factors affect practices, conditions or actions of
individuals and result in human error or an unsafe situation.

Environmental Factors are factors in a mishap if physical or technological factors affect
practices, conditions and actions of individual and result in human error or an unsafe situation.

Physical Environment is a factor in a mishap if environmental phenomena such as weather,
climate, white-out or brown out conditions affect the actions of individuals and result in human
error or an unsafe situation.

PE101 Vision Restricted by Icing/Windows Fogged/Etc

environment are disturbed by the aircraft, vehicle or person and cause a restriction of vision to a
point where normal duties are affected

Technological Environment is a factor in a mishap when cockpit/vehicle/control
station/workspace design factors or automation affect the actions of individuals and result in
human error or an unsafe situation.

PE201 Seating and Restraints
Seating and Restraints is a factor when the design of the seat or restraint system, the ejection
system, seat comfort or poor impact-protection qualities of the seat create an unsafe situation.

PE202 Instrumentation and Sensory Feedback Systems
Instrumentation and Sensory Feedback Systems is a factor when instrument factors such as
design, reliability, lighting, location, symbology or size are inadequate and create an unsafe
situation. This includes Night Vision Displays, Heads-Up Display, off-bore-site and helmet-
mounted display systems and inadequacies in auditory or tactile situational awareness or warning
systems such as aural voice warnings or stick shakers.

PE203 Visibility Restrictions

support mission demands. (i.e. aircraft/vehicle with no intercom) This includes electronically or
physically blocked transmissions. Communications can be voice, data or multi-sensory.

Condition of Individuals is a factor in a mishap if cognitive, psycho-behavioral, adverse
physical state, or physical/mental limitations affect practices, conditions or actions of individuals
and result in human error or an unsafe situation.

Cognitive Factors are factors in a mishap if cognitive or attention management conditions affect
the perception or performance of individuals and result in human error or an unsafe situation.

PC101 Inattention
Inattention is a factor when the individual has a state of reduced conscious attention due to a
sense of security, self-confidence, boredom or a perceived absence of threat from the
environment which degrades crew performance. (This may often be a result of highly repetitive
tasks. Lack of a state of alertness or readiness to process immediately available information.)

PC102 Channelized Attention
Channelized Attention is a factor when the individual is focusing all conscious attention on a
limited number of environmental cues to the exclusion of others of a subjectively equal or higher
or more immediate priority, leading to an unsafe situation. May be described as a tight focus of
attention that leads to the exclusion of comprehensive situational information.

PC103 Cognitive Task Oversaturation
Cognitive Task Oversaturation is a factor when the quantity of information an individual must
process exceeds their cognitive or mental resources in the amount of time available to process
the information.
 128                                                AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_I 18 AUGUST 2011



PC104 Confusion

previous system or situation and that response is inappropriate or degrades mission performance.

PC106 Distraction
Distraction is a factor when the individual has an interruption of attention and/or inappropriate
redirection of attention by an environmental cue or mental process that degrades performance.

PC107 Geographic Misorientation (Lost)
Geographic Misorientation (Lost) is a factor when the individual is at a latitude and/or longitude
different from where he believes he is or at a lat/long unknown to the individual and this creates
an unsafe situation.

PC108 Checklist Interference
Checklist Interference is a factor when an individual is performing a highly automated/learned
task and is distracted by anther cue/event that results in the interruption and subsequent failure to
complete the original task or results in skipping steps in the original task.

Psycho-Behavioral Factors are factors when an individual‘s personality traits, psychosocial
problems, psychological disorders or inappropriate motivation creates an unsafe situation.

PC201 Pre-Existing Personality Disorder

typically by night work or rapid movement (such as one time zone per hour) across several time
zones. Referred to as ―shift lag‖ and ―jet lag.‖ Time in the new time zone will lead to adaptation
and recovery; the amount of time depends on the number of time zones crossed and the direction
of travel. Recovery from shift lag may never occur.
