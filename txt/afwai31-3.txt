1. Purpose. This instruction establishes responsibilities and procedures for management of
AFWA SCIF #1 (Bldg 185), restricted area access control system.
2. Authority
     2.1. The AFWA Security Manager (SM) is appointed by the Commander and is
     responsible for oversight of Information, Personnel, and Industrial Security Programs,
     Antiterrorism, and the Resource Protection Program, to include Access Entry Control System
     (AECS) American District Telegraph (ADT) controlled areas established within AFWA.
     2.2. The AFWA Special Security Officer (SSO) is appointed by the AFWA Senior
     Intelligence Officer and is responsible for the oversight of Sensitive Compartmented
     Information (SCI) material and all SCI security functions for AFWA. Responsibilities
     include the direct day-to-day operations of the AFWA SCIF #1 (185), and the AECS,
     commonly known as the ADT card system, which is used to control access to AFWA
     facilities. Within AFWA, the SSO duties are assigned to a member of the SSO Staff.
3. General
     3.1. General AFWA Access. Access to all areas in AFWA is controlled or limited to
     restrict access to classified areas, to protect high value resources, or to limit the flow of
     traffic through work areas to personnel conducting official business.
     3.2. Controlled Access Areas. Access to controlled access areas is restricted to those
     personnel with required security clearance, access, and need-to-know based on the resources
     or classified data/information contained within the area. Specific established area designator,
     area title, and the access requirements and approving officials for each is provided in
     Attachment 2.
     3.3. Temporary Access.
        3.3.1. Personnel having official business in AFWA facilities controlled by AECS for a
        minimum of 5 duty days may be granted temporary unescorted access cards. Cards are
        primarily issued to allow unescorted entry into the general facility area for visitors on
        official business and/or for extended construction/maintenance actions. Cards will be
        issued and controlled in accordance with paragraph 3.3.2 below. NOTE: Temporary
        cards will NOT be used to grant unescorted entry into classified areas established for the
        protection of classified material without validation of clearance, access, and need-to-
        know. Validation of need-to-know must be provided by the area approving authority
        listed in Attachment 2 and validation of clearance and access must be provided by the
        AFWA SM or Alternate.
        3.3.2. Temporary cards will be issued by the SSO staff and will be requested by the
        sponsor of the visit or the work performance. Cards will be issued to the sponsor, who is
        responsible for recovery of the cards upon completion of the visit/work performance and
        the cards returned to the SSO staff. Requests must state the purpose and duration of the
        visit, the number of cards required, and the sponsor's information. Cards not returned by
        the established visit end date will be changed to "inactive" status in the control system to
        render them unusable for building/area entry.
