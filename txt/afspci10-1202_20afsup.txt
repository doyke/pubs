1. Qualification Status. Space operations training programs are designed to advance crew
members who have completed Space 100/UST through Basic System Qualification (BSQ) to
Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or Combat Mission Ready (CMR) qualification status. 1NXXX
personnel will attend specific training as required to attain CMR status. Mission Support
personnel will be certified IAW paragraph 1.4., as required.
    1.1. BSQ. Following Space 100 or foreign national equivalent and upon completion of
    Initial Qualification Training (IQT), if available, a crew member attains BSQ status. If a
    formal IQT course exists, BSQ is a prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (MQT)
    and is not intended to be a long-term qualification status. MQT provides the training
    necessary to initially qualify a crew member in a specific position required to perform the
    unit mission. Upon completion of MQT, the crew member attains BMC or CMR status IAW
    paragraphs 5. and 6.
    1.2. BMC. Qualification status of individuals who have completed the minimum training
    required to be familiar with specified tasks associated with their unit’s mission or missions.
    BMC status is the minimum level of qualification that applies to Numbered Air Force (NAF)
    commanders (if they choose to be BMC although not required), wing commanders, vice
    commanders, operations group commanders, deputy ops group commanders, squadron
    commanders and detachment commanders as applicable and requires completion of an
    AETC mission area orientation or familiarization course (when applicable) and appropriate
    unit familiarization training. NAF/Wing commanders can designate additional positions as
    BMC. NAF/Wing commanders can also designate their respective squadron commander as
    CMR if they so dictate.
       1.2.1. Units will determine familiarization requirements for BMC qualification and
       forward them through their group/wing through their NAFs for concurrence to HQ
       AFSPC/A3T for approval. Air Reserve Component (ARC) units (i.e., 6 SOPS, 119
       CACS) will staff their BMC familiarization requirements through their respective
       headquarters OPRs who will then forward to AFSPC/A3T for approval.
       1.2.2. NAF/Wing Commanders may require BMC certified individuals to upgrade to
       CMR. These individuals must comply with CMR qualification requirements IAW
       paragraph 6. Additional CMR task training requirements will be met through MQT-
       type training.
           1.2.2.1. (Added-20 AF) 20 AF/CC requires all operations squadron commanders be
           CMR certified. If the OSS commander is BMC IAW paragraph 4.4.5., the OSS
           operations officer will be CMR. Wing Commanders may grant exceptions based on
           special circumstances (e.g., Unauthorized Launch Study Access).
       1.2.3. BMC qualified personnel will always perform crew duty with an individual CMR
       certified in the same duty position of pride of ownership within base personnel.
       1.2.4. (20 AF) BMC qualification includes Emergency War Order (EWO) and Codes
       familiarization training. EWO and Codes certifications are not required.
    1.3. CMR. Qualification status of operations officers and below as well as Spacelift
    Commanders, Spacelift Operations Directors and, if designated by NAF commander, the
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          5


   chiefs of standardization/evaluation, who have completed the minimum training required to
   be qualified and proficient in all tasks associated with their unit’s mission. Operations
   officers (or squadron commanders if designated as CMR IAW paragraph. 1.2.) will be
   CMR in the most comprehensive/senior CMR position (Exception: 20 AF OSS operations
   officers can be BMC per group commander’s discretion). Generally, this status applies to
   13SX, 1C6XX and 1NXXX personnel who have completed Space 100, AETC IQT (if
   available) and MQT, have passed an evaluation and are certified by an appropriate certifying
   official. CMR requirements may apply to additional career fields at selected units at the
   direction of HQ AFSPC/A3.
       1.3.1. CMR personnel are responsible for completing a unit’s real-time operational
       mission and should not be confused with individuals who provide mission critical support
       functions. Examples of CMR crew positions are those with individuals who command
       satellites, accept custody of missile sorties, control space launch countdown processing,
       conduct counterspace operations, and physically control warning and surveillance
       systems. Job performance requirements for CMR positions are documented in
       accordance with NAF-approved Training and Evaluation Performance Standards (TEPS).
       1.3.2. (20 AF) EWO and code handler certifications are prerequisites for CMR
       certification and performance of unsupervised duty.
       1.3.3. HQ AFSPC/A3 is the sole authority for revoking and establishing new CMR
       positions. Units and NAFs should submit recommendations with the appropriate
       justification through HQ AFSPC/A3T. Upon approval, HQ AFSPC/A3 division(s) will
       update applicable guidance.
   1.4. Mission Support Personnel. Personnel not designated CMR/BMC who require a
   structured training program, as directed by the unit commander, will be qualified in their
   unique duty positions. In these cases, the group commander will document qualification
   requirements through the development of a group level operating instruction, ensuring
   compliance with AFPD 36-22 Air Force Military Training, AFMAN 36-2234 Instructional
   System Development, AFH 36-2235V11 Information For Designers Of Instructional
   Systems Application To Unit Training, AFI 36-2201V3 Air Force Training Program On
   The Job Training Administration and applicable Career Field Education and Training Plans
   (CFETP). At a minimum, training program requirements must include a master training plan
   identifying applicable task knowledge and performance requirements. Based on mission
   needs, additional consideration for inclusion into training programs should be given to
   recurring training requirements, procedures for placement on/removal from restricted status,
   procedures for decertification/recertification, and procedures to identify any health or
   medical condition that could impair ability to perform mission duties. The unit commander
   or next senior commander or deputy in the operational chain of command qualifies the
   individual.
2. Operations Review Boards (ORB). NAFs will establish an ORB process to conduct an
investigation to determine the cause of any abnormal system response. Examples of
circumstances requiring an ORB include: major system degradation, indications of erroneous
system response/procedures with significant mission impact, and significant events where the
cause cannot be determined by initial assessment or when corrective action is beyond minimal
retraining/minor procedural changes.
6                                            AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


    2.1. The ORB convening authority is the 14 AF/A3, 20 AF/A3 or the wing/group/squadron
    CC at their respective organizational levels. ORB composition is at the discretion of the
    convening authority. Inform the respective NAF, HQ AFSPC/A3T and the A3 division with
    system responsibility via message when an ORB is convened (electronic versions are
    acceptable).
       2.1.1. (Added-20 AF) Units will establish an ORB process to determine the cause of
       any abnormal system response. An abnormal system response may include the
       following: hardware or software anomalies, Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR)
       violations, or security deficiencies. When to convene, composition, and report format
       will be left to unit discretion; however, the ORB should recommend corrective action(s)
       and suggest improvements to prevent a reoccurrence. Unless directed by other DoD, Air
       Force, MAJCOM, or other agency direction, units will forward their ORB report to 20
       AF/A3NV (e.g., higher headquarters assistance is required to solve a problem).
    2.2. ORB minutes will be approved at the next organizational level above the convening
    authority. Send a copy of ORB minutes to the NAF, with information copies to HQ
    AFSPC/A3T and the AFSPC/A3 division responsible for the mission (electronic versions are
    acceptable). Forward a copy of ORB minutes documenting safety-related problems to HQ
    AFSPC/SE.
3. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for New or Upgraded Systems. Prior to IOC, the
wing/group ensures operations, training, standardization, evaluation and crew force management
programs are developed and managed to provide adequate support to the new or upgraded
system operations. The unit commander will report this status using Status of Resources and
Training System (SORTS) criteria (see AFI10-201, Status of Resources and Training System).
IOC declaration for AFSPC systems are managed IAW AFSPCI10-604, Space Operations
Weapon System Management.

            certification requirement.
        6.1.6. When significant hardware, software or procedural changes impact unit mission
        requirements, recertify affected CMR personnel to address the changes. AFSPC/A3 will
        determine the requirement for recertification based on recommendations from the NAF,
        HQ AFSPC/A3T and the appropriate division within HQ AFSPC/A3, which has
        MAJCOM oversight of the affected mission. (20 AF) Refer to AFSPCI10-902 for EWO
        recertification instructions.
     6.2. CMR Special Applications. When a new unit or duty position is established, new
     equipment or system modifications occur, or new or significantly changed operations
     procedures requiring training or evaluation occur, the most experienced or qualified
     personnel in the unit may be designated as the subject matter experts (SME) and CMR. This
     only applies to those individuals necessary to develop/conduct the appropriate CMR training
     and evaluation programs or individuals necessary to support the operations, test, and
     evaluation process. SMEs must accomplish the appropriate training for the duty position,
     such as contractor-provided Type I training, and meet requirements in paragraphs 6.1.3. and
     6.1.4. as applicable.
     6.3. Certifying Official. The certifying official ensures the successful completion of
     required mission-oriented training, evaluation and ancillary training.
        6.3.1. The unit commander or operations officer documents, in writing (or electronic
        signature), CMR certification for crew members in their unit. For spacelift wings, the
        next senior commander in the chain of command is the CMR certification official.
            6.3.1.1. (Added-20 AF) The certifying official is by position and must be
            knowledgeable of the information being briefed. The next senior commander or
            deputy in the operational chain of command can certify in the absence of unit
            leadership. Certifying officials can certify individuals in other squadrons.
        6.3.2. Document CMR, EWO and additional duty position certification on the AFSPC
        Form 91.
        6.3.3. 21 SW GSU, 50 SW GSU and 148 SOPS Chiefs of Standardization/Evaluation (or
        senior evaluator CMR certified in the evaluated position) administer CMR evaluations
        (initial, recurring or special) to GSU commanders (if designated as CMR IAW
        paragraph 1.2.) and operations officers and provide results to the next senior
        commander (or deputy). The next senior commander (or deputy) makes a certification
        decision and determines additional training requirements.
     6.4. Restricted Status. Personnel in restricted status will not perform unsupervised CMR
     crew duties. Document restricted status entry and reason on the AFSPC Form 91. As a
     minimum, the certifying official restricts personnel for the following:

        month if a PHA is not accomplished.
     6.4.5. Failure to perform one alert/one duty shift for 45 calendar days in the assigned
     CMR duty position (including ARC). Dual-position certified personnel are only required
     to perform one duty shift every 45 days. Multi-position certified personnel are required
     to perform one duty shift in each position every 45 days. (Not applicable to spacelift,
     mobile space control and mobile missile warning.)
        6.4.5.1. Restricted status will begin the 46th day following the last alert/duty shift.
            6.4.5.1.1. (Added-20 AF) For tracking purposes, the day the MCCM
            relinquishes alert will count as Day 0 of the 45 day count.
        6.4.5.2. (Added-20 AF) Award credit for CMR alert duty if the MCC signs for the
        alert and an uncontrollable situation (e.g., illness, death in immediate family, other
        PRP issue) occurs requiring relief. Do not award alert credit if the MCC signs for the
        alert for situations such as field phase.
        6.4.5.3. (Added-20 AF) Alert duty at Vandenberg AFB during Force Development
        Evaluation and Operations Plan 8010 Revision Software Testing (Vigilant Vanguard)
        is creditable toward alert currency requirements of this instruction.
        6.4.5.4. (Added-20 AF) For ALCS, failure to perform one alert/one duty shift for 60
        calendar days in the assigned CMR duty position will result in restricted status.
        Effective date of restriction will be the 60th day following the last alert/duty shift.
        Duel qualified personnel are only required to perform one alert/one duty shift every
        60 days. All airborne alert missions and airborne operational test missions are
        creditable toward alert/duty shift currency requirements of this instruction.

     1NXXX personnel. Units with CMR crew positions filled by personnel with other AFSCs
     (foreign nationals excluded) must submit a waiver request to HQ AFSPC/A3 through HQ
     AFSPC/A3T IAW paragraph 10. of this instruction. Refer to Attachment 2 for a list of
     CMR crew positions.
        7.2.1. (Added-20 AF) Dual qualified CMR crews consist of two certified Missile
        Combat Crew Commanders (MCCCs). A Missile Combat Crew Commander (MCCC) is
        dual qualified upon upgrade to MCCC from DMCCC.
        7.2.2. (Added-20 AF) A Missile Combat Crew Member – Airborne (MCCM-A) is duel
        qualified upon upgrade to Missile Combat Crew Commander – Airborne (MCCC-A).
     7.3. Crew Scheduling. Adherence to safe operating procedures and WSSRs is mandatory
     and has prime consideration in the planning, scheduling, briefing, and conduct of all
     activities. NAFs/units will develop a comprehensive scheduling plan to effectively manage
     personnel resources. NAFs and subordinate units will develop and publish comprehensive
     policies governing specific alert and shift requirements in a supplement to this instruction.
        7.3.1. (Added-20 AF) The OSS will publish a Missile Alert Duty Order (MADO) for
        each pre-departure briefing. The MADO will be authenticated and distributed before the
        alert duty period. MCCs listed on the MADO are authorized to pull alert at any LCC in
        the wing they are qualified for.
            7.3.1.1. (Added-20 AF) Number each MADO consecutively from the start of each
            calendar year. List crew members scheduled to perform alert at the designated flight
            in the ―Primary‖ column. For field evaluations, enter the appropriate data in the
            ―Alternate‖ column. Use the ―Remarks‖ column to explain this entry.
            7.3.1.2. (Added-20 AF) The operations group commander (OG/CC) or designated
            representative will sign the MADO as the initiating agency. All individuals signing
            as authenticating officials must have a DD Form 577 (Signature Card), on file at the
            Keys and Codes Control Center (KCCC).
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                      17


        7.3.1.3. (Added-20 AF) The original MADO will be given to KCCC. The
        operations support squadron (OSS) combat crew scheduling will retain paper
        MADOs for 12 months. Pre-departure briefing officers and each squadron command
        post will maintain a record copy for the duration the MADO is valid.
        7.3.1.4. (Added-20 AF) Corrections and Substitutions. Corrections for changes or
        substitutions, which occur after the order is published, require a new MADO. The
        new MADO need only list those personnel changed or substituted.
            7.3.1.4.1. (Added-20 AF) Use the same order number as the original, but add an
            alpha character to differentiate between the original and revised versions.
            7.3.1.4.2. (Added-20 AF) Any two authenticating officials may sign the change.
            The officer making the change ensures agencies on distribution are informed of
            changes.
     7.3.2. (Added-20 AF) Priorities. Availability of resources will determine the unit’s
     ability to meet operational requirements. When scheduling, apply the following
     priorities:
        7.3.2.1. (Added-20 AF) Priority 1: Primary mission objectives.
        7.3.2.2. (Added-20 AF) Priority 2: Higher headquarters (HHQ) inspections.
        7.3.2.3. (Added-20 AF) Priority 3: Training and Evaluations.
        7.3.2.4. (Added-20 AF) Priority 4: HHQ directed missions, exercises, or system
        training.
     7.3.3. (Added-20 AF) Crew Rest Period. Crew rest is required prior to alert duties.
     The crew rest period is normally a minimum 12 hour non-duty period before pre-
     departure/pre-deployment briefings. Its purpose is to ensure the crew member is
     adequately rested before performing alert duties. Crew rest is free time, which includes
     time for meals, transportation, and rest. Rest is defined as a condition that allows an
     individual the opportunity to sleep.
        7.3.3.1. (Added-20 AF) Do not schedule duty or training 12 hours prior to pre-
        departure/pre-deployment briefings. This does not preclude scheduling items of
        preparation (i.e., pre-pre activities) immediately prior to the pre-departure/pre-
        deployment briefing time. Testing may occur after the pre-departure/pre-deployment
        briefing and prior to alert as directed by the OG/CC or HHQ.
        7.3.3.2. (Added-20 AF) During this free time, crews should have time for meals,
        transportation, and the opportunity for 8 hours of uninterrupted rest.
        7.3.3.3. (Added-20 AF) Under unusual circumstances or to meet mission
        requirements, the OG/CC may place a crew on duty as needs dictate. Every effort
        shall be made to ensure MCCMs have a minimum of 8 hours of uninterrupted rest.
        7.3.3.4. (Added-20 AF) Do not schedule back-to-back alerts unless requested in
        writing by the MCC or MCCM and approved by the OG/CC. Unscheduled back-to-
        back alerts necessitated by unforeseen situations must also be approved in writing by
        the OG/CC. Annotating the MADO will suffice.
18                                             AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


               7.3.3.4.1. (Added-20 AF) Back-to-back alert is defined as an alert action (alert
               and ―O’day) immediately followed by another alert action (alert and ―O‖ day)
               taking place over four consecutive calendar days.
               7.3.3.4.2. (Added-20 AF) Alerts extended due to weather (48-hour alert or
               longer) or multiple days in the field as part of a four-person A1/A2 crew pulling
               12-hour shifts do not constitute back-to-back.
            7.3.3.5. (Added-20 AF) Do not schedule evaluations, crew training, MPT rides, or
            other related duties during a crew member’s O-day. Squadron, group and wing
            commander’s calls, as well as other squadron commander-directed events are
            authorized mandatory events for a crew’s O-day return. A commander’s call is not
            considered additional duty and a MCCM is expected to attend such an event after
            completion of alert duty provided they have safely returned to support base in time.
            In these cases, units will ensure MCCMs have a minimum of 8 hours uninterrupted
            rest beginning from the end of commander’s call until their next scheduled event.
        7.3.4. (Added-20 AF) Utilization.      The following guidance applies under normal
        conditions.
            7.3.4.1. (Added-20 AF) Squadron MCCMs are limited to a maximum of eight alerts
            per month. MCCMs scheduled for more than eight events require OG/CC approval.
            7.3.4.2. (Added-20 AF) Flight commanders, OSOT and OGV MCCMs will perform
            a minimum of two alerts per month. Operations group commanders will determine
            the maximum monthly alert load requirements for these MCCMs. These officers
            hold key staff positions and the primary emphasis should be on performing those
            duties with an alert rate that ensures an adequate level of proficiency.
            7.3.4.3. (Added-20 AF) When situations exist, such as austere manning, higher
            states of readiness, execution of Emergency War Orders (EWO), or other emergency
            situations, units may deviate from the above limits, the minimum amount necessary,
            to ensure mission accomplishment.
     7.4. Officer Crew Tour Commitment Dates. (Except ARC) Officer crew members in
     CMR positions (operations officers and above excluded, where applicable) at CONUS non-
     isolated bases are placed on an AAC 55. The AAC 55 is intended to provide a stabilized
     crew force, a Trained Personnel Requirements validation tool and to ensure payback for
     AETC training. The code is controlled by the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and may
     be terminated for a higher-level Air Force priority. Personnel with an AAC 55 must perform
     duty in a CMR position until an appropriate authority waives the AAC 55 or the AAC 55
     expires. Individuals whose primary duties do not require CMR certification (e.g., plans,
     executives, protocol) should not remain CMR certified. Ideally, officers selected for these
     positions should be near or at the end of their crew tours. An AAC 55 starts from the month
     the member arrives at the organization or function in accordance with AFI36-2110,
     Assignments, paragraph 2.15. and the AFPC Stabilized Tour Guide. The individual becomes
     available for reassignment during the assignment cycle when the AAC expires. For example,
     an individual arrives at his organization on 15 Aug 08 and receives a 3-year AAC 55. The
     AAC 55 begins on 15 Aug 08 and expires 1 Aug 11. The individual is available for
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                         19


  reassignment during the summer assignment cycle, Jun-Sep 11. The local Military Personnel
  Flight (MPF) administers the AAC 55.
     7.4.1. Unit inactivation. Follow-on assignments for officers at inactivating units will be
     determined through the AFPC assignment process.
     7.4.2. Officers applying for schools or special programs do not require an AAC 55
     waiver prior to the selection board. This includes boards for flying training, AF Institute
     of Technology (AFIT) programs, Top Hand and the AF Weapons Program. Officers
     should contact HQ AFSPC/A3T for boards not listed above. If the officer is selected, the
     unit must process a waiver to accurately account for AAC 55 commitments.
     7.4.3. A waiver is required prior to removal of officers from duty in a CMR position if
     the AAC 55 has not expired. HQ AFSPC/A3 is the AAC 55 waiver authority; however,
     this authority is delegated to 14 AF and 20 AF commanders for waivers of 7-12 months
     and wing commanders for waivers of 6 months or less. Documentation of NAF and unit
     waivers will be IAW local unit procedures and will include a roster of all crew members
     granted AAC 55 waivers, the purpose for the waiver and the original and new AAC 55
     expiration dates. Units will send quarterly copies of the roster to their NAFs, who will
     consolidate the inputs and forward to HQ AFSPC/A3TT via hardcopy or e-mail. Since
     Trained Personnel Requirements are based on AAC 55 expiration dates, units should not
     expect replacements for officers with AAC 55 waivers until the original AAC 55 expires.
     HQ AFSPC/A1FC will coordinate with HQ AFSPC/A3TT on assignment actions of crew
     personnel with an AAC 55, as required. Waivers are not required when removal from
     CMR duty is the result of medical disqualification, permanent PRP decertification or if
     AFPC has broken the AAC 55 to meet an Air Force-level PCS requirement. Units will
     also reflect these instances in their quarterly rosters.
         7.4.3.1. (Added-20 AF) The 20 AF/A3 is responsible for managing the AAC 55
         process for 20 AF. The 20 AF/CC may delegate AAC 55 waiver authority to the 20
         AF/A3.
     7.4.4. Unit Staff Manning. To ensure a strong crew force and appropriate wing staff
     manning, the following guidelines apply:
         7.4.4.1. (20 AF) Missile units will fill their company grade staff positions using
         internal resources to the maximum extent. When necessary, PCS manning will be
         provided based on priorities determined by HQ AFSPC/A1FC (in coordination with
         HQ AFSPC/A3TT), but careful planning and coordination should minimize these
         occurrences. Flexible application of AAC 55 and AAC 39 will support this process.
         Recognizing the time-sensitive nature of Code Controller manning, HQ AFSPC/A3
         will support AAC 55 waivers at 2.5 years served for this position. Other staff fills
         should not occur prior to 3 years of crew duty, based on approved AAC 55 waivers at
         the appropriate level. Under no circumstances will officers exceed 5.5 years Time on
         Station (TOS).
         7.4.4.2. (14 AF) Space unit manning is complicated by varied crew-to-staff ratios
         and large staff requirements. Positions for crew-experienced staff officers exceed
         crew positions in many squadrons, driving a higher rate of crew-to-staff rotations than
         missile units. Space unit commanders should minimize crew force turbulence to the
20                                              AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


            maximum extent and seek AAC 55 waivers only as required to maintain staff
            capabilities. Crew members with the highest time on crew should be primary
            candidates for staff positions.
     7.5. Enlisted Crew Tour Commitment Dates. (Except ARC) Based on assignment policy,
     most first term airmen will complete 2 years of crew duty before PCS, all other enlisted crew
     members will complete 3 years without the need for an AAC. Selectively manned units will
     utilize procedures other than listed in this paragraph to maintain crew force stability. Other
     units will use the following guidance to assign AACs to enlisted crew members.
        7.5.1. Units with missions that require all enlisted crewmembers assigned to hold TS/SCI
        clearances and are not selectively manned will apply to be added to the AF Stabilized
        Tour Guide IAW AFI36-2110, Assignments, paragraph 2.15.6. This will provide crew
        force stability upon the individual’s arrival to the unit through assignment of AAC 44, 3-
        year Stabilized Tour.
        7.5.2. Units may request AAC 51, Operational Deferment, for enlisted crew members
        selected to fill NAF/Wing/Group and OSS Staff positions not to exceed 4 years, 3
        months’ time on station. For enlisted crew members selected to fill NAF/Wing/Group or
        OSS Staff positions that PCS to the duty assignment, no AAC is required. Only one
        AAC code will be assigned per manpower billet. If crew members are double-billeted in
        the same manpower position, only one AAC will be approved.
        7.5.3. Operational units performing weapon system upgrades or bringing new weapon
        systems online may request AAC 39, Operational Continuity, Airmen not to exceed 3
        years, for designated SMEs to support transition. Units will identify the minimum
        number of enlisted crew force personnel required to sustain support of upgrade/new
        weapons system transition. New AAC 39s will only be approved to replace SMEs that
        PCS, PCA, separate or retire.
        7.5.4. No more than one AAC per person will be approved for a given crew
        tour/assigned unit.
        7.5.5. HQ AFSPC/A1F is the approving authority for enlisted AAC requests. Submit
        requests through HQ AFSPC/A1FX, 150 Vandenberg St., Suite 1105, Peterson AFB CO
        80914-4020.
     7.6. Adjusting Crew Tour Commitment Dates. AAC 55 dates are established as outlined
     in paragraph 7.4. and will not be adjusted by local MPFs. For instances such as security
     clearance issues and extended DNIC/DNIA status, units are encouraged to request extensions
     for members via the AFPC reclama process as appropriate.
        7.6.1. (Added-20 AF) Pregnant crew members. In accordance with AFI 48-123,
        Medical Examinations and Standards, crew members should be removed from alert duty
        after 24 weeks gestation. This standard may be modified as necessary for problem
        pregnancies. Pregnant crew members should continue to receive their required monthly
        training up to their date of delivery (as medical circumstances will allow). These crew
        members should become CMR as soon as possible after maternity leave is completed.
     7.7. DNIC/DNIA. This process ensures individuals with medical conditions that could
     affect mission accomplishment, cause mission degradation, or endanger personnel safety do
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            21


   not perform operational duties. The terms DNIF, DNIA and DNIC are synonymous
   (reference AFI48-123 VOL 3). Each wing should use DNIC or DNIA exclusively.
      7.7.1. Personnel assigned to CMR/BMC positions (including foreign nationals, if
      required by international agreement or IAW position descriptions supplied to the foreign
      country pursuant to international agreement) who fail to meet the applicable medical
      standards established in AFI48-123 VOL 3 will be placed in DNIC/DNIA status and will
      not perform CMR/BMC duties on real-world systems.
      7.7.2. Personnel in DNIC/DNIA status who are not on convalescent leave, hospitalized,
      or assigned to quarters may perform additional duties as determined by the unit and
      competent medical authority to include receiving classroom/simulator instruction or
      instruction on real-world equipment that has been electrically isolated and performing in
      a simulator capacity.
8. Technical Data And Procedures:
   8.1. Technical Data. Operational systems and weapon systems will not be operated without
   validated and verified technical data or operations procedures. Once technical data or
   operational checklists are in place, crews will use these technical data/checklists at all times
   (or as specified in the technical data) when operating the systems.
   8.2. Operations Manuals. The NAFs will specify procedures for proper marking and
   annotations on hardcopy technical data consistent with the provisions of T.O. 00-5-1, Air
   Force Technical Order System and all other applicable technical order directives.
      8.2.1. (Added-20 AF) Sections 3, 4, and 5 must be covered with acetate to prevent
      technical data from being obscured by Vis-à-vis, grease pencil, or various other marking
      devices. Annotations on the paper technical data page must be in soft erasable black or
      red pencil only. All markings, except supplement entries, must be completely erased
      before manual turn-in. Authorized annotations are:
          8.2.1.1. (Added-20 AF) Any writing in technical data that does not obscure printed
          material or change the technical content or classification of the material being
          annotated. Changing the technical content includes, but is not limited to, adding,
          deleting, or supplementing T.O. checklist steps or technical information.
          8.2.1.2. (Added-20 AF) Underlining, which does not obscure or line out printed
          material.
          8.2.1.3. (Added-20 AF) Color highlighting on acetate that does not obscure the
          printed material.
          8.2.1.4. (Added-20 AF) Page numbers next to steps referencing other checklists.
          8.2.1.5. (Added-20 AF) Placing sections 3, 4, and 5 in acetate is not required for
          T.O.s maintained within a T.O. library and not used for operational purposes.
          8.2.1.6. (Added-20 AF) For T.O. 21M-LGM30F-1-24 (ALCS Operation
          Instructions), sections 3, 4, and 5 are not required to be in acetate. Appropriate use
          and application of acetate is at MCCM-A discretion.

     P = Priority of AFTO 22 being sent (R=Routine - U=Urgent - E=Emergency)
            8.2.2.2. (Added-20 AF) Units are encouraged to submit an AFTO IMT 22 if there is
            information crew members are annotating that does not meet the above criteria but is
            worthy of T.O. inclusion.
     8.3. (14 AF applicable units) Space Operations Procedures. This section outlines the
     basic process for development, validation, and approval of procedures based on new or
     changed operations requirements for units without formally published technical data. These
     procedures can be permanent or temporary. Contractor-developed procedures are produced
     and delivered according to the specifications in the governing contract. The implementing
     unit must review these contractor documents for impact to unit procedures.
        8.3.1. Procedures Development and Validation:
            8.3.1.1. The individual has completed the crew tour, unless appropriate waiver
            authority has approved an AAC waiver. The waiver must be approved prior to PCA
            and decertification. (See paragraphs 7.4. and 7.5.)
            8.3.1.2. Validation. The organization(s) required to implement the procedure first
            validates it through trial use. Run the procedures, noting the expected outcome for
            each step or task. If the outcome is not as expected, then an analysis must be
            accomplished to determine any required modifications to the procedures or expected
            results. Provide recommendations to the developer for consideration or approval. If
            the trial run of a new procedure may impact operations or operational equipment, it
            must be conducted on an off-line simulator/system (if available) with sufficient
            fidelity to ensure no mission impact/equipment damage to the operational system.
        8.3.2. Permanent Procedures. These are necessary to ensure successful mission
        accomplishment. Although they are usually required for an indefinite period of time,
        they may be periodically modified to keep pace with changes to system or mission
        requirements. Permanent procedures are documented in positional checklists or
        operations manuals. Locally prepared checklists are formatted IAW T.O. 00-5-1, MIL-
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          23


     PRF-38314, Manuals, Technical:       Operation and Associated Checklist (Space
     Systems), Preparation of, and MIL-STD-38784, Standard Practice for Manuals,
     Technical, General Style and Format Requirements.
        8.3.2.1. Changes. Changes to permanent procedures are categorized according to the
        urgency for their implementation. Modifications usually are affected through the
        replacement of whole pages. The three categories of changes are emergency, urgent,
        and routine.
            8.3.2.1.1. Emergency. These require immediate action on a deficiency that, if not
            corrected, would result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel, extensive
            damage or destruction of equipment or property, or inability to achieve or
            maintain the mission.
            8.3.2.1.2. Urgent. These require action on a deficiency which, if not corrected,
            could cause one or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to equipment
            or property; reduce operational efficiency; or could jeopardize the safety or
            success of mission accomplishment.
            8.3.2.1.3. Routine. These require action on deficiencies that do not fall into the
            emergency or urgent categories. These are modifications to existing procedures
            that do not affect the overall process for completion, such as administrative
            changes.
        8.3.2.2. 14 AF develops procedures regarding the coordination and approval process
        for permanent procedures contained in positional checklists and operations manuals
        as well as checklist numbering schemes.
            8.3.2.2.1. The coordination process must address procedure technical accuracy
            assurance, standardization of procedures, and training requirements.
            8.3.2.2.2. The approval process must identify the final approval authority for new
            or changed procedures. The final approval authority ensures the procedure
            satisfies the operational requirement, is technically accurate, is in compliance with
            DoD and Air Force directives or instructions, and is formatted appropriately.
        8.3.2.3. All permanent procedures are maintained in the appropriate work center or
        issued to all personnel performing duties in the work center. No new or changed
        procedures will be used for operations until properly coordinated, approved and
        trained to crew members. A unit may recommend to the approving authority that the
        procedure be categorized as a Temporary Procedure (TP) pending final approval. In
        this case, the procedure must meet all TP requirements before implementation.
        8.3.2.4. Individuals have the responsibility to take actions necessary to ensure the
        procedure in use is accurate. Work centers will review procedures at least annually to
        ensure accuracy, currency, and mission applicability.
        8.3.2.5. Forward a copy of all approved permanent procedures and related training
        material to the unit providing system initial qualification training, as applicable.
     8.3.3. Temporary Procedures. TPs are used to temporarily alter existing permanent
     procedures. Posted directly opposite the affected procedure, they are usually required to
     be implemented because of a unique mission requirement (e.g., to support system testing
24                                             AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


        or to support a system engineering analysis requirement). They are seldom modified;
        instead, they are regenerated as a new TP and the previous version rescinded. TPs may
        be used to affect partial changes to permanent procedures until the procedure or page may
        be replaced in its entirety IAW paragraph 8.3.2.1.
            8.3.3.1. A Temporary Procedure Request (TPR) is the document used to implement a
            TP. Initially attached to the TP during the coordination process and prior to TP
            posting, the TPR includes the following information (at a minimum): posting and
            removal instructions, effective dates, issuing agency, and coordinating/approval
            agencies and signatures.
            8.3.3.2. There are three categories of TPs: emergency, urgent, and routine.
               8.3.3.2.1. Emergency. These require immediate action that, if not implemented,
               would result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel, extensive damage or
               destruction of equipment or property, or inability to achieve or maintain the
               mission.
               8.3.3.2.2. Urgent. These require action which, if not corrected, could cause one
               or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to equipment or property;
               reduce operational efficiency; or could jeopardize the safety or success of mission
               accomplishment.
               8.3.3.2.3. Routine. These require action that does not fall into the emergency or
               urgent categories. These are modifications to existing procedures that do not
               affect the overall process for completion, such as administrative changes.
            8.3.3.3. 14 AF develops requirements regarding the approval, coordination, and
            control of TPs.
               8.3.3.3.1. At a minimum, the coordination process must ensure technical
               accuracy and training requirements, as required.
               8.3.3.3.2. All affected duty positions must be knowledgeable of and have access
               to a copy of the TPR and associated TP prior to performing duty in the weapon
               system or receipt of weapon system training.
            8.3.3.4. Units review open TPs for possible integration into permanent procedures.
            14 AF develops requirements for reviewing TPs, to include schedule, responsible
            agency and revocation and extension authorities. 14 AF may delegate this
            responsibility to the wings.
        8.3.4. Supplemental Procedures. Supplemental procedures are used to amplify/augment
        existing permanent procedures without altering them. 14 AF develops procedures
        regarding the coordination and approval process for supplemental procedures.

11. Adopted Forms:
AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action
AFSPC Form 91, Individual’s Record of Duties and Qualification
12. (Added-20 AF) Alert Requirements.
   12.1. (Added-20 AF) Daily Alert Requirements. The crew accomplishes all activities
   knowing that mission accomplishment is 20 AF’s number one priority and ensuring
   personnel and weapon system safety directly supports that goal.
   12.2. (Added-20 AF) Alert Duty. Only crews composed of CMR certified personnel, one
   of which must be a MCCC, will perform alert at EWO configured Launch Control Centers
   (LCCs).
       12.2.1. (Added-20 AF) Squadron commanders and operations officers will sign for their
       alert and perform the entire alert tour as a member of a fully qualified CMR crew.
       12.2.2. (Added-20 AF) Personnel with unauthorized launch (UL) access will not
       perform alert duty. Personnel with unauthorized launch will only be BMC certified.
       When commanders with UL access perform alert, they will be in addition to the normally
       assigned crew. When rest periods begin, UL personnel will not remain in the LCC.
       12.2.3. (Added-20 AF) Only CMR certified MCCC-As will perform ground and
       airborne alert operations involving an EWO-configured, ALCS-equipped aircraft.
   12.3. (Added-20 AF) Pre-departure/pre-deployment. Units will conduct a pre-departure
   briefing for all MCCs before departure for each alert tour. As a minimum, the briefing will
   include No-Lone Zone and Two Person Concept requirements, safety and Personnel
   Reliability Program (PRP) considerations, abnormal configuration of code components,
   weather and road conditions, maintenance activities, code change information (as required),
   and unusual security requirements or situations.
26                                              AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


     12.4. (Added-20 AF) ACP and SCP. Only crews trained and certified specifically in ACP
     or SCP duties and procedures will perform alert tours at the ACP or SCP.
        12.4.1. (Added-20 AF) A crew posted to a shutdown SCP configured LCC is not
        performing alert duty at the SCP, and therefore does not have to be SCP certified.
     12.4.2. (Added-20 AF) ACP/SCP certified crews will be posted to the CLCC during
     periods where the ACP/SCP will be shut down for an extended period.
     12.5. (Added-20 AF) Assuming command. Under normal conditions, the MCC assumes
     command of the flight area and responsibility for operations when they sign for the Sealed
     Authenticator System (SAS). If SAS is not on site, the MCC assumes command upon
     notifying the command post (squadron, alternate, or wing) that changeover is complete.
     12.6. (Added-20 AF) Command of the flight area. While on alert, the MCC specified on
     the MADO is in command of the flight area and is ultimately responsible for all activities,
     operations, security, and personnel in the flight area.
        12.6.1. (Added-20 AF) The MCC must exercise direct command and control during any
        actual or potential situation involving the safety and security of personnel or equipment.
        12.6.2. (Added-20 AF) The maintenance team chief is responsible for the safe operation
        of a missile system in the launch facility (LF) once the LF is penetrated and safed for
        maintenance activities. The MCC resumes responsibility when the safety control switch
        is removed per maintenance withdrawal procedures.
     12.7. (Added-20 AF) Relief of command. The wing commander, OG/CC, applicable
     squadron commander or director of operations may direct relief of an alert duty MCC or
     MCCM. The 625 STOS/CC or ALCS Flight Chief may direct relief of an alert/duty shift
     MCCM-A.
        12.7.1. (Added-20 AF) An evaluator or instructor MCC may relieve a MCC or MCCM
        if such action is required to preclude loss of life, violation of WSSRs, or major damage to
        equipment. If in the course of an evaluation an evaluatee is rated unqualified or commits
        an error that would require restricted status, the evaluator must relieve the appropriate
        MCC or MCCM.
            12.7.1.1. (Added-20 AF) The relieving individual must be CMR in that position.
        12.7.2. (Added-20 AF) When relieved, the former MCC or MCCM must step aside and
        relinquish command immediately and without comment.
        12.7.3. (Added-20 AF) The relieving MCC or MCCM must inform the wing and
        alternate command post and the squadron commander or director of operations of the
        change of command.
        12.7.4. (Added-20 AF) If SAS is in use, it must be changed over to the new crew when
        conditions permit. Do not delay emergency actions to accomplish a changeover.
        12.7.5. (Added-20 AF) Higher headquarters inspectors or evaluators are not authorized
        to relieve a crew on duty in the LCC.
            12.7.5.1. (Added-20 AF) If a MCC or MCCM commits a restrictable field deviation
            or receives an unqualified rating on an inspection field evaluation or observation due
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                        27


         to committing critical or major errors, the inspection team chief will immediately
         inform the wing, operations group, and squadron commanders. The wing or group
         will replace the MCC or MCCM as soon as possible. 20 AF evaluators are qualified
         and required to supervise the MCC or MCCM until they have been replaced.
     12.7.6. (Added-20 AF) A MCC may temporarily relinquish command to facilitate a
     standardization evaluation. The evaluatee MCC, if qualified, or the evaluator MCC must
     be in command of the flight area during evaluations and will complete changeover per
     current weapon system operating instructions.
     12.7.7. (Added-20 AF) An evaluator or instructor MCCM-A may relieve a MCCM-A if
     such action is required to preclude loss of life, violation of WSSRs, or major damage to
     equipment. The relieving individual must be CMR in that position.
         12.7.7.1. (Added-20 AF) When relieved, the former MCCM-A must step aside and
         relinquish command immediately and without comment. The relieving individual
         must inform the mission commander and the squadron commander of the change of
         command.
  12.8. (Added-20 AF) MCC Work Requirements. Schedule crew work requirements to
  provide reasonable and adequate sleep for each crew member. The desired minimum sleep
  period for each MCCM is 8 hours during each 24-hour alert duty tour. Alert activities will
  dictate the actual sleep requirements for the crew.
     12.8.1. (Added-20 AF) When two MCCMs must be awake, alert, and physically
     capable of immediate detection of improper action (e.g., as required by WSSRs) for a
     period greater than 24 hours, the wing or group commanders will institute procedures to
     ensure crew members do not perform more than 12 consecutive hours of LCC duty.
     12.8.2. (Added-20 AF) MCCMs will not consume alcoholic beverages during the 8-
     hour period before reporting for alert duty. This standard also applies to MCCMs who
     are designated as standby MCCMs. MCCMs will not consume alcoholic beverages while
     performing alert or standby duties.
     12.8.3. (Added-20 AF) MCCM-As will not consume alcoholic beverages during the 8-
     hour period before reporting for alert or flying duty. This standard also applies to
     MCCM-As who are designated as standby crewmembers. MCCM-As will not consume
     alcoholic beverages while performing alert, flying, or standby duties.
  12.9. (Added-20 AF) Improved Missile Maintenance Program (IMMP). MCCs will
  coordinate with the appropriate maintenance control center to request a write-up for
  discrepancies in the LCC and, where applicable, the Launch Control Equipment Building
  (LCEB). Facility Managers (FMs) will document discrepancies for the remainder of the
  Missile Alert Facility (MAF).
     12.9.1. (Added-20 AF) New discrepancies will be printed on the IMMP report by the
     MCC/FM. The job control number assigned by the appropriate agency will be entered
     under the event narrative. The other entries may be omitted. Document corrected
     discrepancies on the IMMP.
     12.9.2. (Added-20 AF) When a new IMMP report is brought to the MAF, the MCC and
     FM will both cross-check it with the old report. This cross-check will ensure entries that
28                                              AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


        have been repaired are cleared and new entries are added to the most recent list.
        Document cross-check completion on the IMMP.
     12.10. (Added-20 AF) Danger Tags. MCCs will use the AF Form 979 (Danger Tag) in
     accordance with AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety
     Standard. These tags are attached to material and equipment no longer safe to use because of
     defects, abuse, or wear. They are not designed or intended for use as a reporting system;
     rather, they are warning devices.
        12.10.1. (Added-20 AF) MCCs/FMs are designated as tag issuing authorities for
        equipment within the MAF/LCC/LCEB. MCCs/FMs will attach tags to all unsafe
        equipment, tools, electric circuits, devices, valves, controls, elevator, ladders, and other
        unsafe items or conditions incident to work in progress, to prevent personal injury or
        damage to material or equipment.
        12.10.2. (Added-20 AF) MCCs will immediately coordinate the placement of danger
        tags with Missile Maintenance Operations Center (MMOC). Review and determine with
        the appropriate maintenance control what actions are required to eliminate the hazard.
        Routine maintenance actions required by T.O.s will not be coordinated with ground
        safety, fire department, or BE personnel. Discrepancies requiring a danger tag, except
        temporary conditions incident to maintenance in progress, will be documented in the
        IMMP report.
        12.10.3. (Added-20 AF) Danger tags in the MAF/LCC/LCEB shall only be removed by
        MCCs/FMs when the hazard is abated. If the placement of the tag was coordinated with
        ground safety, fire department, MMOC, or BE personnel, the MCC/FM will coordinate
        with these agencies prior to removal. When the danger tag is for permanent notice, the
        supervisor is responsible for the tag and for furnishing the protective devices (eye, noise,
        etc.) required by the danger tag.
     12.11. (Added-20 AF) LCC Clock Procedures. MCCs must ensure the Weapon System
     Control Element (WSCE), Higher Authority Communication/Rapid Message Processor
     Element (HAC/RMPE), and TOD clocks are synchronized with each other. When setting
     any clock, all clocks must be set using one of the time sources in paragraph 12.11.3. of this
     document.
        12.11.1. (Added-20 AF) Accomplish a time hack once every 12 hours at approximately
        0600Z and 1800Z or any time an error is noted.
        12.11.2. (Added-20 AF) Use the crew log or locally developed form to record time
        hacks and clock adjustments. Entries will include any discrepancy noted and corrective
        action taken.
        12.11.3. (Added-20 AF) Use these DSN numbers to reach the US Naval Observatory:
        762-1401 or 762-1069. If the Naval Observatory cannot be contacted or is inoperable,
        obtain a time hack from another LCC with an accurate clock.
     12.12. (Added-20 AF) Missile crew logs. MCCs must use the electronic log, unless the
     console is shutdown. When the console is shutdown, MCCs will use the AF IMT 524
     (Missile Crew Log), to record significant events occurring during the alert. The log will be
     maintained in sufficient detail so that significant alert activities can be reconstructed. No
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                          29


  alterations are authorized in the preprinted area. Units may subdivide the large lined sections
  and locally overprint the form.
     12.12.1. (Added-20 AF) Crew Log Requirements. Crews will archive crew logs every
     24 hours. Units will maintain a storage container for diskettes and must ensure a system
     is in place to determine what crew log information has been archived on each diskette
     (e.g., MCC names/crew number(s), times/days of the alert, LCC).
         12.12.1.1. (Added-20 AF) Crew log archives are kept in the LCC for 1 week. If the
         missile support base does not request return of the diskette, it may be reused after 7
         days.
         12.12.1.2. (Added-20 AF) If a disk is recalled, use a backup diskette for that day.
         Unit weapons and tactics flights (OSKs) will serve as the point of contact for diskette
         returns and will serve as the collection and distribution point for diskettes.
         12.12.1.3. (Added-20 AF) Any requirement for crew log data in hard copy will be
         requested and coordinated through the office that has the archive and print tool
         capability.
         12.12.1.4. (Added-20 AF) Crew log entries must meet requirements set forth by
         applicable command directives, to include technical orders. Should the console not
         automatically enter required log entry details, the crew must manually input the
         necessary details into the console (e.g., description of event, maintenance team
         involved, etc.).
     12.12.2. (Added-20 AF) Additional crew log entries. Crew log entries may be
     accomplished anytime at the discretion of the on duty MCC. Additional crew log entries
     are required as follows:
         12.12.2.1. (Added-20 AF) Any MCC contingency procedure, severe/hazardous
         weather, or threatening telephone call.
         12.12.2.2. (Added-20 AF) Log the verification of the shift all-call TVI as follows:
         Zulu date time group, number of exceptions and reason for exceptions, both MCCM
         names.
         12.12.2.3. (Added-20 AF) All security situations the MCC declares will be recorded
         on the crew log.
         12.12.2.4. (Added-20 AF) MCCMs must log each crew changeover specifying crew
         name, crew number, changeover time, and results of the Tamper Detection Indicator
         (TDI) inspection.
         12.12.2.5. (Added-20 AF) LCC SAS Container. Make an entry in the MCC log
         when the LCC SAS container is opened. Both crew members sign the log (during
         crew changeover) or initial the log entry (other than crew changeover) when the
         container is locked and verified secure. MCCMs need only make an entry in the
         electronic log.
  12.13. (Added-20 AF) Nuclear Weapons Transfer. DoD regulations require that custody of
  weapons or warheads be formally transferred to the individuals who control access to those
  weapons.
30                                             AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


        12.13.1. (Added-20 AF) At crew changeover, MCCs will accomplish a crew log entry
        to indicate the number of reentry systems/reentry vehicles (RS/RVs) the crew is
        accepting. Indicate any RS/RVs, by LF number, which are demated.
        12.13.2. (Added-20 AF) All matings/dematings in which an RS/RV is removed
        from/delivered to an LF will require a crew log entry IAW AFI21-204. At a minimum
        include the date, time, LF number, and demating supervisor’s name in the crew log entry.
        12.13.3. (Added-20 AF) If an RS/RV is mechanically mated but not electrically mated,
        the MCC will retain custody and make a crew log entry that the RS/RV cannot be
        electrically verified.
        12.13.4. (Added-20 AF) Transfer of weapon(s) custody is required anytime the MCC
        accomplishes time slot transfer or assumption of Automatic Flight Interrogations (AFI).
        Crew log entries must include time of nuclear weapon(s) custody transfer, LCCs
        accepting custody and releasing custody, and the LF(s) involved. The gaining crew is
        then responsible for all transferred sorties.
     12.14. (Added-20 AF) COMSEC/LCC communication systems CRYPTO materials.
     Inventory COMSEC/LCC communication systems CRYPTO materials in the LCC IAW
     instructions provided by the local COMSEC custodian and appropriate command directives.
     The oncoming MCC must inventory at the appropriate technical data step.
        12.14.1. (Added-20 AF) New COMSEC documents transported to the LCC by the
        oncoming crew must be added to the AFCOMSEC Form 16 (COMSEC Account Daily
        Shift Inventory), following crew changeover. Units must ensure a standardized
        procedure is in place to document on the AFCOMSEC Form16 when new COMSEC
        documents have been transported to the LCC, removed from the LCC, or destroyed. The
        procedures must clearly identify all actions affecting each COMSEC document.
        12.14.2. (Added-20 AF) Generate a new AFCOMSEC Form 16 prior to the last day of
        the month. The new AFCOMSEC Form 16 is effective at 0000Z on the first day of the
        new month and used for the next crew changeover. Return old forms to the appropriate
        base agency on the first duty day of each month or as requested.
        12.14.3. (Added-20 AF) Maintain reserve sets of COMSEC material separately from
        the active documents. Place reserve material into use when directed.
        12.14.4. (Added-20 AF) Follow the direction of the unit COMSEC custodian for the
        disposition of superseded documents. Annotate the AFCOMSEC Form 16 as described
        above.
     12.15. (Added-20 AF) System Printouts. Enter the generation and/or removal of SECRET
     and TOP SECRET system printouts in the crew log. Use applicable directives to determine
     classification. Examples include Remote Data Change (RDC) summary printouts or
     Emergency Action Messages (EAMs). The crew log will identify the individual removing
     the materials and the destination of the materials. This procedure applies to materials not
     entered on the AFCOMSEC Form 16.
     12.16. (Added-20 AF) Classified Waste and Destruction. Burning classified material in the
     LCC is only allowed when other destruction means are not available (e.g., inoperative
     shredder). Burning is limited to LCC communication systems cryptographic tapes and
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                            31


  Missile Electronic Encryption Device (MEED) key tapes, as well as other small amounts of
  classified that require timely destruction. Burn classified in the area outside of the acoustical
  enclosure. The burn container will be made of non-combustible material and must be
  provided with a means to prevent burning embers from escaping and approved by the base
  fire chief before use. Ensure the burn container is placed in a hardened configuration under
  higher states of readiness. Develop local procedures to ensure burning of classified material
  is accomplished in a safe manner in the LCC.
  12.17. (Added-20 AF) LCC Tool Kit. The tool kit for the LCC will be stored in a hardened
  location within the LCC and standardized within the group.
  12.18. (Added-20 AF) MPT/Minuteman Enhanced Procedures and Classroom Trainer
  (MEPCT) TK-70 Tapes. Units who possess REACT MPT/MEPCT TK-70 tapes will comply
  with DoD, AF and AFSPC instructions for control, safeguarding, documentation and
  destruction of classified materials.
     12.18.1. (Added-20 AF) Units may maintain up to six TK-70s. The following is an
     example of what may be contained on the six tapes:
         12.18.1.1. (Added-20 AF) Tape 1, current MPT/MEPCT software revision
         (received from MPT/MEPCT contract logistical support [CLS] contractor).
         12.18.1.2. (Added-20 AF) Tape 2, previous MPT/MEPCT software revision
         (received from MPT/MEPCT CLS contractor).
         12.18.1.3. (Added-20 AF) Tape 3, back-up of current training lesson plans and data
         sets.
         12.18.1.4. (Added-20 AF) Tape 4, back-up of current evaluation lesson plans and
         data sets.
         12.18.1.5. (Added-20 AF) Tape 5 and 6, used to transfer data between MPT and
         MEPCT.
     12.18.2. (Added-20 AF) Units may use the tapes as they wish, but should maintain, as a
     minimum, the current and previous MPT/MEPCT software revision.
     12.18.3. (Added-20 AF) Once a TK-70 tape is engraved with a serial number, these
     numbers should be placed on the applicable AF IMT 143 (Top Secret Register Page), and
     AF IMT 144 (Top Secret Access Record and Cover Sheet). These serial numbers are in
     addition to the Originator Control Numbers (OCNs)/Register Page Numbers (RPNs)
     required by DoD/AF instructions.
     12.18.4. (Added-20 AF) If units possess any excess tapes, they can degauss (declassify)
     them at the unit OSB. Once a tape is degaussed, it is no longer classified. No special
     controls are needed once the tape is degaussed. Units must document the destruction of
     the classified material IAW current DoD, AF and AFSPC instructions. Units may mail
     the unclassified tapes to Boeing Service Company via US Postal Service at the following
     address:
               Boeing Service Company
               P.O. Box 6008
               Vandenberg AFB, CA 93437
32                                            AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


     12.19. (Added-20 AF) MPTs/LCCs Information.
        12.19.1. (Added-20 AF) Voice Control Panel (VCP) automatic dialing memory storage
        locations. Use of VCP memory locations will be determined by the unit but must be
        standardized locally. A list of telephone numbers/agencies stored in each memory
        location must be readily available in the LCC.
        12.19.2. (Added-20 AF) Console Access. The REACT console is the duty station of
        the MCC. It is classified Top Secret NC2-ESI CAT C, and anyone accessing it must be
        cleared for Nuclear Command and Control (NC2)-Extremely Sensitive Information (ESI)
        and Emergency Action Procedures (EAP) since it is used to control nuclear weapons. At
        no time will the on-duty crew relinquish control of the console. When maintenance
        teams require entries be made on the console keyboard, they will request the on-duty
        MCC make them. Access to the MPT console will also be limited only to authorized
        personnel. This does not preclude maintenance teams from viewing the screens as
        required to accomplish their procedures. Adequate control will be maintained to ensure
        classified information is not improperly exposed.
        12.19.3. (Added-20 AF) Cycling Status Suppression. When crews are notified by
        MMOC that a fault is cycling status, they may suppress the fault with permission from
        MMOC. Ground Maintenance Response (GMR) 25 cycling during calibration may be
        suppressed without MMOC approval; however, this suppression must be removed
        immediately after the sortie exits calibration.
        12.19.4. (Added-20 AF) Video Taping and Photography in the MPT. Video taping,
        filming and still photography by authorized personnel is allowed as long as the WSCE
        and the HAC/RMPE Visual Display Units (VDUs) do not contain classified information,
        no classified procedures are being accomplished, no classified information is being
        discussed, and adequate measures are taken to ensure no classified information is
        exposed. Any audiovisual material made following this guidance will be unclassified.
        12.19.5. (Added-20 AF) Diskette Procedures. Units will procure diskettes (3.5‖, High
        Density, Double-Sided, 1.44 MB) for each LCC, diskette storage containers for the LCC
        (e.g., a plastic container or binder with diskette holders will suffice), and a diskette
        transport device for MCCs to courier diskettes to and from the LCC.
           12.19.5.1. (Added-20 AF) Diskettes must be formatted prior to dispatching to the
           field using MS-DOS format.
           12.19.5.2. (Added-20 AF) Units are required to have the following diskettes in the
           LCC at all times: HAC/RMPE Journal Memory Loader (JML) disks (1 primary set
           and 1 backup set), 14 crew log archive diskettes (7 primary, 7 backup diskettes), 1
           On-Line Data Collection (ODC) diskette, and 2 Floppy Disk Drive (FDD) test
           diskettes. Units may choose to maintain more disks.
               12.19.5.2.1. (Added-20 AF) Disks Returned to the Support Base. Returned
               disks must be replaced in the LCC as soon as possible after removal. A
               replacement disk does not have to be sent out to the LCC unless the returned disk
               will be absent from the LCC for an extended period of time or the disk has been
               transferred to another account.
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                      33


        12.19.5.3. (Added-20 AF) Each Crew Log Archive diskette will be labeled for a
        corresponding day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.). One diskette will serve as a backup
        for each day.
        12.19.5.4. (Added-20 AF) Classified Labeling. Units may add tracking numbers to
        HHQ-provided classified diskettes; however, do not obscure labeling provided with
        disk. Additionally, units may design and use replacement classified diskette labels.
        12.19.5.5. (Added-20 AF) Classify all diskettes used in the system IAW the highest
        level of information processed on the system. Refer to AFI 31-401, Information
        Security Program Management, for classification guidance, or contact your unit
        security manager. Once a diskette is installed into an on-line REACT console, it will
        be classified a minimum of Top Secret/NC2-ESI CAT C. The diskette must be
        labeled as required by command directives. The only exception to this classification
        requirement is the unit code change disk that will remain unclassified as long as the
        disk is write- protected when mounted in the FDD.
        12.19.5.6. (Added-20 AF) To minimize the work load and the number of labels
        affixed to each diskette, each unit should develop a computer generated label (or
        procure a rubber stamp) to include the following information: ―Derived From:
        Multiple Sources and Formerly Restricted Data: Unauthorized disclosure subject to
        administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as RESTRICTED DATA in foreign
        dissemination; Section 144b, Atomic Energy Act of 1954.‖ This information should
        fit on a standard (1‖ by 3 1/2‖) mailing address label.
     12.19.6. (Added-20 AF) Software Data Gathering Procedures. Whenever unexpected
     responses occur from the HAC/RMPE or WSCE, accomplish the following:
        12.19.6.1. (Added-20 AF) Print the screen (HAC/RMPE or WSCE). Annotate the
        print with crew number, names, unit and LCC, Zulu time of receipt, and Selective
        Message Routing (SMR) code (e.g., ―Crew 400, Capt Kevin Miller, 1Lt Dan Bunch,
        90 MW, A01, 1158z, UUUF1‖).
        12.19.6.2. (Added-20 AF) Write down any information listed in the HAC/RMPE
        work area prompt or any of the WSCE interwindows.
        12.19.6.3. (Added-20 AF) Write down the sequence of crew actions taken
        immediately before/during the unexpected response.
        12.19.6.4. (Added-20 AF) If the HA Backup Printer was on, return the print.
        12.19.6.5. (Added-20 AF) Print the crew log from 1 hour preceding the event to the
        current clock time.
        12.19.6.6. (Added-20 AF) Accomplish a Crew Log Archive (SINCE PREV ARCH
        TO FDD) on a backup crew log archive disk. Do not reuse the disk for a period of 10
        days unless notified by OSK or OGV. If requested, crews will return the disk to
        OSK.
        12.19.6.7. (Added-20 AF) Immediately contact OSK for HAC/RMPE discrepancies
        or OGV for WSCE discrepancies. OSK will in-turn contact 20 AF/A3NK at DSN
        481-5263/4 for HAC/RMPE events. OGV will in-turn contact 20 AF/A3NV at 481-
        5241 for WSCE events. Summarize the information gathered and send a Strategic
34                                            AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


            Air Command Digital Information Network (SACDIN) message to FEW00 (90
            MW/20 AF WCP). Include as much information as possible concerning the
            discrepancy. OSK/OGV will FAX all printouts (screen, crew log, or HA Backup, as
            applicable) no later than the next duty day to 20 AF/A3NK at DSN 481-5229 or 20
            AF/A3NV at DSN 481-5354, as applicable.
               12.19.6.7.1. (Added-20 AF) After duty hours, crews will immediately send a
               SACCS message to TAF00. Contact with the unit OSK/OGV will be
               accomplished ASAP thereafter.
     12.20. (Added-20 AF) Secure telephone usage. If a secure telephone is not fully
     operational, it must be removed from the LCC. All REACT-configured LCCs must keep the
     secure telephone, if available, plugged into a power source to maintain the charge of the
     battery.
13. (Added-20 AF) REACT Concept for Software Support (CSS).
13.1. (Added-20 AF) Overview. The CSS for HAC/RMPE software is an agreement between
HQ AFSPC/A3T/A5, 392 TRS/CC, and SBICBM SPO. The CSS details the change process for
the HAC/RMPE software.
13.2. (Added-20 AF) Proposed changes. Anyone may propose changes to the REACT system
or report software anomalies using an AF IMT 1067 (Modification Proposal). The process used
to make a change is dependent on the urgency of the change. There are three types of changes:
Emergency, Urgent, and Routine.
        13.2.1. (Added-20 AF) Emergency changes. Emergency changes are changes that must
        be made immediately in order for the REACT system to function. Examples of
        emergency changes are software anomalies that prevent proper EWO commit or anything
        that causes the REACT console to be non-functional.
            13.2.1.1. (Added-20 AF) Notify the 20 AF/A3 of emergency changes within 6
            hours. Initial notification may be made by phone, with the AF IMT 1067 FAX or e-
            mail to follow. After duty hours and on weekends and holidays, contact the 20
            AF/A3 through the 90 MW Command Post at DSN 481-3921.
            13.2.1.2. (Added-20 AF) The 20 AF/A3 will immediately notify HQ AFSPC/A3N
            that an emergency change is in work. Within 6 hours, the 20 AF/A3 will notify the
            SBICBM SPO, HAC/RMPE Software Support Facility (Ogden, HSSF), and HQ
            AFSPC/A3 of the required change and then FAX or e-mail them the approved AF
            IMT 1067.
            13.2.1.3. (Added-20 AF) Workarounds may be necessary while some emergency
            changes are in work. 20 AF/A3 will determine workarounds when necessary and
            forward instructions to units.
        13.2.2. (Added-20 AF) Urgent and routine changes. Urgent changes are changes that
        do not fit the emergency criteria, but are serious enough to warrant change without undo
        delay. Routine changes are changes that will improve system performance, but are not
        necessary to mission accomplishment.
            13.2.2.1. (Added-20 AF) All urgent and routine changes are forwarded to 20
            AF/A3NV for incorporation by the unit approval authority. The 20 AF/A3 will
AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004                                                   35


        approve all AF Forms 1067 and forward valid changes to HQ AFSPC/A3N, who will
        forward approved changes to the SBICBM SPO at Ogden.
  13.3. (Added-20 AF) Responsibilities.
     13.3.1. (Added-20 AF) 20 AF/A3 will:
        13.3.1.1. (Added-20 AF) Ensure the HQ AFSPC/A3, SBICBM SPO, and the HSSF
        are notified immediately of all emergency changes to HAC/RMPE software IAW the
        CSS.
        13.3.1.2. (Added-20 AF) Approve all workarounds for MCC use.
        13.3.1.3. (Added-20 AF) Determine if MPT training is required prior to alert duty
        based on the nature of the changes made.
        13.3.1.4. (Added-20 AF) Act as the requirements screening panel (RSP) if the panel
        cannot be convened for an emergency change.
        13.3.1.5. (Added-20 AF) Approve/disapprove all AF IMT 1067.
     13.3.2. (Added-20 AF) 20 AF/A3NK will:

        AFSPC/A3N to ensure HSSF personnel are kept informed of new requirements as
        they develop.
        13.3.2.2. (Added-20 AF) Provide input and assistance as required for workaround
        procedures for emergency changes.
        13.3.2.3. (Added-20 AF) Prepare and submit AF IMT 1067 for all changes to
        OPLAN 8010, EAP, and targeting procedures.
     13.3.3. (Added-20 AF) 20 AF/A3NV will:
        13.3.3.1. (Added-20 AF) Review all AF IMT 1067 and submit to 20 AF/A3 for
        approval/disapproval. 20 AF/A3NV will convene the RSP to review all changes
        submitted. The board will meet at least quarterly, but may meet whenever necessary
        to review change proposals.
        13.3.3.2. (Added-20 AF) Forward approved changes to the Operations Control
        Board (OCB) through HQ AFSPC/A3N.
        13.3.3.3. (Added-20 AF) Return disapproved AF IMT 1067 to the originator with
        the rationale for disapproval. Send information copies to the SBICBM SPO and the
        OCB.

        13.3.3.5. (Added-20 AF) Provide work-arounds and training recommendations to
        the 20 AF/A3.
     13.3.4. (Added-20 AF) Units will:
        13.3.4.1. (Added-20 AF) Ensure all weapon system users are trained in the AF IMT
        1067 process.
36                                            AFSPCI10-1202_20AFSUP 1 OCTOBER 2004


           13.3.4.2. (Added-20 AF) Establish a point of contact for all REACT change
           matters. Forward appointment memorandum to 20 AF/A3NV.
           13.3.4.3. (Added-20 AF) Establish a unit-level approval authority that will forward
           unit-approved AF IMT 1067 along with supporting documentation to 20 AF/A3NV.
           13.3.4.4. (Added-20 AF) Notify the 20 AF/A3, both verbally and in writing, of all
           emergency changes within 6 hours of discovery. Initial notification should be made
           over the phone. Forward the AF IMT 1067 to 20 AF/A3NV as soon as possible after
           notifying the 20 AF/A3.
           13.3.4.5. (Added-20 AF) Submit AF IMT 1067 for all proposed REACT changes.
           13.3.4.6. (Added-20 AF) Ensure unit personnel are available to meet SBICBM SPO
