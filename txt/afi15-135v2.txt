                  SPECIAL OPERATIONS WEATHER EVALUATIONS

2.1. Special Operations Weather Evaluations. The SOWSEP program ensures SOWT
maintain the skills and capabilities to safely and effectively accomplish their assigned mission.
Core evaluations should focus on the unit’s METL using established tasks, conditions and
standards. Other evaluations (initial, task, and spot) should be related to tasks required for
upgrade, unit mission qualifications, or task proficiency.
   2.1.1. In order for the evaluations to be effective and objective, the system relies on
   evaluations by someone other than the immediate supervisor/trainer. This provides checks
   and balances to the evaluation system. It also ensures standardization of processes across the
   unit.
   2.1.2. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid recording
   unsatisfactory performance. A scheduled training mission will not be changed to an
   evaluation to record satisfactory performance. If during an evaluation, an evaluator observes
   a procedure that jeopardizes safety, he will immediately relieve the individual responsible
   and either appoint another qualified individual or personally assume control of the operation.
2.2. Initial Evaluation.
   2.2.1. An initial evaluation is required for all newly assigned SOWT personnel upon
   graduation from the SOWT pipeline. The initial evaluation will be conducted immediately
   following the member’s completion of the unit Initial Familiarization (IFAM)/Initial
   Qualification training (IQT) requirements (normally within 90 days of assignment). Unit
   IFAM/IQT programs are required to be in place to validate competency levels and ensure all
   unit personnel are familiar with unit standard operating procedures (SOP) prior to the initial
   evaluation. The initial evaluation identifies required training areas. This evaluation may also
   be used to qualify an individual in the command or unit mission. The initial evaluation will
   consist of the following:
       2.2.1.1. Open Book Examination IAW paragraph 2.3.2 of this instruction.
       2.2.1.2. Physical Fitness Evaluation IAW paragraph 2.3.3 of this instruction.
       2.2.1.3. Weather Skills Evaluation IAW paragraph 2.3.4 of this instruction
       2.2.1.4. Team Employment Evaluation IAW paragraph 2.3.5 of this instruction.
       2.2.1.5. Initial evaluations will be documented on an AF IMT 803 within a member’s Air
       Force Training Records (AFTR).
2.3. Core Evaluations.
   2.3.1. Core Evaluations are periodic evaluations administered as a quality control measure.
   They are designed to evaluate a member’s proficiency in core and mission essential tasks.
   Core evaluations consist of a open book exam, physical fitness evaluation, weather skills
   evaluation and team employment evaluation.
       2.3.1.1. All SOWT personnel will be evaluated at a minimum once every 18 months.
8                                                                 AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010


       2.3.1.2. All core evaluations will be documented on an AF IMT 803 within a member’s
       AFTR.
    2.3.2. Open Book Exam.
       2.3.2.1. The open book exam is designed to cover all aspects of SOWT duties. It must be
       oriented towards those areas related to the safe conduct of operations and ensure the
       individual retains a broad knowledge of SOWT operations. Prior to the open book
       examination, the Stan/Eval SOWT or designee will ensure the examinee had access to
       current study references and checklist. The following are the administration and
       documentation procedures for the open book examination:
       2.3.2.2. The exam will only cover advanced qualifications possessed by the individual.
       Unit Stan/Eval will develop exam questions dealing with local procedures.
       2.3.2.3. The open book exam will consist of 25 questions covering the following
       knowledge areas:
           2.3.2.3.1. General Knowledge. A minimum of 10 general knowledge questions must
           come from the MAJCOM Master Question File (MQF). The Stan/Eval SOWT
           assigned to MAJCOM/A3V is the OPR for development and maintenance of the
           MQF.
           2.3.2.3.2. Local Procedures. A minimum of five questions must come from unit local
           procedures MQF. If no unit local procedures MQF is developed, unit Stan/Eval must
           provide 15 additional general knowledge questions or all 25 questions will come from
           the MAJCOM MQF.
           2.3.2.3.3. The minimum passing score for the written exam is 70 percent. Incorrect
           answers will be reviewed after grading.
       2.3.2.4. Individuals who fail the open book test are considered Non-Mission Ready
       (NMR). Failures will be re-evaluated using an alternate test within 7 duty days (within
       two Unit Training Assemblies [UTAs] for ANG). Those who fail the re-evaluation will
       be recommended for review board action as outlined in Chapter 3 of this volume.
       2.3.2.5. The open book examinations are controlled items. Stan/Eval sections at all levels
       are responsible for the integrity of the examination.
       2.3.2.6. Document the open book exam on an AF IMT 803 within a member’s AFTR.
    2.3.3. Physical Fitness Evaluation.
       2.3.3.1. SOWT members will be administered a physical fitness evaluation consisting of
       the exercises shown below in Table 2.1. The order for conducting the evaluation is as
       follows: pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, three mile run, and 1,500 meter swim. Calisthenics
       events will be tested one right after the other with a two minute rest period between
       events. Upon completion of all the calisthenic events, a 10 minute rest period is given
       prior to starting the three mile run. Upon completion of the three mile run, a 30 minute
       rest period is given prior to starting the 1,500 meter swim.
       2.3.3.2. To pass the physical fitness examination successfully, an individual must meet
       the requirements for all events. Failure to meet physical fitness standards for any one
       event constitutes failure of entire test.
AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010                                                                      9


     2.3.3.3. Physical Fitness Examination Procedures.
        2.3.3.3.1. Pull-ups (two minute time limit). This exercise is executed on a pull-up
        bar. The individual grasps the bar with the hands about shoulder width apart with
        palms facing away from the face. This is a two-count exercise. The exercise begins in
        the "dead hang" position. Count one: pull the body directly upward until the chin is
        over the bar. Count two: lower the body until the body is again in the "dead hang"
        position. Individuals will not swing excessively or bicycle feet as the chin is pulled
        over the bar. Repeat as many times as possible. This is designed to measure strength
        and endurance in the back and bicep muscles used when performing specific mission
        tasks.
        2.3.3.3.2. Sit-ups (four minute time limit). Starting position: back flat on the ground,
        hands on the head, head off the ground and knees bent at approximately a 90 degree
        angle. Another individual during the exercise holds the feet (optional). This is a two-
        count exercise. Count one: sit up until the back is vertical to the ground. Count two:
        return to the starting position. There is no authorized rest position. If an individual
        raises buttocks from ground or removes hands from the head during a repetition, the
        repetition is not counted. Designed to measure strength and endurance in abdominal
        and hip flexor muscle groups used when performing specific mission tasks.
        2.3.3.3.3. Push-ups (two minute time limit). This exercise starts from the front
        leaning rest position. The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with
        knees together. This is a two-count exercise. Count one; flex the elbows, lowering the
        body until the elbows form a 90-degree angle. Count two; raise the body until the
        elbows are straight and locked. Repeat this exercise as many times as possible. Event
        is stopped when individual lifts an arm or a knee touches the ground. The only
        authorized rest position is the starting position. This exercise is designed to measure
        the strength and endurance of the chest and triceps muscles used during specific
        mission tasks. Strength and endurance in these muscle groups are required to perform
        swimming, lifting, climbing, load-bearing and hand-to-hand combat tasks.
        2.3.3.3.4. Three Mile Run. Performed with running shoes and running shorts.
        Designed to measure aerobic endurance used when performing mission tasks,
        specifically employment or evasion situations.
        2.3.3.3.5. 1,500 Meter Swim. The swim will be performed with swim trunks, dive
        mask or goggles (snorkel optional), and fins using any stroke. If swim is performed in
        open water, a life preserver or flotation device must be worn and 10 minutes will be
        added to maximum times in Table 2.1. Designed to measure aerobic endurance in a
        maritime environment.
        2.3.3.3.6. Grading. Calisthenics repetitions, run times, and swim times will be
        rounded off to the lower point value. A composite score will determine the overall
        score.
        2.3.3.3.7. Documentation. Physical Fitness Evaluations will be documented on an AF
        IMT 803 and maintained in a member’s AF 623 – Individual Training Record within
        AFTR. The test will also be tracked in the Automated Records Management System
        (ARMS) IAW AFI 15-135 Volume 1.

            2.3.3.3.8. Substandard Performance. Individuals who fail will be entered into a
            supervised remedial physical fitness (PT) program and re-evaluated within 60
            calendar days. Individuals must complete an entire PT evaluation when retested.
            Eligibility for operational taskings will be determined by the commander. Individuals
            who fail a second time will not perform operational taskings and will be
            recommended for review board action.

     2.3.4. Weather Skills Evaluations. Weather skills evaluations are designed to test
     proficiency, knowledge, and ability to conduct weather operations during peacetime,
     contingency, and wartime. These evaluations should be conducted under conditions that
     approximate, to the maximum extent possible, actual mission conditions. However, each
     evaluation must focus on the technical aspects of the operation and will not include overly
     complex employment scenarios that impede an operator’s ability to execute specific weather
     skills during the evaluation scenario. Complex mission scenarios involving operations other
     than key weather skills should be administered during periodic exercises vice during graded
     Stan/Evals. A sample weather skills evaluation checklist can be found in Attachment 2.
     These weather skills evaluation items should closely coincide with those found in the
     SOWSEP Compliance Performance Checklist (CPC) as described in Chapter 4.
AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010                                                                        11


       2.3.4.1. Weather skills evaluations will be documented on an AF IMT 803 in the
       individual’s AF IMT 623 within AFTR, and individual training items will be tracked in
       the Automated Records Management System (ARMS) IAW AFI 15-135 Volume 1.
   2.3.5. SOWT Employment Evaluations. The SOWT employment evaluation will be
   administered to three or more personnel. Employment evaluation scenarios will be structured
   to evaluate as many of the unit’s mission tasks as possible to include operations in air, land,
   and maritime environments. Tactical profiles should include rehearsals of tactics and
   procedures associated with the planning, preparation, insertion, execution, and extraction
   phases of an environmental reconnaissance operation. If practical, evaluations will be
   conducted in geographic areas not normally used during training.
       2.3.5.1. Minimum requirements for an employment evaluation are: mission briefing,
       equipment preparation, mission rehearsal, insertion, operational event, extraction, and
       debriefing. Employment evaluations may be conducted during scheduled exercises with
       the prior concurrence of exercise planners. Each SOWT should be evaluated to their
       highest qualification level.
          2.3.5.1.1. Inability to complete an insertion or extraction because of weather, flight
          cancellation, or other uncontrollable circumstances, will not negate an employment
          evaluation. The employment evaluation may be evaluated as long as the briefing is
          completed, a rehearsal is conducted, the insertion is attempted, the operational event
          is completed, the extraction is attempted, and a debriefing is conducted.
NOTE: This option will not be used during two consecutive evaluations of the same personnel.
          2.3.5.1.2. The evaluator should not be incorporated into the evaluation scenario. In
          the event of a safety violation, the evaluator will assume control of the operation to
          prevent a safety incident. Once safety is restored the evaluator will relinquish control
          and continue to observe the operation.
       2.3.5.2. Grading. Employment evaluations are graded Pass (combat mission ready) or
       Fail (non-mission ready). Employment evaluations will be documented on an AF IMT
       803 in the individual’s AF IMT 623 within AFTR, and individual training items will be
       tracked in the Automated Records Management System (ARMS) IAW AFI 15-135
       Volume 1.
       2.3.5.3. Substandard Performance. The evaluator will critique errors, incorrect
       procedures, and minor safety violations during the debriefing. A major safety violation is
       grounds for failure and will be corrected on the spot. Annotate areas requiring
       improvement and corrective action on a paper and electronic copy of the AF IMT 803 or
       623a within AFTR. Individuals who fail the employment evaluation will be placed in a
       non-mission ready (NMR) status and will only participate in training missions under the
       direct supervision of a trainer or evaluator until they have successfully completed a re-
       evaluation. A re-evaluation must be completed within 90 days of the failure. Those who
       fail the re-evaluation will be recommended for review board action. Failure of an
       individual task does not constitute failure for the entire evaluation. If an individual core
       task is failed the individual will be decertified in that task and considered non-mission
       ready until re-evaluation.

2.4. Task Evaluations. Task evaluations are used to evaluate individuals for upgrade, unit
mission qualifications, or task proficiency. The unit commander establishes the list of tasks to be
evaluated in order to meet unit METLs and to qualify individuals for positional upgrades. This
ensures only the best qualified SOWT are placed in positions of increased responsibility.
   2.4.1. SOWT personnel nominated for Element Leader (EL) positions will be required to
   pass a task evaluation based on the list of tasks established by the unit commander. ELs are
   5-level qualified SOWT and therefore are expected to be proficient in all 5-level core tasks in
   the 1W0X2 CFETP. In addition ELs will be signed off on all 7-level tasks under mission
   preparation of the 1W0X2 CFETP.
   2.4.2. SOWT personnel nominated for Team NCOIC and SOWT-Os nominated for Team
   Leader (TL) positions must pass a task evaluation in conjunction with a full-mission profile
   exercise. This provides unit leadership with an opportunity to observe NCOICs and TLs plan
   and execute all phases of special weather operations. NCOICs are 7-level qualified SOWT
   and therefore are expected to be proficient in all 7-level core tasks in the 1W0X2 CFETP.
2.5. Spot Evaluations. Spot evaluations are used as a method to provide the commander with
feedback on individual skills or specific team mission capabilities through random evaluations of
mission training and exercises and may be conducted at any time.
   2.5.1. Personnel receiving spot evaluations must be notified prior to the start of the event.
   Areas found to be substandard will result in de-certification in the task or tasks evaluated.
   The substandard performance will be documented in accordance with this instruction and
   AFI 36-2201 Vol 3, Air Force Training Program on the Job Training Administration as
   appropriate. Specific retraining recommendations should be completed prior to re-evaluation
   and documented by the evaluator. When re-training and re-evaluation are conducted on the
   spot, the specific training completed prior to re-evaluation will be documented by the
   evaluator. Re-training in substandard task(s) should be completed prior to scheduling the re-
   evaluation.
   2.5.2. Units will ensure that a minimum of 20% of assigned personnel receive spot
   evaluations evenly distributed throughout the calendar year.
2.6. Task and Spot Evaluation Documentation Procedures.
   2.6.1. Task and spot evaluations will be documented using brief and concise statements on
   an AF IMT 803 and maintained in the individual’s AF IMT 623 within AFTR. When
   additional comments are required, they are referenced to the original AF IMT 803 on an AF
   IMT 623a, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, within AFTR.
       2.6.1.1. Annotate the appropriate type of evaluation (task or spot), reference if
       applicable, and task(s) evaluated.
       2.6.1.2. Fill in a concise and factual history of tasks accomplished and the conditions in
       which they were accomplished. Annotate results of the evaluation (Pass/Fail).
2.7. Evaluation Briefings and Debriefings. The evaluator will brief and debrief examinees on
all aspects of the evaluation. They will ensure examinees understand what is to be evaluated and
the parameters of the evaluation. During debriefs, the evaluator will ensure the examinee
understands all comments or remarks. The examinee’s supervisor should be present during
debrief. If not present, the supervisor will review the results of the evaluation via AFTR or
AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010                                                                   13


feedback provided by the evaluator. Each person present at the debrief should be given an
opportunity to contribute their comments, observations, and recommendations. Conducting a
proper debrief allows maximum benefit from the information collected and may be used to
identify excellence or deficiencies in a training segment or methodology. Debriefings may also
be documented on an AF IMT 623a within AFTR if the evaluator deems necessary.

                                    REVIEW BOARDS

3.1. Review Board Process.
   3.1.1. Review boards are designed to look at the overall evaluation or training process to
   deliver an impartial judgment. Review boards look at the trainee and the training process to
   see if the failure is individual, institutional, or procedural.
   3.1.2. Convene a review board when:
      3.1.2.1. Directed by the commander.
      3.1.2.2. A SOWT fails a re-evaluation.
      3.1.2.3. After any incident that compromised safety or resulted in injury to personnel or
      damage to equipment through negligence or violation of directives.
   3.1.3. Composition of Review Boards. Unit Stan/Eval conducts the review board. The
   review board also consists of the operations officer and operations superintendent (senior
   SOWT-O if not the operations superintendent). If a primary board member cannot be present,
   the commander will designate an alternate. The alternate will typically be the next senior
   ranking member of the AFSC involved. The reviewer’s direct supervisor may observe the
   board proceeding; however, he will not be a voting member. The commander may observe
   the proceedings as a non-voting member since the board recommends action to the
   commander.
   3.1.4. Review Board Actions. The board will evaluate and analyze all factors bearing on a
   situation and provide the commander with recommendations. Recommendations may include
   removal of an advanced skill qualification, additional supervised training, or
   recommendation for removal from the AFSC. Board findings of personnel retained in the
   AFSC will be maintained on file for 18 months within the member’s PIF. When removal
   from AFSC is recommended, upon commander approval, the Chief/Senior Enlisted Manager
   with the assistance of the unit training manager will coordinate required actions with the
   local military personnel flight (MPF) and base training office.
   3.1.5. Actions resulting in the recommendation for removal of an AFSC will be forwarded to
   the MAJCOM level or next higher headquarters as appropriate for review.

4.4. SOWSEP Compliance Performance Checklist. Current SOWSEP CPC is available on
the AFWA Standardization and Evaluation website and the HQ AFSOC/A3W SharePoint
website.
   4.4.1. SOWSEP CPC is not directive; it restates or paraphrases existing Air Force
   requirements, policy or procedures. The SOWSEP CPC includes guidance for conducting
   evaluations in the section labeled ―Standard Approach for Evaluators (SAFE);‖ evaluators
   will adhere to the SAFE to ensure standardization in the evaluation process.
   4.4.2. The SOWSEP CPC will be maintained and updated by AFSOC/A3W, and have
   publication and effective dates established by AF/A3O-WP.
   4.4.3. All CPC items will be evaluated; those that do not apply, as determined by the
   MAJCOM WFM) will be marked as ―Not Applicable‖ (N/A).
   4.4.4. CPC items are either GO or NO-GOin accordance with AFI 90-201, Inspector
   General Activities. CPC items identified as NO-GO will be documented as discrepancies.
AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010                                                                     17


   4.4.5. Items identified during the evaluation not directly addressed by the CPC, but having a
   positive or negative impact on safety or operations, will be documented as observations and
   will be included in the final evaluation report. These findings will not be counted into the
   SOWSEP scoring or overall rating.
   4.4.6. A combination of related CPC failures that collectively have a negative impact on
   safety or operations can be documented as an observation. If created, these observations will
   be included in the final evaluation report but will not be counted into the SOWSEP scoring or
   overall rating. Note: The independent CPC failures will still be counted as a discrepancy.
4.5. Weather Interest Items. WIIs contain criteria and procedures for their evaluation, and
WII results will be documented in a separate section of the report. AF/A3O-W may direct
evaluation of WIIs as a means to focus management attention, gather data, and/or evaluate the
status of conditions in the weather career field or of specific weather programs, policies, or
procedures. WIIs are not within the purview of the Air Force Special Interest Item Program as
described in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. MAJCOM-unique WIIs will not conflict
with or duplicate AF-level WIIs.
4.6. Scheduling SOWSEP Evaluations.
   4.6.1. SOWSEP evaluations will be conducted once every 24-36 months for Active
   Component organizations, Air Force Reserve organizations, and applicable contracted
   weather organizations. Air National Guard organizations will be evaluated once every 48-60
   months.
   4.6.2. MAJCOMs are encouraged, but not required, to conduct SOWSEP evaluations
   concurrently with other evaluations and inspections that address similar functional areas.
4.7. Conducting SOWSEP Evaluations.
   4.7.1. The SOWSEP evaluation consists of two related evaluations: compliance and
   performance. These components are evaluated and scored in sub-areas IAW the SOWSEP
   CPC. In addition, an overall score (OUTSTANDING, EXCELLENT, SATISFACTORY, or
   UNSATISFACTORY) will be computed based on the procedures in Chapter 3.
   4.7.2. Compliance Evaluation. Measures compliance with Air Force directives with a score
   derived from direct evaluation of procedures and process documentation.
   4.7.3. Performance Evaluation. Measures the effectiveness of weather organization
   procedures and training/competency of personnel or groups engaged in weather operations
   evaluated by direct observation of duty performance (checkrides).
4.8. Evaluation procedures.
   4.8.1. Evaluators will:
       4.8.1.1. When required, request advance copies of documents (e.g., SOPs, OIs, weather
       support plans, etc.) from inspected organization no later than 30 days before evaluation.
       4.8.1.2. Use the SOWSEP CPC and follow the SAFE for compliance and performance
       evaluations.
 18                                                               AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010


       4.8.1.3. Directly observe performance through administration of checkrides on a
       representative sample of task-certified military personnel. All CPC items used for
       checkrides will indicate the required performance standards.
       4.8.1.4. Identify and document as a discrepancy any CPC line-item process or procedure
       not in compliance with AF standards. Discrepancies will be resolved IAW procedures
       outlined in paragraph 4.13.
       4.8.1.5. Identify and document as an observation any non-CPC process or procedure
       found to have a significant positive or negative operational impact (e.g., improves
       existing procedures, poses a hazard to safety). Negative observations will be resolved
       IAW procedures outlined in paragraph 4.13. Positive observations will be reviewed for
       crossfeed by MAJCOMs and AFWA.
4.9. Briefings. At a minimum, in-briefs, progress briefs, and out-briefs will be presented as
follows:
   4.9.1. In-brief.
       4.9.1.1. The SOWSEP team chief will introduce team members, provide an overview of
       SOWSEP evaluation, scoring, and reporting, and define observations, discrepancies, and

       4.9.3.5. Discuss resolution procedures for discrepancies and negative observations.
4.10. Follow-up Evaluations. Follow-up evaluations will be conducted NLT 180 days after
initial evaluation for any organization receiving an overall rating of UNSATISFACTORY.
   4.10.1. Follow-up evaluation waiver requests for weather squadrons must be approved by
   AF/A3O-WP.
AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010                                                                           19


   4.10.2. All other requests will be approved at the MAJCOM/A3 WFM level or equivalent
   and copies of requests will be provided to AF/A3O-WP and AFWA/A3V.
4.11. SOWSEP Scoring and Rating.
   4.11.1. Scoring provides commanders with an assessment of compliance with Air Force
   standards and an evaluation of the organization's ability to perform assigned missions. The
   final report will identify an organization's overall score, compliance score, performance
   score, and a score for each applicable sub-area. These scores will be used to determine the
   overall SOWSEP rating IAW Figure 4.2
   4.11.2. Scoring. Each CPC item is assigned a point value. Evaluators will follow CPC
   instructions for awarding points. Although some elements of the evaluation are subjective,
   evaluators will use the CPC and objective procedures as outlined in the SAFE list without
   exception. All scores are indicated by percentages. Figure 4.1 depicts a SOWSEP scoring
   example.
Figure 4.1. Example SOWSEP Scoring A rating of <70% in any two sub-areas (A-C) or
<70% in D or E results in overall rating of “UNSATISFACTORY”.




       4.11.2.1. Sub-area scores are based on CPC compliance and performance items for the
       applicable sub-area. The score is computed by dividing the total points awarded (i.e.,
       GOs) by the total points possible (minus N/As) and converting to a percentage.
                     (Total Compliance & Performance Pts Awarded (―GOs‖))
SCORESUB-AREA % = ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- x 100
                  (Total Possible Compliance & Performance Pts (Minus N/As))
       4.11.2.2. The Compliance Score is based on CPC compliance items. The score is
       computed by dividing the total compliance points awarded (i.e., GOs) by the total
       compliance points possible (minus N/As) and converting to a percentage.
 20                                                                  AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010

                    (Total Possible Compliance Pts (Minus N/As))
        4.11.2.3. The Performance Score is based on CPC performance items. The score is
        computed by dividing the total performance points awarded (i.e., GOs) by the total
        performance points possible (minus N/As) and converting to a percentage.
                         (Total Performance Pts Awarded (―GOs‖))

                      (Total Possible Performance Pts (Minus N/As))
        4.11.2.4. Overall score is based on a total of the Compliance Score and Performance
        score. The score is computed by dividing the total Compliance and Performance points
        awarded (i.e., GOs) by the total Compliance and Performance points possible (minus
        N/As) and converting to a percentage.
                    (Total Compliance and Performance Pts Awarded (―GOs‖))

4.12. Resolution of discrepancies and negative observations. MAJCOM WFMs have
approval authority for resolution plans and closure requests for SOWSEP discrepancies and
negative observations. Discrepancies and negative observations will not be closed until the core
issues that warranted each finding are fully resolved to prevent recurrence.
    4.12.1. The evaluated organization will adhere to the following guidance for resolution of
    discrepancies and negative observations.
    4.12.2. NLT 60 days from the date of the SOWSEP report, forward a resolution plan to the
    MAJCOM WFM.
        4.12.2.1. Plans will delineate proposed actions, including suspense dates, to resolve each
        item NLT 180 days (365 days for ANG organizations without full-time support) from the
        approval date of the resolution plan.
AFI15-135V2 13 JULY 2010                                                                     21


      4.12.2.2. Resolution plans are not required for organizations receiving an overall rating
      of UNSATISFACTORY. Those organizations will be reevaluated within 180 days.
   4.12.3. Forward closure requests, including items resolved prior to submitting the resolution
   plan, to MAJCOM WFMs.
   4.12.4. Within 30 days of receipt, the MAJCOM WFM will rule on resolution plans or
   closure requests. Requests for closure of SOWSEP discrepancies must include sufficient
   descriptions of actions taken to correct the deficiency and prevent recurrence.
   4.12.5. Performance discrepancies can be closed by creating and documenting training (e.g.,
   during checkride person fails to convert winds from magnetic to true, and SOP exists, then
   document training locally).
   4.12.6. Discrepancies that cannot be resolved by the owning MAJCOM WFM will be
   forwarded to AF/A3O-WP for final adjudication.
