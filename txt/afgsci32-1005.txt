requirements for all ICBM RP/RPIE modifications to maintain hardness and configuration control.

6.2. Equipment/Component Substitutes:

6.2.1. The Chief Missile Engineer identifies the substitution of functionally identical equipment or
components regardless of manufacturer or model designation. Suitable substitutes must meet design
specifications, tolerances, and satisfy original form, fit, function, and hardness criteria. The MES is
the final approval authority for equipment/component substitutes and determines compliance with
hardness criteria and nuclear surety requirements. Items identified by the Chief Missile Engineer may
be temporarily installed and used/operated with ADP authorization until the applicable CEMs are
changed. Disapproved temporarily installed equipment/components will be removed and MES will
develop a suitable substitute or recommendation.

6.2.1.1. Forward all manufacturer brochures/manuals containing component specifications, drawings,
operating instructions, and maintenance instructions pertaining to checkout, troubleshooting, and
adjustment to MES.

6.2.2. The MW/576 FLTS or CE material control requests substitute actions to Base Missile
Engineering by letter and forwards an information copy to MES. Requests may be made by
telephone/E-mail but must be followed up with a letter within 3 working days. The flight letter,
coupled with a manufacturer’s brochure, will be considered an ADP to authorize interim use of the
suitable substitute part. Prepare an AFGSC Form 272 identifying the substitute part and forward
within 30 days of installation.

6.3. ADP:

6.3.1. Base Missile Engineers authorize and control use of ADPs intended for use by the Technical
Engineering Section and technicians that are qualified on the original equipment.

6.3.2. Only MES or the Base Missile Engineer Flight can issue or authorize an ADP change.

6.6. MCL.

NOTE: For MCLs and record MCLs, notify MXG/576 FLTS Plans and Scheduling Section to upload
the MCL information in the TCTO portion of IMDS and is initiated for each site affected by the
MCL.

6.6.1. Types of MCLs

6.6.1.1. Prototype MCL. Prototype MCLs are necessary for more complex modifications that require
on-site verification of supply data and modification instructions. Prototype MCLs are performed only
on sites specified in the MCL or by MES and are removed after the verification is satisfied unless
specified by MES.

6.6.1.2. Record CEM MCL. Record MCLs are necessary for tracking of ICBM RP/RPIE
modifications requiring CEC that are being accomplished under a contract or means other than an
MCL. Record MCLs identify the modification being performed and the affected facilities, systems,
equipment, drawings, and technical data; but, Record MCLs do not provide detailed modification
procedures.

6.6.1.3. CEM MCL. The CEM MCLs, including Rivet MILE MCLs, are instructions for
accomplishing modifications. Unlike a Record MCL, a CEM MCL is complete within itself. The
CEM MCLs contain comprehensive supply data lists and modification instructions.

6.7. MCL Completion Package Preparation:

6.7.1. Submit technical data deficiencies to MES upon completion of the first site.

6.7.2. Submit completion package within 30 days after completion of the last site. A single
completion package may be used for all MCLs included in the same contract. Include the following in
completion packages:

6.7.2.1. Date final site was completed.

6.7.2.2. Reproducible as-built drawings.

6.7.2.3. Shop drawings, if any.
6.7.2.4. Control numbers for all AFGSC forms initiated and technical data affected, and dates forms
were submitted to MES.

6.7.2.5. Any engineering data and/or findings that were used in the accomplishment of the MCL.

6.7.2.6. One original set of vendor’s/manufacturer’s brochures.

6.7.3. Notify MES of any delays in processing the completion package and request an extension a
minimum of 30 days prior to the rescission date from MES.

Terms

Advanced Data Packages (ADPs) - The ADPs provide support for operation and maintenance of
components and subsystems during modification programs, during evaluation of authorized suitable
substitute items, and to provide specialized technical data coverage for maintenance tasks. These
documents consist of federal data or commercial vendor data, and may contain such information as
operation, repair, maintenance instructions, and parts lists. The ADPs may also consist of existing
hard copy CEM pages, which have required changes incorporated with pen, pencil, and typed matter
entries.

Central Engineering Control (CEC) - The purpose of CEC is for control of facility configuration to
ensure system operation, security, safety, and survivability.

Civil Engineer Manuals (CEMs) - The official medium for disseminating technical information,
instructions, and safety procedures to personnel assigned to the organizations responsible for the
operation and maintenance of ICBM RP/RPIE weapon system equipment.

Civil Engineer Manual Interim Change (CEMIC) - Maintenance instructions in CEMs that are
available during modification programs while awaiting formal publication of approved changes.
Typically, CEMICs are used when lack of data or existing data could result in injury to personnel or
damage to equipment. CEMICs may be published locally after coordination with MES.

Construction, Surveillance, and Inspection (CSI) - Process by which life-extension projects are
monitored at ICBM facilities.

Code able – Equipment items which are listed in CEM 21-SM80-06, Work Unit Code manual.

Contracts - A life-extension contract is an MES or base generated project that is beyond the organic
repair capability of the Base Missile Engineering function.

Defense Access Roads – Program that provides a means for the Federal Government to pay its fair
share of the cost for repairs and re-graveling to unimproved missile routes to ensure their continued
ability to support the missile transporter-erector (TE) vehicle. This program is required due to the TE
size and weight (no other missile vehicle mandates the DAR program). Program is managed by
Military Traffic Management Command and is the liaison to Federal Highway Administration.




                                                                                                     36
                                                                      AFGSCI32-1005 25 AUG 2010


Equipment Manuals - Equipment manuals are bound, numbered volumes of commercial and federal
data pertaining to end items of equipment and individual components.

Extraordinary Maintenance (EM) - Maintenance requested by Air Force and performed by local
agencies on a certified missile transporter gravel route in excess of that required for normal public
travel. Alternate route systems are not eligible for EM unless the primary route cannot be used at the
time of the transporter movement. The EM program enables Base Missile Engineering to correct day-
to-day discrepancies that would otherwise interrupt high priority or emergency operations. It provides
for emergency repairs, which cannot wait for scheduled maintenance to be performed by the owning
agency.

Extraordinary Snow Removal (ESR) - A contract established through the FHWA to assist local
agencies through use of supplemental resources. The ESR program is used to ensure the security of
the facility, prevent extensive equipment damage, reduce off alert time, and to protect the health and
safety of Air Force personnel.

Facility Change Initiation Request (FCIR) - An FCIR is used to propose a modification to ICBM
RP/RPIE. An AFGSC Form 286, Facility Change Initiation Request, is used to submit a FCIR.

Facility Engineering Analysis Test (FEAT) - A FEAT is performed to test and verify a proposed
change to the configuration controlled portion of ICBM RP/RPIE. FEATs will originate from FCIRs,
suggestions, or need for suitable substitutes. An AFGSC Form 287, Facility Engineering Analysis
Test (FEAT) Request, is used to submit a FEAT.

Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) - A weapon system computer system used to
schedule and track Missile work orders. The IMDS work orders will be used in Civil Engineering to
record maintenance actions involving one-time BCE assists, 21-SM80-6 inspections, and
maintenance actions taken to support 21-SM80-6 inspections, MCL/FEAT work, and code able and
noncode able equipment repair.

Improved Missile Physical Security System (IMPSS) - Security system at ICBM launch facilities.

Interim Technical Data - Interim technical data is used to operate and maintain systems or
equipment during modifications programs.

Master Change Log (MCL) - Instructions for accomplishing modifications to CEC equipment. The
MCLs are published by MES. The MCLs are numbered and contain supply data and modification
instructions. The last four digits of the MCL coincide with the MCL control number assigned by
MES.

System Manuals - System manuals are bound and numbered volumes of technical data pertaining to
operation and maintenance of entire systems.

Transporter-Erector Route – A road specifically designated for use by the TE vehicle for access to
missile sites.




                                                                                                     37
