    3.19. Vehicles shall not be parked or driven less than 25 feet in front or 200 feet behind
    aircraft with running engines, unless prescribed in applicable aircraft handbooks. Vehicles
    parked next to aircraft shall be clear of wingtips and clearly visible to personnel in cockpit.
    3.20. Passengers in Vehicle. Passengers shall be limited to the designed seating capacity of
    the vehicle during routine operations. This includes pickup trucks and cargo vans with
    passenger seats as well as sedans, station-wagons and buses. When exigent circumstances or
    contingency requirements exceed the capability of available vehicles, commanders may
    through appropriate written and documented risk assessments and compliance with
    installation/host installation guidelines, determine the appropriate means of transportation for
    existing vehicles. Passengers shall use available seat belts when the vehicle is in motion. If
    deemed operationally necessary by the unit commander to ride in the bed of pickup trucks,
    occupants will sit only on the floor, not on wheel wells, with their backs against the cab and
    remain seated while vehicle is moving (see Note below). Passengers in vans will remain
    seated, keep their arms and legs within the vehicle body, and keep side doors closed while
    the van is moving. Passengers will not ride in doorways or sit on engine covers in metro
    vans/step vans. Door nets shall be used when transporting passengers with rear doors open.
    Panel van and metro vehicle (bread truck) sliding passenger doors may remain open while
    the vehicle is in motion if a cargo net is installed to restrain the passengers. Note: Personnel
    jumping or descending from the bed of pickup and stake bed trucks have caused a large
    number of injuries and the practice of riding in the bed of these type vehicles is highly
    discouraged. However, commanders should identify in writing vehicles approved for
    transporting personnel in the bed of pickup or stake bed vehicles.
    3.21. Restricted Visibility or Night Operations. Flashing or parking lights shall be used at
    night when vehicles are temporarily parked on any part of the aircraft ramp. This does not
    apply to vehicles parked in a designated parking area. Refueling and explosive loaded (laden)
    vehicles shall not be operated when visibility is less than 300 feet unless directed by wing or
    installation commander. PMVs and flight line vehicles, except emergency and alert vehicles,
    shall not be operated on the flight line with visibility less than 100 feet. A walking guide with
    a flashing or luminescent wand shall be used during emergency movement of alert vehicles
    when visibility is under 50 feet. Vehicle operators shall ensure headlights do not point toward
    taxiing aircraft or towing operations to prevent blinding aircraft or tow vehicle operators.
    3.22. Control Tower Signs. For units based at an Air Force installation, AFVA 11-240,
    Airport Signs and Markings (Figure 24.2), shall be displayed where maintenance and flight-
    related operations take place. Suitable locations include, but are not limited to, maintenance
    work areas, flight operations, flight line buildings frequented by ground and aircrew
    personnel, vehicles operated on Air Force airfields, etc. Refer to AFI 13-213, Airfield
    Driving, for additional guidance. AFVA 11-240 is available at http://www.e-

   law or during shift-change operability checks.
5. Stopping at Stop Signs and Yield Signs and Crosswalks.
   5.1. Every stop sign and yield sign shall be erected as near as possible to the nearest line of
   the crosswalk on the near-side of the intersection, or if there is no crosswalk, then as near as
   practical to the nearest line of the intersecting roadway.
   5.2. The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign will stop if required before entering the
   crosswalk, on the near side of the intersection.
   5.3. The driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign will make a complete stop at the clearly
   marked stop line painted on the roadway or if no stop line is visible, as close to the stop sign
   as to where traffic can be seen by the driver in all other directions before proceeding. At no
   time will the driver block a crosswalk while pedestrians are attempting to cross the street
   utilizing the crosswalk.
