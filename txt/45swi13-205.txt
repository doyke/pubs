location is designated for installation of a mobile aircraft arresting system if required. Location is approx
7650’ from the approach end of RWY 13. Area is equipped with 4 flush mounted runway edge lights.

1.36. PROCEDURES FOR OPENING AND CLOSING THE RUNWAY. Airfield Management is the
only agency authorized to declare the runway open/closed.

1.37. BIRD WATCH CONDITIONS/PROCEDURES/RESTRICTIONS.
     1.37.1. Resident waterfowl are the greatest hazard to CCAFS flight operations. Gulls and terns are
     common in all areas and present exceptionally heavy activity on the ramp and runway after rain show-
     ers.
     1.37.2. Long legged wading birds are most common along the Banana River and on final approach
     course to runway 13.
     1.37.3. Raptors are common in all areas, especially north of the runway.
     1.37.4. Pelicans and shorebirds present heavy concentrations along the coast and are extremely haz-
     ardous along the final approach course to both runways.
     1.37.5. Small species and migratory birds are common in all bushy areas.
     1.37.6. Due to limited air traffic flow into CCAFS, there have been few recorded BASH incidents.
     1.37.7. Should a bird strike occur, aircrew will complete AF Form 853, Air Force Bird Strike Report.
     Flight Safety will be notified and form faxed to their office at 4-7139. If bird cannot be identified,
     remove 2 feathers from the bird and appropriately discard carcass. Secure feathers in zip lock bag for
     Flight Safety and leave feathers with Airfield Management.
     1.37.8. Bird Watch Phases – Phase 1, 1 April-30 September. Phase 2, 1 October-31 March. Highest
     bird strike potential during Phase 2 due to migratory season. Expect increased activity during phase 2
     at dawn/dusk +/- 1 hour.
     1.37.9. Bird Watch Conditions:
        1.37.9.1. SEVERE – High bird population on or immediately above the active runway or other
        specific location that represents a high potential for strike. Airfield flying operations will be sus-
        pended until the airfield manager disperses the birds and downgrades the condition.
        1.37.9.2. MODERATE – Increased bird population in locations which represent an increased
        potential for strike. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies and supervisors and
        caution by aircrews.
        1.37.9.3. LOW – Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with low probability of hazard.
     1.37.10. The airfield manager is responsible to declare current bird watch condition and conduct
     harassment. BASH cannons will be first line of defense.
     1.37.11. Grass height will be maintained between 7-14”.

1.38. AIRFIELD QUIET HOUR REQUESTS. CCAFS quiet hour requests must be coordinated through
Airfield Management at least 10 working days prior to the event.
45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007                                                                                  13


1.39. FACILITY OPENING/CLOSING PROCEDURES. The tower and airfield management will open
a minimum of thirty minutes prior to aircraft scheduled arrivals/departures or engine start and remain
open at least 30 minutes after departure. The opening shift shall perform control tower and airfield open-
ing checklists.
NOTE: If the back-up generator is running upon arrival to the facility or when back-up power returns to
commercial power, immediately contact Cape Support personnel at 853-5211.

1.40. RAMP LIGHTING OPERATING PROCEDURES DURING TURTLE NESTING SEASON.
   1.40.1. Ballpark lights should only be turned on between sunset and sunrise during aircraft on/offload
   operations and for security reasons. Only the minimum number of ballpark lights necessary shall be
   illuminated.
   1.40.2. The two pole lights should only be used during on and off-load operations and during VIP
   arrivals and departures after sunset. In any case the controller on duty will use the best judgment.
   These lights should never be left on for illuminating an aircraft for security reasons during turtle nest-
   ing season 1 May - 31 October.

1.41. HEAVY AIRCRAFT JET THRUST AVOIDANCE PROCEDURES. Tower shall use the following
phraseology for heavy jet aircraft: “If able, use minimum power to reduce jet blast to ground personnel.”

1.42. LATERAL DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MOBILE OBSTACLES FROM RUNWAY,
TAXIWAYS AND APRONS. Fixed or mobile obstacles are considered airfield obstructions if not sited or
located correctly on the airfield. The runway lateral clearance distance is 1000’ on each side of the runway
centerline. Taxiway lateral clearance is 200’ each side of the taxiway centerline. Apron lateral clearance
is determined by half the wingspan of the largest airframe plus the required wingtip clearance distance. At
the Skid Strip this is 169’ from the taxiway line to the surrounding grass area. (See Attachment 2)

1.43. SUPERVISOR OF FLYING DUTIES. No Supervisor of Flying (SOF) program exists at CCAFS.

1.44. MULTIPLE RFC APPROACH REQUIREMENTS. No RFC approaches exist.

                                              EMERGENCIES

5.1. GENERAL. Emergencies have priority over normal airfield operations. When an emergency is in
progress, non-emergency related radio conversation will be kept to a minimum. Non-emergency taxiing
aircraft will exercise caution and yield to all emergency response vehicles. After an aircraft emergency
lands, the Control Tower Watch Supervisor will suspend operations. Aircraft arriving due to a medical
emergency on board do not require operations to be suspended. Airfield Management will make resump-
tion of runway operations its first priority and may solicit any flightline certified vehicle operators for
FOD check assistance. Prompt notifications are essential to ensure activation of CCEMP and/or 45 SW
OPlan 91-204V1, as required.

5.2. PRIMARY CRASH ALERTING SYSTEM (PCAS). The controller on duty will activate the primary
crash net and pass all pertinent information to CCAFS agencies as soon as possible. The JBOSC Duty
Office and Joint Communications Command Center (JCCC) (fire/security) are on the PCAS. The crash
net will be reactivated to forward updated information as it becomes available. Exercise inputs may be
passed over the crash phone. If the PCAS is out of service, Tower shall contact all agencies individually.
Daily operational checks are accomplished on days when aircraft operations are scheduled or when
deemed necessary. The PCAS will be activated for any of the following conditions:
     5.2.1. All In-Flight/Ground emergencies.
     5.2.2. Aircraft mishap/Accident (on and off base).
     5.2.3. Disaster notification (actual, potential), i.e. Broken Arrow.
     5.2.4. Aircraft with “Hot Brakes”.
     5.2.5. Suspected or confirmed Hijacked aircraft.
     5.2.6. Aircraft bomb threats.
     5.2.7. Unauthorized landings.
     5.2.8. Control Tower evacuation.
     5.2.9. Jettison of external stores (land or water).
     5.2.10. Hydrazine emergencies (EPU activation, leaking).
     5.2.11. Emergency Locator Beacon activation.
     5.2.12. Control Tower Watch Supervisor deems it necessary in the interest of safety.

5.3. TOWER RESPONSIBILITIES:
     5.3.1. Activate PCAS.
     5.3.2. Monitor B Safety Net after PCAS activation and advise, “TOWER IS ON THE CRASH
     NET.”.
     5.3.3. Broadcast “TOWER IS OFF B SAFETY NET” when all vehicles have departed the airfield
     controlled area.

notifies the Det 1 45 MSG/CC (Cape Commander) and Patrick Command Post of all emergency informa-
tion relayed over the PCAS.

5.6. BAILOUT AREA. Time permitting, the designated bailout area is Patrick TACAN 090 degree
radial heading of 090 at 0.5 DME at 2,000 foot minimum altitude. If an aircrew will perform bail out the
control tower operator will plot the aircraft coordinates on the base crash grid map and pass over the pri-
mary crash net.

5.7. JETTISON AND FUEL DUMPING AREA. Time permitting, the designated jettison area is
Patrick TACAN 090 radial, heading of 090 at approximately 5 DME. If aircraft is not TACAN equipped,
Orlando approach shall provide radar vectors. Do not perform fuel dumping operations under 5,000 feet
AGL if conditions permit.

5.8. HOT BRAKE AREAS. Designated hot brake areas are on Taxiway Alpha and Taxiway Bravo. See
Attachment 10.

5.9. HOT (ARMED) AIRCRAFT, UNSAFE OR HUNG ORDNANCE CONDITIONS. Optimum is
for aircraft to land at Patrick AFB. If the aircraft will come to the Cape, aircraft will land RWY 13 and taxi
to 2000 foot remaining marker and stop facing the water.
NOTE: Use of straight-in approaches shall be used to the maximum extent possible to avoid overflight of
populated areas.

5.10. HYDRAZINE EMERGENCIES. Optimum is for aircraft to land at Patrick AFB. If the aircraft
will land at the Cape, aircraft will land RWY 13 and taxi to 2000 foot remaining marker and stop facing

                                FLIGHTLINE DRIVING PROCEDURES

6.1. POLICY. Motor vehicles operating on the flightline are necessary for normal operations and main-
tenance. Carelessness and disregard of safety rules by flightline drivers cannot be allowed since these are
the primary cause of aircraft-vehicle collisions. Upon suspension/revocation of base driving privileges,
the 45 MSG/CC can authorize re-instatement of flightline driving privileges to perform critical mission
essential duties.

6.2. AUTHORIZATION. Motor vehicle traffic on the flightline is restricted to Government Owned
Vehicles (GOV) on official business. Airfield Management can authorize vender or contractor vehicles as
needed to support the airfield mission.

Driving Program.

6.4. UNIT COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITIES. Appoint a primary and alternate unit Flightline
Driving Program Manager FDPM in writing (normally the Vehicle Control Officer VCO or Vehicle Con-
trol Noncommissioned Officer VCNCO) to conduct training for all their personnel where duties require
operating a vehicle on the flightline. Forward a copy of the appointment letter to CCAFS Airfield Man-
ager.
     6.4.1. Certify personnel are qualified to drive on the flightline. (refer to Attachment 12) (Local form
     letter may be used as long as it includes all information listed on Attachment 12.) Authority may be
     delegated in writing to individual unit Flightline Driving Program Managers.
     6.4.2. All base assigned personnel who operate a vehicle on the flightline must complete all training
     and testing requirements. Flightline experience is not a substitute for completion of flightline driving
     training and testing requirement.
     6.4.3. Limit the number of personnel authorized to drive on the flightline to the absolute minimum
     necessary to accomplish the mission. If access to the runway is not required limit driver to ramp certi-
     fication only. See Attachment 13.
     6.4.4. Upon suspension/revocation of the unit’s member’s base driving privileges, suspend/revoke the
     member’s flightline driving authorization and notify the unit FDPM and CCAFS Airfield Manager in
     writing.
     6.4.5. Screen, carefully select, and designate in writing to CCAFS Airfield Manager names of FDPM
     authorized to administer the unit's flightline drivers training program. Appoint replacement more than
     30 days prior to relinquishing unit duty.

   can be accomplished.
   6.10.4. Personnel engaged in construction or repair work on the flightline will take precautions to pre-
   vent FOD hazards their work may create (see Attachment 15).
   6.10.5. Make arrangements to have a certified flightline driver escort provided for personnel who
   have not been certified or trained by Airfield Management, and require access to the airfield. Airfield
   Management cannot provide escorts on a regular basis.

6.11. VEHICLE OPERATIONS IN THE CMA. (For dimensions, see Attachment 8 and paragraph
1.4.) For special events and as appropriate, Airfield Management may authorize CMA areas to be tempo-
rary uncontrolled. During special military operations the airfield will be closed to all non-participants.
(All base agencies are notified via email of all Cape missions).
   6.11.1. To operate a vehicle in the CMA drivers must be certified to drive on the flightline and have
   the AF Form 483 on their person or be escorted.
   6.11.2. Two-way radio communication with the Control Tower must be established and Control
   Tower clearance obtained prior to proceeding onto a controlled movement area. At all times while on
   controlled movement areas the appropriate radio will be monitored. Additionally, vehicles operating
   on the runway or overruns will have rotating lights turned on. If not beacon equipped, headlights and
   flashers will be turned on. NOTE: Hospital ambulances will run emergency lights during actual
   emergencies. During training all ambulances will run headlights and flashers.
   6.11.3. Vehicles and personnel requiring access to the movement area, and not radio equipped, must

6.14. FM RADIO NET OPERATIONS. Control Tower will control vehicular traffic on the airfield
with the tower net or “B” net.

6.15. RADIO DISCIPLINE. Due to the variety of frequencies monitored by the Control Tower (see
paragraph 6.16.), it is imperative that all individuals use proper and concise terminology. The Control
Tower has ultimate authority over all traffic entering the controlled movement area and will issue, by
radio or directional light gun signals, specific instructions which approve or disapprove the movement of
vehicles, equipment, and personnel on the movement area.

6.16. AIRFIELD RADIO PHRASEOLOGY : ALL FLIGHTLINE OPERATORS MUST HAVE A
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES PRIOR TO BEING AUTHO-
RIZED ACCESS TO THE CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA. FDPM’s/Trainers will evaluate driv-
ers on the proper use of radios. The following definitions and examples will be used when communicating
with the Control Tower.
     6.16.1. Definition of Terminology.
        6.16.1.1. ACKNOWLEDGE - Let me know that you understand my message.
        6.16.1.2. AFFIRMATIVE – Yes.
        6.16.1.3. HOLD - Stop your vehicle, maintain your present position.
        6.16.1.4. I SAY AGAIN - The message will be repeated.
        6.16.1.5. NEGATIVE - No, permission not granted; or that is not correct.
        6.16.1.6. OVER - My transmission is ended, I expect a response.
        6.16.1.7. ROGER - I have received all of your last transmission.
        6.16.1.8. SAY AGAIN - Please repeat your last transmission.
        6.16.1.9. STANDBY - The controller is busy with a higher priority item and cannot answer you.
        If the delay is lengthy, the caller should re-establish contact.
        6.16.1.10. PROCEED - The “action word” allowing access to controlled movement area.
NOTE: Usage of non-standard terminology such as "cleared,” or nonessential communications is prohib-
ited due to the possible misinterpretation by other individuals operating on the airfield frequencies. All
radio communication while operating on any frequency utilized to control aircraft or ground movement
on the flightline will be kept to an absolute minimum.
     6.16.2. The following phraseology will be used when requesting access across or onto a movement
     area:
45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007                                                                             29


Table 6.1. Phraseology.
PROCEDURES                                                   PHRASEOLOGY (EXAMPLE)
Driver: State whom you are calling and who are you (Use      "Tower, Ops Mobile"
this radio call to initiate all radio communications )

Control Tower response                                       "Ops Mobile, Tower"

Driver: State who you are, location, and request             "Ops Mobile on taxiway Alpha, request
                                                             permission on runway 13”

Control Tower response                                       "Ops Mobile, PROCEED on runway 13
                                                             and Report-Off”

Driver: Read back Control Tower's instructions               "Tower,Ops Mobile, PROCEEDING on
                                                             runway 13 and will report off"

hold short line on the other side)

Control Tower acknowledgment                                 "Roger Ops Mobile"

   6.16.3. Keys Points.
      6.16.3.1. The words “clear” or “clearance” or any form thereof shall not be used over the radio by
      flightline drivers. This may be misunderstood by other vehicles or aircraft as permission to per-
      form an action.
      6.16.3.2. Key words in Control Tower’s transmission are PROCEED and HOLD (see paragraph
      6.8.1.1.).
      6.16.3.3. Always repeat tower’s directions when operating on or near a controlled movement area
      to confirm that their message was received and understood correctly.
      6.16.3.4. Notify Control Tower when leaving the runway by stating, “Tower your callsign off run-
      way”.
      6.16.3.5. If tower’s radio transmission is garbled or unreadable DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT
      PROCEED ON THE CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA. Hold your position and ask Control
      Tower to repeat their last transmission.
      6.16.3.6. After obtaining the Control Tower permission to proceed on a controlled movement
      area, visually determine that the way is clear before entering the area.

6.17. RUNWAY CROSSING POINTS. The Skid Strip has no taxiways/ramps or facilities on the south
side of the runway that would require runway crossing. See Attachment 17 for diagram.
30                                                                           45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007


6.18. COMMUNICATIONS OUT PROCEDURES. In the event of loss of radio contact with the Con-
trol Tower, exit active runways and controlled movement areas until you have re-established radio com-
munications with the Control Tower. Permission must be obtained from the Control Tower before
re-entry.

6.19. EMERGENCY REMOVAL OF VEHICLES FROM THE CMA. Tower will use the following
methods to recall vehicles if normal communications can not be used:
     6.19.1. Continuously cycle the intensity of runway edge lights.
     6.19.2. Issue a flashing red light gun signal.
     6.19.3. Broadcast simultaneously over all frequencies for all personnel and equipment to exit the run-
     way/controlled movement area.

6.20. CONTROL TOWER SIGNALS. All vehicles that operate on the flightline will have AFVA
11-240, AIRPORT SIGNS & MARKINGS signal decal.
     6.20.1. The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the inside of
     the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for ready reference.
     6.20.2. All flightline vehicle operators will know and comply with all airfield signs, markings and
     control tower signals.
     6.20.3. Flightline drivers will be alert for and obey light gun signals from the Control Tower.
     6.20.4. Light gun signals will be posted in plain view in all vehicles routinely using the flightline. The
     Control Tower light gun signals are as follows:

Table 6.2. Light Gun Signals.
COLOR AND TYPE                                           MEANING
Steady Green Light                                       Clear to cross, proceed, or go
Steady Red Light                                         Stop. (Vehicle will not be moved)
Flashing Red Light                                       Clear active runway or taxiway immediately
Alternating Red and Green Light                          General warning. Exercise extreme caution
Flashing White Light                                     Return to starting point on airdrome

NOTE: Only with prior coordination with Airfield Management and the Control Tower will a vehicle be
allowed to cross a movement area using the light gun signal from Control Tower without direct radio con-
tact with the Control Tower.

6.21. VEHICLE CALL SIGNS: All vehicles operating a radio on the flightline will be assigned call
signs. All call signs will consist of a code word and may have a numerical suffix. The following call signs
are assigned:

6.22. RADIOS. Each unit required to operate vehicles on the flightline are responsible for providing
their assigned drivers ramp net capable radios. Airfield Management may issue hand-held radios for spe-
cial activities. A descriptive call sign will be assigned, for example, "Photo," and inform Control Tower of
the call sign and activity planned.

6.23. TAXIING AIRCRAFT. All vehicles will give way to taxiing aircraft. When being over taken or
passing going the opposite direction, move to an area of at least 25 feet from the wing tip, and at least 50
feet from large frame aircraft (i.e. C-5, AN-124, C-17). Bring the vehicle to a complete stop and give the
taxiing aircrew the thumbs up signal to indicate taxi clearance. (Do not leave paved surface unless it is an
emergency.) No vehicle will pass between an taxiing aircraft and its "Follow Me" vehicle.

6.24. APPROACHING AIRCRAFT. All vehicles will approach a parked aircraft with the driver's side
of the vehicle toward the aircraft. The approach will always be made from the side and front of an aircraft.
Except for servicing operations, no vehicle will stand, park, or be driven closer than 25 feet to the front
32                                                                           45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007


and side of an aircraft, nor less than 200 feet from the rear of an aircraft whose engines are running or
about to be started, except as prescribed in the applicable aircraft handbook.

6.25. PARKED AIRCRAFT. Motorized vehicles will not pass under any part of an aircraft. Vehicles
will not be backed or parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet to front -- 200 feet to rear) of any aircraft,
except as authorized for operations such as loading or unloading, servicing, or towing. A spotter will be
posted when a vehicle is backed towards an aircraft. Prepositioned wheel chocks and a guide will be used
prevent the vehicle from backing into the aircraft.

6.26. EMERGENCY OR EXERCISE OPERATIONS. During an aircraft accident or incident, emer-
gency or exercise situation, all vehicles not directly involved with the situation will immediately leave the
flightline and ramp areas. Vehicles will stop and yield the right-of-way to emergency vehicles.
     6.26.1. Personnel and vehicle recall procedures. When personnel and vehicles are recalled from the
     CMA, they will withdraw to a safe distance from the runway (at least 100 feet from the runway edge).
     If radio contact is lost, tower will flash the runway lights on and off. Personnel should look at the
     tower for light gun instruction.

6.27. VEHICLE LIGHTS. Drivers will not approach the front of a moving aircraft, to include towing
operations at night. If this is not possible, position the vehicle in a location that is well clear of the air-
craft's intended taxi route, with headlights turned off until the aircraft has passed, so that the aircrew will
not be blinded or their night vision impaired. Parking lights will be left on to show the position of the
vehicle. When vehicles are operating on the Skid Strip apron, emergency warning flashers (directional
lights front and rear) are not required when ramp lights are on.
NOTE: Operators of vehicles that are equipped with Vehicle Daytime Running Lights (DRL) must exer-
cise extreme caution while operating vehicles during the hours of darkness. Vehicles will park in a safe
location with ignition off, parking brake set, and emergency flashers on.

6.28. FLIGHTLINE PARKING. (In Other Than Designated Parking Areas). When parking any
wheeled equipment or vehicle on the flightline during the hours of darkness or inclement weather and
leaving the driver's seat unattended, the following applies:
     6.28.1. Vehicle will not be pointed towards a parked aircraft.
     6.28.2. Engine will be turned off.
     6.28.3. Select reverse (standard shift) or park (automatic shift).
     6.28.4. Hand brake or parking brake will be set.
     6.28.5. Chocks will be used to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral
     braking system.
     6.28.6. All motor vehicles will activate emergency flashers when parked on the flightline during the
     hours of darkness or inclement weather.
     6.28.7. Vehicles will be left unlocked with keys in the ignition.
     6.28.8. Equipment will be located to ensure required 50’ wingtip clearance for large frame aircraft
     and 25’ wingtip clearance for smaller aircraft.
45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007                                                                                    33


NOTE: Emergency or aircraft servicing vehicles may be left unattended with engines running (for
required power equipment), but the operator must select park for automatic transmissions or neutral for
standard transmissions, set hand brake, and chock the rear wheels.

6.29. AIRCRAFT REFUELING. Fuel trucks will:
   6.29.1. Not be parked closer than 20 feet to the aircraft fuel intake or air vents, nor within 10 feet of
   any part of the aircraft.
   6.29.2. Not be driven under or parked under any part of an aircraft.
   6.29.3. Leave the vehicle door slightly ajar while servicing aircraft in case of an emergency and the
   vehicle must be moved quickly.
   6.29.4. All other vehicles will not operate or park a vehicle within 50 feet of any fuel spill or any refu-
   eling operation (see T.O. 00-25-172, paragraph 4--4-10A).

6.30. AIRCRAFT TOWING. The tow vehicle will be driven by an authorized and qualified driver.
There will be a qualified person in the aircraft cockpit to provide braking during all towing operations of
fixed wing aircraft. Aircraft will not be towed at more than 5 miles per hour. Wing walkers will be used
during towing operations, when required. Towing without aircraft power, i.e., "chock walks," will only be
done as a last resort and can only be approved by the Flightline Production Supervisor (see AFOSH STD
127-100 chapter 6 and AFMAN 24-306).

6.31. AFTER-HOURS VEHICLE OPERATION. When the airfield is closed the following proce-
dures will be complied with:
   6.31.1. Vehicles operating during this period will contact Cape Support, 853-5211 for access.
   6.31.2. Vehicles will not proceed on the runway when after-hour operations are being conducted.
   6.31.3. Vehicles can cross runways, when the airfield is closed, under the following conditions:
       6.31.3.1. There are no after-hour aircraft operations being conducted.
       6.31.3.2. Visually clear the runway and adjoining airspace in both directions before proceeding.
       6.31.3.3. Vehicles will contact Cape Support, 853-5211 to report off the airfield.

6.32. AIRFIELD ENTRY POINTS. The airfield entry points are at the end of Skid Strip Road, and at
the Skid Strip parking apron. Vehicles will not access the airfield via control tower road or the mid field
access road without prior permission. (see Attachment 16).

6.33. ENFORCEMENT POLICY. FLIGHTLINE DRIVING SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT AND VIO-
LATIONS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. Unit Commanders, FDPM’s and the Airfield Manager have the
authority to revoke flightline driving privileges. If any of the three revoke flightline driving privileges the
remaining two authorities will be notified. The Airfield Manager is the governing authority concerning
flightline driving violations. The following policy is used only as a guideline and is not intended to cover
all violations.

6.34. RUNWAY INTRUSIONS. A runway intrusion is a serious airfield safety violation where a vehi-
cle or person enters a runway or overrun without specific Control Tower approval. If a runway intrusion
34                                                                            45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007


occurs or is suspected personnel identifying the incident will notify the Airfield Manager or Cape Security
Forces immediately.
     6.34.1. For runway intrusions that had an adverse impact on flight operations (arrivals, departures,
     etc.) an AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report, must be submitted to Wing Safety.

6.35. CMA VIOLATIONS. Control tower will record CMA violations in it’s daily events log. Viola-
tions will be reported IAW AFI 91-202, The Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. In all cases, Wing
Safety will be notified.
     6.35.1. For CMA violations that did not impact aircraft operations, the AF Form 457, USAF Hazard
     Report, will be used and reported to the Airfield Manager to take immediate action to correct the prob-
     lem or apply interim control measures. Report the incident to the Wing Safety Office by AF Form 457,
     by telephone or in person. (See AFI 91-202, US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program and AFMAN
     91-223 Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports).
     6.35.2. All CMA violations, including HATRs, regardless of impact on flight safety, must be docu-
     mented in AOB minutes. Units must provide specific information (Who, what, when, where and how)
     for trend analysis. Maintain a record of all runway intrusions, actions taken, and results for the current
     and previous calendar year.

6.36. FIRST VIOLATION. Airfield Management will revoke the individual's flightline drivers license
(AF Form 483) for a minimum of 7 days and notify the driver's unit commander and FDPM. The individ-
ual must be retrained and recertified to regain flightline driving privileges. The individual's unit com-
mander must send a letter to the Airfield Manager stating completion of retraining prior to retesting.
Depending upon the seriousness of the violation the individual's flightline driving privileges may not be
reinstated.

6.37. SECOND VIOLATION. A second runway intrusion in most cases will result in permanent loss of
flightline driving privileges.

6.38. CONTROLLED AREA VIOLATION. The outer confines of the airfield marked by signs is con-
sidered a security controlled area. CCAFS Security Forces will be immediately notified when any unau-
thorized person or vehicle are found in the controlled areas. Unauthorized access will be considered a
security violation and reported to and handled by CCAFS Security Forces.

6.39. OTHER AIRFIELD DRIVING VIOLATIONS.
     6.39.1. Violations without incident will result in refresher training with emphasis on areas concerning
     the violation. Subsequent violations will result in loss of flightline drivers license and recertification.
     6.39.2. Other violations involving an incident will result in loss of flightline driving privileges until
     recertified.

6.40. GENERAL CERTIFICATION. Personnel are authorized to operate vehicles on the airfield
when:
     6.40.1. Unit Commander, or FDPM has determined the individual has a valid need to drive on the
     flightline.
45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007                                                                                     35

   currently prevent the person from driving on base, and military license if required for the vehicles that
   they will be tasked to drive on the flightline.
   6.41.4. All applicants must pass color vision testing administered by the hospital. Exceptions:
       6.41.4.1. Individuals who are not able to pass the hospital color vision testing can still be flight-
       line certified if they can distinguish between red and green colors. Trainers/FDPM’s will use a
       practical color vision test to verify this ability. The practical color vision test will include the per-
       son responding to light gun signals from the Control Tower. The individual must correctly identify
       each red and green light gun signal from the Control Tower to pass the practical test.
       6.41.4.2. Personnel who are required to be color coherent for entry into their career field are
       exempt from color vision testing.

6.42. TRAINING. If all of the prerequisites are met, as a minimum the FDPM will ensure:
   6.42.1. The individual completes a comprehensive unit flightline training course.
   6.42.2. All individuals will read and understand this instruction. (45 SWI 13-205).
   6.42.3. Training is conducted on unique operations and situations i.e. Operating a vehicle while using
   NVD’s, driver and assistant driver responsibilities if operating with NVD’s, NVD-related accident
   reporting procedures, and NVD instructor qualification requirements.
   6.42.4. A day and night orientation, and check ride on the flightline is completed. If the driver only
   requires to drive during daylight hours a nighttime orientation is not required and license will be over-
   stamped “limited daytime use only”. See Attachment 14 for check ride checklist.
   6.42.5. The flightline driving review test is completed. (optional).

6.43. LICENSING. Once all training has been successfully completed take the following actions.
   6.43.1. The individual will bring a completed certification letter (Attachment 11) signed by the unit
   commander certifying flightline driver training, Airfield Check Ride Form (Attachment 14), and a
   completed AF Form 483 to Building 50211 (Airfield Manager) on Wednesdays at 1000. Airfield Man-
36                                                                          45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007


     agement will administer a flightline driving written test. Minimum passing score is 80 percent. Testing
     and certification sessions may be canceled without prior notice during emergencies and exercises.

field Management within 30 days of appointment for program administration training and flightline qual-
ification training (unless already qualified). NOTE: The commander may appoint an individual to
administer the flightline driving program in addition to, or in lieu of, the FDPM. Only the individuals
responsible for implementing the program and training are required to be flightline driving qualified. Pro-
gram administration training for FDPM/Flightline Program Administrators will be conducted on the first
Wednesday of each month immediately after the flightline certification session.

6.45. TEMPORARY DUTY (TDY) PERSONNEL. Personnel temporarily assigned to CCAFS Canav-
eral AFS and who have a requirement to drive on the flightline may be granted permission to drive on the
airfield. The following criteria must be met.
     6.45.1. Individual must possess a current AF Form 483, stamped for flightline driving at their perma-
     nent duty base for full flightline driving privileges at CCAFS Canaveral AFS. NOTE: Personnel that
     are not flightline certified at their home station will be placed in the same category as temporary con-
     tractors or vendor personnel (see paragraph 6.46.).
     6.45.2. Personnel will be briefed by host unit FDPM on local airfield layout and procedures empha-
     sizing FOD control, speed limits, and runway intrusions. See Attachment 16.

6.46. TEMPORARY CONTRACTOR OR VENDOR PERSONNEL. Temporary contractor and ven-
dor personnel must have a valid state driver's license in their possession. The Airfield Manager will give
an in-depth briefing and establish an exact route to and from their work areas. They may then be granted
temporary flightline driving privileges (see Attachment 15).

6.47. PRIVATE OWNED VEHICLES (POV). POV’s will not operate on the flightline. Rental vehi-
cles used for official government business are considered GOVs.

6.48. TEMPORARY VEHICLE PASS. Temporary passes are issued by 45 OSS/OSA for 30 days or
less. Permits will be displayed on the dashboard in the lower left corner.

6.49. GOLF CARTS AND MULES. Golf carts and mules will be used on the airfield for official busi-
ness only. Golf carts and mules are considered government vehicles and all procedures and qualifications
for vehicles and drivers outlined in this instruction applies.
     6.49.1. Motorcycles, mopeds, scooters, bicycles, tricycles that are personally owned will not be per-
     mitted for use on the airfield.
45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007                                                                                 37


6.50. FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE (FOD) PREVENTION. Vehicles on the flightline are a major
source of foreign objects that damage aircraft tires and are ingested into jet engines with disastrous
results. In order to help prevent FOD, the following precautions will be taken by all personnel on the
flightline.

6.51. FOD CHECK POINTS. Vehicle operators will Inspect vehicles and remove any potential FOD
material prior to entering the flightline and upon leaving construction areas with loose debris on the pave-
ment. FOD checkpoints at the Skid Strip are marked with signs.
   6.51.1. Pick up potential FOD material on the flightline. Contact Airfield Management if a sweeper is
   needed.
   6.51.2. Vehicles will be operated on hard surfaces to the maximum extent possible. Check the tires
   and undercarriage of vehicles returning from non-paved surfaces and remove rocks and other material
   which could create a FOD hazard.
   6.51.3. Close truck tailgates and tool compartments prior to entering the flightline.
   6.51.4. Report violations of FOD procedures to Airfield Management for appropriate action.

6.52. RESTRICTED AREA. The installation commander has established 4 separate restricted areas on
the Skid Strip parking apron for priority resources. Only when an aircraft is parked within the area is the
area considered restricted.
   6.52.1. The restricted area boundary is marked with a 6” wide red painted line on all sides. Warning
   signs are posted every 100 feet along the boundary when the area is active. Entry to the restricted area
   will be tailored to the operation and determined by the aircraft commander or the CCAFS mission
   operations controller.
   6.52.2. Security Entry control points (ECPs) will be determined by aircraft security standards or oper-
   ational requirements as determined by the CCAFS mission operations controller. Violations will be
   reported to and handled by CCAFS Security Forces. See Attachment 9.

6.53. AIRFIELD SIGNS AND MARKINGS. The taxiways are marked with a 6” yellow reflective
painted line painted down the center that is used to lead aircraft from the runway to the parking apron.
One hundred feet from the runway edge the taxiway line is interrupted and intersected by a Visual Flight
Rule (VFR) holdline. See Attachment 10.
   6.53.1. To travel past the VFR holdline toward the runway you must be in radio contact with the Con-
   trol Tower. The VFR holdline is a double yellow solid line with a double yellow broken line extending
   perpendicular to the taxiway line from grass to grass. The marking on the ground also corresponds to
   the runway signage.
   6.53.2. Taxiways are designated by letters. Both taxiways have taxiway designation signs posted.
   They have a yellow letter designated on the sign with a black background.
   6.53.3. Runways are designated by numbers. Compass heading determines how runways are num-
   bered. Signage with numbers corresponds to each appropriate end of the runway.
   6.53.4. The runway edge has a 3’ wide white stripe called an edge marking. If you cross the VFR
   holdline and white runway edge stripe without radio contact with the Tower or permission you will be
   considered a runway intrusion and lose your flightline driving privileges.

6.54. TOWER OR VEHICLE RADIO PROBLEM AREAS AND VISUAL BLIND SPOTS. There
are no radio or visual blind spots.

6.55. PRECISION APPROACH CRITICAL AREAS. No critical areas exist due to lack of naviga-
tional aids.
45SWI13-205 1 APRIL 2007                                                                       39
