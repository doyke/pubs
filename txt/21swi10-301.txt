1. General. 21 SW is affected by many types of plans. Plans management is an on-going
process used by the wing to provide guidance, plan programs, assign responsibilities to 21 SW
subordinate units to support unit activation, inactivation or move; an acquisition or modification
in excess of $10 million in any 1 year or $50 million over the life of the program; force structure
changes requiring an Implementation Plan directed by headquarters or 21 SW leadership. The
proponent is the key element for generating plans—the office, unit, or activity at any level that
initiates an Air Force basing action.
2. Types of Plans. The Department of Defense uses many types of plans. The type of plans
most common to the 21 SW will be supporting plans or functional plans. Other plans are
described below.
     2.1. Operations Plan (OPLAN). CJCSM 3122.01A defines an OPLAN as a complete and
     detailed joint plan containing a full description of the CONOPS, all annexes applicable to the
     plan and a TPFDD. OPLANs can quickly be developed into an Operation Order (OPORD).
     2.2. Concept Plan (CONPLAN). CJCSM 3122.01A defines a CONPLAN as an operation
     plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable expansion or alteration to
     convert it to an OPLAN, Campaign Plan or OPORD.
21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012                                                                        3


   2.3. Supporting Plan. AFMAN 10-401, Volume 1, states, “In the supporting plan phase,
   each subordinate and supporting commander who is assigned a task in the Commander’s plan
   prepares a supporting plan.” This means any higher headquarters’ OPLAN which tasks
   the21 SW (through 14 AF) requires the 21 SW to develop a supporting plan. Typically, this
   is accomplished and coordinated by the Wing Plans and Programs Office.
   2.4. Functional Plan. AFMAN 10-401, Volume 1, states, “functional plans involve military
   operations in a peacetime or permissive environment. Functional plans are tasked by the
   Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) for humanitarian assistance/disaster relief,
   peacekeeping, or counter drugs. Most 21 SW plans fall into this category.” The following
   are examples of functional plans:
      2.4.1. Contingency Plans
      2.4.2. Installation Security Plans
      2.4.3. Base Snow Removal Plans
      2.4.4. Comprehensive Emergency Management Plans.
      2.4.5. Base Weather Support Plans
   2.5. Base Support Plan (BSP). AFMAN10-401, Volume 1, states, “As a minimum, base-
   level plans must address mobility, mobilization (if appropriate), reception, employment,
   deployment, sustainment, and redeployment planning required for the combat force to
   accomplish its mission. All installations with a wartime mission, regardless of size or
   location, must develop base support plans according to AFI 10-404, Base Support Planning,
   to define their wartime activities.”
   2.6. Programming Plans (PPlans). Headquarters directive, coordinated document, consisting
   of a Basic Plan and supporting functional staff annexes, which defines the actions required,
   and outlines the responsibilities for achieving a given program objective. The primary types
   of actions for which PPlans are developed include unit activations and inactivations;
   realignments involving the physical move of people or assets; base closures; beddown of
   weapons systems; unit conversions from one weapons system to another; beddown and/or
   integration of specialized systems or unique organizational constructs; and increases or
   decreases in a unit's Primary Aircraft Inventory.
   2.7. Programming Message (PMsg). A PMsg is a headquarters’ level message used in lieu
   of a PPlan when less comprehensive documentation will suffice to implement a program
   objective. For example, a PMsg is often utilized when limited functional involvement is
   required to execute the action. A PMsg may also be used as an interim measure to establish
   the overall goal and provide basic guidance pertaining to a major program action while more
   comprehensive documentation is being developed. This is the method of choice when
   planning time is limited. 2.8.      Implementation Plans (IPlans). Wing-level plans that
   delineate actions required for wing agencies to complete a specific project (base closure, unit
   activation, etc.). These are typically generated based on requirements outlined in a higher
   headquarters Programming Plan (PPlan).
3. Operations, Support, and Functional Plan Responsibilities:
   3.1. Commander, 21st Space Wing (21 SW/CC). Approves and signs all plans tasking
   agencies outside the 21 SW and all plans tasking across group lines within the 21 SW.
4                                                                    21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012


    Delegates signature authority for plans to installation commanders at geographically
    separated units (GSU) where the 21 SW GSU is the host for the installation.
    3.2. Wing Plans, Programs and Exercises Office (21 SW/XP):
       3.2.1. Manages the 21 SW plans program.
       3.2.2. Maintains a wing plans library consisting of plans signed by the Wing Commander
       or designated representative. The Plans Library includes only those plans that task
       agencies outside the 21 SW or across group lines. It may also include those plans at a 21
       SW GSU where that GSU is the host for the site (and therefore the Installation
       Commander).
       3.2.3. Publishes, updates, and distributes an index of wing plans. The index includes
       only those plans defined in paragraph 3.2.2 above.
       3.2.4. Reviews/coordinates on wing-level plans.
       3.2.5. Manages the annual review of wing-level plans.
       3.2.6. Ensures compliance with higher headquarters or locally-established directives to
       prevent duplication.
       3.2.7. Provides guidance to 21 SW organizations on the plans program.
       3.2.8. Serves as the focal point to coordinate, within the 21st Space Wing, plans from
       organizations outside the 21 SW that task 21 SW units. 21 SW/XP will prepare a staff
       summary sheet through all agencies affected in that plan, consolidate any comments, and
       provide a consolidated wing response back to the plan’s OPR.
       3.2.9. Publishes a letter of rescission when all actions in an IPlan are completed.
    3.3. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). Is responsible for creating, coordinating, and
    managing plans within its functional area.
       3.3.1. Develops plans as directed by higher headquarters’ requirements.
       3.3.2. Ensures proper construction and format of plans.
       3.3.3. Identifies all tasked agencies.
       3.3.4. Coordinates plans with tasked agencies. This includes both agencies within the 21
       SW and those external to the 21 SW. Use a staff summary sheet to obtain coordination
       within the 21 SW. For non-Air Force agencies outside the wing, use an official
       memorandum requesting coordination with an explanation of support requested from that
       agency. Any failure to provide input will be treated as concurrence.
       3.3.5. Conducts annual reviews of plans to ensure accuracy and currency.
       3.3.6. Distributes plans to all users. Ensures the 21 SW/XP has a soft copy (in addition
       to a hard copy) for the 21 SW/XP Plans library and to update the wing plans index.
    3.4. Tasked Organizations. It is imperative any tasked agency reviews the plan to ensure
    tasks in the plan are accurate and feasible.
       3.4.1. Reviews plan for compliance and feasibility.
       3.4.2. Ensures the plan reflects the most recent guidance and information.
21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012                                                                         5


        3.4.3. Ensures plan reflects the most recent operations security requirements to protect
        sensitive capability, intentions and activities.
4. General: A plan is a documented course of action establishing procedures on a one-time or
as-needed basis. A plan ensures established procedures are coordinated before an event takes
place. Operation, concept, supporting, and functional plans are developed based on requirements
identified by either an Air Force Instruction (AFI), a Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive,
Headquarters United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) directive, Headquarters Air
Force Space Command (AFSPC) directive or locally-established requirement.
4.1.   Plans Format and Guidance.
    4.2. Format. Plans adhere to formats prescribed in higher headquarters’ directives. AFMAN
    10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats and Guidance, is the governing guidance for formatting
    Air Force operational and concept plans. 21st Space Wing planners will use the format
    described in paragraphs 4.2.1 and 4.2.3 of this instruction (unless another higher
    headquarters’ directive prescribes an alternate format). The objective of using a prescribed
    plan format is to ensure standardization and ease of use across the wing. Paragraph 4.1.2
    shows numbering standards for 21 SW plans, and paragraph 4.1.3 defines the minimum
    content and formatting requirements. The content of plans prescribed in paragraph 4.1.3 can
    be added to as necessary. Group and squadron plans should also use this format to ensure
    consistency across the wing.
        4.2.1. Numbering Plans. The plan number depends on the higher headquarters’ directive
        requiring the plan.
           4.2.1.1. Plans with a higher headquarters corresponding plan. These plans should be
           numbered to correspond with the higher headquarters plan. For example, if AFSPC
           publishes a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan supplement to AFI 10-
           2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations,
           which mandates a wing plan, the wing plan will be 21 SW Comprehensive
           Emergency Management Plan 10-2. If the 21 CES and the 721 CES both publish
           Comprehensive Emergency Management plans, they both will be numbered 10-2. To
           alleviate confusion, all plans with like plan numbers will add a “P” suffix for Peterson
           units and a “C” suffix for Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station units. Plans directed
           by a higher headquarters instruction may be numbered to correspond with that
           instruction.
           4.2.1.2. Plans without a higher headquarters corresponding plan. These plans should
           follow functional area numbering similar to number instructions. Use AF Index 2 as
           a guide for choosing numbering systems.
        4.2.2. Numbering Standards.
           4.2.2.1. Numbering Paragraphs. There are two preferred methods for numbering
           paragraphs in 21 SW plans. Plan paragraphs will be numbered using one of the
           formats in Figure 1.

            4.2.3.8. Appendices. Each Annex can be subdivided into Appendices to address
            specific functional areas. For example, Annex D covers Logistics. Under Logistics
            are areas such as Transportation, Supply, Mobility, Contracting, etc. Separate
            Appendices can be added to discuss specifics about these logistics-related functional
            areas. Add as many Appendices as required. Appendices are numbered starting at
            "1," for example Appendix 1 to Annex D.
            4.2.3.9. Tabs. Tabs are attachments to appendices should a plan need to further
            define requirements listed in an Appendix.
            4.2.3.10. Exhibits. Exhibits are attachments to Tabs.
5. Signature Requirements: Signature requirements are based on who is tasked in the plan.
Use the following guidance when determining who will sign a plan's memorandum of
transmittal:
     5.1. 21st Space Wing Commander. Wing plans tasking agencies outside the 21 SW or
     across group lines require the 21 SW/CC or his/her designated representative signature.
     5.2. Group Commander. Plans tasking across squadron lines, but remaining within a single
     group, can be signed by the respective group commander or designated representative.
     5.3. Squadron Commander. Plans tasking solely within a single squadron can be signed by
     the squadron commander or designated representative.
     5.4. Functional Area Chiefs. Plans tasking solely between functional areas (for example, a
     plan tasking from the 21st Civil Engineering Fire Department to the 50th Civil Engineering
     Fire Department) can be signed by the functional area chief (in this example, the 21 CES Fire
     Chief or designated representative).
     5.5. Individual Annexes. Individual annexes need not be signed by the individual
     responsible for the functional area. The signature on coordination documentation serves as a
     record of concurrence.
6. Plan Development: Each plan follows a process from inception to completion. This process
ensures (1) the plan is required and accurate, (2) tasked agencies can provide required support,
(3) the plan is correctly formatted and (4) the plan is distributed to the necessary agencies. See
21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012                                                                      9


Attachment 2 for a plans development process flowchart. All plans must be formally staffed
before implementation.
7. Plan Staffing Requirements: All plans must be staffed through appropriate agencies. This
ensures others have the opportunity to review your plan for possible impacts to their
organization. Staffing a plan provides two-way benefits. The plan OPR benefits from the
expertise of functional representatives who ensure taskings in the plan are realistic and
attainable. The tasked agencies benefit because they can tailor the support they can give in
advance of plan implementation and not be caught off guard when the plan is implemented.
There are essentially two types of staffing, initial (full) and annual review. 21 SW/XP will
manage the wing-level plans annual review process, while the plan OPR is responsible for
staffing and coordinating the plan. For wing-level plans, 21 SW/XP will notify the plan OPR of
the requirement to perform the annual review. Use a staff summary sheet for coordination within
the 21 SW. For non-Air Force agencies outside the Wing, use an official memorandum with an
explanation of the requested support from that agency.
   7.1. Initial (Full) Staffing. This is required any time a completely new plan is drafted for
   implementation or an existing plan is rewritten due to extensive changes. All agencies
   affected by the plan must review the plan and provide appropriate comments before the plan
   is staffed through the Wing Command Section for approval. (See Attachment 3)
       7.1.1. The plan OPR will include 21 SW/XP in the early stages of the plan review. As a
       minimum, 21 SW/XP will review not only for format but also to verify the accuracy of
       the list of wing and tenant units and external coordinating agencies.
       7.1.2. The OPR is responsible for coordinating the plan with all affected agencies
       (including wing, tenant and external agencies). The OPR will forward necessary copies
       to each agency and monitor responses from these agencies.
       7.1.3. After completing coordination from paragraph 7.1.2, the plan OPR will prepare a
       staff summary sheet to obtain wing commander approval/signature on the draft plan. 21
       SW/XP will be included in this wing coordination.
       7.1.4. After the Wing Commander or Vice Wing Commander (or designated
       representative) approves the plan and signs the memorandum of transmittal, the OPR will
       make necessary distribution (paper or electronic copies). 21 SW/XP requires both one
       paper copy and one electronic copy of the plan for the wing plans library.
       7.1.5. 21 SW/XP will post approved and signed plans that meet classification
       requirements in the Wing Plans and Programs Office plans library.
   7.2. Annual Review. To ensure currency of information and taskings, all plans must be
   reviewed annually. This gives tasked organizations the opportunity to update their respective
   annexes to more accurately reflect ability to support requirements in the plan. See
   Attachment 4 for a flowchart of the annual review process.
       7.2.1. 21 SW/XP initiates this review prior to the anniversary of the date of each wing-
       level plan. 21 SW/XP sends a memorandum to the plan OPR to remind the plan OPR to
       complete the review process. The plan OPR will prepare a staff summary sheet with all
       tasked organizations as coordinating agencies. These agencies, as a minimum, include all
 10                                                                 21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012


      group CCs, wing staff offices and all agencies (within and external to the 21 SW) tasked
      in the plan.
      7.2.2. Minor changes may be made by page-replacement procedures or by pen-and-ink
      procedures depending on the complexity of the change. Ensure any change is
      coordinated with all affected agencies to obtain written concurrence. The OPR will
      maintain coordination documentation, provide a copy of that documentation to 21
      SW/XPP and distribute changes to everyone in Annex Z, Distribution.
      7.2.3. If the annual review results in extensive changes, full staffing procedures will be
      required.
8. Implementation Plans (IPlans):
   8.1. Commander, 21st Space Wing (21 SW/CC), or designated authority approves all IPlans.
   8.2. Wing Plans and Programs Office (21 SW/XP).
      8.2.1. Manages 21 SW IPlans.
      8.2.2. Develops IPlans as directed by higher headquarters’ PPlan requirements.
      8.2.3. Represents 21 SW/XP at AFSPC Programming Plan (PPlan) meetings.
      8.2.4. Staffs PPlans to 21 SW groups and wing staff agencies for review.
      8.2.5. Tasks 21 SW groups and wing staff agencies to prepare their IPlan annexes and to
      develop milestone timelines for each IPlan project.
      8.2.6. Publishes and distributes IPlans to the 21 SW group and wing staff agencies.
      8.2.7. Tracks the status of IPlan milestones through the project lifespan.
      8.2.8. Processes changes to the IPlans, including coordination of the changes and
      distribution.
      8.2.9. Formally rescinds IPlans when the primary objectives of the plan are met.
      8.2.10. Consider meeting the intent of the 21 SW mission, vision and priorities
      (Attachment 5) during the development phase of the IPlan.
   8.3. 21 SW Group and Wing Staff Agency OPRs.
      8.3.1. Are responsible for the content of their IPlan functional area annexes, including
      providing changes to 21 SW/XP when the OPR deems necessary.
      8.3.2. When tasked by 21 SW/XP, prepare their functional area annex, to include
      developing milestones for each trackable action for the IPlan projects. All inputs are to
      be coordinated through the chief of the respective group or wing staff agency before
      being submitted to       21 SW/XP.
      8.3.3. Ensure OPSEC is integrated into planning efforts to increase mission
      effectiveness.
      8.3.4. Provide status reports in accordance with Annex A of each IPlan.
21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012                                                                    11


   8.4. Numbering IPlans. IPlans are assigned a number based upon the fiscal year the IPlan
   was initiated in and the number of IPlans created within that calendar year (i.e., 06-01). A
   book containing IPlan numbers is located in 21 SW/XPP.
   8.5. Numbering Standards.
       8.5.1. Numbering Paragraphs. IPlan paragraphs will be numbered in one of the
       following formats in Figure 2. Note: You must have a subparagraph “b” to have an “a”.
       8.5.2. Numbering Pages. All page numbers will be centered at the bottom of each page
       except the cover page, which is not numbered. Change page numbers will use the
       following numbering system adding “(Change X, Date)” centered two lines below the
       page number.

          corresponding to the Annex letter, Appendix number (Arabic numerals), and Tab
          letter and page within each section. (For example: Annex A, page 1, is "A-1,"
          Appendix 1 to Annex A, page 1, is "A-1-1," Tab A to Appendix 1 to Annex A is "A-
          1-A-1.").
   8.6. Plan Contents. Below is a description of an IPlan’s contents.
       8.6.1. Cover Page. As a minimum, the cover page includes the long title, plan number,
       date, OPR and security classification, as applicable.
       8.6.2. Table of Contents. Lists the IPlan’s contents by page number. Lists all Annexes,
       Appendices, and Tabs. If a portion is not used in the plan, indicate “Not Used” in the
       “Page” column and if a portion will be published separately, state that in the “Page”
       column.
 12                                                                  21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012

Terms
Annex—A document appended to a basic plan or order to make it clearer or to give it further
detail.
Appendix—A subordinate addition to the annex of a plan, which is usually too bulky or full of
details to include in an annex. An appendix is related to a major division or category of data to
be presented.
Basing— Actions taken to position Air Force units (on AF or non-AF property) or non-USAF
entities on USAF real property. Basing is the process used to determine the location of a unit,
manpower, mission, or activity.
Base Support Plan—The installation level planning accomplished to support unified and
specified command wartime operation plans, as well as MAJCOM supporting plans. It cuts
across all functional support areas in a consolidated view of installation missions, requirements,
capabilities and limitations to plan the actions and resources supporting war or contingency
operations other than war, including deployment and reception operations.
Beddown—Establishing a unit, mission, activity, or personnel on real property for longer than
one year. This applies to activities of all military branches, other DoD, non-DoD federal, state
and local government, and/or private agencies requesting the use of Air Force real property.
Beddown is considered the execution of a basing action.
Comment Resolution Matrix (CRM)—-This document is used in second and subsequent
rounds of coordination of a plan. The CRM serves as a record of all comments made during
coordination and how those comments were resolved. Typically, the CRM is a four-column
document with the following headings:              PAGE, PARAGRAPH, COMMENT and
RESOLUTION. The Page and Paragraph columns identify the location within the plan of the
comment in the Comment column. The Comment column lists the OPR who submitted the
original comment, the criticality of the comment (Critical, Substantive or Administrative) and the
original comment itself. The Resolution column describes how that comment was resolved
(whether or not the comment was included/incorporated in the plan) and justification for the
described resolution.
Concept Plan (CONPLAN)—An operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require
considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. It contains the
CINC’s Strategic Concept and those annexes and appendices deemed necessary to complete
planning. Usually does not contain a TPFDD.
 16                                                                   21SWI 10-301 5 June 2012


For Official Use Only (FOUO)— FOUO is for information that has not been given a security
classification pursuant to the criteria of an Executive Order, but which may be withheld from the
public because disclosure would cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions. The governing directive for FOUO is DOD
5400.7-R/AF Sup.
Guidance—Policy, direction, decision, or instructions having the effect of an order when issued
by a higher authority.
Implementation Plan—A wing-level detailed plan to execute and track projects that have been
approved by HQ AFSPC. These projects include force structure changes, such as activations,
inactivations, unit relocations and transfers and major mission upgrades or changes.
Installation Deployment Plan—A document which provides detailed procedures, instructions,
and comprehensive data required to expeditiously deploy personnel and equipment.
Operation—A military action or the carrying out of a strategic, tactical, service, training, or
administrative military mission; the process of carrying on combat, including movement, supply,
attack, defense, and maneuvers needed to gain objectives of any battle or campaign.
Operation Order (OPORD)—A directive issued by a commander to subordinate commanders
for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation.
Operation Plan (OPLAN)—A plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a
basis for development of an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to
execute the Commander’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of these resources to the
theater of operations. Forces and supplies are identified in the OPLAN TPFDD.
PPlan—A MAJCOM level plan. A directive, coordinated document, consisting of a Basic Plan
and supporting functional staff annexes, which defines the actions required, and outlines the
responsibilities for achieving a given program objective. The primary types of actions for which
PPlans are developed include unit activations and inactivations; realignments involving the
physical move of people or assets; base closures; beddown and/or integration of specialized
systems or unique organizational constructs; and increase or decrease in a unit’s Primary
Aircraft Inventory.
Programming Message (PMsg)— A PMsg may be used in lieu of a PPlan when less
comprehensive documentation will suffice to implement a program objective. A PMsg may also
be used as an interim measure to establish the overall goal and provide basic guidance pertaining
to a major program action while more comprehensive documentation is being developed. This is
the method of choice when the planning time is limited.
SITE SURVEY—-An authorized visit by an individual or team to survey real property to
determine its feasibility for a unit or mission beddown. Site surveys may, in part, consist of
preliminary examinations, field investigations, etc.
Support—The action of a force which aids, protects, complements, or sustains another force in
accordance with a directive requiring such action.
