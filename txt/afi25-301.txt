SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSA) are allowed by Subchapter I, Chapter 138,
Sections 2341-2350 of Title 10, United States Code. This Instruction no longer includes
suggested templates or examples for implementing agreements or implementing instructions.
Ownership of the billing and collecting piece of the ACSA process has been revised – including
the newly fielded ACSA Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS)
invoicing and payment requirements. AGATRS is the system of record for all DOD agencies and
its use is mandatory. Non-reimbursable support guidance has been added as it relates to
transiting aircraft. This revised AFI concentrates heavily on the role and responsibilities of

logisticians charged with oversight and conduct of the ACSA program at all levels. Redundant
information (i.e., information contained in the DOD Directive) was removed.

                                            Chapter 1

                        GENERAL GUIDANCE AND LIMITATIONS

1.1. Definition and Purpose. An Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) refers to
a legal instrument entered into under the authority of section 2341 or 2342 of Title 10, U.S. Code
that authorizes the acquisition and reciprocal provision of logistics support, supplies, or services
(LSSS). An ACSA may also be referred to as a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA).
ACSAs allow the interchange of LSSS between the Armed Forces and military forces of nations
or international organizations with which the US has a concluded ACSA. They are used
primarily during combined exercises, training, deployments, or for unforeseen circumstances or
exigencies, including wartime, contingency operations, humanitarian or foreign disaster relief
operations, and peace operations conducted under Chapter VI or VII of the United Nations (UN)
Charter, in which there is a need to acquire and/or transfer LSSS.
   1.1.1. The Secretary of Defense implements the authorities found in Subchapter I, Chapter
   138, Sections 2341 – 2350 of Title 10, United States Code and in DOD Directive 2010.9,
   Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements. The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,
   Technology, and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)), IAW DOD Directive 2010.9, paragraphs 5.1.2,
   5.1.3 and 5.1.4, designates countries eligibility for cross-servicing agreements, authorizes the
   Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to conclude ACSA agreements, and issues
   implementing ACSA policy and program management guidance to the Military Departments.
   Respective responsibilities of the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the
   Commanders of the Combatant Commands are found in DODD 2010.9. The AF implements
   DoDD 2010.9 with AFPD 25-3.
   1.1.2. ACSA is not the primary means for obtaining LSSS. It does not replace national
   responsibilities for planning and acquiring logistics requirements. The intent of ACSA is to
   provide commanders with a flexible tool to obtain or provide LSSS when mission needs
   prevent self-support.
   1.1.3. There are other statutory authorities, programs and international agreements that allow
   US Forces to provide support to foreign forces. Determining which statutory authority is
   appropriate is scenario dependent. Supporting legal offices and MAJCOM ACSA Managers
   can provide guidance on these alternatives.
1.2. ACSA Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS). AGATRS is
the Department of Defense (DOD) system of record for the Office of the Secretary of Defense,
Joint Staff, combatant commands, and service components to manage and track all ACSA
transactions. The system also serves as the world-wide library for concluded ACSAs and
Implementing Arrangements (IA). AGATRS is an unclassified web-based system that can be
accessed world-wide. See CJCSI 2120.01A, Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements,
Enclosure A, paragraph 5.k for additional information on AGATRS.
1.3. Eligible Foreign Nations. Only foreign militaries and international organizations with
which the US has concluded ACSAs are eligible for cross-servicing (acquisition and transfer of
LSSS). Eligible countries and international organizations from which the US may acquire LSSS
under the acquisition-only authority are those that meet the criteria in paragraph 4.2 of DODD
2010.9.
 4                                                                     AFI25-301 5 MAY 2011


     1.3.1. Negotiation and conclusion of ACSAs must be accomplished per AFPD 51-7 and
     DODD 5530.3, International Agreements.
     1.3.2. A list of current ACSAs, along with FAQs and training tools, are maintained by the
     Joint Staff J-4. Contact your MAJCOM ACSA Manager for additional information.
1.4. Reimbursement Methods. ACSAs and IAs allow for reimbursement in one of three ways:
1) cash (including electronic funds transfer (EFT) or check); 2) replacement in kind (RIK); or 3)
equal value exchange (EVE). Guidance for pricing reimbursable transactions for ACSAs is
found in DOD 7000.14-R, DOD Financial Management Regulation (―the FMR‖), Volume 11A,
Chapter 8.
1.5. Categories of Support. The categories of LSSS that may be acquired or transferred under
ACSA authorities are: food, water, billeting, transportation (including airlift), petroleum, oils,
lubricants (POL), clothing, communications services, medical services, ammunition (with
limitations), base operations support (and minor construction under 10 U.S.C. 2854, 2805, and
2803 incident to base operations support), storage services, use of facilities, training services,
spare parts and components, repair and maintenance services, calibration services, and air and
sea port services. Permissible LSSS also includes temporary use (lease or loan) of general
purpose vehicles and other items of non-lethal military equipment not designated as significant
military equipment on the United States Munitions List promulgated pursuant to Section
2278(a)(1) of Title 22, U.S. Code.
     1.5.1. As outlined in 10 U.S.C. 2350, base operations support allowable under ACSA
     includes minor construction under 10 U.S.C. 2854, 2805, and 2803 incident to base
     operations support. Further guidance on minor construction projects is found in AFI 32-1023,
     Designing and Constructing Military Construction Projects.
     1.5.2. Temporary use (lease or loan) of general purpose vehicles and other items of non-
     lethal military equipment not designated as part of the United States Munitions List (USML)
     under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1). For guidance on control and transfer of USML and CCL assets,
     refer to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, and AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions
     Maintenance Management.
     1.5.3. ACSA may not be used to transfer items that are subject to the Atomic Energy Act of
     1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq). If it is unclear whether a contemplated category of LSSS is
     permissible, consult your higher headquarters ACSA manager and the servicing Staff Judge
     Advocate for specific guidance.
1.6. Guidance for ACSA Use. Before providing any LSSS, including repair services,
maintenance services or spares support to a foreign military under an ACSA, the ACSA POC
must ensure release of the requested LSSS is authorized. Release of classified or sensitive
materiel must be carefully examined and specifically approved by the appropriate Foreign
Disclosure release authority. Transfer of publications, regulations, technical orders and similar
documents is NOT authorized under this program. ACSA does not bind either party to providing
support. Support must be denied if provided support is not authorized, negatively impacts US
military appropriations or current operations, and/or requires an increase in US inventory levels
for the sole purpose of supporting foreign LSSS requests.
     1.6.1. Transfers of POL are accomplished under an existing Fuel Exchange Agreement.
     Offset Billing Agreement or Direct Billing Agreement in accordance with DOD 4140.25-M,
AFI25-301 5 MAY 2011                                                                           5


  Volume II, Chapter 17, DOD Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas, and
  Coal, and in accordance with AFI 23-210, Fuels Management. AF organizations requiring
  fuel support and related services from foreign governments shall forward their requirements
  to Defense Energy Support Center via the respective COCOM Joint Petroleum Office.
  1.6.2. In accordance with AFI 10-1801, Foreign Government Aircraft Landings at USAF
  Installations, ―routine airport services‖ are provided on a non-reimbursable basis for military
  and state aircraft of foreign countries. AFI 10-1801 identifies standard non-reimbursable
  support, such as use of runways, ground services, baggage on/off loading, and other routine
  airport services, that may be provided to all foreign militaries transiting US installations,
  whether or not they are NATO members. AFI 10-1801 is only applicable to transient forces
  and does not apply to locations having a permanent or semi-permanent foreign military
  mission/presence or planned operational missions, either transiting or operating from that
  location. AFI 10-1801 does not permit the provision of fuel on a non-reimbursable basis.
  1.6.3. By paragraph 4.7 of DODD 2010.9, US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)
  is the approval authority for ACSA requests for airlift operated by Air Mobility Command
  (AMC). Applicable combatant command ACSA managers are the approval authorities for
  airlift requests using Combatant Command (COCOM) organic assets. Airlift ACSA requests
  are processed from the foreign military requestor through appropriate command levels to the
  appropriate COCOM ACSA Manager.
  1.6.4. When properly approved, and consistent with the law and DODD 2010.9, vehicles and
  equipment end items may be provided as a loan/lease under the provisions of ACSA. There
  are circumstances such as exercises, contingencies, and transient support to foreign forces
  where it would be appropriate to loan/lease vehicles or equipment end items. MAJCOM
  ACSA Managers should refer to COCOM directives and Instructions to ensure any loan/lease
  is in compliance with COCOM policy. Functional area managers must confer with Financial
  Management (FM) personnel to determine fair lease rates. Guidance for pricing for the use
  (lease) of equipment provided under an ACSA is found at paragraph 080601.B of Volume
  11A, Chapter 8, of the FMR.
  1.6.5. AF organizations may NOT negotiate the provision of support inherently controlled or
  owned by another AF organization, without the prior approval of that organization and/or
  appropriate headquarters elements.
  1.6.6. LSSS acquired from the AF through an ACSA may not be transferred by the recipient
  country or organization to a third party without the permission of the US Government.
  Requests for such transfers must be forwarded through the applicable COCOM to OSD.

     ACQUISITION AND CROSS-SERVICING AGREEMENT (ACSA) AUTHORITIES
                       AND RELATED DOCUMENTS

2.1. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Authorities. ACSAs are authorized per Title 10 of the
United States Code, Chapter 138, Subchapter I. This chapter of law provides for two distinct
ACSA authorities: Acquisition-Only Authority and Cross-Servicing Authority.
     2.1.1. Acquisition-Only Authority. In situations where no Cross-Servicing Agreement exists,
     acquisition-only authority may be implemented either through contract using the authority of
     Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), or through international agreements (acquisition-only
     agreements) that rely on the authority of 10 USC 2341.
     2.1.2. Cross-Servicing Authority. 10 USC Section 2342 authorizes the establishment of
     Cross-Servicing Agreements under which the US may transfer LSSS to the military services
     of a foreign country on a reciprocal/reimbursable basis.
2.2. Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements (ACSA). The SECDEF implements ACSA
authority in DOD Directive 2010.9. ACSAs are normally negotiated by the applicable
geographic COCOM with OSD approval. IAW AFPD 25-3, authority to negotiate and conclude
cross-servicing agreements must be requested from the Secretary of the Air Force on a case by
case basis. Procedures used for negotiating and concluding implementing arrangements must be
IAW AFPD 51-7 and AFI 51-701 Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting and Maintaining
International Agreements. ACSAs form the foundation for follow-on Implementing
Arrangements (IA), if such Arrangements are required.
2.3. Implementing Arrangements (IA). Implementing Arrangements define specific roles and
responsibilities for executing LSSS transfers, specify additional terms and conditions, identify
types of support and payment methods, and provide key points of contact for logistical and
financial concerns.
     2.3.1. An IA is often negotiated at the same time as the ACSA and is normally incorporated
     into the ACSA. It may also be a separate document, usually annexed and subordinate to the
     ACSA. The IA is normally generic in scope and multi-service applicable. POCs for each
     signatory are listed, allowing direct contact between POCs in initiating and conducting
     transactions. Development, negotiation and conclusion of any IA require delegated authority
     and must be coordinated through the appropriate COCOM ACSA Manager.
2.4. Requests for Support. Requests for support processed under the authority of an ACSA or
an ACSA IA are treated as ―orders‖ however, providing support is NOT mandatory and each
request must be evaluated for legal sufficiency and operational impacts.
     2.4.1. IAW AFPD 25-3 approved transactions (orders accepted and filled) will be
     documented. Agreed upon forms of documentation are usually identified within the
     applicable ACSA and/or IA. Any form is acceptable as long as it contains minimum
     acceptable data elements and proper/authorized signatures from both parties to the
     transaction. AGATRS may be used to produce acceptable forms for ordering and receiving
     ACSA support. Attach any applicable forms or Implementing Instructions (II) as necessary
AFI25-301 5 MAY 2011                                                                            7


   to the primary transaction form. See the FMR, Volume 11A, Chapter 8 for additional
   guidance on documentation.
   2.4.2. ACSA Managers will maintain a record of all completed ACSA transactions. This
   record includes but is not limited to ACSA forms and any supporting information. A
   quarterly summary report of ACSA transactions and relevant program information is
   required by DODD 2010.9. AGATRS is the official system of record for ACSA
   transactions. Forms and applicable attachments can be scanned and uploaded as needed.
   2.4.3. Ordering authority rests with the POCs designated in the ACSA or IA, or as further
   delegated by appropriately appointed authorities. Requests for support (orders) may only be
   placed by these POCs or their delegated representatives.
2.5. Implementing Instructions (II). IIs are used, as necessary, to define the details of a
complicated transaction or to identify administrative procedures. IIs may be written as an
attachment to an ACSA order form or as a stand alone document. Contact the MAJCOM ACSA
Manager for examples and templates.
   2.5.1. IIs are not considered international agreements and therefore the requirements and
   restrictions of AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining
   International Agreements, do not apply. Care must be taken, however, to ensure the IIs are
   fully consistent with, and do not exceed the scope of, the ACSA or IA.
   2.5.2. The authority to write IIs rests with the appropriate ordering authorities listed in the
   ACSA or IA, or their designated/executing POCs. This authority may be further delegated to
   levels appropriate to ensure transaction visibility and accountability.
   2.5.3. Foreign ACSA Managers or POCs may have different procedures for establishing the
   terms of exchange when they are the transaction supplying agent. The use of IIs should be
   promoted as the preferred method of detailing ACSA exchanges involving AF forces.

   squadron-level personnel as required.
3.6. Staff Judge Advocate (JA). The MAJCOM/JA and/or AF component JA of the applicable
COCOM equivalent provides a valuable source of knowledge and experience in dealing with
international issues. All proposed ACSAs, IAs, IIs, and issues WILL be coordinated with the
servicing staff judge advocate to ensure all legal concerns are addressed.
   3.6.1. MAJCOM/JA legal issues involving ACSAs should be forwarded by the MAJCOM as
   appropriate to either the COCOM legal office or SAF/GCI for resolution, with copy to
   AF/JAO.
   3.6.2. The MAJCOM/JA will provide a legal memorandum for all specific IAs negotiated at
   the MAJCOM level per the requirements of AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding,
   Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements.

   8 guidance on payment and pricing ACSA transactions.
   3.7.5. ACSA obligation and earned reimbursement limitations and ceilings are addressed in
   FMR, Volume 11A Paragraph 080204 and 080205. Authorization is discussed in Paragraphs
   080207 and 080208. Reports and report formats are covered in Paragraph 0804.
   3.7.6. DODD 2010.9 Paragraph 5.5.7 addresses establishing controls to prevent exceeding
   limitations. Financial managers involved with ACSA must be well-versed in the references
   provided in Paragraph 3.7 (and subparagraphs) and in Attachment 1.
3.8. Functional Area Managers. Functional area managers/experts will coordinate directly
with ACSA Managers to procure support under ACSA. In addition, the ACSA managers will
coordinate foreign support orders with the appropriate functional managers prior to approving
the provision of support.
   3.8.1. Appropriate functional managers must review relevant ACSA transactions. This
   review is required to ensure funding is available when receiving support, and to ensure there
   is no operational impact when providing support. Until funds have been identified, AF units
   cannot request support, and if there are negative operational impacts, support should not be
   provided to foreign militaries.

will be recorded within this system.
   4.1.1. ACSA Managers and IA POCs will keep current signed copies of all pertinent ACSAs
   and IAs. Concluded ACSAs and IAs can be found in AGATRS or obtained from the Joint
   Staff, Multinational Logistics Division.

Terms
Acquisition—Only Agreement— A legal instrument entered into under the authority of 10
USC 2341 to acquire logistic support, supplies, or services. An Acquisition Agreement is an
international agreement.
 14                                                                         AFI25-301 5 MAY 2011


Cross—Servicing Agreement— A legal instrument entered into under the authority of 10 USC
2342 that authorizes the reciprocal provision of logistic support, supplies, or services. A Cross-
Servicing Agreement is an international agreement.
Implementing Arrangements (IA)— A supplementary arrangement that prescribes details,
terms, and conditions to implement an ACSA in more defined levels of activity than ACSAs
themselves. They must be completely consistent with associated ACSAs and DODD 2010.9.
Implementing Arrangements that do not involve the obligation of funds may extend for an
indefinite period of time. An implementing arrangement is an international agreement.
Implementing Instructions (II)— IIs address the type of support exchanged, units involved, the
duration required, any limitations involved, costs incurred, fund cite(s) to which payment will be
transferred, billing cycles, and so on. IIs are distributed to all organizations identified in the II, to
include applicable foreign POCs. Since IIs primarily address in-house administrative procedures
and responsibilities for handling transactions, they are not international agreements and are not
signed by both national forces.
