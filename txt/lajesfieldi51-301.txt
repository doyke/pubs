This instruction implements DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER) as well as provisions
of the 1995 Technical Agreement Between the United States and Portugal (Tech Agreement)
(Annex H, Art III). It establishes internal agency requirements and procedures for processing
requests for approval of off-duty employment required by sections 2-206a and 3-306a of DoD
5500.7-R, JER, authorized by DoD Directive 5500.7, Standards of Conduct. This instruction also
implements the directive that agency designees, commanders, heads of organizations, and
supervisors exercise the authority expressly granted by sections 2-303 and 3-306e of DoD
5500.7-R to require DoD employees under their jurisdiction to report any off-duty employment
prior to engaging in such employment, and to prohibit off-duty employment that is prohibited by
statute or regulation, will detract from readiness or pose a security risk. All military and civilian
personnel assigned to DoD activities at Lajes Field, who seek to engage in off-duty employment,
are required to submit an AF IMT Form 3902, Application and Approval for Off-Duty
Employment. This is a punitive instruction; military and civilian personnel who fail to comply
with paragraphs 1.3., 1.4., and 1.5. of this instruction subject themselves to disciplinary action.
This instruction applies to Air National Guard and US Air Force Reserve members when in
active duty or full-time National Guard duty (AGR) under Title 32 U.S.C. Section 502(f). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This version
clarifies, updates, and streamlines previous guidance.
1. Policy
     1.1. Personnel assigned to Lajes Field, both military and civilian, must not engage in off-
     duty employment that:
        1.1.1. Is prohibited by U.S. or Portuguese statute treaty or regulation.
        1.1.2. Would detract from readiness.
        1.1.3. Would pose a security risk.
     1.2. Explanation of Terms.
        1.2.1. The term "off-duty employment" means business activities and compensated
        outside employment, including self-employment. Examples of self-employment include
        the sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics, household supplies,
        vitamins and other goods or services.
        1.2.2. The term "readiness" includes the ability of the Air Force to perform its mission in
        the manner and at the time and place required, and the ability of a military member or
        civilian employee to perform his or her government duties in the manner and at the time
        and place required.
     1.3. All Air Force civilians and military personnel who intend to perform off-duty
     employment, including employment while on terminal leave, shall submit an AF IMT 3902
     to their first-level supervisor at least 2 weeks before beginning employment (except in cases
     where 2 weeks notice is not possible). Final approval must be obtained prior to starting off-
     duty employment. Medical service personnel must comply with the requirements regarding
     off-duty employment in AFI 44-102, Community Health Management, in addition to the
     requirements of this instruction.
     1.4. A new AF IMT 3902 must be submitted whenever the type of employment or the
     employer changes, the individual's Air Force duties change significantly, or the number of
     regularly scheduled off-duty hours increases. Occasional increases in hours due to situations
     such as the availability of overtime work, or the need to fill in for an absent coworker, do not
     require resubmission of the AF IMT 3902. Previously denied requests may be resubmitted
     after a change in the individual's Air Force duties.
     1.5. Military personnel who fail to comply with the filing requirements of this instruction
     violate a lawful general order which may result in appropriate disciplinary action or criminal
     liability under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Air Force civilian
     employees who violate this instruction by failing to comply with its filing requirements are
     subject to appropriate disciplinary action without regard to criminal liability.

2. Procedures for Completing the AF IMT 3902
   2.1. The employee completes Section I.
   2.2. The employee's immediate supervisor completes Section II.
   2.3. In cases where the employee is required to file a SF 278, Public Financial Disclosure
   Report, or an OGE Form 450, Confidential Financial Disclosure Report, and where the off-
   duty employment will be with a "prohibited source" as defined in the Joint Ethics Regulation
   (JER), DoD 5500.7-R, (which includes any person or company that does business or seeks to
   do business with the DoD, regardless of the dollar amount of the contract or purchase), wing
   JA shall complete Section III. In other cases, JA review is not required unless requested by
   the employee's immediate supervisor. However, installation commanders may require JA
   review in all cases (this may be accomplished by letter, as opposed to by local
   supplementation of this instruction).
   2.4. Section IV is completed by the first person in the employee's chain of command or
   supervision who is a commissioned military officer or a civilian GS-12 or above (who may
   be the same person as the immediate supervisor). The individuals specified in this paragraph
   who are authorized to complete Section IV of the AF IMT 3902 (other than unit
   commanders) are considered to be Delegates of Unit Commanders, for purposes of
   completing Section IV of the AF IMT 3902.
   2.5. Filing AF IMT 3902. After a request is approved or disapproved, the original request
   will be maintained either by the individual's unit, or in one or more centralized locations
   (such as a squadron orderly room). In cases where the Legal Office coordinated on the AF
   IMT 3902, a copy of the completed AF IMT 3902 will be sent to the Legal Office, which will
   maintain the IMT as required by the JER, DoD 5500.7-R.
3. Additional Requirements
   3.1. In addition to an AF IMT 3902, all persons requesting approval for off-duty
   employment will provide to their first-level supervisor, a statement that they have read,
   understand, and will comply with the requirements of the JER and the Tech Agreement.
   3.2. It is the responsibility of the requester to abide by the Portuguese laws regarding work
   by aliens in Portuguese territory.
