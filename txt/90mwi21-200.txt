SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has significant changes and requires complete review. It includes the 90th
Munitions Squadron and changes all references from the Tool Accountability System (TAS) to
TCMax.

PART 1. This section applies to all dispatching 90 MXG sections and personnel.
1. Program Guidance:
     1.1. Security, control, and accountability of tools and consumables.
        1.1.1. Store tools and consumables in a designated location for positive control and ease
        of inventory. Prior to dispatch, Composite Tool Kits (CTKs) or individual tools will be
        accounted for on a log or load list which lists (as a minimum) those fields of data found
        on the AF Form 1297. Authorized tool custodian/monitors will issue CTKs and annotate
        accountability for the dispatched CTK on the log.
        1.1.2. Master Inventory Lists (MILs) and Inventory Lists (ILs) will include the
        nomenclature and quantity, for each CTK item, by drawer/section number (see Figure 1
        below). MILs shall contain the date signed, name, rank and signature of the NCOIC.
        Maintain MIL copies in the section’s administrative files, issuing tool room and
        respective CTK. Tool sets with their own container (i.e. drill bits) shall include an IL
        specific to the given tool set.

     1.2. Inventory Procedures.
        1.2.1. Inspect/inventory all CTKs quarterly regardless of utilization levels and document
        inspectors name, rank, and the date accomplished in Tool Accountability System
        (TCMA).
        1.2.2. Account for consumables by quantity/unit of issue and replenish them as they are
        used.
        1.2.3. Maintenance teams shall inventory CTKs prior to dispatch and prior to departing
        any job site.
        1.2.4. Handle lost or missing items IAW paragraph 1.6.
        1.2.5. Tool rooms shall visually inspect all CTKs for accountability and document
        discrepancies/completion at the beginning of each tool room shift.
     1.3. Warranted tool management: Owning work center custodian or monitor shall track
     tools and equipment under warranty and take appropriate action with the vendor to replace
     broken or faulty tools/equipment.
     1.4. Control and management of replacement, expendable and consumable hand tools,
     HAZMATs, and other items contained in CTKs.
90MWI21-200 2 DECEMBER 2014                                                                   3


      1.4.1. Empty spaces (spaces not occupied by a tool) are not permitted in CTKs. Update
      the MIL, IL, TCMax per provisions in AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.4.1.3, immediately after
      a tool is permanently removed from a CTK and eliminate the empty space.
          1.4.1.1. Use of TCMax or other AF approved tool control/inventory system per
          provisions in AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.4.1.3.
* NOTE: TAS is no longer supported by the Air Force; TCMax has been approved for use
of Air Force tool control/inventory.
      1.4.2. Maintain CTKs in Fully Mission Capable (FMC) status at all times. Segregate,
      secure, and control all unserviceable tools.
      1.4.3. Process repairable tools for repair and dispose non-repairable items in a timely
      manner. Maintain a supply of spare tools to ensure mission continuity consistent with
      historical failure rates for a given item.
      1.4.4. Immediately update the IL and TCMax or other AF approved system per
      provisions in AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.4.1.3, when tools are unserviceable and/or
      removed from the CTK. Replace unserviceable and repairable tools with projected repair
      cycle time greater than the next scheduled mission requirement with a spare tool (if
      available). Minor defects that do not significantly degrade the performance of a given
      tool will not be cause for replacement of a CTK item, consistent with technical guidance.
      1.4.5. Replace expendable/consumable items from spare tool inventories as needed
      following each dispatch.
      1.4.6. Segregate, secure, control and maintain an IL for spare tool stocks. Do not etch,
      stamp or otherwise mark. Maintain an inventory of spare tools IAW AFI 21-200.
      1.4.7. Control HAZMAT and turn in all items for proper disposition.
   1.5. Transfer of tools/CTKs at the job site: The losing and gaining team at a job site shall

      1.6.1. The maintenance team shall notify Missile Maintenance Operations Center
      (MMOC) or Munitions Control (90 MUNS Control) for hardness degrade determination
      and shall await further instructions from MMOC/90 MUNS Control, if a tool/item cannot
      be found during inventory.
      1.6.2. The responsible team shall initiate a Lost Tool Report (see Attachment 2) and
      route as shown therein. An initial search shall be completed within 4 hours on base or as
      soon as reasonable off base of discovering the item is missing, and subsequent initial
      notifications completed within 8 hours on base and as soon as reasonable off base of loss.
      The secondary search and secondary notifications shall be completed within 24 hours of
      loss whenever possible. Update TCMax or other AF approved system per provisions in
      AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.4.1.3, and associated ILs to reflect the current inventory status
      of the CTK if the tool cannot be immediately found and replace the tool as soon as
      possible to return the CTK to FMC status.
      1.6.3. QA will maintain completed reports for trend analysis.

       1.16.2. On site: After completion of site maintenance and prior to site departure, CTK
       inventories need to be re-accomplished. A different signature needs to be annotated on
       the CTK sign in sheet to close the kit. Example: the Team Chief inventories the CTK
       and signs it open prior to base departure. Prior to site departure a Team Member needs to
       accomplish the inventory and sign the CTK closed.
       1.16.3. Multiple sites: CTKs used on another site must be inventoried and signed open
       again prior to use on site. Upon completion of site maintenance, again someone other
       than the person who signed open the CTK must inventory and sign the kit closed prior to
       site departure.
       1.16.4. Tools transferred to another team in the field: Teams receiving CTKs in the field
       from another team must inventory and sign the kits open. Teams will not accept the
       CTKs or sign them open unless they have been signed closed by the transferring team.
       1.16.5. Return to base: Tool room technicians will receive and inventory the CTKs upon
       return to base in the TCMax program. Tools Room Technicians will immediately notify
