     containers or live munitions to non-Air Force entities for possession, management, and
     processing.
2. Customers and Users Responsibilities.
     2.1. Ensure all munitions residue is turned in to the Munitions Flight to include expended
     brass, links, expended smoke grenades, pull-pins, empty containers/boxes and packing
     material.
     2.2. Prior to turn in, ensure the following:
        2.2.1. Ensure that no live munitions are mixed with munitions residue.
        2.2.2. Segregate residue in separate containers (i.e., 5.56mm ball residue in one

        2.2.3. Ensure all containers (inner and outer) to include wooden and cardboard boxes
        remain serviceable for turn in to the Munitions Flight. All stripper clips, pins, and
        bandoleers, etc., will also be turned in.
        2.2.4. Ensure containers that are to be returned to the Munitions Flight are free of live
        munitions.
     2.3. Dud items will not be turned in to the Munitions Flight; appropriate emergency
     Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) procedures will apply.
     2.4. Contact the Munitions Flight to schedule an appointment for munitions residue/empty
     container return, 557-7137.
3. Munitions Flight Responsibilities.
     3.1. The Munitions Flight Chief will provide the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
     Disposition Services facility in writing a list of qualified munitions inspectors to
     certify/verify munitions residue which includes their name, rank, authorization to inspect,
     certify, and/or verify, and specimen signature of each inspector.
     3.2. The Munitions Flight Chief will ensure that only qualified/appointed munitions
     personnel are authorized to certify/verify and process any munitions residue to include small
     arms brass or empty munitions containers.
     3.3. The Munitions Flight Chief will periodically review the inspection procedures to ensure
