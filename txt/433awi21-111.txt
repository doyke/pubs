SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been formatted to comply with current publishing guidelines and to convert
the current MXG Operating Instruction (OI) into an AWI.
1. Definition. Cannibalization (CANN) is the authorized removal of an assembly or
subassembly from a weapon system, support system or equipment end item for installation on
another end item to satisfy an existing supply requisition and to meet priority mission
requirements with an obligation to replace the removed item.
2. Procedures.
   2.1. Individual Responsibilities.
2                                                              433AWI 21-111 25 JUNE 2014


       2.1.1. Verify part is required to meet mission commitments.
       2.1.2. Order the part and obtain a valid document number. Request status from
       Decentralized Material Support (DMS). If the status is zero balance, request CANN
       authorization from an approved CANN authority as identified on group level authority
       letter.
       2.1.3. Obtain a CANN number from the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and
       ensure removal actions are properly documented in accordance with TO 00-20-2,
       Maintenance Data Documentation. Notify MOC with the following information: From
       end item serial number, To end item serial number, and the document number. Ensure
       there are two entries made in the equipment forms: A Red X for the re-installation of the
       removed component and; A Diagonal for the removal action (to be signed off at the time
       of removal).
       2.1.4. Ensure that proper technical data procedures are followed and that all required
       circuit breakers, switches and aircraft systems have an AF Form 1492, Warning Tag,
       installed, if required.
       2.1.5. Shift maintenance supervision, through Plans, Scheduling and Documentation
       (PS&D) will determine what equipment to CANN from. After proper coordination direct
       the removal of the CANN component and its installation on the ‘receiving’ end item.
       Ensure all associated hardware is bagged and attached to the removed component’s
       location. If it is necessary to use hardware for the installation of a part /component,
       ensure the hardware is ordered and the equipment forms are annotated with a valid
       document number. Also ensure that associated hardware that cannot be reused (o-rings,
       seals, etc.) is on order and have a valid document number.
       2.1.6. Ensure Due-in-for-Maintenance (DIFM) assets are properly routed to supply, and
       ensure that proper documentation is made in donor and recipient end item forms for
       serially controlled parts.
    2.2. CANN authority responsibilities.
       2.2.1. Before authorizing a CANN action, ensure that the special certification roster
       reflects the inspection (INSP) course code “INSP 00159”. This course code will be used
       to monitor CANN authority levels for the maintenance group.
       2.2.2. Coordinate/obtain approval from the applicable squadron supervision prior to
       removal actions from external squadron sources, ISO/Refurb aircraft, flight line aircraft
       and equipment end items, i.e. engine or Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), and
       support systems assigned to the MXG.
       2.2.3. All CANN actions on Contract Field Team (CFT) aircraft will require
       approval/coordination through the MXG Quality Assurance office, 925-7858.
    2.3. MOC Responsibilities.
       2.3.1. Verify CANN approval with the most recent CANN authority letter.
       2.3.2. Create CANN action discrepancy in Core Automated Maintenance System
       (CAMS) for Mobility (G081) using program 9050, Input Aircraft Discrepancies, (for
       aircraft only).
433AWI 21-111 25 JUNE 2014                                                                 3


     2.3.3. Verify that item has been ordered and validate document number.
     2.3.4. Notify DMS of CANN action and provide all required information to
     update/change the supply request.
  2.4. DMS Responsibilities.
     2.4.1. Verify no on hand assets exist. (Check other sources, i.e. Tail Number Bin (TNB),
     bench stock, back shop, DIFM detail, and serviceable turn-in area).
     2.4.2. Notify appropriate agency of current status.
     2.4.3. Ensure document number “Mark For” is completed.
     2.4.4. Verify Mission Capability (MICAP) through Base Supply.
  2.5. In accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Air Force Reserve Command
  (AFRC) Sup 1, Aircraft Equipment and Maintenance Management, when a required part
  cannot be delivered and installed on time, the CANN authority may approve the CANN of
  parts before the initiation of CANN documentation (e.g., Red Ball maintenance).
