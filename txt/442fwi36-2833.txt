SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document replaces and substantially changes 442 FWI 91-302 and must be completely

submission process and submission deadline.
1. Objective: Safety awards are designed to honor and recognize individuals and units for

performers and encourage others to emulate their example on a calendar year basis.
Additionally, the safety awards program identifies wing-level nominees for higher headquarters
awards.
