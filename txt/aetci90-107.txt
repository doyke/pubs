                                            Chapter 1

                     CONTINUOUS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT (CPI)

1.1. Introduction to CPI. AETC process improvement shares the Air Force CPI model that
uses various methodologies, depending on the needs of the situation or problem under review.
Methodologies include problem solving, lean, business process reengineering, Six Sigma, and
theory of constraints. The phrase "CPI initiatives" encompasses all CPI, problem solving,
improvement and change activities conducted across AETC.
1.2. CPI Goals:
     1.2.1. Fundamentally change the culture of the Air Force so that Airmen understand their
     role in improving daily processes and eliminating wasted efforts that add no value to mission
     accomplishment.
     1.2.2. Instill a mindset of CPI and problem solving across the workforce.
     1.2.3. Provide an objective assessment of key Air Force processes and focus on using and
     applying CPI tools and techniques to promote process improvement, eliminate waste and
     create a feasible action plan.
1.3. AETC Goal. To create and sustain an environment of continuous improvement that
cascades from AETC/CC to every squadron, flight, and work center. Within this environment, all
AETC members must strive to integrate CPI into core missions, codify and implement standard
processes, eliminate duplication of effort or redundant resource use, and learn from others'
successes in order to achieve higher levels of productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010                                                                        5


                                            Chapter 2

                                  INSTRUCTION PURPOSE

2.1. CPI Mindset. USAF emphasis on implementing a culture of continuous process
improvement will generate numerous opportunities for change that require a governing directive.
AETC uses an all-encompassing program for CPI, which could include any number of process
improvement tools or methodologies, but primarily consists of problem solving, lean, business
process reengineering, Six Sigma and Theory of Constraints. Lean makes up roughly 80 percent
of the overall AETC CPI program.
2.2. Common Governance. The complexity of change requires the command provide a single,
unified governance process that eliminates redundancy in managing initiatives. This document
outlines the command's approach to continuous improvement that will integrate efforts from HQ
AETC across all NAFs, DRUs, FOAs and other organizations assigned or attached to AETC. A
command wide, enterprise-level, integrated approach will maximize efficiency across the
command, contribute to a culture of continuous improvement throughout the workforce and
develop our Airmen in a structured and consistent manner.
2.3. Resource Allocation. The process of prioritizing CPI initiatives for resource allocation and
redistribution requires consistent information and leadership insight.
2.4. Cultural Challenges. To achieve success, the command must overcome historic and
cultural challenges including:
   2.4.1. Failure to follow through to results.
   2.4.2. No accountability for initiative performance.
   2.4.3. No strategic alignment to leadership goals.
   2.4.4. Insufficient resources allocated for change initiatives.
   2.4.5. No middle-tier leadership involvement, enthusiasm or commitment to cultural change.
2.5. Results of an Effective Governance Process:
   2.5.1. Accountability. Clear accountability for specific objectives that affect command-
   wide performance.
   2.5.2. Control. Effective decision making at leadership levels to ensure appropriate
   emphasis and resource allocation are applied to priorities.
   2.5.3. Alignment. Sufficient senior leader insight into design and execution of initiatives to
   ensure alignment with command goals and objectives.
   2.5.4. Transparency. Ability to clearly see processes that steer the command to effectively
   perform the mission and clarify the command vision.
   2.5.5. Results. Fact-based, quantifiable data showing measured improvements, elimination
   of waste, tangible cost savings and/or cost avoidance.
   2.5.6. Benchmarks. Enable benchmark sharing, also referred to in this instruction as
   command standard processes, across all units and all levels within AETC by using a common
   process to identify, coordinate and communicate benchmark candidates.
 6                                                                 AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010

             PERFORMANCE, ALIGNMENT, INTEGRATION, INNOVATION

3.1. Performance. Accountable, measurable, continuously improving performance across the
command.
     3.1.1. Lead implementation of process improvement techniques end-to-end.
     3.1.2. Set tangible performance targets for cost, schedule, and performance. Measure, report,
     compare, and reward results.
     3.1.3. Create an environment that inspires trust, teamwork, and continuous improvement.
3.2. Alignment. Link to, and alignment with, AETC core, enabling, and governing processes
and process owners, as depicted on the AETC strategy map. In particular, initiatives must align
with AETC perspectives and objectives.
3.3. Integration. Process improvement initiatives should be directed at closing performance
gaps depicted on strategy maps across the command, thereby enabling one enterprise to recruit,
train and educate America’s Airmen.
3.4. Innovation. Ability to innovate is essential in order to keep pace with warfighting
requirements, leverage new technologies and improve AETC recruit, train and educate support
processes. Effective use of CPI gives AETC the ability, through innovation, to implement the
best practices in recruiting, training and educating.
AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010                                                                        7


                                          Chapter 4

       INTEGRATED CPI AND STRATEGY MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT

4.1. Air Force Objectives. The Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff defined the
following CPI objectives, which in part form the basis for the AETC/CC intent:
   4.1.1. Provide a standard Air Force approach to continuously improve all processes that
   affect the Air Force ability to deliver required effects.
   4.1.2. Develop a culture that promotes elimination of waste, best practice sharing of and
   cycle time reduction across all products and services. Involve all Airmen in the relentless
   pursuit of excellence.
   4.1.3. Ensure all Airmen understand their role in saving resources and eliminating waste,
   develop the ability to effect change, and continuously learn new ways to improve daily
   activity processes.
4.2. Integration and Role of the Strategy Map.
   4.2.1. AETC uses the strategy map as a tool to develop and drive command strategy, which
   includes specific objectives, measures and initiatives targeted to address gaps in performance
   or other problem areas. Figure 4.1 visually illustrates the AETC integration philosophy. Also,
   see steps 1 through 4 in paragraphs 4.2.1.1 through 4.2.1.4.
      4.2.1.1. Step 1. Apply challenging, stretch goals to strategic measures to identify
      performance gaps during periodic reviews.
      4.2.1.2. Step 2. Use CPI (lean) principles to find the root cause and help develop the
      countermeasures to find the best solution (most effective and efficient).
      4.2.1.3. Step 3. Align resource prioritization processes with desired strategic objective
      outcomes.
      4.2.1.4. Step 4. Use strategy reviews to track and report results of countermeasures.
      Measure the success, and then standardize the success.

Figure 4.1. AETC CPI and Strategy Management Integration.




     4.2.2. The strategy map serves as a pointing mechanism for command improvement
     opportunities. AETC will use CPI tools and prioritize improvement efforts to address
     strategy map performance gaps.
4.3. CPI Desired Effects. The Air Force defined five desired effects that organizations should
target and strive to achieve:
     4.3.1. Productivity. Increase the productivity of our most valued resource: people.
     4.3.2. Asset Availability. Significantly increase critical asset availability rates.
     4.3.3. Agility. Improve response time and decision-making agility.
     4.3.4. Safety and Reliability. Sustain safe and reliable operations.
     4.3.5. Energy. Improve energy efficiency.
4.4. AETC/CC Support. AETC/CC fully supports all CPI desired effects. With regard to
recruiting, training and educating America’s Airmen, AETC strives for effectiveness and
efficiency. Directors and CCs at all levels are responsible for measurable performance
improvements. It is the responsibility of all AETC Airmen to improve the way they work.

   initiatives visible across the command, initiate policy changes through the appropriate HQ
   AETC directorate to codify and lead cross implementation of those improvements and/or
   command standard processes.
   5.4.4. Review initiatives conducted by other major commands (MAJCOM) to select those
   with potential application within AETC. Maintain a process to push information to AETC
   directorates, NAFs and wings.
   5.4.5. Lead selected enterprise-level CPI efforts. Provide qualified facilitators to address
   enterprise improvement opportunities identified by the AETC/CC.
   5.4.6. Maintain open communication channels and conduct regular meetings with CPI and
   strategy development points of contact (POC) across the command.
   5.4.7. Maintain and update AETC CPI CoP.
   5.4.8. Plan, schedule, coordinate and administer an annual CPI program management review
   (PMR). Program managers from across the command will be invited to review the previous
   year's command process improvement efforts and performance. Chair the PMR; publish an
   agenda, and post read-ahead and follow-up material as necessary on the AETC Process
   Improvement Office CoP.
   5.4.9. Serve as the AETC single focal point for all activities associated with CPI efforts. The
   Secretary of the Air Force Undersecretary Chief Management Officer (SAF/USM) will work
   all CPI issues through HQ AETC. AETC organization representatives will work exclusively
   through their chain of command to HQ AETC/CCO.
   5.4.10. Establish business rules to prevent duplication of effort and/or redundant resource
   commitment.
   5.4.11. Develop and oversee execution of the command CPI maturity matrix model.
   5.4.12. Develop and oversee execution of the command annual improvement plan (AIP).
   5.4.13. Develop and oversee execution of the command CPI facilitator training tracker.
   5.4.14. Provide status of maturity matrix, AIP and facilitator certification progress to
   AETC/CC during quarterly strategy reviews. Note: HQ AETC/CCO is not the approval
   authority for CC or director measures of performance (MOP).
   5.4.15. Provide CC, headquarters staff and field organizations with change management
   (CM) guidance.
   5.4.16. Develop CM tools, techniques and processes; publish guidance to enable AETC
   organizations to manage change initiatives.
   5.4.17. Facilitate rapid dissemination of best practices and lessons learned.
   5.4.18. Provide green belt and 8-step problem solving training as required.
5.5. All AETC Organizations (Assigned and Attached):
   5.5.1. Directors, NAF/CCs and wing/CCs will establish their CPI execution intent. This
   includes strategy development and execution, as well as implementation of CPI initiatives. In
   addition, wing CCs establish an executive council (EC) (see AFSO21 Playbook) or use an
   existing corporate structure to govern and lead integrated CPI and strategic planning efforts.
AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010                                                                     11


  The EC will provide CPI and strategic planning governance and leadership. At wing level,
  the EC integrates CPI and strategic planning activities and oversees development and
  implementation of CPI initiatives. The wing CC or CV chairs the wing EC, which is at
  minimum composed of the wing CC and/or vice CC and group CCs.
  5.5.2. Establish an integrated capability to lead and execute a CPI program that complies
  with the command program; develop and execute a strategy aligned with command strategy;
  and plan, conduct, implement and sustain CPI initiatives.
     5.5.2.1. HQ AETC/CCO provides CPI expertise, but CPI is a commander program.
     Commanders establish integrated capability on their respective staffs.
     5.5.2.2. For the purposes of this instruction, AU is considered a NAF equivalent. AU
     centers are considered wing equivalents. Policy guidance directed at AETC wings also
     applies to AU centers. Schools reporting to AU centers are considered group equivalents.
  5.5.3. Implement a CPI organizational structure that takes advantage of organizational
  synergies and potential efficiencies.
  5.5.4. Dedicate an appropriate number of personnel to CPI duties. The AFSO21 Playbook
  provides a guideline to help commanders determine the proper balance and synergy between
  dedicated staffing and organizational structure.
  5.5.5. Wing CCs establish an EC, as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook, or use an existing
  corporate structure to govern and lead integrated CPI and strategic planning efforts. The
  purpose of the EC is to provide governance and leadership to CPI and strategic planning
  efforts within the organization. At wing level, the EC integrates CPI and strategic planning
  activities and oversees development and implementation of CPI initiatives; typically focuses
  on specific CPI activities and strategy execution; is chaired by the CC or CV; and at
  minimum is composed of the CC and/or CV and group CCs.
  5.5.6. Conduct maturity assessments using the AETC CPI assessment scorecard. The
  scorecard,     available     on    the    HQ      AETC/CCO        CPI     SharePoint     site
  (https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/cc/afso21.aspx) functions as a self-inspection tool for directors
  and commanders to measure an organization’s progress in implementing and sustaining CPI.
  E-mail results through the appropriate chain of command to HQ AETC/CCO at
  afso21.workflow@randolph.af.mil, and the SharePoint site.
  5.5.7. Develop and execute an annual improvement plan (AIP). An AIP (template available
  on the CPI SharePoint site) is an organization’s prioritized list of strategically aligned
  process improvement efforts. HQ AETC/CCO tracks and reports each organization’s top
  three process improvement efforts (PIE) from the AIP. E-mail results through the chain of
  command to HQ AETC/CCO and the SharePoint site.
  5.5.8. Ensure adequate number of green belt and black belt facilitators. Certification
  requirements are listed in Chapter 8. E-mail progress reports, using the facilitator
  certification tracker, through the chain of command to HQ AETC/CCO workflow and
  SharePoint site.
  5.5.9. To request CPI facilitator support, complete AETC Form 94, Facilitator Work
  Request, located on the e-Publishing site, and submit it to the HQ AETC/CCO workflow E-
  mail address. For more information, contact HQ AETC/CCO.

   command sponsored CPI meetings. Ensure all communication with HQ AETC/CCO,
   including MOP updates, is coordinated through the NAF.
   5.6.9. Integrate CPI strategies across respective organizations.
AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010                                                                         13


                                           Chapter 6

                           CPI PROCESSES AND OPERATIONS

6.1. Categories of Initiatives. A CPI initiative typically focuses on saving time, money, or
other resources, or on improving performance and/or product quality, or on eliminating waste
and/or nonvalue-added activities. Typical CPI initiatives are:
   6.1.1. Just Do It (JDI). Small, common-sense improvements over which the implementing
   office has complete control. JDIs are also quick fixes of processes and products identified
   during CPI events and completed during the event week or as quickly as possible afterward.
   They are part of the CPI process and results are captured as part of the overall execution and
   sustainment of an entire CPI event, but they are not typically staffed or tracked. JDIs would
   not count toward facilitator certification requirements.
   6.1.2. Rapid Improvement Event (RIE). Short-term, high intensity effort to address a
   specific problem. The focus is typically in a dedicated 3- to 5-day session, though preparation
   normally begins several weeks in advance and followup continues after. An RIE generally
   follows a structured, systematic approach to identifying and eliminating waste by developing
   baseline performance measures, current and future state maps, key metrics, an action plan,
   and other deliverables. RIEs are sometimes identified during value stream mapping or
   enterprise value stream mapping.
   6.1.3. Improvement or Change Project. Longer term improvement events involving
   processes that are large in scope or complexity and could require application of CPI tools
   such as Six Sigma, business process reengineering, and Theory of Constraints.
6.2. Sources of CPI Initiatives:
   6.2.1. Strategy Driven. Initiatives that directly contribute to achieving a strategic objective
   or closing performance gaps on the command, directorate, NAF, or wing strategy map.
   6.2.2. Process and Operations. Initiatives that improve command processes or operations.
   6.2.3. CC/Director or Leadership Insight. Initiatives directed by the commander/director
   as a result of leadership insight into performance issues or required changes.
6.3. Plan, Conduct, Implement, Sustain Model. The process for planning a CPI initiative,
conducting the CPI event, executing through to completion, and implementing and reporting
results should follow a standard, consistent process throughout the command, although the nature
of the initiative and source will cause the initiative to follow different paths as appropriate.
   6.3.1. Plan. The directorate, NAF, or wing CPI office is the focal point for all CPI
   initiatives conducted across the unit, and for managing the portfolio of initiatives. Individual
   organizations and process owners are responsible for identifying improvement opportunities,
   developing those opportunities into specific improvement initiatives, executing those
   initiatives, and following up in a spirit of continuous process improvement. Once an
   improvement opportunity or initiative is identified, the responsible organization takes these
   actions:
       6.3.1.1. Check the CPI management tool (MT) database or other known sources for a
       similar improvement initiative conducted in AETC or the Air Force.
14                                                                AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010


     6.3.1.2. If a similar improvement initiative exists, determine feasibility to adapt results to
     shape the planned initiative or possibly rescore the planned initiative based on the work
     already accomplished.
     6.3.1.3. Complete the charter template/worksheet. See Attachment 2. The charter
     completely defines the improvement initiative and establishes scope and responsibility.
     The template/worksheet includes all requirements specified in the AFSO21 Playbook and
     establishes additional AETC requirements for signatures of those who own the process
     and lead the improvement event. Key leader signatures are critical to agreement and
     overall understanding, commitment and accountability. The charter format may differ
     from that shown in Attachment 2, as long as all information is addressed. Additionally,
     the first three blocks of the report (prepared on and briefed from a ledger/tabloid size
     sheet called the A3) can substitute for the charter template. See Attachment 3 for general
     information and specific examples of how the A3 is used.
  6.3.2. Conduct. The responsible organization or process owner works with the directorate,
  NAF, or wing CPI office or HQ AETC/CCO as necessary to obtain facilitation support and
  conduct the improvement event. For many CPI events, the responsible office or process
  owner conducts the event using internal resources once adequate numbers of facilitators
  become available.
     6.3.2.1. The AFSO21 Playbook outlines a standard improvement event approach
     modeled after a systematic problem solving methodology.
     6.3.2.2. Solving day-to-day work area problems, regardless of organizational level, goes
     to the heart of CPI efforts. Problems equal improvement opportunities. This proven,
     systematic problem-solving model serves as the foundation for all lean, Six Sigma,
     Theory of Constraints and other Air Force CPI initiatives. See Attachment 3 for more
     information on these steps.
         6.3.2.2.1. Step 1. Clarify and validate the problem.
         6.3.2.2.2. Step 2. Break down the problem and identify performance gaps.
         6.3.2.2.3. Step 3. Set improvement target.
         6.3.2.2.4. Step 4. Determine root causes.
         6.3.2.2.5. Step 5. Develop countermeasures.
         6.3.2.2.6. Step 6. See countermeasures through.
         6.3.2.2.7. Step 7. Confirm results and process.
         6.3.2.2.8. Step 8. Standardize successful processes.
  6.3.3. Implement:
     6.3.3.1. At the conclusion of the CPI event, the facilitator, working with the process
     owner completes an A3 report, as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook. See Attachment 3.
     Other documentation typically required at the conclusion of an event includes an outbrief
     to the process owner and champion, implementation action plan, value stream or process
     maps, and any other documentation deemed appropriate or dictated by the event. The
     facilitator or responsible organization enters the final A3 report and all other
AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010                                                                        15


      documentation (or links to documentation) into the continuous process improvement
      management tool (CPI-MT), accessible on the CPI CoP.
      6.3.3.2. The champion and/or process owner takes responsibility for implementing action
      items reported from the improvement event.
   6.3.4. Sustain. The directorate, NAF, or wing CPI office establishes a reporting process
   (typically at the 30-, 60-, and 90-day, 6-month, and 12-month points) for the champion
   and/or process owner to monitor improvement plan execution, and measure and record
   results in CPI-MT.
      6.3.4.1. The implementing office reports results on selected initiatives to the directorate,
      NAF, or wing CPI office, based on agreements made during or immediately after the
      improvement event or project. Otherwise, the implementing office tracks results and
      reports to the process owner. Results could include one or more of the items in
      paragraphs 6.3.4.1.1 through 6.3.4.1.6, or other results captured by the implementing
      office.
          6.3.4.1.1. Improvement objectives achieved and/or not achieved.
          6.3.4.1.2. Return on investment.
          6.3.4.1.3. Cycle time reduction.
          6.3.4.1.4. Direct and/or indirect cost savings.
          6.3.4.1.5. Personnel savings.
          6.3.4.1.6. Tangible and/or intangible results affecting one or more of the five CPI
          desired effects.
      6.3.4.2. The directorate, NAF, or wing CPI office will follow up on selected initiatives
      with the event owner 30, 60, and 90 days, and 6 and 12 months after implementation to
      ensure the improvement is being sustained. The directorate, NAF, or wing CPI office
      determines the follow up time frame. A key area to examine during follow-up is whether
      the improved process caused unintended consequences (i.e., transfer or increase of
      nonvalue-added work to another process). Unintended consequences are not always
      immediately apparent.
      6.3.4.3. Process owners identify one or more key measures, preferably during the actual
      improvement event, to help ensure newly improved processes remain under control and
      on track. The directorate, NAF, or wing CPI office can help establish measures and
      control systems for newly improved processes.
6.4. Command Standard Processes. Selected improvements have potential application across
AETC.
   6.4.1. The directorate, NAF, or wing CPI office identifies selected improvements that have
   potential command-wide application, and during the annual PMR, works through HQ
   AETC/CCO to share the improvements. Directorate, NAF, or wing CPI offices can report
   improvements with command-wide applications at any time via the command CPI workflow
   E-mail.
 16                                                              AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010


   6.4.2. HQ AETC/CCO will sponsor an annual PMR to review and select AETC benchmarks
   as candidates for replication across the command.
   6.4.3. HQ AETC/CCO staffs potential command standard processes through the appropriate
   HQ AETC functional directorate for consideration and approval.
6.5. Process Owners. Closely manage changes to ensure strategic alignment with command,
NAF, directorate, and wing strategy maps and organizational commitment, and identify and
address barriers to successful implementation.
   6.5.1. Standard processes outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook and this instruction incorporate
   change management practices at every level. For example, the process of developing the
   event charter clearly defines the initiative, change, or problem solving activity for all
   involved up and down the chain of command, facilitating leadership alignment.
   6.5.2. Bringing the right subject matter experts together to analyze the problem and
   formulate implementation action plans capitalizes on clear and open communication, and
   involves the right people in order to facilitate follow through.
   6.5.3. CPI initiative scope and complexity will dictate the level of effort required when
   identifying subject matter experts, whether planning a simple meeting during which the
   process owner and team lead select participants or comprehensive stakeholder analysis that
   may include a voice of the customer analysis.
   6.5.4. Standard A3 reporting and out brief processes serve to keep everyone involved with
   the improvement informed on progress and the way ahead. The AETC CM Process
   complements the AFSO21 Playbook by providing expanded definitions and a reference to an
   automated tool with templates and tutorials to help develop and execute change management
   strategies. (See Attachment 4.)
   6.5.5. If implementing an initiative that requires a change or waiver to a governing directive
   or instruction, the change/waiver request will be submitted through the appropriate functional
   channel for approval. The SAF/USM administrative guidance memorandum may be attached
   to the waiver package. It is accessible on the HQ AETC/CCO SharePoint site.
AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010                                                                      17

    CONTINUOUS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT MANAGEMENT TOOL (CPI-MT)

7.1. CPI-MT. CPI-MT is a tool to enable leaders to oversee their initiatives in a single
integrated platform, and ensure strategy alignment, maintain visibility and drive productivity
7.2. Purpose:
   7.2.1. Serve as the central repository for project management, reports and queries.
   7.2.2. Provide real time project status, documents, issues, and metrics visibility.
   7.2.3. Help execute projects to completion.
   7.2.4. Facilitate team collaboration.
   7.2.5. Support tracking/monitoring using portfolios and dashboards.
   7.2.6. Reduce E-mail chains and manual status reporting.
7.3. Point of Contact Procedures. Each directorate, NAF, or wing CPI office will assign one
primary and one alternate CPI-MT POC to be responsible for overall CPI-MT issues within their
organizations. POCs will develop local plans to enter all approved current and ongoing projects.
7.4. Roles and Responsibilities. CPI-MT rights and privileges are associated with assigned
roles and groups. Users are assigned to one or more roles and/or groups based on the tasks they
perform in CPI-MT. Note: Some CPI-MT roles and groups have the same names as formal CPI
roles (for example, process owner/champion), but actual CPI-MT tasks may differ and require
delegation to other users.
   7.4.1. Generally, users are not assigned to a specific CPI-MT role or group. They maintain
   their CPI-MT profile (contact information and preferences) and may search and view
   everything in the database except metrics.
   7.4.2. Team members have the same rights as general users, and may use CPI-MT
   discussions, issues and taskings to collaborate on projects to which they are assigned. They
   may also view, add or edit documents and view metrics and status reports for their assigned
   projects.
   7.4.3. Team leads have the same rights as team members, for the projects to which they are
   assigned, and may enter information into CPI-MT. They may create or modify charters,
   create or manage projects, add or remove team members, update metrics (performance and
   operational) and request permission to proceed to the next project phase (gate approval) if
   required. Note: Team leaders are responsible for the accuracy of data loaded into CPI-MT.
   7.4.4. Process owners and champions have the same rights as team leaders, and may
   approve/reject requests to proceed to the next project phase (gate).
   7.4.5. Financial representatives currently have the same rights as team members, and may
   validate and lock performance tracking (financial) metrics. This role is under review based
   on efforts to import applicable data from the financial reporting template into CPI-MT.
 18                                                                AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010


   7.4.6. Work tree administrators (WTA) may create or modify the work tree structure. They
   may edit and move projects within their respective branch of the work tree, invite new users,
   assign users rights and privileges, edit user profiles, and delete users. They also perform
   database quality control with respect to work tree issues (i.e., project location, user accounts,
   etc.). WTAs are not responsible for the accuracy of data associated with individual projects,
   such as planned or actual milestone dates, metrics, etc.
   7.4.7. Master process officers (certification group members) update user certification status.
   HQ AETC/CCO is the master process officer for AETC personnel.
7.5. Content Organization. Projects are organized in CPI-MT under a work tree (a hierarchic
structure, much like the Windows® file system). The root directory, CPI Projects, contains two
branches: Air Force Key Processes and Air Force Organization Type and Location. AETC is
under Air Force Organization Type and Location, and is further divided into branches for each
major installation. HQ AETC/CCO will create branches for additional organizations as
necessary.
   7.5.1. HQ AETC/CCO has appointed a primary and an alternate WTA for AETC and will
   appoint additional WTAs as needed for subordinate work tree branches.
   7.5.2. Users create and maintain AETC AFSO21 projects in the appropriate AETC work tree
   branch. AETC AFOS21 projects will not appear above the AETC subordinate branch work
   tree level without approval of the AETC WTA.
7.6. Account and Documentation Procedures. Facilitators and team leads should ensure
appropriate members of a project team have a CPI-MT account established in order to participate
in the collaborative environment. All significant documents related to a project will be posted in
CPI-MT. At minimum, post deliverables for the project; including the charter, event agenda,
event out brief, A3 report, value stream maps, action and/or implementation plan, financial
reporting template and any other documents deemed necessary or potentially helpful from a
lessons learned or historical perspective.
   7.6.1. CPI-MT users may use their common access card (CAC) to register at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afso21prod/AFSO21/Home.page.
   7.6.2. Self-registered users who require access rights other than search/view should E-mail
   the HQ AETC AFSO21 workflow account.

                            TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION

8.1. HQ AETC/CCO. HQ AETC/CCO is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
various levels of training and certification throughout AETC.
   8.1.1. 8-Step Problem Solving Training. Basic CPI training and an overview of the
   concepts, benefits, principles, and expected outcomes associated with CPI. Although CPI
   involves various methodologies, the 8-step training focuses on the Air Force 8-step problem
   solving process and a standard approach to lean, which is a business philosophy advocating
   cutting waste from processes.
   8.1.2. Green Belt Training. Applied process improvement training in a classroom
   environment; includes group dynamics and facilitation skills. Certification also requires
   candidates to observe, co-lead and lead three CPI process improvement/problem solving
   events, and teach one awareness course. An individual certified at Green Belt or above can
   also conduct ongoing awareness training.
   8.1.3. Black Belt Training. Advanced process improvement methodologies, group
   dynamics, facilitation, and process engineering training in a classroom environment followed
   by participation and application of skills in a series of lean, process reengineering or other
   CPI improvement events or projects in more than one CPI methodology, with one or more
   events at a cross-functional or enterprise-wide level. Green Belt certification is a prerequisite
   for Black Belt Training. The Department of Defense (DoD) course, sponsored by
   SAF/USMS, satisfies Black Belt certification requirements.
   8.1.4. Master Black Belt Training. Consists of additional experience of up to 20 process
   improvement events or projects in more than one process improvement methodology done
   primarily at a cross-functional or enterprise-wide level, in addition to classroom training as
   necessary to satisfy knowledge and skill requirements. Black Belt certification is a
   prerequisite for Master Black Belt training. The Department of Defense (DoD) course,
   sponsored by SAF/USMS, satisfies Master Black Belt certification requirements.
   8.1.5. Senior Leader and Executive Training. SAF/USMS sponsors senior leader
   (colonels, GS-15 and equivalents, and chief master sergeants) and executive (general officers
   and senior executive service personnel) training at various times throughout the year. The
   senior leader course is scheduled through HQ AETC/CCO. The executive course is
   scheduled through the Air Force Senior Executive Management Office.
8.2. SAF/USMS. Establishes standards for CPI education and training course material and

8.5. Green Belt Training/Certification.
   8.5.1. Only approved trainers may teach the Green Belt course. Organizations may approve
   and maintain a pool of certified trainers as determined by the needs of the organization. At
   minimum, trainers must be Black Belt certified (or in training to become Black Belt) and
   possess teaching competencies (ability to communicate effectively, desire to teach, etc.). CPI
   offices shall periodically monitor Green Belt training classes to ensure consistency and
   adherence to standards.
   8.5.2. Directorate, NAF, and wing CPI offices schedule and conduct Green Belt courses to
   meet organizational needs. Key considerations include the ability of the organization to
   certify students in the prescribed timeframe and the number of students requiring training
   and/or coaching/mentoring. If open seats exist for a class, directorates, NAFs, and wings
   should contact HQ AETC/CCO to allow students from other locations to fill the seats.
   8.5.3. Trainers use only SAF/USMS-approved training material located at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?filter=OO-TR-AF-43.
   Additional locally developed material may supplement or augment the Green Belt course as
   long as SAF/USMS approved material is taught in its entirety.
   8.5.4. After each Green Belt class, directorate, NAF, and wing CPI offices update CPI-MT
   for students who successfully completed the class.
   8.5.5. Directorates, NAFs, and wings assign a coach/mentor to each Green Belt trainee to
   mentor students through the certification process. Coaches/mentors must either be certified
   Black Belts or SAF/USMS Black Belt program candidates. Coaches/mentors should strive to
   ensure students receive as much practical experience as possible to build on the material
   taught in the Green Belt course, including observing events conducted by experienced
   facilitators.
   8.5.6. Directorates, NAFs, and wings ensure students complete all certification requirements.
   All CPI events performed by Green Belt candidates must appear in CPI-MT. HQ
   AETC/CCO will generate certificates of completion and forward certificates to directorate,
   NAF and wing CPI offices along with a notification letter from AETC/CV to the appropriate
   commander or director. Note: HQ AETC/CCO will manage the training program for HQ
   AETC, including determining needs, scheduling classes, filling student quotas, assigning
   coaches/mentors, and tracking student certification progress, until each director has the in
   house ability to manage this program.
8.6. Black Belt Training/Certification:
   8.6.1. Black Belt training and certification is managed at SAF/USMS.
   8.6.2. Directorates, NAFs, and wings will submit training requirements and candidates'
   names to HQ AETC/CCO. Candidates' organizations are normally responsible for travel
   costs associated with training.
   8.6.3. HQ AETC/CCO manages command training allocations and forwards candidates'
   names to SAF/USMS.
 22                                                               AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010


   8.6.4. Directorate, NAF, and wing CPI offices work with AETC/CCO to assign a qualified
   Black Belt coach/mentor to each student. Ideally, coaches/mentors and students reside at the
   same location to minimize travel costs and enable greater interaction.
   8.6.5. Coaches/mentors monitor student progress and periodically update the directorate,
   NAF or wing CPI office and CPI-MT. All CPI events performed by Black Belt candidates
   must appear in CPI-MT.
8.7. Master Black Belt Training/Certification:
   8.7.1. Master Black Belt training and certification is managed at SAF/USMS.
   8.7.2. HQ AETC/CCO will identify training requirements and the names of candidates. The
   candidate’s organization is normally responsible for all travel costs associated with training.
   8.7.3. HQ AETC/CCO manages command training allocations and forwards candidates'
   names to SAF/USMS.
   8.7.4. HQ AETC/CCO will assign a qualified Master Black Belt coach/mentor to each
   student. Ideally, coaches/mentors and students reside at the same location to minimize travel
   costs and enable greater interaction.
   8.7.5. Coaches/mentors monitor student progress and periodically update the HQ
   AETC/CCO and CPI-MT. All CPI events performed by Master Black Belt candidates must
   appear in CPI-MT.
AETCI90-107 17 MAY 2010                                                                  23

               CHANGE MANAGEMENT (CM) CONCEPTS AND TOOLS

A4.1. CM. CM is a planned and systematic process of continuously aligning and improving an
organization’s people, structure, and culture to meet organizational strategy. Its purpose is to
help organizations initiate, accept, adapt to, and ultimately integrate changes to improve
productivity and customer support. CM strategies are normally determined by the scope and size
of the change initiative, and the priority senior management places on the initiative. The AETC
CM Process provides a structured, consistent approach for change initiative teams responsible
for building and executing effective CM strategies.
A4.2. Objectives:
   A4.2.1. Minimize disruption often associated with the impact of change, while increasing
   the pace, improving implementation efficiency, and allowing the organization to focus on
   continued growth.
   A4.2.2. Build ownership and commitment to change, enhanced capability to support
   envisioned changes, and an organizational environment that makes changes work.
   A4.2.3. Ensure leadership alignment and commitment, communication and organizational
   buy-in, effective workforce training and education, and sustainability to anchor change into
   the organization’s systems and structures.
   A4.2.4. Anticipate and address potential obstacles to implementing change initiatives.
A4.3. Method. The AETC method describes five essential elements for successfully
implementing change: leadership mobilization and alignment, assessing and managing readiness
and risk, communicating and engaging with stakeholders, preparing and equipping the
workforce, and institutionalizing the change. These elements can be performed in a sequential
process, where one builds upon the results of the previous element, or they can be performed
individually, depending on the size and scope of the change initiative. Table A4.1 shows the
critical success factors for each of the elements. For instructions on completing steps associated
with      each    element,     go    to    the   AFMC        Change     Management      CoP     at
