(ADDED) (MOUNTAINAFB)AFI 48-148, 12 October 2001, is supplemented as follows.
This supplement provides specific requirements for the protection of Mountain Home AFB
(MHAFB) personnel and their dependents from ionizing radiation. It implements the ALARA
concept for potential exposures to ionizing radiation, (e.g., RAM, or radiation producing devices
(RPD), etc.) at MHAFB. This instruction applies only to ionizing radiation; it does not apply to
non-ionizing radiation such as lasers or radar. This instruction does not apply to exposures of
personnel to ionizing radiation resulting from the employment of nuclear or thermonuclear
weapons in combat. Maintain records prescribed by processes in this publication according to
AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of them according to the Air Force (AF)
Records Disposition Schedule located at the AF Portal link for the AF Records Information
Management System. Contact supporting records managers as required. Refer recommended
changes and questions regarding this publication to the office of primary responsibility using AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, route AF Forms 847 through the base
publications and forms manager.

Summary of Changes

(ADDED) (MOUNTAINHOME)Updated office symbols from 3666 ADS/SGGB to 366
AMDS/SGPB. Updated paragraphs 2.15.1.1 and 2.15.4.1. for clarification. Reference paragraph
5.3.1.4., added policy update information regarding Radon assessment at MHAFB.
1.1.1. (Added) This instruction provides specific policy, instruction and guidance for the
protection of MHAFB personnel and their dependents from sources of ionizing radiation.

1.2.1. The requirements of this supplement are intended to protect airmen, civilians, and
contractors supporting the 366th Fighter Wing (366 FW) mission, on MHAFB as well as their
dependents, or members of the general public present on MHAFB.
1.3.3. (Added) Limit ionizing radiation exposure on MHAFB to levels that are ALARA.
1.7.1.1. (Added) Interventions will only be performed on MHAFB if all other viable solutions
have been explored and considered. Furthermore, they will only be done under the guidance,
permission and supervision of MHAFB RSO.
2.10.1. 366 FW/CC (Commander) will designate, in writing, a qualified individual to be
installation RSO, as appropriate.
2.11.1.1. (Added) MHAFB RSO will be a Bioenvironmental Engineer (43E3A), or a
Bioenvironmental Engineering Craftsman (4B071/91).
2.15.1.1. (Added) Will provide consultant support to the installation commander on radiation
protection issues, and keep 366 FW and group commanders informed about radiation health and
safety issues and effectiveness of measures to control ionizing radiation hazards through
briefings at the quarterly Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) Council
meetings. Annual review of the ionizing radiation safety program will be conducted in an ESOH
Council meeting, preferably during the second quarter meeting.
2.15.2.1. (Added) MHAFB RSO, or his designee, will ensure all personnel enrolled on the
MHAFB Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeter (TLD) program will receive annual ALARA and
workplace-specific training.
2.15.2.2. (Added) MHAFB RSO will establish and manage the base radiation safety program to
include the following activities: review of procedures and practices, facility design review and
classification, training, exposure control activities and monitoring and surveillance activities.
2.15.4.1. (Added) Radon monitoring is no longer required on MHAFB since the base was
classified as "low risk" by the Air Force Radon Assessment and Mitigation Program (RAMP) in
1988. Documentation of this study and the results can be obtained from the 366th Aerospace
Medicine Squadron, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) (366 AMDS/SGPB).
2.18.7.1. (Added) Notify MHAFB RSO of potential violations of this instruction, of unsafe
work practices involving radiation sources, or of accidents or incidents involving radiation.
3.1.2.2.1. (Added) Radiation procedures and instructions will be reviewed by 366
AMDS/SGPB during regular workplace occupational health assessments (annually, or every 2
years). Unit RSOs should ensure they are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.
3.2.1.3. 1 (Added) The 366th Civil Engineer Squadron (366 CES) will notify 366 AMDS/SGPB
when facility design reviews are conducted to ensure appropriate radiation safety features are
incorporated.
3.3.1. General: MHAFB personnel (military, civilians and in-house contractors) who have the
potential to be occupationally exposed to 10 percent of the annual dose limits (i.e., those enrolled
in the MHAFB TLD Program) will receive initial and annual training that is appropriate in
breadth and depth to the radiation hazards present in the workplace. Training will be workplace
specific. Training may include other populations based on the judgment of the MHAFB RSO.

3.3.2.1. (Added) MHAFB RSO will review all ALARA and workplace-specific training plans
initially and whenever changes to the training are made.
3.3.2.2. (Added) MHAFB RSO will assist in the development ALARA and workplace-specific
training plans when requested.
3.3.3.1. (Added) 366 AMDS/SGPB will keep training plans and sign-in sheets in the case files
for no less than 3 years.
3.4.3.1. (Added) Levels established by MHAFB RSO are: investigative level: 50 mrem per
month, and abnormal exposure level: 600 mrem a year.
3.5.5.1.1. MHAFB RSO will maintain applicable SDRD Forms 1527-1 in the 366 AMDS/SGPB
office in the "TLD Binder" for 5 years.
3.6.3.1. 366 AMDS/SGPB will maintain survey results in the appropriate case file for no less
than 3 years (refer to Attachment 8 (Added), Distribution and Filing of SDRD Forms 1527-1).
5.2.2. 1 (Added) MHAFB RSO will assess public exposures generated from activities on
MHAFB which use or produce ionizing radiation. These assessments will be done initially when
an activity is started, and when it is changed in such a way that radiation exposures to the public
are expected to differ from the initial assessment. 366 AMDS/SGPB will maintain record of
these assessments in the appropriate case file for no less than 3 years.
5.3.1. RAMP rated MHAFB as low risk, therefore, further radon monitoring is not required.
5.3.1.4. (Added) The policy update from HQ AF/SGOP, dated 9 Mar 2005, states the technical
information provided during the RAMP program is still accurate.
