This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-21, Utilization and
Classification of Air Force Military Personnel. It implements classification procedures and
related actions for Air Force officers and enlisted. It develops the classification system that
identifies required qualifications for every specialty in the Air Force—the officer structure is
found in the Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) and the enlisted structure is
found in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). This instruction applies to
RegAF, Air Force Reserve (AFR) and the Air National Guard (ANG) personnel, except where
noted otherwise. In collaboration with the Chief of Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE) and the
Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower,
Personnel, and Services (HQ USAF/A1) develops personnel policy for Classification of
Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). This Air Force Instruction (AFI) may be supplemented at any
level; all MAJCOM level supplements must be approved by the Human Resource Management
Strategic Board (HSB) prior to certification and approval. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the OPR using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; Route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate chain of

                                            Chapter 1

     CLASSIFICATION OBJECTIVE, CONCEPT, TENETS, RESPONSIBILITIES,
                          AND STRUCTURE

1.1. Overview. The military personnel classification system identifies duties and tasks for every
position needed to accomplish the Air Force mission. The system is designed to identify
qualifications and abilities necessary to accomplish these duties and tasks, as well as provide
clear and visible career progression patterns. It links duties and tasks into cohesive job clusters
that are used to match personnel requirements with personal aptitudes, attributes, and
qualifications. The classification system also provides concise award, upgrade, and retention
criteria for career progression.
1.2. Classification Concepts and Tenets:
   1.2.1. Functional Grouping Concept. The classification system groups related work
   requirements (positions) into Air Force Specialties (AFS). Positions are grouped on
   similarity of functions and requirements for knowledge, education, training, experience,
   ability, and other common criteria. AFSs are further combined into broader and more
   general functional categories called career fields. This functional grouping provides a
   classification and utilization system that:
       1.2.1.1. Remains stable regardless of organizational structure changes.
       1.2.1.2. Provides a framework to procure, train, and develop specialized and broadly
       experienced personnel.
       1.2.1.3. Easily adapts and responds to changes in Air Force skill requirements.
       1.2.1.4. Supports utilization and other personnel program needs.
   1.2.2. Practical Specialization Concept. AFS qualifications are listed in paragraph 3 of each
   specialty description in the Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) and the Air
   Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). Qualifications include knowledge,
   education, training, experience, and other factors. These are defined as mandatory or
   desirable for each skill level. While no one person is likely to perform all functions of an
   AFS at any one time, individuals can be developed to perform all duties and responsibilities
   of the various duty positions within an AFS at different times throughout a career. When
   individuals meet all of the mandatory qualifications of the specialty and have shown skill
   level qualification in all tasks of the positions in which assigned, they are considered
   qualified for award of the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).
   1.2.3. The following are the basic tenets of the classification structure:
       1.2.3.1. The classification system is established to identify requirements and identify the
       personnel qualified to fill those requirements.
       1.2.3.2. Design AFSCs which make sense in the objective Air Force structure.
       1.2.3.3. Use simple, clear, logical groupings.
       1.2.3.4. Provide visible AFSC qualification/skill levels for officer and enlisted personnel.
 6                                                                      AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


        1.2.3.5. Maintain the ability to identify career fields, specialties, subspecialties, and skill
        levels.
        1.2.3.6. Maintain the ability to identify special job requirements and positions, special
        duty identifiers (SDI), reporting identifiers (RI), and special experience identifiers (SEI).
        1.2.3.7. Eliminate redundant identifiers. Do not duplicate other Military Personnel Data
        System (MilPDS) identifiers.
        1.2.3.8. Group AFSCs functionally.
        1.2.3.9. Maintain a balance of specialist versus generalist specialties to allow maximum
        efficiency and equity in assignment and promotion opportunities.
        1.2.3.10. Do not proliferate small population specialties that adversely limit the ability to
        effectively manage the resource.
        1.2.3.11. Specialty description (contained in the respective AFOCD and AFECD) for
        each occupational grouping will contain general occupational information (what most of
        the people do most of the time) and quantify the minimum requirements necessary to
        reasonably predict success in the specialty.
        1.2.3.12. Specialty description is broad in scope to adequately portray all skill levels
        represented by the description and will not contain a grade requirement.
        1.2.3.13. Grade requirements are determined by manpower, in conjunction with the Air
        Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).
        1.2.3.14. Specialty description format is standardized to maintain simplicity, clarity, and
        ease of publishing.
        1.2.3.15. Specialty descriptions are generally no more than 2 pages in length (may
        exceed this length to include shredout descriptions, when needed).
        1.2.3.16. Staff each requested change to the classification system with all impacted
        agencies using the provisions of the Career Field Managers’ Guide available at
        https://gum-
        crm.csd.disa.mil/app/login/redirect/home/session/L3NpZC9ZZnhLQms3bA==.

       1.3.2.11. Attend functionally oriented workshops, conferences, meetings, etc. to provide
       expertise on classification matters and advises on known or potential impact resulting
       from specialty restructuring actions.
       1.3.2.12. Review, coordinate and approve/disapprove requests for RegAF officer and
       enlisted Airman AFSC withdrawal (disqualification). Update awarded AFSCs, special
       duty and reporting identifiers on disqualified airmen. Respond to requests to change
       disqualified airmen reporting identifiers, as needed.
       1.3.2.13. Approve/disapprove RegAF SEI withdrawals/removals.
       1.3.2.14. Ensure minimum specialty requirements are adhered to according to the
       AFOCD and AFECD.
    1.3.3. The Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG) shall recommend to HQ USAF/A1 medical
    exceptions to classification policies and procedures for officer and enlisted personnel.
    1.3.4. The Commander and Supervisor shall: Assign personnel to authorized positions
    consistent with requirements, Airman’s grade, and skill/qualification level. Initiate or review
    and evaluate job proficiency and skill qualifications of each Airman. Limit the use of
    enlisted Airmen outside their CAFSC. Comply with criteria outlined in paragraph 3.34 when
    using enlisted Airmen outside their CAFSC. Use the following source documents to award,
    upgrade, downgrade, and withdraw Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC), Special Duty
    Identifiers (SDI), Reporting Identifiers (RI), and Special Experience Identifiers (SEI):
       1.3.4.1. AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action, or
       1.3.4.2. Case Management System (CMS) or AFPC generated action, or

    military personnel classification system outlined in this AFI, Officer and Enlisted
    Classification Directories and manpower directives.
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                          9


   1.3.7. The Individual shall gain and maintain specialty qualifications for awarded AFSC(s).
   Since individual effort is directly related to career progression, it is incumbent on the Airman
   to develop professionally and keep abreast of specialty knowledge and proficiency standards.
   Several programs blend specialty training with academic pursuits to enable or enhance career
   progression. These include career development courses, advanced specialty training,
   supplemental training, on-the-job training and accredited education.
   1.3.8. The Career Field, MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM) and NGB/AFR Career Field
   Manager (CFM) shall provide technical assistance in developing career field structures and
   classification identifiers. AFCFMs develop (in coordination with MFMs and NGB/AFR
   CFMs) specialty descriptions, specialty prerequisites, and qualifications. AFCFMs provide
   waiver recommendations for mandatory AFSC requirements to waiver authority (see Table
   3.1 and Table 3.2). NGB/AFR CFMs have enlisted waiver authority commensurate with the
   AFCFMs as stated in Table 3.2.) AFCFMs also:
       1.3.8.1. Keep specialty descriptions current,
       1.3.8.2. Initiate or coordinate on new and proposed classification changes,
       1.3.8.3. Resolve all non-concurrences before submitting new classification changes to
       HQ AFPC/DPSIC, Air Force Military Classification Development for formal
       coordination and implementation consideration.
       1.3.8.4. Publicize approved classification changes to commanders, MFMs, NGB/AFR
       CFMs, and affected Airmen within their functional communities.
1.4. Classification Structure. The classification structure consists of AFSCs, Prefixes,
Suffixes, SDIs, RIs, and SEIs. The backbone of the system is the AFSC consisting of four
(officer) or five (enlisted) characters and may include a prefix or suffix (shredout). Table 1.1.
and Table 1.2. outline the AFSC structure and define each character position within the AFSC.
Complete descriptions, to include authorized codes, title, summary, duties and responsibilities,
qualifications, and suffixes/shred outs (if applicable) are contained in the respective AFOCD and
AFECD available on the World Wide Web at

that position of the AFSC. For example, X12XX denotes all 12 AFSCs, to include all utilization
fields, prefixes, qualification levels, and suffixes.
2. In addition, not all positions above wing level qualify for the staff AFSC. For those positions
above wing level, Manpower will use the staff AFSC requirements for determining applicability:
Staff Air Force Specialty Code—Identifies an officer position above wing level specifically on
the duty requirements of the role performed, not the fact that the authorization is on a staff above
wing level. Use staff AFSCs (XXX4) to identify planning and policy-making positions above
wing level. It requires the same skills as those for the qualified AFSC (XXX3), but applied to
developing broad policies, plans, and procedures. Management responsibility increases without
a corresponding increase in knowledge of the technical aspects of the function. Officers
filling/have filled such positions are awarded the staff AFSC.

                                             Chapter 2

                                 INITIAL CLASSIFICATION

2.1. Classifying Newly Accessed Officers:
   2.1.1. Newly Commissioned Line Officers. The various Sources of Commission (SOC),
   e.g., United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), Officer Training School (OTS), Air Force
   Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) and the Academy of Military Science (ANG)
   will select and designate candidates for flying using the following reporting identifiers: 92T0
   (pilot trainee); 92T1 (navigator/CSO trainee); 92T2 (Air Battle Manager [ABM]; and, 92T3
   (remotely piloted aircraft [RPA] pilot trainee). When these RegAF individuals complete
   training, the MPS will award the appropriate entry-level AFSC. All other newly
   commissioned RegAF officers will be classified by HQ AFPC/DPSIP, Officer Accession
   Branch. AFR and ANG MPSs classify newly commissioned officers at their permanent duty
   station (PDS).
       2.1.1.1. HQ AFPC/DPSIP uses the AFPC Initial Classification model (computer
       application) results to identify, sort and prioritize AFSCs for each ROTC and USAFA
       cadet using the individual AFSC requirements contained in the AFOCD specialty
       descriptions as eligibility criteria. Individual qualifications, eligibility, cadet preferences,
       commander’s recommendation, and Air Force requirements are used as model inputs.
       Air Force requirements have the highest priority. Individual qualifications include
       education, physical qualifications (as determined in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations
       and Standards), training, experience and class ranking within the respective SOC. The
       model is the final AFSC classification solution for cadets.
       2.1.1.2. Following initial classification, changes in AFSC may take place due to medical
       disqualification for the AFSC, individual inability to qualify for associated Personnel
       Reliability Program (PRP) requirements, or other reasons. Notification of the need to
       change AFSCs based on these categories will be provided to AFPC/DPSIP for
       reclassification consideration.
       2.1.1.3. Requests for reclassification prior to attending Initial Skills Training may be
       addressed to AFPC/DPSIP for initial review. AF/A1P is the approval/disapproval
       authority.
   2.1.2. Newly Commissioned Non-Line Officers and Line of the Air Force Judge Advocates
   will be classified by their respective accession authorities as referenced in paragraphs 3.19.,
   3.20., and 3.21
   2.1.3. Air Reserve Component (ARC) line officers returned to extended active duty (EAD)
   in accordance with AFI 36-2008, Voluntary Extended Active Duty (EAD) for Air Reserve
   Commissioned Officers. Reclassification is not required upon accession. MilPDS will reflect
   the AFSC contained on the EAD orders issued by HQ AFPC/DPSIPR, Officer Voluntary
   Return to EAD (Recall) Section.
2.2. Classifying Non-Prior Service (NPS) Enlistees. 2 AF/Det 1 classifies non-prior service
RegAF enlistees before they depart from Basic Military Training and reclassifies those
eliminated from initial skills training but retained in the Air Force. AFR and ANG MPSs will
 14                                                                  AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


classify all RC NPS enlistees at their PDS and, if needed, reclassify those eliminated from initial
skills training. Process waivers of mandatory entry requirements according to paragraph 3.7 and
use Table 3.2. to determine waiver authority and processing instructions.
   2.2.1. Guaranteed Training Enlistment Program (GTEP). Prior to reserving a GTEP
   allocation, Recruiting Service will ensure applicant meets all mandatory qualifications for
   entry into the AFSC. Process waivers according to paragraph 3.7 and use Table 3.2. to
   determine waiver authority and processing instructions.
   2.2.2. Aptitude Index (AI). Applicants are guaranteed training in one of four aptitude areas:
   Administrative, Electronic, General, or Mechanical. They will be assigned a specific job
   during basic training. AFSC classification of enlistees with an AI is determined by 2AF
   TTOC/Det1/POBB, using MilPDS TTMS-JM to validate individuals meet mandatory
   qualifications for entry. Classification is based on individual’s initial enlistment contract,
   needs of the Air Force and personal preference. An AI enlistee may request release from his
   or her enlistment contract to volunteer for announced priority requirements. Det 1/POBB is
   the approval authority for these requests. Normally, an individual may select as many as ten
   AFSC preferences from available openings, provided they are qualified for each.
   2.2.3. The Detachment screens applicants who enlist for training and initial assignment in
   specific AFSCs to ensure enlistees meet qualifications. Unless disqualified for their
   guaranteed job, GTEP enlistees will be classified into their GTEP AFSC. They may request
   a release to volunteer for announced requirements. Det 1/POBB is the approval authority for
   these requests.
   2.2.4. Non-United States Citizens (excluding United States Nationals). Non-United States
   citizens are restricted from classification in any specialty listed in the AFECD (Attachment 4,
   Additional Mandatory Requirements for AFSC Entry) as not open to Non-United States
   citizens.
   2.2.5. Disenrolled Cadets. The USAFA or HQ AFROTC, in conjunction with HQ AETC,
   Student Resources Divisions, and HQ AFPC/DPSIPE, Enlisted Accessions Branch, classify
   disenrolled prior service and non-prior service cadets (see AFI 36-2012, Record of
   Disenrollment from Officer Candidate-Type Training--DD Form 785). Consider the
   following in the order presented:
       2.2.5.1. College graduates. If Air Force requirements permit, college graduates are
       classified consistent with their academic background.
       2.2.5.2. Needs of the Air Force.
       2.2.5.3. Personal qualifications such as education, job experience, vocations or hobbies,
       physical condition, and eligibility for security clearance.
       2.2.5.4. Individual Preference. Normally, an individual may select as many as eight
       AFSC preferences, provided the individual is qualified for each.
2.3. Classifying Prior Service Enlistees. HQ United States Air Force Recruiting Service
(USAFRS) and HQ AFPC/DPSIPE, jointly classify prior service RegAF enlisted Airmen. They
determine if the individual remains qualified for the AFSC possessed when separated using the
specialty description in the AFECD. Minimum aptitude requirements do not apply for
previously held AFSCs. ANG and AFR units will classify all prior service enlistees and evaluate
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                        15


the member’s prior AFSCs, skills and experience for waiver to NGB/AFR CFM for re-award of
AFSC.
   2.3.1. HQ USAFRS and HQ AFPC/DPSIPE award former enlisted personnel the AFSC
   possessed at the time of separation, unless downgrade or withdrawal procedures in paragraph
   4.1 apply. The control AFSC (CAFSC) is the AFSC in which the airman enlisted. Award
   AFSCs at the 3-skill level or lower to enlistees from other services that, on separation, held
   specialties convertible to Air Force skills. AFCFMs determine authorized conversions from
   other Service classification identifiers to AFSCs for the convertible skills list in the AFECD.
   2.3.2. Former Air Force personnel in technical training are awarded the 1-skill level AFSC
   in the specialty they are enrolled in at technical training as their CAFSC. Their former
   enlisted AFSC is assigned as the primary AFSC (PAFSC). Award AFSC at the 3-skill level
   or lower to personnel who hold a convertible skill earned in another service as a PAFSC.
2.4. Classifying Former Air Force Officers: For RegAF, HQ AFPC/DPSIPE (for RC airmen,
the AFR/ANG MPS) will:
   2.4.1. Help them determine what enlisted AFSCs they qualify for (AFPC will base AFSC
   selection on prior experience and training).
   2.4.2. Classify them before they enlist, when possible.
   2.4.3. Award AFSCs or SDIs and accurately record qualifications at the proper skill level.
   After initial classification, normal AFSC skill upgrade requirements apply.
   2.4.4. Use the following steps to classify former officers:      (NOTE:      Do not alter the
   sequence.)
      2.4.4.1. Schedule applicants who do not have Mechanical, Administrative, General, or
      Electronics (MAGE) scores to take the Armed Forces Classification Test.
      2.4.4.2. Verify the enlisted AFSCs previously held by the applicant by ensuring they
      meet the mandatory specialty qualifications in the AFECD. Apply downgrading and
      withdrawing provisions specified in paragraph 4.1. Award previously held AFSCs, at the
      proper skill levels, to qualified applicants. Use applicants in their previous enlisted
      AFSCs when it meets the needs of the Air Force (see paragraphs 2.4.4.3 and 2.4.5).
      2.4.4.3. When they do not qualify for or cannot be used in a previously held AFSC,
      award an enlisted AFSC closely related to their officer AFSC if they meet specialty
      qualifications in the AFECD.
          2.4.4.3.1. Use a technical advisor who is proficient in the requested AFSC to review
          the officer’s records (including technical knowledge requirements) to determine the
          appropriate AFSC and skill level.
          2.4.4.3.2. Award AFSCs at the 3-skill level unless the technical advisor recommends,
          in writing, awarding the 5-skill level. Determine whether or not to award an AFSC
          above the 5skill level after having been assigned in the AFSC at the permanent duty
          location. The supervisor, after evaluating the experience and training, may
          recommend awarding the 7skill level.
          2.4.4.3.3. If supported, the supervisor will submit a written evaluation with
          supporting documentation showing the qualifications to HQ AFPC/DPSIC (for
 16                                                                AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


           RegAF airmen) or NGB/AFR CFM (for RC airmen as designated in Table 3.2.) for
           review.     After HQ AFPC/DPSIC review, forward to the AFCFM for
           recommendation. HQ AFPC/DPSIC (or NGB/AFR CFM IAW authorities in AFI 36-
           2101, Table 3.2.) will approve or disapprove the request.
   2.4.5. If an AFSC is not awarded under paragraphs 2.4.4.2 or 2.4.4.3, the MPS, will award
   an AFSC at the 1-skill level after completing the following process:
       2.4.5.1. RegAF applicant go to the On Line Retraining Advisory, located on the vMPF
       site, to select up to five AFSCs, SDIs, or RIs, from those listed as shortages. For
       AFR/ANG, while AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, applies, applicants must
       contact a reserve component recruiter specific to the vacancies.
           2.4.5.1.1. Former officers must meet the mandatory qualifications listed for the
           specialties chosen (refer to the AFECD). If additional tests are required, administer
           them. If waivers are necessary, use Table 3.2, and Table 3.3
           2.4.5.1.2. For RegAF, former officers may select an AFSC, SDI, or RI; however, in
           addition to meeting mandatory specialty qualifications, the former officer must meet
           assignment criteria outlined in AFI 36-2110, Assignments. Reserve members must
           meet the criteria in AFI 36-2115, Selected Reserve Assignments. For ANG, see
           ANGI 36-2101, Assignments within the Air National Guard.
       2.4.5.2. Advise HQ AFPC/DPSIPE of the RegAF applicant’s choices. DPSIPE will,
       using AFI 36-2626, the AFECD and this AFI, classify the applicant and notify the MPS.
       For AFR/ANG, while AFI 36-2626 applies, applicants must contact a reserve component
       recruiter specific to the vacancies.
   2.4.6. AFSC, SDI, or RI for which they are found qualified will be designated as awarded
   AFSCs, SDIs, and RIs. It is important to accurately record AFSC qualification at the proper
   skill level because of promotion impacts and the possibility that future Air Force needs may
   dictate assignment into an awarded specialty.
2.5. Initial Skills Training Eliminees. RegAF Line Officer initial skills training eliminees on
extended active duty, whether elimination was self-initiated or not, and whether before or after
training commences (to include initial training declination), will be considered for
reclassification contingent on current AF requirements.          AF/A1PT will provide HQ
AFPC/DPSIP all AF Specialty Codes (AFSC) open to receive eliminees, based on projected
requirements and sustainment. A panel of five field grade officers (primarily O-6’s) will be
convened to review elimination packages and make recommendations for reclassification or
separation.
   2.5.1. Reclassification and Separation Authority. Commander, AFPC is the reclassification
   and separation authority for line officer initial skills training eliminees. Using a panel
   process, the commander will approve reclassification or separation of an officer; refer a case
   to the officer’s command for processing under AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge
   Procedures for Commissioned Officers; or forward the case to the Secretary of the Air
   Force’s Personnel Council (SAFPC) for action.
   2.5.2. Panel Members. The panel will review the elimination package using the whole
   person concept to determine if the officer will be reclassified. Panel members will consider
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                         17


   an officer’s potential to develop and contribute in subject career field. Consider degree,
   special coursework, commander’s assessment and officer’s preferences.                The final
   determination must meet the needs of the AF and the officer’s ability to meet or exceed those
   needs. Panel members must comply with panel procedures. AF/A1PT provides
   reclassification requirements to AFPC. Exceptions must be coordinated with AF/A1PT. If
   qualified, officers must be placed in the most critical AFSCs first, to include reclassification
   into another rated AFSC.
       2.5.2.1. Panel members will use careful consideration when reviewing/scoring each
       package. Officers not selected for reclassification via this panel will be separated and
       recoupment of educational costs is a real possibility.
2.6. Strength Aptitude Test (SAT). The mandatory strength standards required for entry into
all enlisted career fields are shown in the AFECD, Attachment 4, Additional Mandatory
Requirements for AFSC Entry.
2.7. Determining the Initial CAFSC. The MPS, will use Table 2.1 to determine initial
classification; Table 3.10 to determine the CAFSC for airmen in training status; and Table 3.11
to determine the CAFSC as a result of assigning or withdrawing awarded AFSCs.
2.8. Determining Officer Core Identifier (Core ID) (RegAF only). HQ AFPC Officer
assignment teams are responsible for managing and periodically auditing Core IDs for lieutenant
colonels and below; except for The Judge Advocate General’s Corps officers, who are managed
by HQ USAF/JAX.
   2.8.1. The officer Core ID is initially based on the AFSC into which the member is classified
   at the time of accession into EAD, approved retraining or approved for Competitive Category
   Transfer in accordance with (IAW) AFI 36-2106, Competitive Category Transfers. For
   officers accessed to EAD under a Voluntary Return to Active Duty (AD) Program, the Core
   ID will match the critical AFSC for which they were approved to return to AD IAW AFI 36-
   2008.
   2.8.2. The Core ID for all line officers will be first three digits of the AFSC an officer was
   originally accessed into EAD, retrained or approved for a category transfer.
   2.8.3. Once a Core ID is established, it cannot be changed unless the officer formally applies
   and is approved to retrain, is designated for involuntary cross flow (IAW AFI 36-2626) or is
   approved to transfer to another competitive category IAW AFI 36-2106. The assignment
   team accepting the retrainee or Competitive Category Transfer Airman is responsible for
   updating the new Core ID. The MPS will make corrections to the officer’s PAFSC/2AFSC
   as determined by this instruction.

               CLASSIFICATION ACTIONS AT BASE OF ASSIGNMENT

3.1. Designating a Primary AFSC (PAFSC). The MPS is responsible for designating the
PAFSC for each officer and enlisted Airman. It will be the AFSC, SDI or RI in which the
individual is most qualified to perform duty. Use the following factors, in the order presented, to
determine the PAFSC:
   3.1.1. Skill/qualification level. Usually, the AFSC denoting an individual’s highest level of
   skill/qualification will be designated as the PAFSC. Award of higher skill levels (enlisted) or
   qualification level (officer) is contingent on meeting the qualifications outlined in paragraph
   3 of the appropriate specialty description contained in the AFOCD/AFECD.
   3.1.2. Experience. Length and recency of experience will be considered.              Length of
   experience can include comparable military or civilian experience.
   3.1.3. Complexity of the specialty. Specialties requiring a comparatively high degree of
   knowledge and responsibility will be given preference over the less complex, consistent with
   experience.
   3.1.4. Amount of formal education and training. The extent of an individual’s formal
   education and training that led to specialty qualification will be considered.
   3.1.5. Currency of Equipment.         Qualification on state-of-the-art equipment will be
   considered.
   3.1.6. Desires and interests of the individual.
3.2. Designating Other Classification Identifiers:
   3.2.1. MPS awards AFSCs, SDIs, or RIs representing additional qualifications, in the order
   of best qualification as second (2AFSC), third (3AFSC), and fourth (4AFSC) (enlisted only).
   Feeder AFSCs are retained according to paragraph 3.32
   3.2.2. AFSCs, RIs, or SDIs showing additional qualifications beyond those identified in para
   3.2.1 will not be designated. There are no provisions to retain more AFSCs, RIs, or SDIs
   than are available in the MilPDS.
   3.2.3. Rated officers will possess a PAFSC, 2AFSC, or 3AFSC denoting best aircrew
   qualification. "Best aircrew qualification" means aircrew AFSC 11XX, 12XX, 13BX and
   18XX with suffix for aircraft type, including "other."
   3.2.4. Designating SEIs. Designate (award) all SEIs for which qualified.
3.3. Designating a Duty AFSC (DAFSC). A DAFSC, including prefixes, suffixes, and skill
levels, must match the authorized unit manpower document (UMD) position. An officer's
DAFSC must match an awarded AFSC, either entry, qualified, or staff, except for the officer’s
qualification level. For example, an entry level (38P1) personnel officer assigned to a position
with the qualified (38P3) AFSC will have the 38P3 DAFSC. Do not change authorized AFSCs
on manning documents to match the qualification level of the officer. The DAFSC for enlisted
personnel must match the CAFSC (except for skill level, if necessary) unless the enlisted Airman
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                          19


is on temporary duty (TDY) outside the CAFSC. (Reference paragraph 3.34 for duty out of
CAFSC restrictions and time limits.)
   3.3.1. Officers will not be assigned duty in an AFSC in which they are not expected to
   progress to the qualified level, except for emergency short term manning requirements.
   3.3.2. Officer DAFSC changes must be approved by both the losing and gaining AFPC
   assignment managers. For ANG and AFR officers, approval authority is the respective
   ANG/AFR CFM if an Authorization Change Request (ACR) is being completed.
   3.3.3.

Table 3.7. provides DAFSC criteria for officer students.
   3.3.4. If the authorized position does not accurately identify the duties being performed, the
   unit commander requests Force Support Squadron manpower personnel conduct a position
   analysis. The MPS corrects the DAFSC retroactively if the analysis results in a change to the
   UMD.
   3.3.5. The duty title will describe the actual job and the level of responsibility of the
   individual. As such, it will not mirror the AFSC specialty description title in the
   AFOCD/AFECD, respectively. Using AFSC 38P3 for example, you would not have an
   officer’s duty title read “Personnel Officer, Qualified” since by describing the role being
   performed it would be more descriptive to have Chief, Manpower and Personnel Flight,
   Chief, Services Flight, Operations Officer, etc.
   3.3.6. An officer appointed as a section commander may be awarded the C-prefix only when
   the officer so appointed is assigned to a valid C38P3Q UMD authorization and meets the
   eligibility requirements for award in the AFOCD. For units not qualifying for a full-time
   section commander authorization, officers may be appointed as the section commander and
   will remain in their current AFSC without the C-prefix. In this case, officers will use the
   duty title “section commander” only when performing duties requiring command authority.
   In all cases, an officer’s performance as section commander will be evaluated and recorded
   under the provisions of AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems.
3.4. Awarding Special Duty Identifiers (SDI). SDIs are awarded to denote qualifications the
same way AFSCs are awarded. The AFOCD and AFECD specify SDI qualifications. AFPC
approves award of RegAF officer SDIs according to Table 3.6, enlisted SDIs according to Table
3.8, and withdraws SDIs according to the appropriate subparagraph in paragraph 4.1 Airmen
performing additional duty SDI roles will not be awarded the SDI. For example, Airmen
performing “USAF Honor Guard” responsibilities as an additional duty will not be awarded SDI
85G0 or 8G000. As such, their DAFSC must not reflect 85G0 or 8G000. Individuals must fill a
valid 85G0 or 8G000 UMD authorization for award of either of these SDIs. Similarly, part-time
First Sergeants will not be awarded SEI 8F000.
3.5. Awarding or Designating Reporting Identifiers (RI). RIs are established primarily to
identify conditions or jobs where a specific specialty description is not practical, such as general
officer (9G000), wing commander (91W0), chief master sergeant of the Air Force (9C000),
student, patient, prisoner, disqualified airman, etc. RIs are awarded or designated to denote
qualification or to report a condition the same way AFSCs are awarded. MPSs will award or
designate RIs as defined in the AFOCD/AFECD and according to Table 3.6, Table 3.7, and
 20                                                                  AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


Table 3.8 except for wounded warrior and disqualified airmen RIs. Enlisted personnel released
from an RI, without an awarded AFSC, will have their RI withdrawn (not retained in RI,
regardless of reason) according to the appropriate subparagraph in paragraph 4.1 Consider return
to a prior AFSC, if practical, IAW para 4.3.1.2.3.4. If not, designate as a disqualified airman and
review for retraining consideration pursuant AFIs 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program or
separation IAW 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen.
3.6. Reinstating an AFSC, SDI, or RI and Associated SEIs. AFSCs, SDIs, or RIs and
associated SEIs withdrawn using appropriate authority can be reinstated by the AFCFM (or
NGB/AFR CFM) if the original reason for withdrawal no longer exists. Reinstatement must be
requested by the individual, in writing (memorandum format), endorsed by the individual's
supervisor and commander, and forwarded by e-mail (digitally signed and encrypted) to the
MPS. The MPS will ensure each request is fully documented and forwarded to HQ
AFPC/DPSIC by e-mail/CMS for RegAF Airmen. The reinstatement request must outline the
circumstances leading to AFSC withdrawal, what has changed since the withdrawal, and
justification for AFSC, RI, or SDI and/or SEI reinstatement. Requests must be justified and
include supporting document(s). HQ AFPC/DPSIC will coordinate with the appropriate
AFCFM, approve/disapprove the request, and notify the MPS. The MPS will notify the
individual requesting the reinstatement, and the individual’s parent unit. If approved for
reinstatement, DPSIC will award the AFSC at the skill level designated by the AFCFM.
   3.6.1. Reinstatement request for AFR members will be documented as above and the MPS
   will forward the reinstatement request electronically to HQ AFRC/A1KK for processing to
   AFR CFM for approval/disapproval. HQ AFRC/A1KK will notify the MPS of the AFR
   CFM’s decision. The MPS will notify the individual requesting the reinstatement and the
   individual’s unit. If approved for reinstatement, MPS will award the AFSC at the skill level
   designated by the AFR/CFM.
   3.6.2. Reinstatement request for ANG members will be documented as above and the MPS
   will forward the reinstatement request electronically to the ANG Classification Waivers CoP
   for processing to NGB/CFM for approval/disapproval. NGB/CFM will notify the MPS of
   the decision. The MPS will notify the individual requesting the reinstatement and the
   individual’s unit. If approved for reinstatement, MPS will award the AFSC at the skill level
   designated by the NGB/CFM.
3.7. Waiving Mandatory Requirements. Mandatory requirements for awarding AFSCs may
be waived in extremely rare instances for individuals possessing exceptional qualifications
determined to be equivalent to the mandatory requirements. Approval authority and procedures
to request classification waivers are outlined below in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 A waiver request
must start with the individual or the individual’s immediate supervisor. Waiver requests must be
fully justified and documented. Only requests that are recommended for approval will be
forwarded to the next review level (see paragraph 3.7.5, Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 for processing
instructions). NOTE: Procedures to request waivers pertaining to on-the-job training (OJT)
time-in-training for AFSC upgrade are contained Table 3.4., below.
   3.7.1. Experience: Consider waivers for individuals who have had experience in a closely
   related AFS, or who have had civilian experience considered a counterpart of the specialty
   being considered. The length of like civilian or related experience must equal the time
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                       21


  required for upgrade to the appropriate skill level (for enlisted) or the qualified level (XXX3
  for officers) in the AFSC.
  3.7.2. Training: Consider waivers of training (formal, Career Development Course (CDC),
  etc.) for individuals who have performed exceptionally well in the specialty over an extended
  period or have gained the required knowledge through other avenues.
  3.7.3. Minimum Aptitude Scores for Retraining (Enlisted). Waiver requests must explain
  why waiver of the mandatory aptitude score is in the best interest of the AF and not simply to
  allow retraining for the individual. Consider requests for individuals who have a sustained
  record of outstanding performance and identify the specific rationale for supporting the
  waiver. Commanders will screen each waiver and only forward those justified and
  recommended for approval.
  3.7.4. Other Mandatory Requirements. Waiver requests must be justified and documented.
  Use Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 to determine approval authorities for waivers of mandatory
  requirements. Forward officer medical, legal, and chaplain waivers as follows:
     3.7.4.1. Medical Officers (AFSCs 4XXX): MAJCOM to HQ AFPC/DPANF, 550 C

1. The MPS will ensure individual requesting the waiver includes the rationale, using official
memorandum format, why the waiver is warranted and includes supporting documentation, (i.e.,
transcripts, training records, performance reports, test results, letters of recommendation, medical
evaluations, or other documents justifying request).
2. Follow the processing guidelines established in paragraphs 3.7.5.
3. Before approving training/qualification waivers for RegAF enlisted Airmen with approved
retraining class quotas, coordinate with HQ AFPC/DPTOT. For RC airmen, the MPS will
contact NGB/A1DC or AFRC/A1KK, respectively.
4. Prior to processing a waiver request, commanders must ensure trainees have completed all
subject and task knowledge requirements as identified by the supervisor. Refer to the applicable
AFSC specialty description to identify specific mandatory requirements for award.
5. A copy of the waiver decision is forwarded to the AFCFM (or NGB/AFR CFM, as
appropriate).

6. Waiver authority equivalent to that of the AFCFM is delegated to the headquarters level Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command CFMs for their Reserve Component.
Exception: AFSC 3E7XX and 4N0XXX waiver authority remains with AFCFM.
7. Waiver authority for two time CDC failures will not be further delegated. The Fire Protection
Career Field (3E7XX) and Aerospace Medical Service (4N0XXX) CDCs are part of a National
Certification and Accreditation system. Unit and Base Education and Training Managers (for
locations not having a Base Training Manager, the senior training manager will fill this role)
must ensure waiver packages are properly documented and recommendations well justified.
8. Prerequisite AFSC requirements may be listed in the “experience” or “other” paragraph of the
specialty description. HQ AFPC/DPSIC will coordinate waivers with the AFCFM. ANG and
AFR enlisted requesting waiver under this rule will complete waiver requests IAW the
Classification Waiver Guide and send to NGB/AFR CFM for review and coordination. Waiver
packages will be forwarded to the approval authority (HQ AFPC/DPSIC) for coordination with
the AFCFM. Examples could be ASVAB, lift factor, PULHES, hearing, vision and any other
requirements not identified in rules 1 – 6, above.
   3.7.5. Processing Waiver Requests. Use Table 3.3 (Table 3.4. is for enlisted On-the-job-
   Training (OJT) time-in-training) to determine appropriate routing for waiver requests. The
   individual’s immediate supervisor or commander must decide when a waiver is appropriate.
   All waiver requests must be justified and include sufficient rationale or documentation for
   the next level of review to adequately and fairly determine disposition. Each level of review
   has the responsibility to use their best judgment of what is fair and equitable to the
   individual, and what is in the best interest of the Air Force. Return or disapprove cases
   lacking sufficient justification to warrant consideration.
NOTE: There are no provisions to award additional AFSCs solely to show future, potential, or
possible utilization. Return such requests without action and advise the Airman to apply for
formal retraining if they wish to pursue utilization in another specialty.

3.8. Converting to New or Revised AFS:
   3.8.1. Establishing a new AFS or revising existing ones usually requires changes to
   accession targets, training courses and requirements, initial and selective reenlistment bonus
   applicability, and manning documents as well as reevaluating entry, award, and retention
   qualification criterion. Conversion instructions for such changes will be published in the
   CS&CIG with each update to either the AFOCD or AFECD. The CS&CIG will specify the
   action(s) required by the MPS, AFPC, and Manpower.
   3.8.2. If a review and evaluation of individual’s qualification is required, e.g. an indirect
   conversion action, this must be accomplished as a pre-conversion action to ensure award of
   the AFSC(s) occurs immediately following the AFSC conversion effective date (see the
   applicable CS&CIG and AFSC Conversion PSD guide available on the AFPC myPers
   website, for detailed conversion instructions). Conversion actions must be completed
   immediately following the conversion effective date. However, in cases where the actions
   are not completed, MPSs are authorized to award AFSCs based on conversion instructions
   for up-to 30 days after the effective date.
   3.8.3. Conversion to new or revised AFS will be at a comparable skill level unless otherwise
   noted in the conversion guide instructions.
   3.8.4. During the initial conversion period and for up to 30 days after the effective date,
   testing and mandatory training, experience, and education may be waived for awarding new
   AFSCs unless otherwise specified in conversion guide instructions.
   3.8.5. When existing AFSCs are revised and new mandatory prerequisites are established,
   personnel will retain their awarded AFSC even if they no longer meet the newly established
   prerequisites, unless otherwise specified in the conversion guide instruction.
   3.8.6. MPS will make sure individuals are classified in accordance with conversion guide
   instructions. Technically qualified MPS personnel will assist in the conversion process. For
   indirect conversions, the senior functional for the AFSC(s) concerned or a MFM (NGB/AFR
   CFM) will assist in identifying the correct AFSC(s) from those listed in the conversion guide.
3.9. Changes in Mission, Weapon System, or Equipment. A change in basic mission,
weapon system, or equipment may require changes to authorized AFSCs and reevaluation of
training and individual qualifications for individual AFSCs. Conversion instructions for Airmen
affected by the change are developed by the local functional manager for the specialty in
coordination with the AFCFM.
   3.9.1. Conversion instructions will identify training requirements and skill level
   determination procedures for accomplishing the conversion, if required.
   3.9.2. MPS, with the help of the local functional representatives impacted by the conversion,
   will determine appropriate DAFSC, CAFSC, and awarded AFSCs according to the
   conversion instructions and update accordingly.
   3.9.3. Source documents for control and awarded AFSC updates resulting from an indirect
   AFSC conversion are the conversion RIP (generated by the MPS) or the AF Form 2096.
3.10. Using Suffixes. Suffixes identify positions related to particular equipment or functions
within an AFSC.
 30                                                                     AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


    3.10.1. Classification actions for suffixes are the same as those prescribed for AFSCs. When
    AFSC suffixes are awarded, they become an integral part of the AFSC.
    3.10.2. When enlisted Airmen are being retrained in a different AFSC, including a different
    suffix of an AFSC, the CAFSC is designated at the 1-skill level for the AFSC into which
    retraining (see Table 3.10., Rule 2).
    3.10.3. Besides being identified in paragraph 3 of the specialty description, AFSCs
    authorized for use without shreds are also identified in the AFOCD by a (+) preceding the
    AFSC number on the Officer Classification Structure Chart and in the AFECD by an (*)
    preceding the AFSC on the Enlisted Classification Structure Chart.
    3.10.4. Enlisted airmen awarded AFSCs authorized for use without shreds are considered
    proficient in the basic AFSC and may be used in either the shred or the basic AFSC.
    Example: An enlisted airman’s PAFSC is 1C551D. Because this AFSC is authorized to be
    used without the shred, the enlisted airman is considered qualified to work in either AFSC
    1C551 or 1C551D. Note: an airman with a PAFSC of 1C551 must meet the requirements for
    award of the 1C551D AFSC for award and utilization.
3.11. Using Prefixes. Prefixes are authorized for use with AFSCs when there is a need to
identify an ability or skill not restricted to a single utilization field or career field. A prefix used
with the appropriate AFSC identifies manning document position requirements and individuals
qualified to perform duty in the position.
    3.11.1. More than one prefix to the same specialty is authorized (for example, PAFSC
    T3S071 and 2AFSC W3S071). However, do not award multiple prefixes to the same AFSC
    if it results in deleting another AFSC qualification.
    3.11.2. Prefix award is managed using the guidance contained in Section I of the AFOCD or
    AFECD.
    3.11.3. Prefix withdrawal is managed using the same guidance as AFSC withdrawal.
    However, periods of nonperformance will not be used as a sole basis for withdrawing a
    prefix. Once awarded, prefixes will be retained as long as the AFSC is retained. If an AFSC
    is withdrawn, the prefix associated with the AFSC is also withdrawn. This includes the
    officer C prefix.
    3.11.4. When awarding officers prefix N or prefix P, an appropriate suffix, specified in the
    AFOCD Section I explanation for the applicable prefix, must be affixed to the AFSC.
3.12. Classifying Patients. Use RI 93P0 as the DAFSC for officer patients and RI 9P000 for
the DAFSC of enlisted patients hospitalized or expected to be hospitalized for 90 days or more.
Airmen will retain their CAFSC, PAFSC and other awarded AFSCs unless withdrawn according
to Chapter 4.
3.13. Managing Special Experience Identifiers (SEI):
    3.13.1. SEIs are established to identify special experience and training not otherwise
    identified within MilPDS. SEIs complement the assignment process, but are not substitutes
    for AFSCs, CEM codes, prefixes, suffixes, SDIs, RIs, or professional specialty course codes.
    They are established when identifying training, skills or experience as critical to the
    assignment match, or force management needs and no other identification is appropriate or
    available. SEIs can be used to rapidly identify an already experienced resource to meet
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                        31


  unique circumstances, contingency requirements or management needs. They provide a
  means to track individuals and identify positions requiring or providing unique experience or
  training that would otherwise be lost.
  3.13.2. Responsibilities. SEIs can be tied to the assignment process, as required, when
  specific experience requirements are justified for specific situations for assignment selection.
  As such, AFCFMs, MFMs, ANG/AFR CFMs, commanders, supervisors, AFPC assignment
  managers, and AFPC military classification personnel share responsibility for overall
  management of the SEI program.
     3.13.2.1. HQ AFPC/DPSIC establishes, revises, and deletes SEIs from the
     AFOCD/AFECD and MilPDS when requested by the AFCFM (or NGB/AFR CFM if
     RC-specific). The AFCFM, in conjunction with MAJCOM FMs and ANG/AFR CFMs
     are responsible for annually reviewing established SEIs to determine validity and
     usefulness (see AFOCD and AFECD for additional SEI information). DPSIC does not
     update SEIs for individual Airmen, but is the approval authority for all RegAF SEI
     withdrawal actions processed through CMS IAW the PSD Guide. For ANG/AFR
     Airmen, the unit commander approves withdrawal of awarded SEIs and CMS is not used.
     3.13.2.2. Commanders and supervisors review an individual's qualification for award and
     request SEI update by the MPS according to SEI PSD Guide.
     3.13.2.3. Functional managers at the appropriate level (MAJCOM, ANG/AFR-CFM,
     SOA, Det, etc.), with the help of manpower, review authorizations to determine if
     positions are coded with the appropriate SEI or SEI coding is required. They review duty
     positions to determine if the job will provide the incumbent with the special experience
     that the SEI denotes. A key element to the success of the SEI program is to identify the
     appropriate positions requiring the training/experience reflected by the SEI.
     3.13.2.4. HQ AFPC assignment officers/managers use SEIs, when appropriate, in the
     assignment selection process for RegAF Airmen.
     3.13.2.5. Officers (lieutenant colonel and below) may request award or withdrawal of
     SEIs IAW the SEI PSD Guide.
  3.13.3. MPS may award SEIs for colonels and colonel-selects according to SEI criteria
  specified in the AFOCD IAW the SEI PSD Guide.
  3.13.4. Enlisted SEIs. MPSs will:
     3.13.4.1. Update or request enlisted SEI actions. The Commander or designated
     representative is the approving authority for awarding SEIs unless otherwise specified in
     the AFECD.
     3.13.4.2. Monitor incoming and locally initiated assignment actions and consider special
     experience and training in determining an individual's duty position.
     3.13.4.3. Award SEIs during in-processing, classification interviews, or when
     determined appropriate by an individual's supervisor or commander.
  3.13.5. The AFECD contains the complete list of authorized SEIs and includes designation
  criteria and authorized AFSC combinations. MPS will award the SEI to the appropriate
  AFSC IAW the PSD Guide after the member meets experience and training requirements
 32                                                                  AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


   outlined in the AFECD. NOTE: Enlisted airmen assigned to SEI positions will either
   possess the necessary experience or be able to gain the necessary experience with training
   and time spent in the position.
   3.13.6. If the SEI area in MilPDS is full and a new SEI is to be awarded, consider the
   following factors in evaluating which SEIs to retain in MilPDS:
       3.13.6.1. Retain experience on modern equipment or systems versus experience on
       obsolete equipment or systems (functional managers determine equipment currency).
       3.13.6.2. Retain SEIs based on the extent of experience and training versus SEIs with
       minimum experience or those of lesser importance at the time of review.
       3.13.6.3. Officer SEIs are not awarded for simply occupying an SEI coded position.
       SEIs are only awarded once the officer meets the mandatory qualification criteria to
       include training and/or experience, whether occupying a coded position or not.
   3.13.7. RegAF functional managers at the appropriate level may code appropriate "no name
   allocations" with desired SEI requirements when specific circumstances warrant SEI
   matches. These actions will be pre-coordinated with the AFPC assignment manager.
       3.13.7.1. Code SEI positions on the manpower files.
       3.13.7.2. Assign individuals with desired SEIs to matching positions.
   3.13.8. Process requests for withdrawal of awarded SEIs IAW the SEI PSD Guide.
3.14. Classifying General Officers. Reporting Identifier (RI) 90G0 is the primary and duty
AFSC of all general officers. Award it upon selection for promotion to brigadier general and
withdraw all other awarded AFSCs. Classification procedures contained elsewhere in this Air
Force Instruction do not apply to general officers.
3.15. Awarding Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) to Officers. Use specialty description
qualifications in the AFOCD and this instruction to award or change AFSCs. An officer must
meet the mandatory entry requirements for award of AFSCs, SDIs, or RIs. Paragraph 3 of the
specialty description contains mandatory and desirable entry, award, and upgrade criteria.
Designate other AFSCs according to paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2
3.16. Awarding Intermediate or Qualified AFSCs. Approval authority is the unit
commander, unless otherwise specified in Table 3.5 and Table 3.6 MPS monitors the eligibility
of officers for upgrade to an intermediate, if applicable, or to a qualified AFSC. Establish a six-
month upgrade suspense date when no minimum experience is shown in the specialty description
in the AFOCD. Use this date strictly to monitor the award action. It is not a minimum
experience requirement; it is simply a monitoring tool. See paragraphs 3.17 and 3.18 for
commanders’ upgrade and award actions.
   3.16.1. Use the officer upgrade RIP to notify commanders or supervisors when officers have
   met necessary experience requirements.
   3.16.2. Commanders or supervisors review an officer's qualification for upgrade and return
   annotated RIP to the MPS. If an officer is not qualified for upgrade, the commander or
   supervisor will advise the MPS to establish a new suspense date. The new suspense date will
   represent the commander’s or supervisor’s estimate as to when the individual will be ready
   for upgrade.
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                       33


3.17. Classifying Commanders. A variety of AFSCs, SDIs, and RIs are available to identify
commander requirements. Use the AFOCD to determine which identifier is appropriate for the
role and position under consideration. Personnel selected for commander positions (AFSCs,
SDIs, or RIs such as XXC0, SDI 80C0, SDI 81T0, RI 91C0 and RI 91W0) are considered
qualified upon assignment to the position. Such commander specialties encompass command,
direction, planning, and staff supervision, cut across career fields of diverse functions and
activities and are only awarded to officers assigned to valid commander or deputy commander
positions. They carry a high level of responsibility and extreme care must be exercised in their
award. They are not awarded to show potential qualification.
3.18. Using the Commander Prefix. Use the prefix "C" to identify functional AFSC
commander positions below group level. It is only authorized to be used with the 3
qualification level and cannot be used with the 4 qualification level. NOTE: The 4
qualification level does not denote additional qualification. It is used solely to identify staff
positions above wing level. The C Prefix denotes commander duties within a functional AFSC,
(i.e., C31P3, Commander, Security Forces). Award it according to the authorized prefix listing
contained in the AFOCD.
   3.18.1. If the officer has not been previously awarded the C prefix, update the suspense for
   award 12 months from date assigned to a commander position. The automatic suspense
   routine will generate a RIP to the individual’s commander. The minimum experience for
   award of the C-prefix is 12 months assigned to a funded C-coded authorization as a unit
   commander and performing that role.
   3.18.2. Do not use the C prefix for specialties specifically established to identify commander
   functions as denoted by the term "commander" in the specialty title. Example: SDIs 80C0,
   Commander, Cadet Squadron, USAFA; and 81C0, Training Commander, OTS; RIs 91C0,
   Commander; 91W0, Wing Commander; and AFSCs 10C0, Operations Commander; 20C0,
   Logistics Commander; 30C0, Support Commander; and 40C0, Medical Commander or
   60C0, Program Director. NOTE: See C Prefix definition in the prefix listing contained in
   the AFOCD for a complete listing of AFSCs not authorized for use with the prefix.
3.19. Awarding Medical Utilization Field AFSCs (4XXX). Award medical AFSCs only to
officers designated as members of the Medical Service, USAF, according to Title 10, United
States Code (U.S.C.), Section 8067(a) through (f). A medical officer may not possess AFSCs in
other than the 4XXX series unless approved by HQ AFPC/DPAN, Medical Service Officer
Management Division.
3.20. Awarding Chaplain Utilization Field AFSCs (52RX). Award and assign 52RX only to
officers who are accepted for service as chaplains, possess ecclesiastical endorsements listed in
DoD Directive 1304.19, and are accepted by HQ USAF/HC, Chief of Air Force Chaplains.
   3.20.1. Assignment as an ANG chaplain requires appointment as a Chaplain (52RX) IAW
   ANGI 36-2005 Appointment of Officers in the Air National Guard of the United States and
   as Reserves of the Air Force.
   3.20.2. Assignment as an AFR chaplain requires be appointed as a Chaplain (52RX) IAW
   AFI 36-2115.
3.21. Awarding Legal Utilization Field AFSCs (51JX). A Bachelor of Laws or Juris Doctor
degree in law issued by an accredited law school, current admission to the bar of a Federal Court
 34                                                                AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


of the highest court of a state, and designation by The Judge Advocate General according to 10
U.S.C., Section 8067(g), are mandatory for entry and award of 51JX AFSCs. In addition, award
the qualified AFSC to those officers who have met all training and experience requirements
prescribed in the AFOCD. Award 51JX AFSCs only to those Air Reserve Component officers
designated as judge advocates by The Judge Advocate General, in accordance with AFI 51-103,
Designation and Certification of Judge Advocates. Officers awarded a 51JX AFSC, but who do
not have an appointment in The Judge Advocate General’s Corps Reserve in accordance with
AFI 51-802, Assignment to The Judge Advocate General’s Department Reserve, shall have the
AFSC withdrawn and will be reclassified. Award the qualified AFSC to those officers who have
met all training and experience requirements prescribed in AFI 51-802 and the AFSC specialty
description in the AFOCD. For ANG officers ANGI 36-2005, Appointment of Officers in the Air
National Guard of the United States and as Reserves of the Air Force.
3.22. Rated Officers. Loss of Aircraft Qualification. Rated officers placed in an inactive
aviation service code (flying status codes J, K, L, P, S, or T) retain their awarded AFSC at the
qualified or staff level. Chapter 4 contains instructions for rated officers disqualified from
aviation service. There is no requirement to downgrade the AFSC as a result of these
circumstances. An awarded AFSC, regardless if it is the PAFSC, 2AFSC, or 3AFSC, will reflect
the highest held qualification level.
3.23. Classifying Officers of Other Services Working in the Air Force. Assign officers of
allied countries or other DoD agencies attached to the Air Force for duty in AFSCs authorized
for Air Force use. Because these officers fill specific manning requirements within the Air
Force, give them duty assignments that maximize their technical training and experience. Do not
delete military specialties recorded by other departments from their records.
3.24. Competitive Category Transfers. For RegAF officers, requests to transfer between
competitive categories will be accomplished according to AFI 36-2106, initiated by the officer,
and coordinated through the appropriate functional assignment officer. Application requirements
for a competitive category will vary based on the gaining AFSC requirements. Transfer
application requirements are available on their specific website via
https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/login/redirect/home/session/L3NpZC9ZZnhLQms3bA
NOTE: Officers eliminated from their initial skills training may be reclassified under paragraph
3.35.
   3.24.1. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard competitive category transfers will be
   accomplished IAW AFI 36-2005 (and ANGI 36-2005 for ANG officers).
3.25. Awarding AFSCs in Enlisted Career Fields. Award or change AFSCs based on
specialty standards in the AFECD, this instruction, and the PSD Guide.
   3.25.1. Award of an AFSC must be based on one of the following:
       3.25.1.1. Initial classification (see Chapter 1).
       3.25.1.2. Enlisted skill level upgrade (see Table 3.8).
       3.25.1.3. AFSC downgrade or withdrawal (see Chapter 4).
       3.25.1.4. AFSC conversions (see CS&CIG; periodic revisions to the AFECD).
       3.25.1.5. Enlisted retraining (see AFI 36-2626 for requirements).
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                     35


       3.25.1.6. Awarding helper-level AFSCs to Air National Guard and United States Air
       Force Reserve enlisted personnel based on civilian experience (see Chapter 5).
   3.25.2. Additional AFSCs will not be awarded solely to show future, potential, or possible
   utilization.
   3.25.3. Restrict award of the 7-skill level to SSgts through MSgts. Restrict award of the 9-
   skill level to SMSgts. Restrict award of the Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) code to Chiefs
   and Chief selects. Use Table 3.9 for authorizing manpower positions.
NOTE: AFSCs will only be awarded through the methods cited in paragraph 3.25. MPS will
return requests that do not conform to this paragraph to the originator.
3.26. Strength Aptitude. Mandatory strength standards for entry into all enlisted career fields
are shown in the AFECD, Part II, Attachment 4.
3.27. Classifying Airmen in Retraining Status. Retrainees in the grade of SMSgt and below
must complete all mandatory requirements to qualify for award of a new skill level. Supervisors
will review AFSC mandatory requirements to determine if a waiver is appropriate when an
Airman possesses prior experience or training in a related AFSC, and forward the supporting
documentation to the individual’s commander (coordinate with Base Training Manager/senior
3S2X1, Education and Training as necessary). If recommended for approval, the commander
will forward the complete request by encrypted email to the MPS. The MPS will review for
completeness and forward waiver with recommendations, to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for final
disposition. For RC personnel, process waivers IAW the respective ANG/AFR Classification
Waiver guide. Review Table 3.1 and Table 3.2, and Table 3.3 for waiver approval levels and
processing requirements.
   3.27.1. RegAF CMSgts and CMSgt-selects approved by AF/DPE, Chiefs’ Group,
   Assignments Division, to cross flow into other than an awarded CEM code may bypass
   normal lower skill level qualification. NOTE: ANG and Air Force Reserve Command
   (AFRC) CMSgts cross flowing into another AFSC outside the career field ladder must
   submit a waiver to bypass normal skill level qualifications to NGB/A1PO for ANG personnel
   and AFRC/A1KK for AFRC personnel. NGB/A1PO or AFRC/A1KK will review for
   completeness and coordinate with ANG or AFRC CFM and training managers before
   approving or disapproving.
   3.27.2. While some training may be required, the managerial talents of the CMSgts/CMSgt-
   selects will not be wasted through routine and unnecessary training efforts. CEM codes are
   awarded using Table 3.8, rule 6.
3.28. Classifying Students. Retain a student's awarded AFSC except as indicated in paragraph
2.2 For classifying student officers refer to Table 3.7 The DAFSC of enlisted personnel
attending a formal school is the AFSC to which the course trains according to the Education and
Training Course Announcement (ETCA, a web-page version of the Air Force Course Catalog).
If the course does not train to a specific AFSC, the DAFSC remains the same as it was at the
base of assignment. Award a 3-skill level AFSC upon graduation from the AFSC awarding
course. To determine the CAFSC of enlisted personnel, see Table 3.10
3.29. Classifying Chaplain Assistant Personnel (Except USAFR Enlisted Personnel). The
37th Training Wing, Lackland AFB TX, using policies established by HQ USAF/HC, makes
 36                                                                  AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


initial entry of NPS enlisted personnel into Chaplain Assistant (AFSC 5R0X1). The wing
chaplain and NCOIC interviews retrainees into this AFSC, then forwards recommendations to
the command chaplain for review.
   3.29.1. For AFR enlisted personnel, HQ AFRC/HC using policies established by HQ
   USAF/HC, will approve/disapproval retraining applications into the Chaplain Assistant
   career field (AFR do not accept NPS into AFSC 5R0X1). The wing chaplain and NCOIC
   will interview applicants into this AFSC, then forwards recommendation to HQ AFRC/HC
   for command chaplain review/approval.
3.30. Classifying Instrumentalists. The Air Force Military Training Center classifies initial
enlistees into AFSCs 3N1X1 and 3N2X1 using AFI 36-2002, Regular Air Force and Special
Category Accessions, and AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. Band
commanders may award any instrumental suffix to qualified persons assigned and classified in
AFSC 3N151 if there is a vacancy in the unit of assignment. Requirements and testing
procedures are specified in AFI 35-101.
3.31. Classification Interviews and Audits:
   3.31.1. Personnel specialists, 5-skill level or higher with classification experience, conduct
   classification audits during in-processing and when an airman receives an assignment in an
   AFSC other than their CAFSC.
   3.31.2. Auditors or Personnel specialists will:
       3.31.2.1. Evaluate accuracy and currency of the AFSC data. Ensure a source document
       (see paragraph 1.3.4.) exists for each awarded AFSC, RI, or SDI and verify accuracy of
       awarded skill level.
       3.31.2.2. Downgrade or withdraw AFSCs according to paragraph 4.1
       3.31.2.3. Provide classification counseling.
       3.31.2.4. Determine whether designated SEIs are accurate.
3.32. Using Feeder AFSCs. When enlisted airmen progress to the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level AFSC
or CEM code in which two or more AFSCs merge, retain the feeder AFSC (the AFSC from
which they progressed) as an awarded AFSC. Retain only the feeder AFSC immediately
preceding the enlisted airman’s highest awarded AFSC. (Example: PAFSC 2A590, 2AFSC
2A573A would be retained as a feeder AFSC. When the enlisted airman is promoted to Chief
Master Sergeant and is designated with CEM 2A300, 2AFSC 2A590 will be awarded to denote
the enlisted airman’s technical qualifications. AFSC 2A573A would be withdrawn.) AFSCs
with shreds at the 3-skill level and combined at the 5-skill level are used to facilitate the first
duty assignment. Therefore, delete the feeder 3skill level AFSC when upgrading the enlisted
airman to the 5-skill level.
3.33. Determining CAFSC. HQ AFPC/DPAA (Airman Assignments Division) manages
CAFSCs for RegAF enlisted and ANG/AFR MPSs for assigned RC airmen.
   3.33.1. The CAFSC is initially based on the AFSC into which the member is classified at the
   time of enlistment or during basic training (See Table 2.1). It will be identical to the highest
   awarded AFSC or CEM code in the ladder in which the member is being used or trained with
   the following restrictions:
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                       37


       3.33.1.1. The CAFSC for members performing duty in a 3-, 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level
       structure will not exceed the:
          3.33.1.1.1. 3-skill level for AB through A1C.
          3.33.1.1.2. 5-skill level for SrA and SSgt.
          3.33.1.1.3. 7-skill level for TSgts and MSgts.
          3.33.1.1.4. 9-skill level for SMSgts.
       3.33.1.2. The CAFSC for members performing in an AFS without a 5-skill level will not
       exceed the:
          3.33.1.2.1. 3-skill level for AB through SSgt.
          3.33.1.2.2. 7-skill level for TSgts and MSgts.
          3.33.1.2.3. 9-skill level for SMSgts.
       3.33.1.3. The CAFSC for Chiefs and Chief selects is the CEM code of the career ladder
       in which assigned.
   3.33.2. Although the MPS can change the CAFSC, changes other than initial, retraining,
   normal skill-level upgrade and Special Duty Identifier (SDI) actions are reviewed for
   propriety by both the gaining and losing AFPC assignment managers for RegAF airmen
   (ANG/AFR CFMs for RC airmen). Base level changes of CAFSC can be disapproved based
   on the overall Air Force resource need. NOTE: Individuals with more than one awarded
   AFSC can be used based on the needs of the Air Force. The date the CAFSC is changed is
   based on how that change is affected. If an individual is PCA’d locally, the effective date of
   the CAFSC is the date assigned to the position. If an individual is PCS’d to another base, the
   effective date of the CAFSC is the date departed last duty station. Do not change the CAFSC
   for an Airman being disqualified from their current CAFSC (see Chapter 4).
       3.33.2.1. Airmen having received an initial enlistment bonus (IEB) or receiving a
       selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) in their current enlistment are restricted by MilPDS
       for MPS-level CAFSC changes. For RegAF airmen, contact HQ AFPC/DPAA5 for
       assistance if CAFSC change is needed.
          3.33.2.1.1. For ANG and AFR airmen, the servicing MPS performs these actions.
3.34. Use Outside of CAFSC. Local emergencies or overages may be the basis for an airman’s
prolonged assignment outside of the normal career progression pattern. However, to negate any
career regression, assignments will be rotated between all airmen in the same CAFSC, if the
source CAFSC represents the appropriate resource pool. If pulling from any AFSC, rotate
among all available Airmen.
   3.34.1. MPSs:
       3.34.1.1. May authorize using airmen through SMSgt outside their CAFSC up to 130
       days in any 12month period.
       3.34.1.2. Are responsible for ensuring CMSgts and CMSgt selects are not performing
       duty out of their CAFSC for more than 270 days in a 12-month period.
38                                                                           AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


    3.34.2. Do not use airmen out of their CAFSC if they have an assignment limitation code
    (ALC) "O" and received an enlistment bonus, a selective reenlistment bonus, or who have a
    break in service without first requesting a waiver. Send requests for waivers on RegAF
    airmen to the Systems, Procedures and Student Management Assignments Branch at HQ
    AFPC/DPAA5, 550 C Street West, Suite 29, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4737. RC waiver
    requests will be coordinated with NGB/A1P and AFR/A1KK, respectively.
    3.34.3. AFPC Assignment Managers/ANG/AFR CFMs may:
       3.34.3.1. Approve using airmen through SMSgts outside their CAFSC in excess of 130
       days.
       3.34.3.2. Forward waiver request for using RegAF Chiefs and Chief selects outside their
       CAFSC to HQ USAF/DPE, Chiefs’ Group Assignments. For NGB/AFR Chiefs and
       Chief -selects, forward waiver requests to the respective RC CFM.
    3.34.4. Use outside of CAFSC does not waive requirements to terminate special duty
    assignment pay (SDAP) when the period of temporary duty exceeds 90 days (see AFI 36-
    3017, Special Duty Assignment Pay).

NOTES:
1. Effective date of change for the CAFSC for unclassified enlisted personnel (9U000) is the
date of receipt of training or transaction identifier code AA47Q, whichever comes first.
2. CAFSC effective date (for retraining through a formal school [including special duty]) is the
date departed current duty station TDY to accomplish required training (either en route to new
duty station or when returning to present duty station). If there is not a PCS or PCA and no
formal training, the CAFSC will be changed when assigned duty. Do not change CAFSC prior
to date of departure. For ANG airmen, update the entry level CAFSC (and award the AFSC to
the PAFSC, 2AFSC, 3AFSC or 4AFSC) at the time the airman is assigned to the duty position
with the AFSC in which they will be attending the 3-level awarding course.
3. Individuals returned to previous duty station following completion of training and who work
in their previous AFSC will be reported as working duty out of control. The duty AFSC will
match the position the individual is assigned to, but the CAFSC will remain the new AFSC.
4. Skill restrictions of paragraph 3.33. apply.

                     DOWNGRADING AND WITHDRAWING AFSCS

4.1. Downgrading AFSCs or Withdrawing Awarded AFSCs, CEMs, SDIs, or RIs. The
MPS monitors the downgrade of AFSCs or the withdrawal of AFSCs, and CEM, SDI, and RI
codes and processes appropriate forms and actions according to this AFI, and the
Officer/Enlisted AFSC Disqualification PSD Guide (see Table 4.3). Unit Commander is the
approval authority unless otherwise noted. Commanders must review conditions in paragraphs
4.1.1 through 4.1.12 to determine when to downgrade AFSCs or to withdraw an awarded AFSC,
SDI, RI, or CEM. MPS will ensure downgraded AFSCs match grade and skill-level
authorizations in Table 3.9 Commanders and supervisors considering downgrade or withdrawal
recommendations must carefully evaluate all of the facts before proceeding. Downgrading or
withdrawing an AFSC, SDI, RI, or CEM will not be used as an alternative to more appropriate
disciplinary or quality force action. Conversely, while punitive action will not be taken against
an individual solely because of their failure to remain qualified in an AFSC, SDI, RI, or CEM
code,—the cause for downgrade or withdrawal may require appropriate administrative action. In
many instances, however, withdrawal of the AFSC, SDI, RI or CEM code is the result of the
individual’s ineligibility to retain the awarded identifier and will be characterized as being
disqualified from the identifier. Disqualification is either the result of conditions or actions over
which the individual had no control, i.e., medical disqualification, some training failures, some
failures to maintain mandatory AFSC qualification requirements; or, due to conditions or actions
over which the individual did have control, i.e., other training failures, substandard duty
performance, loss of security clearance, failure to maintain AFSC qualification requirements, etc.
These will be processed through the CMS as AFSC Disqualification actions IAW the applicable
Officer or Enlisted AFSC Disqualification PSD Guide. HQ AFPC/DPSIC is the approval
authority for all RegAF AFSC disqualification actions. For RC Airmen, ANG and AFR
squadron/flight commanders are the approval authority for their assigned Airmen. Follow-on
utilization of disqualified Airmen will be IAW AFIs 362626, Airman Retraining Program,
362110, Assignments (for RC Airmen, AFI 36-2115 (AFR) and ANGI 36-2101); 36-3208,
Administrative Separation of Airmen (AFI 36-3209 for AFR). HQ AFPC/DPSIC determines
qualifications for, approves/disapproves disqualification actions and updates reporting identifiers
(9A000, 9A100, 9A200, 9A300, 9A400 and 9A500) for RegAF enlisted airmen upon initial
disqualification from all awarded AFSCs. ANG/AFR MPS will accomplish updates for
downgrading and withdrawing AFSCs following unit/CC disqualification action approval.
When notified the disqualified airman reporting identifier on a RegAF Airman must be revised to
reflect changes in retraining status, DPSIC will reopen the case and contact the submitting
unit/MPS for the new AF IMT 2096. DPSIC, NGB/A1DC or AFRC/A1KK may also initiate a
disqualification action (when available evidence makes the airman ineligible to remain in the
AFSC) and direct the unit to complete the unit/base level requirements for disqualification.
When an airman’s eligibility for retraining changes following initial disqualification, DPSIC (or
the commander) may initiate the documentation required to change the reporting identifier to the
most appropriate under the new circumstances. DPSIC determines eligibility for award of and
updates RI 9A400 (return to duty program). The AF Wounded Warrior program (HQ
AFPC/DPFW) determines eligibility for and updates Wounded Warrior (9WXXX and 92WX)
 50                                                                   AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


identifiers. All AFSC disqualification cases will include a current EPR or OPR, as appropriate,
closing out the day prior to disqualification action initiation. See AFI 36-2406 for details.
NOTE: For actions resulting in Initial Enlistment (IEB) or Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB)
skill withdrawal, commanders must review for bonus termination and recoupment action
according to AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force (RegAF), ANGI 36-2002,
Enlistment and Reenlistment in the Air National Guard and as a Reserve of the Air Force, or AFI
36-2612, United States Air Force Reserve Reenlistment and Retention Program, as applicable.
   4.1.1. Downgrade, Withdrawal, or Disqualification as an Exception to Procedures (ETP).
   When none of the provisions outlined in this chapter apply and the commander still believes
   an AFSC downgrade, withdrawal, or disqualification is appropriate, contact HQ
   AFPC/DPSIC (RegAF only) to review the circumstances/issues/documentation believed to
   support AFSC disqualification under this paragraph. Following DPSIC review forward all
   pertinent data via a CMS action to HQ AFPC/DPSIC as an exception to procedures. HQ
   AFPC/DPSIC is the approval authority for RegAF airmen.
       4.1.1.1. HQ AFPC/DPSIC will forward cases on RC Airmen to ANG/A1PO or HQ
       AFRC/A1KK, respectively, for consideration. If approved, the RC MPS will update
       MilPDS.
   4.1.2. Lack of Recent Performance (Downgrade or Withdrawal):
       4.1.2.1. Officer—Withdrawal (does not apply to rated AFSCs).
          4.1.2.1.1. Do not withdraw an awarded AFSC for at least 3 years after the date that
          duty was last performed.
          4.1.2.1.2. Do not withdraw an awarded AFSC based on extensive formal training (20
          weeks or longer) for at least 5 years after the date that duty was last performed.
          4.1.2.1.3. Officers may request withdrawal of awarded AFSCs after meeting the
          requirements of 4.1.2.1.1. or 4.1.2.1.2. above. MPS will review the request and
          forward to the AFPC assignment manager for final action.
       4.1.2.2. Enlisted--Downgrade. MPS downgrades AFSCs using Table 4.1
       4.1.2.3. Enlisted—Withdrawal.
          4.1.2.3.1. AFSCs are withdrawn after 2 additional years of nonperformance when
          downgraded using Table 4.1 (See Table 3.11 to determine CAFSC.)
          4.1.2.3.2. SDIs or RIs are withdrawn after 8 consecutive years of nonperformance.
          4.1.2.3.3. Although downgrade action based on consecutive nonperformance in the
          specialty may or may not have been accomplished as outlined in Table 4.1, AFSCs
          awarded at the 7- or 9-skill level are withdrawn after 8 years, and 5-skill level (3-skill
          level, if no 5-skill level exists in the ladder) are withdrawn after 6 years, 3-skill level
          is withdrawn after 2 years. Failure to downgrade or withdraw AFSCs within the
          specified time frames does not indicate the Airman remains qualified and will be
          deleted upon discovery.
          4.1.2.3.4. Re-awarding AFSCs withdrawn (or to have been withdrawn) under this
          provision at the 3-skill level requires approval by the AFPC assignment manager
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                    51


          (RegAF only) and AFCFM for the AFSC. The commander’s request for re-award will
          include written certification by a technical advisor proficient in the AFSC of the
          airman’s eligibility (meets mandatory entry and award specialty requirements as
          listed in the AFECD) and proficiency level for consideration. For those times when a
          technical advisor proficient in the AFSC is not available, nearby bases and the
          MAJCOM staff may be able to assist with the certification. Upgrade to the highest
          previously held skill level only requires qualification training and duty position
          certification by the supervisor.
              4.1.2.3.4.1. NGB and AFRC CFMs are the approval authorities for RC enlisted
              actions review and approval IAW their waiver approval authority in Table 3.2.
              The respective RC MPS will finalize the action.
              4.1.2.3.4.2. Documentation requirements for RC personnel include a copy of the
              certified CFETP, position description (PD), or coordinated MFR with supervisor
              and command of host location to document tasks performed. All documentation
              will be provided to the servicing MPS for ANG/AFR MPS verification.
          4.1.2.3.5. Lack of recent performance does not apply to feeder AFSCs (see paragraph
          3.32).
NOTE: Time spent in a TDY status (contingency or other) or performing duties in an AFSC,
SDI, or RI other than CAFSC counts as time performing in the specialty. Example: Individual's
PAFSC, CAFSC, and DAFSC is 3S1X1 and is TDY performing duty in a previously awarded
AFSC (that has not been withdrawn for lack of recent performance). This performance
establishes a new date from which to count years outside of the AFSC. See above for RC
documentation requirements.

NOTE: AFSCs not downgraded using the above table will be withdrawn using paragraph
4.1.2.3.3.
   4.1.3. Enlisted Airman Reduced in Grade (Downgrade). MPS will downgrade to the skill
   level as shown in Table 4.2 Restore AFSCs downgraded due to reduction in grade effective
   upon promotion, provided the enlisted Airman meets all mandatory requirements. Reinstate
   original effective dates when demotion appeals result in restoration of former grade and
   original date of rank.

NOTE: Downgrade the CAFSC and awarded AFSC to 3-skill level for AFSCs without a 5-skill
level.
   4.1.4. Substandard Performance (Downgrade or Withdrawal [Disqualification]).
   Commander initiates withdrawal (disqualification) action when duty performance indicates
   an officer or enlisted is unable to perform tasks associated with his or her skill/qualification
   level. Review the individual's record for adequate training. For RegAF airmen, contact HQ
   AFPC/DPSIC to review the circumstances/issues/documentation believed to support AFSC
   disqualification under this paragraph prior to creating the CMS case. The MPS will submit
   an AFSC disqualification action via CMS (IAW the PSD Guide) to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for
   approval.
      4.1.4.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC Airmen, DPSIC will forward the CMS case
      to NGB/A1PO or HQ AFRC/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. If approved,
      the servicing RC MPS will update MilPDS.
      4.1.4.2. Commander Actions. Notify the member by letter that AFSC downgrade or
      withdrawal has been initiated on an AF Form 2096. Member must concur or nonconcur,
      sign and date the form. The commander's notification will include the reasons for the
      action and advise the member if he/she non-concurs with the action of the option to
      submit a written rebuttal when interviewed by an evaluation official (EO). The
      commander will submit the following documentation to the MPS:
          4.1.4.2.1. Notification letter signed by unit commander with the completed, signed
          and dated AF Form 2096 prepared according to the PSD Guide.
          4.1.4.2.2. Last three performance reports; or, if the individual has not received a
          performance report, a letter from the member's immediate supervisor assessing past
          duty performance. Note: it is difficult to support disqualification for substandard
          duty performance when the officer or enlisted performance report reflects the
          individual is meeting standards.
          4.1.4.2.3. Supporting training documentation (enlisted only).           Note:      this
          disqualification reason is the most difficult to use in that the individual’s training
          documentation must show that the unit has decertified the individual from specific
          tasks in which the airman is performing in a substandard manner, retrained and
          certified, and continues to perform in a substandard manner despite the additional
          training, etc.
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                    53


        4.1.4.2.4. Letters of counseling (or other administrative documentation) relative to
        the duty performance cited as the reason for the disqualification action.
        4.1.4.2.5. Any additional documentation germane to the case.
     4.1.4.3. If the commander, supervisor, member, and MPS Commander concur with the
     AFSC downgrade action, the MPS will approve the downgrade. If the commander,
     supervisor, member, and MPS Commander concur with the AFSC withdrawal
     (disqualification) action, the MPS will document and forward the action via CMS to HQ
     AFPC/DPSIC. DPSIC will review and approved/disapprove and update MilPDS for
     approvals.
        4.1.4.3.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case to
        ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. If approved the
        servicing RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
     4.1.4.4. When the member or the MPS Chief does not concur with the downgrade or
     withdrawal (disqualification), the Force Support Squadron (FSS) commander will either
     disapprove the request if it is considered without merit, or appoint a disinterested
     evaluation official (EO). The EO must be a field grade officer or senior NCO; senior in
     grade to the individual being reviewed. The EO cannot be in the member’s chain of
     command. The EO will:
        4.1.4.4.1. Read Chapter 4 of this instruction to ensure a thorough understanding of
        AFSC withdrawal and downgrade procedures.
        4.1.4.4.2. Review the case file and the supporting documentation.
        4.1.4.4.3. Obtain a written evaluation of the substandard duty performance relative to
        the requirements of the AFSC by a technical advisor qualified with the technical
        aspects of the specialty involved (the technical advisor cannot be in the individual’s
        chain of command.).
        4.1.4.4.4. Explain the recommended action and counsel the member, advise him or
        her of the right to submit a written rebuttal that may include statements from people
        knowledgeable of the member's duty performance, and help the member prepare any
        written rebuttal. Members not submitting a rebuttal will acknowledge such in writing
        as well as understanding of "disqualified airman processing" according to the PSD
        Guide. The acknowledgement letter is a mandatory part of the case file. (See Figure
        4.1)

     4.1.5.2. Withdrawing certification requires the withdrawal of the AFSC (disqualification)
     unless the AFOSI commander grants an exception. The AFOSI MPS submits AFSC
     disqualification actions via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for deletion of AFSCs 71XX or
     7SXXX before reassignment.
  4.1.6. Failure to Maintain Mandatory AFSC, SDI, or CEM Qualification Standards
  (withdrawal [disqualification]).
     4.1.6.1. The MPS will submit an AFSC disqualification action via CMS to HQ
     AFPC/DPSIC. For RegAF Airmen, if approved, DPSIC will withdraw the AFSC, SDI or
     CEM code (for officers) when an Airman fails to maintain the mandatory specialty
     requirements listed as "other" in the AFOCD specialty descriptions or when an enlisted
     Airman fails to meet award and retention criteria in specialty descriptions contained in
     the AFECD.
        4.1.6.1.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case to
        ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively, for internal processing. If approved, the
        servicing RC MPS will finalize the action and update MilPDS.
     4.1.6.2. Do not use failure to meet a mandatory entry requirement as sole basis for AFSC
     withdrawal after award of an AFSC above the 1-skill level.
     4.1.6.3. Request withdrawal of the AFSC or CEM Code if an airman fails to maintain the
     mandatory qualifications listed as award and/or retention requirements for the 3-, 5-, 7-,
     9-, or CEM skill level in the AFSC specialty description. EXCEPTION: An enlistee
     with prior service, who has an AFSC awarded according to paragraph 2.3, retains the
     AFSC pending determination of eligibility for reinstatement of mandatory security
     clearance if previously administratively withdrawn (AFI 31-501, Personnel Security
     Program Management).
56                                                               AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


  4.1.7. Withdrawing an AFSC as a Result of Medical Disqualification (Withdrawal
  [Disqualification]). Typically, when the medical evaluation reviewing or approving authority
  determines the medical defect permanently prevents the individual from being used in the
  awarded AFSC IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards), the MPS will
  submit an AFSC disqualification action via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for
  approval/disapproval. DPSIC refers the disqualification case to HQ AFPC/DPASF for
  review and follow-on utilization consideration for RegAF officers, if approved.
     4.1.7.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, HQ AFPC/DPSIC will refer the
     case to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. The servicing
     RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
     4.1.7.2. A change of the physical profile alone does not disqualify a member for
     continued duty in the AFSC. Consider other factors (such as recorded evaluation of duty
     performance, extent to which physical restriction would affect duty performance, etc.) in
     determining whether the physical limitations preclude the member from performing
     effectively in the awarded AFSC. Submit documentation describing the impact for
     medical evaluation reviewing or approving authority consideration. Do not send in
     AFSC disqualification case. Ensure the completed AF Form 1042 or 422 is submitted
     with the disqualification action.
     4.1.7.3. If the airman has been processed through the Disability Evaluation System and
     retained on active duty, the local MEB reviewing and approval authority will provide the
     MPS an AF Form 422, Physical Profile Serial Report, including comments clearly
     defining the scope of the medical problem and whether the physical limitations preclude
     the member from performing effectively in the awarded AFSC. Complete the AF Form
     422 using provisions in AFI 48-123.
  4.1.8. Prerequisite AFSC:
     4.1.8.1. Officers--Withdrawal. After award of the qualified or intermediate-level AFSC,
     delete the entry-level officer AFSCs. After awarding the qualified 3-level aircraft
     commander, missile combat crew commander, or bomber CSO AFSC, delete the
     intermediate-level AFSC (2- level).
     4.1.8.2. Enlisted--Withdrawal. When an enlisted airman progresses from a skill level to
     the next higher one in the same career ladder, delete the lower-skill level AFSC.
     EXCEPTION: When enlisted airmen progress to a 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level AFSC or CEM
     code in which two or more AFSCs combine, retain the feeder AFSC as an awarded
     AFSC.
  4.1.9. Withdrawing or Downgrading an Improperly Awarded AFSC. When discovered, the
  unit will request withdrawal of an improperly awarded AFSC. The request will be in official
  memorandum format and contain a synopsis of the requested action and will include a
  recommendation from the individual's supervisor. An assessment by an individual proficient
  in the specialty will accompany the request. The MPS will submit an AFSC disqualification
  action via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for approval/disapproval. Final approval authority is
  HQ AFPC/DPSIC, for RegAF Airmen.
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                    57


     4.1.9.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case to
     ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. If approved the
     servicing RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
  4.1.10. Medically Disqualified for Aviation Services. Aviation service disqualification
  actions are processed IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical
  Ratings and Aviation Badges. Following disqualification from aviation service, AFSC
  disqualification actions are processed using the CMS, as indicated below.
     4.1.10.1. Rated Officers--Withdrawal. Rated AFSCs (11XX, 12XX, 13BX, 18XX) are
     retained for 4 years from the medical disqualification date from aviation service.
     However, further duty not involving flying in a rated AFSC requires HQ AFPC/DPAO
     (NGB/A1PO or AFR/A1KK for RC personnel) approval. After 4 years, the rated AFSC
     is withdrawn unless DPAO (NGB/A1PO or AFR/A1KK for RC personnel) approves
     further duty beyond the initial 4 years. When rated officers disqualified from aviation
     service are not selected to perform non-flying rated duties and/or determined no longer
     needed to perform in this capacity, the MPS will submit an AFSC disqualification action
     via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC. An AFSC withdrawn under this provision will be re-
     awarded at the appropriate qualification level IAW paragraph 3.6. if the medical defect
     no longer exists and the individual is returned to active flying status. The approval
     authority, the unit CC, must coordinate with DPAO (NGB/A1PO or AFR/A1KK for RC
     personnel) for assignment instructions in that event.
        4.1.10.1.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case
        to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively, for internal processing. If approved the
        servicing RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
     4.1.10.2. Nonrated Officers--Withdrawal. Withdraw officer nonrated AFSCs requiring
     qualification for aviation service or parachute duties when permanently medically
     disqualified. Officers temporarily disqualified for failure to maintain medical fitness
     according to AFI 11402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings, and
     Badges may retain their AFSCs for 9 months from the date assigned aviation service code
     03 (medical disqualification), unless permanently disqualified before the end of 9
     months. At that time, the MPS will initiate AFSC disqualification through CMS. An
     officer’s AFSC in and of itself may not require qualification under 11-402 to retain the
     AFSC. In these instances, the disqualification case is to address the X or J prefixes and
     the officer retains the non-prefixed AFSC.
        4.1.10.2.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case
        to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively, for internal processing. The servicing
        RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
     4.1.10.3. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA)--Withdrawal (Disqualification). Withdraw
     CEA AFSCs 365 days after medical authority signs AF Form 1042 placing CEA on duty
     not to include flying (DNIF), or when assigned aviation service code of 03 (permanently
     medically disqualified), whichever occurs first. The MPS will submit an AFSC
     disqualification action via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for approval/disapproval.
        4.1.10.3.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case
        to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively, for internal processing through the MPS,
58                                                                 AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


         supporting SG and wing. The servicing RC MPS will finalize the action and, if
         approved, update MilPDS.
  4.1.11. Disqualified for Aviation Service for Other Than Medical Reasons (Withdrawal
  [Disqualification]). When an individual is removed from aviation service for other than
  physical reasons (aviation service codes 01, 02, 05, 06, 07, 08 or 09), the MPS will submit an
  AFSC disqualification action via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for review and
  approval/disapproval. The CMS case must include the documentation supporting the
  disqualification (loss of security clearance, training failure, failure to maintain AFSC
  specialty qualification requirements, etc.). DPSIC is the approval authority for RegAF
  Airmen. The effective date, if approved, will be the effective date on the aeronautical orders
  from the flight records office. DPSIC refers the disqualification case to HQ AFPC/DPASF
  for review and follow-on utilization consideration for RegAF officers, if approved.
     4.1.11.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case to
     ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively, for internal processing. The servicing RC
     MPS will withdraw the rated or aircrew specialties following wing commander approval.
     The effective date would be the date on the aeronautical orders provided by the flight
     records office.
  4.1.12. Failing to Progress While in Upgrade Training (Withdrawal [Disqualification]):
     4.1.12.1. Officers. When an officer is eliminated from initial technical training (see
     paragraph 3.35 for RegAF officers) a technical training elimination package will be
     submitted to HQ AFPC/DPSIP IAW AFI 36-2110 (RegAF only). For officers failing to
     meet proficiency requirements for upgrade to the qualified AFSC, identify the training
     provided and other associated documentation supporting the denial of upgrade via CMS
     to HQ AFPC/DPSIC. For officers disapproved for continued duty in an AFSC, provide
     the documentation supporting the denial of upgrade via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC. HQ
     AFPC/DPSIC is the approval/disapproval authority. Reclassification or retention of the
     officer will be considered based on current Air Force policies.
     4.1.12.2. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, HQ AFPC/DPSIC will refer the
     case to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively, for internal processing. The servicing
     RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
     4.1.12.3. Enlisted:
         4.1.12.3.1. If the training manager disqualifies an individual from training in IAW
         AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, the MPS will submit an AFSC
         disqualification action via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC.
         4.1.12.3.2. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, HQ AFPC/DPSIC will
         refer the case to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing.
         The servicing RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
         4.1.12.3.3. Withdraw the AFSC when an enlisted airman is eliminated from an AFSC
         awarding or formal training course that is mandatory for skill progression and listed
         as mandatory in the AFECD. NOTE: See AFI 36-2626, table 2.2, for disposition of
         retraining formal school eliminees.
         4.1.12.3.4. Do not withdraw an AFSC if it will be reinstated at a later date.
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                           59


   4.1.13. AFSC withdrawal (Disqualification) for airmen returned to active duty under the
   return to duty program (AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System, Chapter 11) and no
   longer qualify to retain awarded AFSCs. HQ AFSFC will initiate withdrawal of awarded
   AFSCs for which the airman no longer qualifies via CMS to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for review,
   processing and update of RI 9A400. This RI remains until such time as the airman is
   retrained or separated/discharged.
   4.1.14. Airmen leaving a SDI, regardless of reason (Voluntary or Involuntary) without a
   military skill (Valid awarded AFSC at the 3-level or higher) to which they are eligible to
   return, must be reviewed for future utilization. If the airman cannot be utilized after pursuing
   the following utilization options, initiate disqualified airman processing through CMS to HQ
   AFPC/DPSIC. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, HQ AFPC/DPSIC will refer
   the case to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. The servicing
   RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
       4.1.15.1. Assess feasibility of returning to AFSCs previously withdrawn (or to have been
       withdrawn) for lack of recent performance IAW paragraph 4.1.2
       4.1.15.2. If eligible, airman may apply for retraining IAW AFI 36-2626.
4.2. Officer Disqualification Actions. The MPS will report the disqualifying circumstances of
RegAF officers to HQ AFPC/DPSIC via CMS. HQ AFPC/DPSIC will review to determine if
disqualification can be approved then forward to HQ AFPC/DPASF for a utilization
determination. If DPASF is unable to place the officer into a new AFSC, the officer will be
designated as either 96D0, Officer Not Available for Use in Awarded AFSC for Cause (if
appropriate, see AFOCD), or 96U0, Unclassified Officer. For those identified for utilization in a
new AFSC, the assignment team will provide further instructions, as necessary. An officer under
consideration for award of another AFSC must meet the mandatory entry and retention
requirements.
   4.2.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, HQ AFPC/DPSIC will refer the case to
   ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. The servicing RC MPS
   will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
4.3. Certifying Intelligence Officers for Security Access (AFSCs 14NX):
   4.3.1. HQ 497 IG/INS, the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF), is solely
   responsible for determining and certifying eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented
   information (SCI). (See AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.)
   4.3.2. Security certification standards are established by Director of Central Intelligence.
   4.3.3. SCI certification authority will not be delegated.
   4.3.4. Withdrawal of SCI certification requires withdrawal of 14NX AFSCs, unless an
   exception is granted by HQ AFPC/DPSIC on recommendation of the Office of the Assistant
   Chief of Staff, Intelligence (HQ USAF/A2).
   4.3.5. Revocation of an officer’s security clearance by HQ 497 IG/INS requires withdrawal
   of AFSC 14NX, without exception. Approval authority is HQ AFPC/DPSIC.
 60                                                              AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


4.4. Effective Date of Downgrade or Withdrawal/Disqualification Actions:
   4.4.1. In cases where AFPC (NGB/A1PO or AFRC/A1KK for RC personnel) has approval
   authority for AFSC withdrawal, the effective date for the AF Form 2096, Section II, will be
   determined prior to the approval notification being sent to the MPS via the CMS.
   4.4.2. AFSC disqualification for medical or disqualification from aviation
   service/jump/marine dive reasons will take effect on the date of the disqualification as
   specified on the AF Form 422/AF Form 1042 or aviation order, respectively.
   4.4.3. Withdrawing an airman's PAFSC and designating a new PAFSC are concurrent
   actions.
   4.4.4. If an enlisted airman does not have an awarded AFSC besides the one withdrawn, then
   HQ AFPC/DPSIC will designate RI 9A000, 9A100, 9A200, 9A300, 9A400 or 9A500 (as
   appropriate) as the primary and control AFSC for RegAF airmen or 96D0/96U0 as the duty
   and primary AFSC for RegAF officers. RegAF MPSs will not award a 9AXXX RI and may
   delete only when departing for approved retraining—otherwise, retain until the member is
   separated, retired, or discharged. AFPC will update all disqualified airmen RIs following
   approval of the disqualification action for RegAF Airmen (officer and enlisted).
      4.4.4.1. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case to
      ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. The servicing RC MPS
      will finalize the action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                  61

Exception to   Commander     forward, all pertinent data to MPS to forward to HQ
Procedures,                  AFPC/DPSIC, via CMS with recommendation. DPSIC is the
paragraph                    approval authority for RegAF Airmen. DPSIC evaluates
4.1.1.                       circumstances and accompanying documentation. If
(see Note 1)                 supportable, approves request. Disapprovals will be returned
                             to the MPS. Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel,
                             DPSIC will refer the case to ANG/A1PO/A1DC or
                             AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal processing. The
                             servicing RC MPS will finalize the action and, if approved,
                             update MilPDS.

Lack of        MPS           reviews request and completes AF Form 2096 to document
Recent                       downgrade or withdrawal action. MPS will only approve
Performance,                 substantiated cases where non-performance in the specialty is
paragraph                    verified. (see Note 3) If request is not substantiated,
4.1.2.                       disapprove and return to individual or unit with rationale.
(see Note 2)
Substandard    MPS           ensure appropriate documentation outlined in paragraphs
Performance,                 4.1.4.1.1. through 4.1.4.1.4. is included. Disapprove and
paragraph                    return to the unit if incomplete. If complete and all
4.1.4.                       coordinating agencies and the member agree on downgrading
                             the AFSC, approve the downgrade and update MilPDS
                             accordingly. Disapprove and return to the unit if all
                             requirements have not been met and/or if the documentation
                             is incomplete. If complete and the member does not concur
                             with the action, forward request to the FSS commander for
                             resolution. If complete and (1) the commander has requested
                             withdrawing the AFSC and (2) the member, commander, and
                             MPS concur, recommend approval and forward the CMS
                             case to HQ AFPC/DPSIC for processing. Upon receipt of a
                             CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will refer the case to
                             ANG/A1PO/A1DC or AFR/A1KK, respectively for internal
                             processing. The servicing RC MPS will finalize the action
                             and, if approved, update MilPDS. If the member,
                             commander, and MPS are not in concurrence with the
                             withdrawal, forward the case to the FSS Commander for
                             continued processing.

 Substandard    FSS              either disapprove the request, if considered to be without
 Performance,   Commander        merit, or appoint a disinterested Evaluation Official (EO)
 paragraph                       (field grade officer or SNCO, senior in grade to member
 4.1.4.                          being reviewed). EO cannot be individual’s commander,
                                 supervisor or in the member’s chain of command. HQ
                                 AFPC/DPSIC is the approval authority for RegAF Airmen.
                                 Upon receipt of a CMS case for RC personnel, DPSIC will
                                 refer the case to ANG/A1PO or AFR/A1KK, respectively for
                                 internal processing. The servicing RC MPS will finalize the
                                 action and, if approved, update MilPDS.
                EO               Will read Chapter 4 and follow procedures outlined in
                                 paragraph 4.1.4.3.1. through 4.1.4.3.4.2.

NOTES:
1. Use this provision when none of the other provisions outlined in paragraph 4.1.2. through
4.1.12. apply and the commander still believes downgrade or withdrawal is appropriate.
2. Table 4.1. applies.
3. Time spent in a TDY status (to include deployment) in the AFSC to be downgraded or
withdrawn counts as time performing in the specialty. Member’s time starts over from the return
date of the TDY.

 70                                                                  AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013


rather than duties and does not have a full specialty description. Example: 93P0 Patient (officer),
9P000 Patient (enlisted).
Secondary Air Force Specialty Code (2AFSC)—The awarded AFSC in which an individual is
second best qualified to perform duty.
Skill Level—The level of qualification within an awarded enlisted AFS, shown by the fourth
digit of the AFSC. The 1-skill level (helper) identifies personnel initially classified in an AFS
when entering the Air Force or when retraining. The 3-skill level (apprentice) identifies enlisted
personnel who have obtained basic knowledge within an AFSC through completion of an initial
skills course. Apprentices gain duty position experience and, upon completion, enter a structured
apprenticeship program to gain qualification and experience required of a 5-skill level
(journeyman). In specialties where a 5-skill level does not exist, personnel are considered skilled
at the 3-skill level. Apprentices implement work activities as directed and perform tasks
unsupervised when certifying officials determine them to be qualified. The 5-skill level identifies
enlisted personnel who, through experience and training, have demonstrated skilled proficiency
in their AFSC. Journeymen continue to gain experience and qualification in their AFSC and,
upon promotion to staff sergeant, enter a structured training program to gain experience and
qualification required of a craftsman (7-skill level). Journeymen plan, coordinate, implement,
and supervise work activities. The 7-skill level (craftsman) identifies enlisted personnel who
have gained a high degree of technical knowledge in their AFSC and who have additionally
acquired supervisory capability through training and experience. Craftsmen continue to gain
experience in technical, supervisory, and managerial functions. Craftsmen plan, coordinate,
implement, and direct work activities. The 9-skill level (superintendent) identifies enlisted
personnel who, through experience, training, and performance, have shown a high degree of
managerial and supervisory ability to fill positions requiring broad general (and sometimes
technical) knowledge. Superintendents plan, coordinate, implement, and direct a wider scope of
work activities and functions. When two or more career ladders combine at the supervisory 7- or
9-skill level (capper AFSC), members can supervise any or all of the subordinate career ladders;
however, members may only perform the specific technical functions of the career ladder
through which they have progressed. The awarded feeder AFSC identifies this training and
experience.
Special Duty Identifier (SDI)—A four- or five-digit code and title used to identify manpower
positions and persons performing duties not clearly within a specific career field. Has a complete
specialty description. Examples: 83RO Recruiting Service (Officer), 8P000 Courier (Enlisted).
Special Experience Identifier (SEI)—A three-character code that identifies special experience
and training not otherwise identified in the personnel data system. SEIs may permit rapid
identification of individuals already experienced to meet assignment requirements. More
importantly, they provide a means for identifying critical manning requirements during wartime
or contingency operations when little lead time is available for training personnel in specific
technical skills needed to support a weapon system or mission. SEIs are not substitutes for
AFSCs, suffixes, prefixes, special duty identifiers, reporting identifiers, CEM codes, or
professional specialty course codes. The AFOCD and AFECD list approved SEIs.
Special Duty Assignment Pay AFSC—AFSCs designated for special duty assignment pay as
stated in AFI 36-3017, Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP) Program.
AFI36-2101 25 JUNE 2013                                                                          71


Specialty Description—A description of an AFS or SDI that includes a title, code, specialty
summary, duties and responsibilities, qualifications, other specialty data, and, when established,
suffixes.
Staff Air Force Specialty Code—Identifies an officer position above wing level specifically on
the duty requirements of the role performed, not the fact that the authorization is on a staff above
wing level. Use staff AFSCs (XXX4) to identify planning and policy-making positions above
wing level. It requires the same skills as those for the qualified AFSC (XXX3), but applied to
developing broad policies, plans, and procedures. Management responsibility increases without
a corresponding increase in knowledge of the technical aspects of the function. Officers
filling/have filled such positions are awarded the staff AFSC.
Strength Aptitude—An individual's strength ability as measured by the Air Force Strength
Aptitude Test. The Enlisted Classification Directory lists strength requirements for each AFSC.
Supplemental Training—Formal training of officers or enlisted personnel that enhances
qualification in the job but does not result in change of AFSC.
Technical Advisor—Any military person awarded the AFSC at the 5-skill level or above that
can evaluate an individual’s specialty qualifications. Does not require formal designation.
Technical Training Course—A formal school course of instruction listed in the Education and
Training Announcements (ETCA), authorized by HQ USAF, and taught by the Air Force, DoD
school, or by a civilian organization for the DoD.
Third Air Force Specialty Code (3AFSC)—The awarded AFSC in which the individual is
third best qualified to perform duty.
Training—Instruction and applied exercises for the acquisition and retention of skills,
knowledge, and attitudes required to accomplish military tasks.
Utilization Field—A group of Air Force officer specialties, related by required skills and
knowledge. A utilization field can consist of only one specialty if the skills and knowledge
required are unique and don't relate to other officer specialties.
