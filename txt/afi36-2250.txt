This is the initial publication of this Air Force Instruction.
This instruction implements AFPD 36-22, Military Training. It outlines eligibility, implements policy
and assigns responsibilities for the use of units and personnel of the Air Force and its Reserve Compo-
nents (RC) under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Air Force in civil-military innovative readiness
training (IRT) activities that result in support and services for eligible organizations and activities outside
the Department of Defense, which are not otherwise prohibited by law. It carries out the tenets of DoD
Directive 1100.20, Support and Services for Eligible Organizations and Activities Outside the Depart-
ment of Defense, dated 30 January 1997; and Section 2012 of Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.).
Ensure that all records created by this instruction are maintained and disposed of IAW AFMAN 37-139,
Records Disposition Schedule.

1. Policy
    1.1. Units and personnel of the Air Force (under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Air Force)
    may be used to assist certain eligible non-DoD organizations and activities, as identified in DoD
    Directive 1100.20, in addressing community and civic needs of the United States, its territories and
    possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, when such assistance is incidental to military
    training or is otherwise authorized by law. The list of eligible non-DoD organizations and activities
    are designated in USC Title 10, Section 508 as: Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Boys Clubs, YMCA,
    YWCA, CAP, US Olympic Committee, Special Olympics or any other entity approved by the Secre-
    tary of Defense. The Directive does not authorize the use of units and personnel for civilian law
    enforcement purposes nor for response to natural or manmade disasters.
    1.2. Civic and community assistance provided shall be accomplished through IRT activities, and shall
    be accomplished primarily, but not exclusively, by personnel in the areas of healthcare services, trans-
    portation, general engineering, and infrastructure support and assistance.
    1.3. Support and services provided under authority of Title 10, Section 2012, U.S.C. shall:
        1.3.1. Be consistent with the national policy of protecting military readiness and avoiding compe-
        tition with the private sector.
2                                                                           AFI36-2250 1 MARCH 1999

       1.3.2. Be coordinated among the Military Departments and other Federal, State, and local agen-
       cies involved with the IRT Project/Activity to avoid duplication.
       1.3.3. Contribute, whenever possible and appropriate, to the protection and assurance of critical
       local, State, regional, and national infrastructure.
    1.4. If a specific request for support and services is received, assistance may be provided only if:
       1.4.1. Assistance is requested by a responsible official of the eligible organization or activity to
       which the assistance is to be provided. A responsible official is an individual authorized to repre-
       sent the organization or activity regarding the matter of assistance to be provided. Examples
       include a request from a state agency, i.e., hospital, school, museum; the mayor of a city; or a
       county government official.
       1.4.2. Unit officials must coordinate with civilian officials to ensure that assistance meets a valid
       community need and does not duplicate other available public services.
       1.4.3. Assistance is not reasonably available from a commercial entity or, if available, the respon-
       sible official submitting the request for assistance certifies that the commercial
       entity that would otherwise provide such services agrees to the provision of such services by the
       Armed Forces. The determination of reasonable availability of assistance from a commercial
       entity may take into account whether the requesting organization or activity would be able, finan-
       cially or otherwise, to address the specific civic or community need(s) without the assistance of
       the Armed Forces.
    1.5. Assistance may be provided only if:
       1.5.1. The assistance provided accomplishes valid unit training requirements and the assistance
       provided complies with the policies, procedures, and responsibilities of the references in attach-
       ment one.
       1.5.2. The assistance provided involves tasks directly related to the specific Air Force Specialty
       Code (AFSC) of the individual member.
       1.5.3. The requirement that the military assistance must accomplish valid unit training does not
       apply in a case in which the unit assistance consists primarily of military manpower, and the total
       amount of such assistance on a particular project does not exceed 100 man-hours. In these partic-
       ular instances, most manpower requests will be met by volunteers, and that any assistance other
       than manpower will be extremely limited. Government vehicles may be used, but only to provide
       transportation of personnel to and from the work site. The use of military aircraft is prohibited.
    1.6. The provision of assistance shall not adversely affect the quality of training, or otherwise inter-
    fere with the ability of a member or unit of the Air Force to perform their military functions.
       1.6.1. The provision of assistance shall not result in a significant increase in the cost of training.

2. Responsibilities.

       required reports to the Congress regarding the IRT activities conducted under the authority of Title
       10, Section 2012.
       2.1.5. Serve as the coordinating agency with OASD/RA and major commands or headquarters.
       2.1.6. Approve IRT activities and ensure commanders of units or personnel participating in
       approved IRT activities determine the type, manner, and means of assistance provided is consis-
       tent with valid training requirements, or related to the specific AFSC of the individual member.
       2.1.7. Ensure, in the case of healthcare assistance, that activities comply with all applicable local,
       State, Federal, and military requirements governing the qualifications of participating military
       healthcare providers, and regulating the delivery of healthcare in the particular locale, State or
       region where a medical IRT activity is to be conducted. Medical personnel will provide assistance

       tion. The most stringent requirements shall prevail when a conflict exists.
       2.1.8. Develop and prescribe, as appropriate, after-action reporting requirements to be conducted
       by units and personnel under SAF jurisdiction.
       2.1.9. Encourage and facilitate the establishment of advisory councils on civil-military coopera-

       2.1.10. Forward to OASD/RA for review and consideration all requests for services received by
       the Air Force, the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve from any non-eligible requester.
       Such requests will be considered provisional until formal adjudication by OSD on the requester’s
       eligibility. No support may be provided while eligibility status is pending or until the requester is
       approved by the Secretary.
       2.1.11. Ensure that each project that is proposed to be conducted in accordance with Section 2012
       of Title 10 U.S.C. (regardless of whether additional funding from the Secretary of Defense is
       sought) is requested in writing, reviewed for full compliance with that section, and approved in
       advance of initiation by SAF/MIR, and, in the case of a project that seeks additional funding from
       the Secretary of Defense, by the Secretary of Defense.

3. Procedures.
   3.1. Requests for approval to conduct any IRT initiative must be accomplished IAW attachment 2.
       3.1.1. SAF/MIR will submit the completed, approved requests to conduct Military Training to
       OSD/RA for tracking and funding (if required).
   3.2. Funding (refer to attachment 2).
4                                                                           AFI36-2250 1 MARCH 1999

       3.2.1. Civil-Military IRT funding, provided by OSD/RA, is intended to augment the Services/
       Components training costs for their military readiness mission that may be associated with a
       project. It is not intended to support significant overhead/management costs. Any overhead costs
       need to be directly correlated and combined with the specific IRT program/project in which it sup-
       ports and retained by each Service/Component in total or by each specific project at any organiza-
       tional level. (Overhead is defined as funding in support of the overall Civil-Military Innovative
       Readiness Training program, whether O & M, Milpers, or combined.)
       3.2.2. Criteria for approval and/or funding will be based upon:
           3.2.2.1. Proposal submitted and completed in accordance with the appropriate fiscal year sub-
           mission instructions. NOTE: IRT activities will not result in a significant increase in the cost
           of the training.
           3.2.2.2. Availability of funding to support request.
    3.3. Memorandums of Agreement (MOA). OASD/RA provides MOAs to organizations at the
    beginning of each fiscal year after overall project approval.
    3.4. Reporting requirements during the project and upon project completion.
       3.4.1. After-action reports are due 60 days after project completion and should include all budget
       information for OSD/RA funded and unfunded projects; a summary of training completed; a sum-
       mary of the assistance provided; and copies of any media coverage on the assistance. At a mini-
       mum, assess the degree to which completed IRT activities have contributed to individual and unit
       mission readiness and training, and whether the IRT activity addressed the intended community or
       civic need(s).
       3.4.2. Costs shown in after-action reports must equal original submission or the report must
       explain why it doesn’t.
       3.4.3. Interim reports are not necessary for funded projects unless the project is interrupted, mod-
       ified,* or halted. NOTE* Send requests for modification by fax, email or telephone to OSD/RA,
       but don’t proceed with any modification until it is approved.
           3.4.3.1. In this case, file reports within 30 days of project cessation.

            INNOVATIVE READINESS TRAINING (IRT) PROGRAM GUIDELINES

A2.1. General : These guidelines apply to any IRT project conducted under the authority of Section
2012 of Title 10, U.S. C. and DoD Directive 1100.20, dated January 30, 1997. A General Officer level
signature is required on all project submissions. Each state and organization has unique and specific legal
requirements, therefore a legal review must be accomplished, by the unit SJA, for each project to ensure
that these legal requirements are satisfied. DoD and military leadership must ensure they afford only the
best support and services to the civilians they serve.

A2.2. PROGRAM TITLE : Civil-Military Innovative Readiness Training (IRT). This program is a
partnership between requesting community organizations and the military, therefore resource support is a
“shared” responsibility. Individual IRT projects provide commanders another opportunity to meet their
mobilization readiness requirements, enhance morale, and contribute to military recruiting and retention.
As in overseas deployments, these projects should be incorporated into future unit training plans and bud-
gets.

A2.3. FUNCTIONAL AREAS : Engineering, Medical/Healthcare/Human Services, Transportation.
The exception to this is for projects that fall under section 1.5.3.

A2.4. AUTHORITY : Department of Defense Directive 1100.20, “ Support and Services for Eligible
Organizations and Activities Outside the Department of Defense,” January 30, 1997.
