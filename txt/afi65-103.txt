                                                Chapter 1

                                                GENERAL

1.1. Administrative Orders. These instructions establish procedures and provide guidance for prepara-
tion, issue, numbering, funding, authentication, distribution and maintenance of special orders authoriz-
ing temporary duty and emergency leave travel of Air Force personnel.

1.2. General Information and Explanation of Terms:
    1.2.1. Temporary Duty (TDY) Actions. TDY is defined in JFTR, appendix A, and JTR, C4451.
    Temporary duty at any one location is limited to not more than 179 days. Exceptions must be specif-
    ically authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force. Route waiver requests through the local military
    personnel flight (MPF). JTR/JFTR references preceded by a "C" refer only to civilians and those with
    a "U" to military.
    1.2.2. Authentication. The process that makes an administrative order official. Authentication takes
    place when the signatures of the approving official (AO) and the fund certifying official and the travel
    order number are placed on the travel order.
    1.2.3. Effective Date. The date orders go into effect; usually the date shown for travel to begin.
    1.2.4. Authority to Publish Orders. In accordance with (IAW) AFI 37-128, commanders down to
    and including squadron level may publish orders. Commanders below squadron (detachment or
    flight) level may publish TDY orders when a higher level commander specifically authorizes them to
    do so. A commander may publish orders that are not within his or her jurisdiction only if the proper
    commander approves. Hospitals and aeromedical staging units may publish orders on patients who
    are members of any Air Force activity but must give copies to the patient's parent organization. Addi-
    tionally, the commander or order office of primary responsibility (OPR) may delegate orders-publish-
    ing authority.
    1.2.5. Orders Approving Official (AO). The competent authority who determines the need for an
    order, requests its publication, justifies special authorizations, and approves claims for reimbursing
    items not authorized in the order or which require administrative approval (the AO will not be the
    traveler). This official must sign manually prepared orders or requests for composed orders. He or she
    need not sign computer generated orders as long as the automated system is certified by the Defense
    Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).
    1.2.6. Heading. For the publishing headquarters, include DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE;
    complete unit designation; Major Air Command (MAJCOM) of assignment, abbreviated in parenthe-
    ses; mailing address; type and number of the order; and the date order is published. Do not postdate
    or predate. On form orders, type the designation of the publishing headquarters in upper case letters.
    On composed orders, letterhead stationery without caption may be used. See Figure 1.1. for example.
    1.2.7. Body. Write a separate paragraph for each action directed. List all persons or activities affected
    by the same action in the same paragraph. Number paragraphs when more than one is used and divide
    into subparagraphs when needed.
    1.2.8. Close. The elements of the close may include the fund citation, required distribution, unit des-
    ignation, AO signature and title, order number and issue date.
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                   5


     1.2.8.1. This section also includes address and facsimile information for other DoD agencies/Ser-
     vices when the travel voucher must be forwarded to those agencies/Services for settlement. Con-
     tact your local Financial Services Office (FSO) Travel Section for guidance when using another
     DoD component’s funds.
  1.2.9. Numbering and Dating Administrative Orders. Each order must be dated. Number in order,
  starting with number one for each fiscal year (FY). The servicing FSO will determine whether orders
  are numbered centrally by the FSO or decentralized to the units. If orders are unit numbered, the FSO
  will determine what numbering prefix is used. The order number will include type of order, special
  order (S.O.), series (T), and numerical designation. Cite, above the heading of the first order of a year,
  the number of the last order published the previous year.
  1.2.10. Citing Authority for Publication. An authority must be cited in all travel orders.
  1.2.11. Forms for Orders. Compose an order when a form can not be used but include required
  information. Computer generated orders may vary from format established for composed orders or
  form orders after which they are patterned as long as all required data are included.
  1.2.12. Series of Special Orders. Use Table 2.1, AFI 37-128, when assigning a series of special
  orders to specific actions.
  1.2.13. Information Required To Identify Personnel.
     1.2.13.1. Grade, Name and Social Security Number (SSN).
         1.2.13.1.1. Write name and grade in upper case letters, except as noted in paragraph 1.2.13.4.
         1.2.13.1.2. For composed orders, the first time a name is used state grade or title, first name,
         middle initial, last name and SSN. Subsequent use will include only grade or title and last
         name.
         1.2.13.1.3. If the person is retired include the word "Retired."
         1.2.13.1.4. Omit the SSN for individuals who do not have one, such as foreign nationals,
         exchange officers, etc.
         1.2.13.1.5. When many individuals are on an order (for example, orders directing units to per-
         form TDY), make a machine roster and photocopy it on the order.
         1.2.13.1.6. The order containing all the names and SSNs will not be given to the travelers;
         instead, a copy of the order with SSNs blanked will be provided to the travelers. Upon using
         the order, each traveler will fill in his or her SSN. The order containing all the names and
         SSNs will be used for official purposes only, i.e. FSO for funds obligation and lodging office
         to verify and track customers.
     1.2.13.2. Unit and MAJCOM of Assignment. Show each individual’s unit, MAJCOM, and
     assignment address. When a composed order is published by the unit state only "this headquarters
     (HQ)" or "this unit" in the body of the order.
     1.2.13.3. Departmental Status and Component. In orders for military personnel not in the Air
     Force, include the departmental status and component, in addition to grade, name, and service
     number or SSN. For example, CAPT MARK HESS 000-00-0000, DA (INF)" or "SQ LEADER
     JAMES W FEARS, 5167, Royal Air Force."
6                                                                           AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


       1.2.13.4. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) Agents. Omit grade in travel
       orders of AFOSI agents and use the term "Special Agent, AFOSI," instead of grade.
       1.2.13.5. Senior Executive Service (SES) or Scientific or Professional Personnel. O n a l l
       forms and composed travel orders, after the name include the position title and precedence priority
       distinguished visitor (DV) code assigned to the traveler. For example: "SES-3 Deputy Director,
       Material Management (OC-ALC) (DV-6)."
    1.2.14. Verbal Orders. Do not issue verbal orders unless absolutely necessary. Verbal orders are
    authorized only when time or error prevents written orders from being published in advance of travel.
    Verbal orders must be confirmed (in writing) as soon as possible. Include in the written order the date
    and by whom the verbal order was issued and a statement why written orders were not issued earlier.
    For example, "The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented
    written orders in advance." On form orders this can be included in the remarks block. When an order
    is published by an organization that authenticates orders for several units (host and tenant situations),
    include the unit issuing the verbal order.
       1.2.14.1. Variations in itinerary will not be included when publishing orders after travel is com-
       pleted. Instead, include specific dates and travel locations. Confirmatory travel orders must
       include the following statement: "Submit a travel voucher within 5 workdays after receipt of
       order (if travel is completed before orders are published) or after travel completion (if orders are
       published before travel is completed)." An example of a composed travel order body follows:
       The verbal orders of the Cmdr, HQ AFMC, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 1 Jun 97, directing CAPT
       DAVID F SMITH, 123-45-6789, HQ AFMC/IGA, this stn, to proceed on 1 Jun 97 from
       Wright-Patterson AFB OH to Edwards AFB CA on TDY for approximately 5 days to perform
       tests in connection with aircraft stress testing and to return to Wright-Patterson AFB OH, are con-
       firmed. Circumstances prevented written orders in advance. (SITE VISIT) TDN. Submit a travel
       voucher within 5 workdays after orders receipt.
       1.2.14.2. A DD form 1610 may be used for a confirmatory order. If it is put the word "CONFIR-
       MATORY" in block 8 and the required statement in block 16.
    1.2.15. Changes to Orders-Amendments, Rescissions, and Revocations. A m e n d a n o r d e r t o
    change data in it. Rescind an order when some action has been taken on the published order, such as a
    Government Transportation Request. Revoke an order when no action occurs against the original
    order. To amend, rescind, or revoke an order, use AF Form 973, Request and Authorization for
    Changes of Administrative Orders, or a composed order if AF Form 973 is not practical. Publish
    amendments, rescissions, and revocations in the same series as the original order. Do not use blanket
    statements such as “Previous orders are rescinded” or "This order supersedes all previously published
    orders."
       1.2.15.1. Who May Publish. An order may be amended, rescinded, or revoked by the organiza-
       tion that published the original order. Exception: Hospitals and aeromedical staging units may
       publish orders on patients who are members of any Air Force activity, but must provide copies to
       the patient's parent organization.
       1.2.15.2. How to Complete AF Form 973, Request and Authorization for Change of Adminis-
       trative Orders. Complete the items needed to make the change, as shown in Figure 1.1.
       1.2.15.3. Publish An Amendment:
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 7


        1.2.15.3.1. To add, delete, or change pertinent data to read as originally intended. Refer to
        paragraph 1.2.15.7. for additional information.
        1.2.15.3.2. To correct inaccurate first and middle names and initials and other personal data on
        invitational travel orders, and on other TDY orders when required for an individual to enter a
        foreign country.
        1.2.15.3.3. To add or change a travel advance payment statement(paragraph 2.1.5. and Figure
        2.1., item 16y).
     1.2.15.4. Do Not Publish An Amendment:
        1.2.15.4.1. To replace one name with another.
        1.2.15.4.2. To correct appropriation data. Refer to Department of Defense Financial Manage-
        ment Regulation (FMR) Volume 9, Travel Policy and Procedures, paragraph 020205.B.
        1.2.15.4.3. For after the fact approval in some instances. Some JFTR/JTR provisions provide
        for after the fact approval (e.g., special conveyances). In this case the approval is not a retro-
        active amendment. Such expenses are claimed on the voucher and approved by the AO signa-
        ture on the DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher. (The traveler should obtain AO
        approval prior to incurring expenses not previously authorized.) Refer to FMR, Volume 9,
        paragraph 020204.B.
        1.2.15.4.4. To add an individual after the original TDY order has been published. Publish a
        new order.
        1.2.15.4.5. To delete an individual. Rescind/revoke in part the original order that pertains to
        the person.
        1.2.15.4.6. To change an effective date after it has passed. Revoke the expired order and pub-
        lish a new one.
        1.2.15.4.7. To change meal direction after the fact. The AO (pen and ink) circles the correct
        item or itemizes the changes as necessary. AO signature is required. See Figure 2.1. and
        Attachment 2 for specific instructions.
        1.2.15.4.8. To change personal data except as noted in paragraph 1.2.15.3. When orders con-
        tain erroneous data (e.g., misspelled names, incorrect social security number (SSN) or incor-
        rect grades), the traveler may make and initial changes.

                              Instructions for Preparing AF Form 973.
NOTE: Rescind an order when some action has been taken on the published order, such as travel
advance, Government Transportation Request (GTR), etc. Revoke an order when no action occurred
against the original order. Amend an order to change data in it. If the order is being revoked only as it
pertains to some, but not all, individuals in the basic order type the words "IN PART" after you mark the
"Revoked" block. This is not necessary if it is already preprinted on the form.
Items 1A through C, 8, and 11 through 16 are self explanatory.
Item 2--Include all previous amendments.
Item 3--(Relating to TDY). Include original TDY action.
Item 4--(Identification of Individual to Whom Change Action Pertains). Do not use this form if the orig-
inal order pertained to the appointment of a board or committee; use a composed order. When an amend-
ment applies to everyone listed on the basic order, use the statement, "same as basic order" instead of
repeating names on the amending order.
Item 5A--(Amendment). When indicating a change in wording, underscore the portion changed and what
it is changed to read.
Item 5B--(Is Amended to (Include) (Delete)). Cross out the one that does not apply.
Item 6--(Remarks). Include information not covered by preceding items, for example, the authority for
the action when required, etc. You may also use this item to continue preceding items when more space
is required.
Item 7--(Accounting Citation). Include fund citation from original order. If the member is placed in TDY
hold status by HQ AFPC, add ALPHA code "P" (Per Diem). Initials of the fund approving official are
required on amendatory order when additional funds are being spent, such as a TDY extension, travel to
additional TDY points, etc.
Items 8 through 16-- Self-explanatory.
                                         ___________________
       1.2.15.5. When to Rescind an Order. Rescind an order when it is no longer needed: for exam-
       ple, if an individual has blanket or repeated travel orders and goes PCS, completes a project, or has
       a change in duty assignment.
       1.2.15.6. When to Revoke an Order. Revoke an order before it has gone into effect. The AO
       determines when to revoke "T" series travel orders and notifies the office that published the order
       by memorandum. The AO will rescind the order with an AF Form 973, if travelers made prepara-
       tory travel expenses. Officials may use a letter to cancel TDY orders and deobligate funds pertain-
       ing to TDY orders. When using a letter, the subject will include the number and date of the order
       being revoked, e.g. "Revocation of S.O. T-1234, dated May 15, 1997.” Include in the body of the
       letter the traveler's name, SSN, organization, and rationale for travel cancellation. The requesting
       official must sign and date the letter.
       1.2.15.7. Retroactive amendments to increase or decrease the amount of money due the traveler
       must be fully justified (24 Comp Gen 439). Written requests for such amendments must clearly
       show the original order was unclear, incomplete, or lacked necessary information. Orders publish-
       ing agencies should look carefully at requests for such amendment to ensure the amendment and
10                                                                          AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


        the reasons given agree with this Comptroller General decision. Circumstances permitting an
        amendment to authorize additional payment are so rare that claims based on them are seldom
        allowed. Instead, the travel claim with amended orders should be submitted to the General
        Accounting Office through DFAS, with a statement of facts and circumstances. A written amend-
        ment confirming a verbal order is not included in this category provided the verbal order was
        issued on or before the effective date of the directed change.
        1.2.15.8. If an order is revoked or rescinded and replaced immediately by a new order from the
        same organization, the new order may also announce the revocation or rescission. In the remarks
        section of form orders, add the statement in uppercase letters: "THIS ORDER REVOKES OR
        RESCINDS (ORDER NUMBER AND DATE.)" In composed orders, make this statement the last
        paragraph.
        1.2.15.9. When an order is revoked, it no longer exists as an official document. Once rescinded,
        although still an official document, it no longer can be used. Do not revoke a revocation or rescis-
        sion; instead publish a new order.
     1.2.16. Corrected Copies:
        1.2.16.1. Publish a corrected copy of an order only to correct an error in the publishing headquar-
        ters, travel order number, or date. For example enter "CORRECTED COPY-DESTROY ALL
        OTHER T-12345, dtd 5 Oct 97" (cite incorrect number and date) at the top of the corrected copy.
        Use the same heading and close used on the original composed or form order, correcting only
        those portions requiring correction. Double underscore the corrected portion. Distribute the same
        as original order. See paragraphs 1.2.15.3. and 1.2.15.4. for criteria to amend orders.
     1.2.17. True Copies. You may reproduce any order or portion of it, as a true copy or a true extract
     copy. Include the same heading and close as the original composed or form order, and the statement
     "A TRUE COPY" or "A TRUE EXTRACT COPY." In a true extract copy, include only the
     required information. For example, if a paragraph is on several individuals, include only the name of
     the one for whom you need a copy. Use asterisks to indicate omitted material. Individuals authorized
     to authenticate orders according to paragraph 1.2.2., may authenticate true copies or true extract cop-
     ies.
     1.2.18. Printed Information on Reverse of Orders. You may print information on the reverse of
     special orders to make the job simpler. Suggested order back is at Figure 2.2.
     1.2.19. Record Copies-Maintenance, Disposition, Retrieval, and Review. For information on:
     length of orders
     and continuation lines, paper size, margins, and numbering refer to AFI 37-128. Disposition instruc-
     tions may be found in AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities.
     1.2.20. Orders Distribution. For general information see AFI 37-128. In addition, those units
     authorized to publish travel orders must ensure a copy of each travel order is forwarded to the FSO
     within one duty day of the date published. Faxed copies are allowed.
     1.2.21. Orders Reproduction. Orders reproduction is the responsibility of the unit issuing the
     orders.
     1.2.22. Maximum Time Periods for TDY. Active duty Air Force personnel are not placed on
     funded TDY (including travel time to and from) at any one location for more than 179 days. Refer to
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                            11


  AFI 36-2110, Assignments, for waiver criteria or contact your MPF. Temporary duty to attend
  courses of instruction must not exceed 20 weeks (not counting travel time to and from) at any one
  location. Holidays or periods when classes are suspended do not serve to extend course duration (53
  Comp Gen 218). Reserve components are limited to 20 weeks TDY without a waiver (reference
  JFTR U7150 A.4.).
  1.2.23. Attendants and Escorts. Authorized types of orders that may be published for attendants
  and escorts vary on a case-by-case. For more information see Table 1.1. and contact your local FSO.
  1.2.24. Forms to be Used for TDY. Use a DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY
  Travel of DoD Personnel, when practical, to publish TDY orders. See the general example in Figure
  2.1. and specific examples in Figure 2.1. and Figure 2.2.. DoD personnel include civilian employees,
  military members, and military retirees. Use either a DD Form 1610 or a composed order for blanket,
  permissive and repeated TDY orders. AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency Leave
  Travel, will be used for funded emergency leave of military members and accompanying dependents.
  Use an AF Form 937, Request and Authorization for Dependent(s) Travel, when dependents travel
  alone.
  1.2.25. Contingency, Exercise, Mobility (CEM) Orders. Specific instructions for CEM orders are
  contained in AFI 10-215, Personnel Support for Contingency Operations. (PERSCO).

                                                 Chapter 2

                                              TDY ORDERS

2.1. Qualifications and Responsibilities of the Orders Approving Official (AO).
     2.1.1. Qualifications. Commanders must ensure their AOs are of sufficient rank and training to make
     sound decisions about the TDY mission. The AO is an individual having the capability to validate
     TDY requirements and approve/disapprove travel requirements for mission accomplishment.
     2.1.2. Determine the need for TDY. Temporary duty is conducted to meet mission requirements
     only. Do not permit travel when a letter, telephone, message, or less expensive means will do. Keep
     the number of people who must travel to a minimum; for example, never allow two or more persons
     to travel when one person can do the job. Determine if personnel near the temporary duty station can
     do the job. Combine missions to carry out multipurpose results, thereby cutting unnecessary trips,
     number of persons traveling, places to be visited, variations in itineraries, and length of trips. Keep
     personnel participation at conferences, meetings, and seminars to a minimum when travel is at gov-
     ernment expense (including nonappropriated funds) and does not relate directly to the accomplish-
     ment of the mission (refer to DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, for official travel not at
     government expense). Review and reauthorize, if needed, blanket and repeated travel orders. Ensure
     travel is kept to the minimum necessary to carry out command or unit mission. Screen requests for
     foreign travel to keep U.S. attendance at foreign conferences to minimum. If possible, use U.S. per-
     sonnel located at or near the conference site, and assure compliance with the DoD Foreign Clearance
     Guide before travel begins. Coordinate local transportation requirements when sponsoring meetings
     and conferences to keep costs at an absolute minimum, including reducing the need for rental cars.
        2.1.2.1. For off-base lodging, require the traveler to coordinate with the commercial activity to
        determine if the location is tax exempt and if so, the forms and actions required to gain the neces-
        sary tax exemption. The traveler will take advantage of the tax exemption where ever allowed to
        help reduce TDY costs.
        2.1.2.2. When the AO has written permission to cite funds from another organization, the AO
        relies upon the funding organization for guidance relevant to special authorizations and meal
        direction (refer to paragraph 3.2. and Attachment 2).
     2.1.3. Modes of Transportation. Government travel will not be procured from a travel agency other
     than the TMO/CTO. Direct government procured transportation except:
        2.1.3.1. When a specific mode of travel, for example, military air is directed in the order.
        2.1.3.2. For limited instances of travel abroad.
        2.1.3.3. When using a privately owned conveyance (POC). Travelers should be permitted to use
        a POC if they desire and the mission does not require travel by another mode.
     2.1.4. Other Information for Orders Approving Officials (AOs). Provide written authorization
     for persons to escort or handcarry classified information.
        2.1.4.1. Approve requests to handcarry classified information according to AFI 31-401, Manag-
        ing the Information Security Program.
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                15


     2.1.4.2. Ensure civilian contractor plants and Air Force plant representatives office (AFPRO) are
     notified before travel is made to those type of organizations.
     2.1.4.3. Take full responsibility special authorization approvals.
     2.1.4.4. Determine meal direction for travelers billeted on a military installation or when meals
     are provided in a conference registration. See item 16, Figure 2.1. and Figure 2.2. and Attach-
     ment 2. Refer to AFI 34-602, Government Quarters and Dining Facilities, to determine meal
     availability on Air Force installations. Until confirmed otherwise, presume meals are available
     on Army, Navy, and Marine installations.
     2.1.4.5. Ensure each travel authorization contains a statement indicating whether the traveler is
     authorized to purchase transportation tickets using a centrally billed account (CBA) or an individ-
     ually billed account (IBA).
  2.1.5. FSO Travel Advance Eligibility Statements. Include a travel advance payment statement as
  prescribed by Figure 2.1., item 16y. This requirement is the result of the DoD Standard Travel
  Advance Policy. The Policy specifies the travel advance payable based on the eligibility of personnel
  for a government contractor-issued travel charge card. The travel advance will be based on the travel
  advance statement (specified by Figure 2.1., item 16y). If the order does not contain a travel advance
  statement, payment by FSOs SHALL NOT BE MADE UNLESS AN AMENDED TRAVEL
  ORDER IS PUBLISHED. Note: A travel advance is not authorized except when the mission limits
  ATM availability, advance conference fees are required for non-Air Force sponsored meetings and/or
  conferences as addressed in AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph 4.42,
  the member has applied for a government travel charge card and the card has not arrived (proof of
  application required before advance is made), or when the traveler’s card was withdrawn for cause.
     2.1.5.1. For TDYs over 30 days, the FSO will provide alternative pay methods for cardholders.
     For TDYs longer than 30 days the following two alternative pay services will normally be pro-
     vided to the traveler:
         2.1.5.1.1. Compute an advance based on the orders and EFT the advance to the travelers bank
         account the day the trip starts. This method requires only one transaction and the traveler will
         have the money in his or her checking account to pay the government travel charge card bill on
         time. It is the travelers’s responsibility to contact the government travel charge card 1-800
         number to determine the amount owed.
         2.1.5.1.2. Compute the advance based on the orders and suspend an EFT payment to be made
         automatically every 30 days for the length of the trip. This method will reduce the total
         amount of cash advances but will require additional transactions.
     2.1.5.2. Fund estimates are always required on TDY orders when self-type (local) funding is
     cited.
     2.1.5.3. At the discretion of the local FSO, Fund Summary Record and Program Summary Record
     addresses may be entered on TDY travel requests.
  2.1.6. TDY to High Threat Areas. Annotate TDY orders when travel is to designated high threat
  areas to reflect compliance with the DoD Travel Security Policy. Refer to the DoD Foreign Clearance
  Guide, contact the local Antiterrorism Representative, or OSI Detachment to determine current high
  threat areas. The policy requires individuals to travel by AMC air or AMC charter to the maximum
  extent possible, receive briefings on availability and use of fee passports by the local passport agent,
16                                                                         AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


     and receive terrorist threat briefings and suggested personal travel precautions by designated local
     officials prior to travel.
        2.1.6.1. Military members must, and civilians and dependents may, familiarize themselves with
        AFI 36-2209, Survival and Code of Conduct Training, for training and education measures nec-
        essary to support the Code of Conduct.
        2.1.6.2. In addition, atch the Antiterrorism Travel Order Coversheet (AFVA 208-3) to the TDY
        orders before giving to the traveler.
     2.1.7. Travel Order Personnel Tempo (PersTempo) Codes. Include, in the “Remarks” block of
     the order, the appropriate “Travel Order PersTempo Code” and corresponding definition title listed in
     Table 2.1. This code is used in the voucher settlement process to flow information back to the person-
     nel system. Additional information on the Duty Status Codes that fall under each “Travel Order Per-
     sTempo Code” can be found in AFI 36-2134. A travel voucher supported by an order that does not
     have a “Travel Order PersTempo Code” will be processed as an “Q” Travel Order PersTempo Code
     during settlement. This travel will not accumulate for the payment of high-deployment (Burdensome
     Tempo) pay.

Item 2-Included Name (uppercase letters) last, first, middle initials.
  a. If an order is for several people, include data for no more than 2 in items 2, 3, 4, and 6; then put in
item 2 “See item 16” and type remaining names and data in item 16, space permitting.
  b. If space in item 16 does not permit, include “See reserve” in item 2 and type all names and other
information on plain bond paper so it can be reproduced on the order back.

Item 4-Position Title and Grade or Rating.
Item 5-Official Station.
Item 6-Organizational Element.
Item 8-Type of Orders.
Item-9-Purpose of TDY:
   a. Do not use a general statement, such as “USAF Matter” or “Official Business”. Use a clear concise
statement which portrays the travel purpose. Also include one of the following categories of travel most
closely describing the order purpose:
        (1) Site Visit. Visit to a site perform operational or managerial activities. Example include: over-
see programs, grant operations, or management acitivities for internal control purposes; carry out an audit,
inspection, or repair acitivity; conduct negotiations; provide instructions; and provide technical assis-
tance.
        (2) Information Meeting. Attend a meeting to discuss general agency operations, review status
reports or discuss topics of general interest. If a site visit was conducted as part of the same trip, consider
the entire trip a site visit.
       (3) Training Attendance. To receive training.
        (4) Speech or Presentation. To make a speech or presentation, deliver a paper, or otherwise take
part in a formal program other than a training course.
       (5) Conference Attendance. To attend a conference, convention, seminar, or symposium for pur-
poses of observation or education only with no formal role in the proceedings.
         (6) Entitlement Travel. Travel to which the employee, member, or their dependents are entitled as
a result of an assignment; for example, official vacation or home level; medical emergency, and educa-
tional travel.
Item lOa-(Approx Number of Days). Show the number of days TDY, plus travel time from PDS to TDY
locations (or locations) and return. DO NOT include delay enroute or ordinary leave in this item.
      a. If traveler remains on TDY for more days than shown, the order need not be amended if the
number of days on TDY is no more than 100 percent or 7 days, whichever is less. For example, if 5 days
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  21


TDY are authorized and the traveler remains on TDY for 10 days, an amendment is not necessary. In this
example, if the traveler was required to remain on TDY for 11 days, then an amendment must be pub-
lished extending TDY.
         b. For repeated orders, leave blank and place a statement in item 16 showing number of trips to be
taken.
         c. For BTOs, leave blank.
       d. For permissive TDY, show specific number of days, including travel time. Cross out the word
"approximate."
         e. For special leave always enter "15."
NOTE: For military personnel, extension beyond 179 days TDY requires prior Secretarial approval.
Enter in item 16 SAF approval was granted according to AFI 36-2110 (as applicable) by (Cite letter or
message, and date).
Item lOb-(Proceed O/A Date). The on or about date is valid for 7 days before or after date shown, as long
as the traveler does not depart before the date the order is authenticated. For example, if the date shown
on the order is 7 May 97 and the traveler does not depart until 14 May 97, no amendment is needed. If the
traveler leaves on 15 May 97, publish a new order. For blanket and repeated travel orders and special
leave orders, show inclusive dates. For example, NET 1 Oct 97-NLT 30 Sept 98.
22                                                                             AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


NOTES:
  1. If a new order is done on the same traveler (or travelers) because the effective date is passed, the
     old order may be revoked or rescinded in the remarks section of the new order.

        EXAMPLE: SO TA 1945, 6 MAY 97, RELATING TO ABOVE INDIVIDUAL (OR INDIVIDU-
        ALS) IS REVOKED. (If travel advances were paid or if a GTR or MTA has been processed, even
        if they are returned to the FSO or TMO, the order must be rescinded not revoked.)
     2. When delay enroute is authorized, proceed date is based on when the traveler will depart duty sta-
        tion.
Item 11-(Variation Authorized):
         a. Only use when absolutely necessary (see paragraph 3.4. for guidance). Do not authorize varia-
tions in repeated, blanket, or permissive TDY orders. Only use it in confirmatory orders when the traveler
has not yet returned and the remainder of the itinerary is incomplete. If the order is requested after the
travel is completed, do not authorize variations. Instead, put in place(s) where TDY was performed (in
exact order).
        b. (Itinerary-FROM) Enter the word "FROM. " Use location where traveler is assigned or
located; for example, permanent station, leave address, TDY point when new orders are being published
for further TDY, or station where assigned for a special or short tour of AD. If traveler is at a leave
address, TDY station, or a short or special tour of AD, enter in item 16: "Presently on (TDY, short tour of
AD, or leave) per (include information to identify order)".
        c. (Itinerary-TO) enter the word "TO." When unclassified, show specific location where TDY
will be performed; for example, unit and military installation (air base; air station; site; test range; foreign,
U.S. or state agency; or building and city, and state or country. Do not indicate a military installation near
the TDY location merely to save per diem costs. However, if official business is going to be conducted on
that installation it should be shown on the order. Do not show enroute stops where no TDY will be per-
formed. For BTOs, include: "Will proceed as many times as necessary to any point (within or within and
outside) (CONUS, Europe, etc.)". For special leave enter the POD in CONUS specified by TMO.
        d. (Itinerary-RETURN TO) Enter the words "RETURN TO." As a rule, return will be shown to
the traveler's permanent station.
                 (1) If traveler is ordered to TDY from a leave address, and is to revert to leave status,
     include in item 16: "Upon completion return from TDY will revert to leave status, (number) days
     leave authorized."
                 (2) If traveler is ordered on further TDY from a TDY point, and is to return to first TDY
     station, include in item 16: "Upon completion return to (TDY station) and comply with existing
     orders."
NOTE: When "FROM" and "RETURN TO" addresses differ from the organization publishing the order,
the ZIP Code on those showing an Air Force Base is not required; for all others, include a complete
address; for example, street, city, state and if known, the entire ZIP Code.
Item 12-(Mode of Transportation). For CONUS travel, do not use this section to authorize or direct any
mode of travel. Instead, indicate the authorized or directed mode of travel in block 16. For transoceanic
travel, unless the traveler has been authorized to personally procure transportation per paragraph 3.3.12.,
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                   23


check the block "as determined by appropriate transportation officer." Cross out "(Overseas travel only)"
and type in "Transoceanic Travel." Review restrictions in JTR, paragraph C2001, before directing or
authorizing travel by government aircraft for civilian employees.
Item 13-(Per Diem Authorized). Not used unless a reduced or increased rate is prescribed; then enter an
"X" in the block (other rate of per diem) and add: "Per diem $_______ authorized according to (cite
authority)." See the JTRs, paragraph U4135-C (military travelers) or C4550-1 (civilian travelers). For
special leave, enter "NO PER DIEM AUTHORIZED (AFI 36-3003)".
Item 14-Complete on all for self specific allotment funded (local funds) TDYs.
Item 15-(Advance Authorized). Not required. See JTR, paragraphs C1103-1 and C3150-2, item 15.
Item 16-(Remarks). Used for instructions, special authorizations and other pertinent information. The
following statements are provided as examples and should be used as required. (Frequently used state-
ments or instructions may be preprinted on the reverse of the DD Form 1610, see Figure 2.2., and the
applicable item numbers referenced in item 16. Type the following: "The following items on the reverse
apply;" (List the number of each applicable item).
        a. Meal Direction Statement. For travel to military installations and except for field duty or inpa-
tient orders, list all the following meal direction options on the order back and make a statement in block
16 which item applies:
               1) All government meals are available and directed.
               2) Partial government meals are available and directed.
               3) Government meals are not available or directed.
Changes to meal direction are allowed after the fact by the AO if necessary (Figure 2.2.). Circle the cor-
rect option and sign by the circle. Note: Entitlements may only be increased after the fact. For more
complex changes involving a number of days, indicate changes specifically by day, providing the first let-
ter of the revised entitlement. For example, if the AO wants to upgrade days 3, 7, 8, and 9 to locality rate
and 6 and 10 to proportional rate, the change would look like this: 3L, 7L, 8L, 9L, 6P 10P. The AO signs
in the space provided. Note: The beginning and ending days of travel are automatically computed using
75% of the locality rate.
        b. Reporting Instructions. For Schools or Courses of Instruction, reporting instructions are
required. Reporting instructions are optional for other types of TDY. For schools or course of instruction
include class entry date. If applicable, include: "During the period of TDY, individual is attached to (unit)
for administration." Include the following statement in all school orders: "Individual will report to TDY
station no earlier than ______ (hour and date) or no later than _______ (hour and date) and will depart
TDY station NLT 1 day after course completion."
NOTE: For information on reporting dates when attending more than one course, see AFI 36-2110.
Reporting instructions are in AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools or will come from the quota control
agency.
        c. Acting Transportation Officers. If traveler is to be designated as an Acting Transportation
Officer, include: "Individual is designated an Acting Transportation Officer for the purpose of issuing
transportation requests and will comply with AFI 24-101.”
24                                                                           AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


        d. Commercial Transportation Arrangements. Usually, state “Per AFI 24-101, Government pro-
cured transportation directed; contact your Commercial Travel Office (CTO) or Traffic Management
Office (TMO) as soon as possible.”
        e. Travel at no expense to the Government. If traveler is taking part in a public ceremony or dem-
onstration, and expenses are paid by the sponsoring agency, include: "Travel will be performed at no
expense to the government; expenses will be borne by (organization)."
        f. Recoupment of Expenses. If the Air Force is to recoup travel costs of travel from Service, gov-
ernment agency, or a foreign government, include: "Recoupment of expenses incident to this order will
be effected by USAF from (agency concerned)."
        g. Permissive TDY:
                 (1) To authorize permissive TDY together with official TDY, for permitting individuals or
     groups such as bands to perform at unofficial functions, include: "Permissive TDY at no expense to
     the government authorized from (hour and date) to (hour and date) for the purpose of (state purpose,
     for example, performing at officer and NCO open messes, etc.)." If the permissive TDY is for a pur-
     pose other than the one shown above, include: "no more than ____ days permissive TDY, including
     travel time, is authorized at no expense to the government for the purpose of (state purpose)." See
     Figure 2.5.
                 (2) For permissive TDY not in conjunction with official TDY, see paragraph 2.6. For
     required statements, see Figure 2.5.
       h. Group Travel. If travel falls within the purview of JTR, paragraph U4000, include: "This is a
group travel order."
        i. Contingency, Exercise, and Mobility (CEM) TDY. See AFI 10-215.
        j. Casualty Reporting Information. Include the following on orders for members assigned to geo-
graphically separated units (GSU): "Casualty reporting information: Member's UPRGP is maintained at
(location of Personnel Flight maintaining records)."
       k. Repeated TDY Travel. Include: "Traveler is authorized to perform (number) round trips each
(week, month, year, or during period indicated in item 10b)."
         l. Exercises and Maneuvers. If TDY is associated with exercise, maneuver, or other similar activ-
ity, the dates of the actual period of the exercise as explained in the exercise plan must be included. For
example: "The actual period of (name of maneuver, exercise, etc.) is from (date) to (date)."
         m. Travel by Privately Owned Conveyance. If more than one traveler will be in an official travel
status traveling in a privately owned conveyance, add the names of those persons and show who's driving.
For example: "(Name of traveler) will be a passenger in a privately owned conveyance driven by (name
of driver) or (name of traveler) will be accompanied by (name of passenger) in his or her privately owned
conveyance." If all or some of the people are listed on the same order, it's easier to asterisk the names, for
example, one for the driver and two for the passengers, and explain in item 16. For example: "*driver,
**passenger."
       n. Registration/Conference Fee. If a fee is required to attend federally or nonfederally sponsored
meetings, include: "Registration fee is approved on _________ (date) in the amount of $_______ which:
(a) covers cost of ___ meals and ___ nights lodging at $_______ per night, (b) covers no meals or lodg-
ing. (Authority: JTR, C4708 (Civilian), JFTR, U4535 (Military). See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  25


4.42 for more information on registration fees. Note: If conference fees include meals, per diem rates are
adjusted downward to PPD or incidentals, whichever applies.
         o. Leave Information. Complete when leave is granted for reasons other than to cover excess
travel time. Enter number of days authorized; and when possible, the emergency telephone number; and
the address of the leave point. For civilian employees only enter the number of days authorized. Do not
use a TDY order to account for leave taken prior to departure from or after return to the PDS, whether
civilian or military.
       p. Excess Baggage Authorized Per Person. Authorization for excess baggage, when approved
(paragraph 3.3.14.), include "Excess baggage of pd/pieces authorized."
       q. Aero Club Aircraft. Include: "Use of aero club aircraft is authorized." This is not a special
authorization but reimbursement is limited to cost of Government Transportation Request (GTR)_______.
(JFTR paragraph U3210 and JTR paragraph C2053)
        r. For travel abroad, refer to the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide.
        s. TDY to Military Installations. Add the following statement: "Per diem is based on the avail-
ability of government quarters (military and civilian)and mess (military). For travel to military installa-
tions, advance lodging reservations are mandatory to maximize the use of government quarters and for
more efficient use of per diem. Contact the TDY location’s lodging operation immediately to make reser-
vations. If on-base lodging is not available, the lodging office will make reservations in contract quarters
or provide nonavailability information." This statement is not necessary on medical inpatient orders.
       t. Special Leave. Add: "Member is authorized special leave and space required transportation to
the nearest port in the 48 contiguous states and return transportation from the port to the PDS. Authority:
1 U.S.C. 705 and AFI 36-3003."
        u. Return to Duty Travel. See paragraph 2.7. and Figure 2.6. for a sample order using a DD Form
1610.
        v. TDY 30 Days or More. When published by the member's unit add: "Report to MPF/DPMUO
prior to departure."
w. Promotional Items. On funded orders add: "Accept no promotional items, for example gifts, bonus
tickets, etc."
        x. Charge Card/Travel Advance Statements. See paragraphs 16y through 16ab for guidance. If
further guidance is needed, contact your local FSO.
       y. If allowing a travel advance, orders will so state. If the order does not include a travel advance
statement, travel advance by FSOs shall not be authorized unless an amended travel order is published.
When multiple travelers are listed on the TDY order, designate the applicable travel advance payment
statement for each traveler as follows: Place the letter identifier, or item number listed on the reverse of
the order identifying the appropriate statement, after the SSN. For example: Smith, John H.,
123-45-6789 (A).
      z. Includes address and facsimile information for other DoD agencies/services when the travel
voucher must be forwarded to those agencies/services for settlement. Contact your local FSO for guid-
ance when using another DoD component’s funds.

                (1) Cardholder: Person issued a government travel charge card or who has turned-down
     issuance of the card.
                 (2) Non-cardholders: Personnel who have declined to apply for or accept the government
     travel charge card and personnel who have applied for, but have not received, their government travel
     charge card as of the effective date of the travel.
                (3) Ineligible personnel are those personnel who have been denied the card by their com-
     mander or supervisor or whose government travel charge card has been suspended or revoked because
     of account delinquency.
        ab. Travel advance statements shown in the travel orders:
                (1) Cardholder-If the traveler is a cardholder, the following statement applies: "Advance
     by FSO is not authorized. Traveler has a government travel charge card and PIN, which will be used
     for ATM cash advances for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) plus miscellaneous expenses."
                (2) Cardholder-When specific item/s cannot be charged, for example, registration fees for
     non-Air Force conferences. In addition to the statement in aa(l), add: "Travel card cannot be used to
     charge (insert item). Advance from FSO limited to actual or estimated cost of specified item."
                (3) When the traveler meets one of the following conditions:
        (a) Has card/PIN, but circumstances preclude use of both charge and ATM cash advance features
        (b) Is ineligible for card
      (c) Has applied for, but not received card/PIN. The following statement applies: "Traveler
advance by FSO is approved. Limit advance to 80% of all authorized and allowable expenses."
       (d) Requires an advance for non-Air Force conference fees and those fees may not be charged to
the government travel charge card.
                 (4) FSO travel advance payment cannot exceed 45 days of authorized and allowable
     expenses, except when the AO authorizes, in the order, an advance of expenses for a longer period of
     time as warranted by the nature of the travel. For example: Traveler will be TDY 60 days to a loca-
     tion where travel pay service will not be available, and there is neither an ATM, mail service or check
     cashing facility available and the government contractor-issued travel charge card cannot be used.
     The AO may authorize an FSO travel advance of up to 60 days. In addition to the statement in
     aa(3)(c), the following statement will be shown in orders: "Traveler authorized to receive a travel
     advance payment for XX days."
Item 17-(Requesting Official). You may use this item when required by command or local instruction.
Item 18-(Approving Official (Type Grade and Title), and Signature). If item 17 is not used for a request-
ing official, the name, grade, and title may be put there and the signature in item 18. The AO will not be
the same as the traveler. Note: Facsimile (fax) copies and signatures are allowed for voucher settlement.
This freedom applies to all forms prescribed by this AFI.
Item 19-(Accounting Citation.)
       a. Unit Information. To the left and directly under the words "Accounting Citation" enter the des-
ignation and location of the publishing headquarters.
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                    27


       b. Accounting Classification. Enter accounting classification used to fund the travel, normally
from the publishing unit, unless authority was granted to use funds of another unit. DO NOT include
accounting citations on permissive TDY orders or transportation authorizations.
              (1) When using funds of another unit, a copy of the authority will be provided to the FSO
   when processing travel orders. A designated official must initial to indicate authenticity and accuracy
   of the fund citation.
              (2) Travel requests not funded by AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA) or AF
   Form 402, Obligation Authority or Sub-allotment, must contain the signature of the official certifying
   fund availability.
              (3) When citing multiple funds, include TDY location to which they apply in parenthesis
   following the fund cite. If there is not enough space for accounting classification (or classifications)
   and accompanying instructions (if required), state "See Reverse," and enter information on a separate
   sheet of bond paper.
            (4) When travel is chargeable directly or indirectly to a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case
   or FMS administrative surcharge money, include one of the following statements after fund citation.
   "FMS Case (number)" or "FMS surcharge."
              (5) For the, Customer Identification Code (CIC) number (for travel to, within, or from an
   overseas area, when travel will be performed by scheduled AMC aircraft)--contact your Traffic Man-
   agement Office.
               (6) Distribution will be placed in the remaining space of this block.
        c. Travel involving Two FYs. Orders published before 1 Oct, including travel entitlements to be
earned in the next FY, must cite both the current and next FY appropriations. This allows a traveler to be
paid a travel advance (if so authorized) and to arrange for transportation. The FSO certifies current year
funds only, and validates the accounting classification for the next FY. A qualifying statement concerning
fund availability for the next FY is not required. After the start of the new FY, determine if funds are
available and record the obligation. If funds are not available and travel has not begun, act to have TDY
order revoked.
Item 20-(Order Authorizing Official). (May be signed or official seal may be used.) On computer gener-
ated orders, the word "official" may be used in lieu of a seal or signature. The order authorizing official
and fund certifying official should not be the same individual. Completing this block is not required if
block 18 is signed.
        d. Facsimile (faxed) Funds Certification. Faxed funds certification is allowed IAW local FSO
policy. Specifically, an organization may fax a travel order for certification to the activity responsible for
the funds (normally the installation comptroller organization), the funds are then certified and obligation
entered. The order is then faxed back to the organization for publication.

2.3. Blanket Temporary Duty Orders (BTOs). A limited number of BTOs may be published for indi-
viduals who anticipate 12 or more trips per FY, within certain geographical limits, to perform regularly
assigned duties. BTOs will not be issued based solely on an individual's grade or position. Frequency of
travel must be the determining factor. BTOs continue in effect until expiration or rescission. BTOs are
only effective during one FY and will not be used for any one trip in excess of 179 days. If trip goes over
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  29


into a new FY, publish a second order to cover that period. If BTOs are required for the same people in
the next FY, publish new orders. The fund-approving official must sign the request for orders, indicating
funds are available and accounting classification is accurate. See Figure 2.3. for sample.
   2.3.1. Authority for Publication. BTOs may be approved by the Chief Of Staff, HQ USAF, and the
   commander of a major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA), or a direct reporting
   unit (DRU). These commanders may further delegate approval authority to reasonable, appropriate
   lower levels. This may be done by supplementing this regulation.
   2.3.2. Order Content. BTOs require the same data as other TDY orders (see Figure 2.1. and Figure
   2.1.), except the geographical area of travel must be specified. State effective and expiration dates. In
   addition, government meals are directed until adjusted upward, as necessary, by the AO after the TDY.
   Add the following statement, "Accept no promotional items, for example, gifts, bonus tickets, etc.”
   See Figure 2.3. for sample information for the reverse of a BTO.
       2.3.2.1. Example of a Composed Blanket Travel Order: C O L M A R A L I N C D E W E Y,
       123-45-6789, this HQ, will proceed at such times as may be necessary during the period 1 Oct 97
       to 30 Sept 98, both dates inclusive, from Wash DC to any point within continental limits of the
       U.S. on TDY in connection with duty as Director of Administration; and upon completion of each
       mission will return to Wash DC. (Speech or Presentation). Since your per diem is based on the
       availability of billeting and mess, when TDY to military installations contact the base billeting
       officer to see if they are available. Government meals are directed. Accept no promotional items,
       for example, gifts, bonus tickets, etc. (Cite the proper accounting classification and customer iden-
       tification code.) Items 1 and 2b through 5 on reverse apply. Authority AFI 36-2110.
   2.3.3. Endorsement to Blanket TDY orders. Special authorizations (paragraph 3.2.) requiring writ-
   ten justification will not be included in the basic order. These authorizations, when required for a spe-
   cific trip, must be added by endorsement to the original order and signed by the AO. Maintain and
   dispose of any written justification IAW AFI 37-128. In addition, air movement designators, port
   reporting instructions, excess baggage, foreign flag carrier certificates, ordinary leave, and overseas
   area clearance may be added by endorsement. When circumstances of a specific trip require the trav-
   eler to obtain a travel advance payment, the blanket travel order must be endorsed with the appropriate
   travel advance payment statement prescribed by Figure 2.1., item 16y and signed by the AO.
   2.3.4. BTO Review. The installation FSO will review BTOs annually, normally when organizations
   are preparing new orders for the FY. Review will ensure orders are administratively correct. Also, the
   FSO must ensure BTO criteria are met and make a recommendation through the appropriate chain of
   command to the AO for approval/disapproval of the BTO. Additionally, MAJCOM-FOA/DRU/FM
   will make BTOs an item of interest during staff assistance visits and inspector general inspections.
   2.3.5. BTO Travel Advance. Cash advance requirements while in a travel status will be met by
   using ATMs. FSOs will only issue travel advance payments when circumstances of a specific trip
   negate the use of the government travel charge card. In this instance, the BTO must be endorsed with
   the appropriate travel advance payment statement prescribed by Figure 2.1., item 16y.

                                Instructions for Blanket Travel Orders.
Blanket orders differ from other orders because they can be used over and over again for an extended
period. They are intended for people whose official duties require frequent travel with little advance
notice. Below are some differences from routine orders.
Item 9. Purpose for which this order was approved. If the traveler goes TDY for a purpose other than
indicated, a separate one-time routine order must be issued. For example, Colonel Twinkle is selected to
sit on a promotion board at Randolph AFB. Since this travel does not relate to normal Air Combat Com-
mand activities, a separate order must be prepared. When selecting the type and category of travel, select
the ones that best fit the majority of the trips likely to be taken.
Item 10a. This item is left blank.
Item 10b. Instead of a single date like on a routine TDY order, put in the note earlier than (NET) and the
not later than (NLT) dates. This represents the period the order can be used. As in routine orders, a 7 day
window before and after the proceed O/A date applies. You can make the order good for any period of
time, for example, a month, a quarter, etc., as long as the date and travel does not run into the next FY.
Item 11. Variations are never allowed on a blanket order. In the “TO” portion of the itinerary specify the
geographic limitations where travel is authorized.
Item 12. Usually this item will be blank unless only one mode will satisfy all trips to be taken. Never
mark the block for more advantageous to the government as it would be a special authorization and must
be added by endorsement.
Item 16. In general, except for the first statement in this order, put in the same information as in routine
orders. One difference is that if the traveler will procure his or her own transportation or will use a POC
as not more advantageous to the government, the cost provided by the TMO for commercial transporta-
tion has to be added by endorsement. Billeting and mess may vary since the traveler may go to other than
military installations conducting varying missions. Include the meal's statement contained in Figure 2.1.,
item 16a (all three options). The traveler will inform the AO which item applied after the fact and the AO
will circle and sign the correct choice before the traveler files the travel voucher.
                    SUGGESTED REVERSE OF BLANKET TRAVEL ORDER
(NOTE: Only items indicated in remarks (item 16) of the order apply.)
1. Before traveling, comply with the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide for clearance, passport, and immuni-
zation requirements.
2. Member is cleared for access to classified material up to and including (a) SECRET (b) TOP SECRET.
3. Within overseas area of TDY, travel by military and commercial aircraft, commercial rail, and bus is
authorized.
4. Before traveling outside CONUS by AMC scheduled aircraft, include in these orders a statement that
the member will report to APOE NLT 1 1/2 hours before scheduled departure time, flight number, and
departure time assigned by TMO. The local priority issuing agency provides return information.
5. Each of the following is authorized when this order is endorsed for a specific trip by an authorized offi-
cial, making the specific authorization(s) applicable:
       a. Travel by privately owned conveyance authorized. This mode of transportation determined
more advantageous to the government.
32                                                                          AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


       b. Hire of special conveyance (as specified in the endorsement) for use within area of TDY station
determined more advantageous to the government.
6. The following statement will be used when order is endorsed for a specific trip by an authorized offi-
cial after it has been approved by the Secretary of the Air Force: "Travel is authorized by first class com-
mercial air during the period (dates) per approval of Secretary of the Air Force (date approved)."
7.a) All government meals are available and directed.
        b) Partial government meals are available and directed.
        c) Government meals are not available or directed.
                                          ____________________

2.4. Repeated TDY Orders. Repeated TDY orders allow any necessary number of separate round trips
from the permanent duty station (to and from), or between specified locations. Each separate journey may
require stopover for duty at one or more places before returning to the permanent duty station (PDS).
Travel must not be solely between place of duty and lodging/home. Normally, government meals are
directed until adjusted by the AO after the TDY.
     2.4.1. Special Instructions. "Specified locations" means the TDY locations must be listed in the
     order. Do not authorize variations in itinerary in repeated orders. If the number of trips for a period
     will be exceeded, amend the repeated order or publish separate orders for the excess trips. Repeated
     TDY orders continue in effect until expiration or rescission. Repeated TDY orders are only effective
     during one FY and will not be used for any one trip in excess of 179 days. If a trip goes into a new FY,
     publish a second order to cover that portion. They may be endorsed as described in paragraph 2.5. If
     repeated orders are required for the same people in the next FY, publish new orders. The fund certifi-
     cation official must initial the request for orders, indicating funds are available and the accounting
     classification code is accurate. No funding codes are used on repeated transportation authorizations
     even when they are for space required nonreimbursable travel.
     2.4.2. Authority for Publication. Repeated TDY orders may be published by any commander
     authorized to publish travel orders. These orders require the same general information prescribed in
     Figure 2.1. In addition, include the effective and expiration dates of the order and specify the number
     of round trip journeys that may be taken. See Figure 2.4. for a sample repeated travel order.

               INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING A REPEATED TRAVEL ORDER
Follow general guidance in Figure 2.1. with these exceptions:
Item 8. Enter capital letters “REPEATED.”
Item 10a. Leave blank
Item 10b. Indicate inclusive dates as shown.
Item 11. Itinerary:
        a. (Variation Authorized). Do not authorize variations.
      b. (Itinerary-To). Enter the word "TO." Show only specific locations where TDY will be per-
formed on each and every trip.
Item 14. Estimate based on number of trips authorized.

apply including meal direction.
                                      _________________________

2.5. Endorsed Orders. Except as provided in paragraph 2.3.3. for BTOs, do not endorse blanket or
repeated travel orders for other purposes: for example, to direct further travel, authorize additional funds
expenditure, or to change strength accountability.
     2.5.1. Who May Endorse. Orders must be endorsed by the AO who issued the original order, or a
     lower echelon when authorized by a higher headquarters (for example, OSI district offices). Com-
     manders of aeromedical staging units may endorse patient travel orders when the change is directed
     by the Armed Services Medical Regulating Officer (ASMRO). Copies of the endorsement must be
     furnished to the order originator, organization of original destination, and gaining medical facility.
     2.5.2. How To Endorse. Endorse composed orders below the body or on the reverse if space is not
     available. Do form orders on the composed orders below the body or on the reverse if space is not
     available. Do form orders on the reverse if possible or use a separate page. When an endorsement is
     typed on the reverse or on a separate page, identify the order being endorsed as shown in the example
     below and address it to the traveler.
     2.5.3. Endorsement Distribution. Distribute three copies of a BTO to the traveler and one copy to
     the AO.
     2.5.4. Example: SO TA-179, 437 ABG, Charleston AFB, SC, 01 Jun 97 Endorsement to Orders:

               INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING A PERMISSIVE TDY ORDER
Follow the general guidance in Figure 2.1. with these exceptions:
Item 8. Enter in capital letters “PERMISSIVE.” This term can be used for civilian employees traveling
at no expense to the government (see paragraph 2.6.3.)
Item 9. Do not enter the type or category of travel.
Item 10a. Show specific number of days including travel time and cross out "approximate."
Item 11. Do not authorize variations.
Items 12 through 15. Leave blank.
Item 16:
       a. Authority. Enter AFI 36-3003 for military; JTR, paragraph C6250, for civilians.
        b. Permissive TDY. Include the following statements: "Submit a no pay travel voucher within 5
workdays after completion of travel. Travel permitted by this order does not entitle traveler to expenses
of travel or per diem. Individual is on authorized absence from duty and eligible for military furlough fare
discounts. Absence excess to number of days authorized is chargeable to leave."
        c. House Hunting Trip. Add: "Report to the Base Housing Referral Office servicing your new
duty station before entering into any rental, lease, or purchase agreement for off-base housing."
Item 19. (ACCOUNTING CITATIONS). Do not include an accounting citation on permissive TDY
orders. Place the distribution in the remaining space in this block.
                                      _________________________

2.6. Permissive or No Expense to Government Orders. Permissive orders allow members to be away
from their PDS without being charged leave. There is no reimbursement for travel. Most permissive
travel for military members will be done on an AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization. However,
in some cases, a DD Form 1610 or a composed order is used. To determine if a travel order must be used
see AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, and JFTR, paragraph U7650.
   2.6.1. Operation Bootstrap TDY. See AFI 36-2306, The Education Services Program. For Boot-
   strap, permissive in conjunction with PCS or TDY, or travel involving reimbursement from a nonap-
   propriated fund, continue to use the DD Form 1610. Include the same general information as any
   TDY, except you must specify number of days, including travel time. Include the following state-
   ments: “Submit a no-pay travel voucher within 5 workdays after completion of travel. Travel permit-
   ted by this order does not entitle traveler to expenses or travel or per diem. Individual is on authorized
   absence from duty traveling at personal expense and eligible for military furlough fare discounts.
   Absence in excess to number of days authorized is chargeable to leave.” Include the opening and
   closing of the term (or terms) involved. Furnish a copy of the orders to the proper FSO. See sample
   permissive order at Figure 2.5.
   2.6.2. Permissive Orders - Military Personnel. Authority AFI 36-3003 (JFTR, paragraph U7650).
   Military personnel traveling on permissive TDY orders are permitted space available travel by
   DoD-owned or controlled aircraft.
NOTE: Permissive TDY for house-hunting terminates upon acceptance of housing and further absence
from duty is charged as leave.
38                                                                           AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


     2.6.3. Travel at No Expense to Government-Civilian Personnel. A u t h o r i t y J T R , p a r a g r a p h
     C6250. When an employee agrees to pay his or her own expense, if travel at government expense is
     not authorized, for attendance at a meeting of a technical, professional, scientific, or other similar
     organization and it has been determined the employee will be in a duty status, issue a permissive
     TDYorder. The order must state travel is at the employee's request.
     2.6.4. When Order Not Used. The traveler's supervisor or competent authority must verify the trav-
     eler's signed statement that travel was not performed. Send the statement and a copy of the order to
     the proper FSO. There is no need to revoke the order since funds are not involved.
     2.6.5. Travel by POV. This mode may be authorized as a convenience to the traveler if it will not
     increase the total cost to the government. An example would be a member traveling to a permissive
     TDY station (in a nonpay travel status) during a time in which he or she would not usually be sched-
     uled for duty.

2.7. NATO Travel Orders. These orders are to be used only for military personnel movement, their per-
sonal baggage, individual weapons, and official documents. Use AF Form 1631, NATO Travel Order,

                                                Chapter 3

                                        GENERAL GUIDANCE

3.1. Separate Orders Involving Travel. When a single Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC)
number applies to a group of individuals traveling on TDY, include the number in the accounting classifi-
cation. If a single RC/CC number does not apply, prepare a separate order for each person, or place the
number after each name, for example: "MAJ W J SMITH, 000-00-0000." RC/CC 100314.” Indicate the
omission of the RC/CC in the accounting classification by using brackets, for example, "57*3400 30*
4312 (xxxxxx) 409 503700" and include a statement in the body of the composed orders, or in the
"Remarks" item of form orders "RC/CC number is indicated after each traveler's name."

3.2. Special Authorizations. A special authorization is something that adds to the cost of normal travel
and will only be requested when needed to accomplish the mission. When travel cannot be made by nor-
mal transportation modes, or when special authorizations are required to carry out travel, comply with the
restrictions in the following paragraphs.
   3.2.1. Statement for Orders. To indicate special authorizations desired and that a cost analysis has
   been accomplished, the following statement must be included in the "remarks" section of the order:
   "Special authorization(s) for (rental cars, use of privately owned conveyance, excess baggage, etc.) is/
   are required for mission accomplishment. The cost of the special authorization(s) has been reviewed
   and is justified as more advantageous to the government or necessary for mission accomplishment."
   The AO or commander's signature in the AO section of the order indicates actual approval of the spe-
   cial authorization.
   3.2.2. Justifications. Justifications for special authorizations must be based on advantage to the gov-
   ernment. Convenience to the traveler is never a reason for approving a special authorization. Factors
   to be considered in determining if special authorizations are an advantage to the government, include
   but are not limited to:
       3.2.2.1. Requirements of the mission assignment.
       3.2.2.2. Availability of all types of transportation modes and effect on productive time related to
       the travel time involved.
       3.2.2.3. Need to transport additional baggage, tools, or equipment.
       3.2.2.4. Location of places of temporary duty in relation to location of lodging and meal facilities
       and availability of transportation between these points.
       3.2.2.5. Total cost to the government (includes per diem, lost work time, salary of civilian
       employees, and actual transportation).
       3.2.2.6. Duty locality in relation to traffic conditions, routing, and weather.
       3.2.2.7. Overall cost advantage when there are accompanying passengers under official travel
       orders in the same privately owned conveyance.
       3.2.2.8. Documentation (letters, messages, etc.) used to justify a special authorization is consid-
       ered background material and will be maintained and disposed of according to AFI 37-128.
42                                                                            AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


        3.2.2.9. If a special authorization does not apply to all travelers, the order must state to whom it
        applies.

3.3. Nonuse of Government Facilities:
     3.3.1. MAJCOM Supplements. MAJCOM supplements to this AFI may include specific circum-
     stances where commanders may issue adverse effect statements covering duty requirements that do
     not permit use of government facilities.
     3.3.2. Nonuse of Government Facilities. Before orders are published, the traveler or project officer
     must request and obtain approval for nonuse of government facilities if billeting is available on the
     TDY installation.
     3.3.3. Authorizing Officials. Wing or group commanders may authorize nonuse of government
     facilities, in individual cases, when conditions justify it, but the commander at the TDY location does
     not agree to issue an impracticability statement. This authority must be issued with care. Letter
     request must cite this subparagraph and also state the impracticality condition. If known in advance
     of the TDY, the authorization will be included in the TDY order using the statement in 3.3.5. below.
     3.3.4. Statement of Adverse Effect -- Nonuse of Government Facilities. If a traveler finds govern-
     ment facilities cannot be used without adversely affecting the mission, the AO signs the DD Form
     1351 approving the change if appropriate. For simple changes in meal direction (see Attachment 2
     and Figure 2.1.) the approval is done on the order back. For exercises, the exercise commander (or
     equivalent, such as team leader) is provides a memorandum to the AO indicating circumstances pro-
     hibiting use of government facilities. If appropriate, the AO signs the DD Form 1351 approving the
     change. For FSO documentation requirements as a basis for payment of increased per diem, retain
     supporting documents as background material.
     3.3.5. Nonuse Statement. If it is known in advance that use of government quarters would adversely
     affect mission performance, use the following statement in the TDY order: "Use of government quar-
     ters will adversely affect (the mission) (performance of duties) (at ), or (for the period )." If unique
     or specialized billeting requirements exist, orders will include a statement to that effect.
     3.3.6. AETC and AFIT Fund Citations. AETC and AFIT authorizes other organizations to cite
     their funds in orders. This covers only normal allowances. If special authorizations are needed, the
     AO must get approval before putting them in the order IAW AFCAT 36-2223.
     3.3.7. Special Conveyances AFI 24-101:
        3.3.7.1. Motor vehicle. When a motor vehicle is rented for the exclusive use of one or more per-
        sons, it is a special conveyance. Select the rental service permitting the mission to be carried out at
        lowest overall cost. Traffic management officers (TMO), Commercial Travel Office (CTO) or
        Scheduled Airline Traffic Offices (SATO) will make arrangements for travelers. See AFI 24-101
        for procedures.
        3.3.7.2. Statements for Authorizing Special Authorizations in Orders. Special authorizations
        must be authorized in the TDY order. Following are examples of statements used:
            3.3.7.2.1. "Hire of special conveyance for use within area of TDY station authorized as more
            advantageous to the government."
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                   43


           3.3.7.2.2. "Hire of special conveyance authorized as more advantageous to the government."
           Use this statement when use is not restricted to the area of the TDY station; for example, it is
           in a remote area where adequate common carrier transportation is not available.
           3.3.7.2.3. When variations in itinerary are authorized or there is more than one TDY point,
           indicate the actual location (or locations) where special conveyance will be used. For exam-
           ple: "Hire of special conveyance within area of (location of TDY) authorized as more advan-
           tageous to the government."
       3.3.7.3. The AO should ensure traveler is briefed on specific guidance concerning rental vehicles
       (see AFI 24-101).
   3.3.8. Fly-It-Yourself Aircraft. Fly-it-yourself aircraft must be authorized in orders as a special con-
   veyance. Persons who use fly-it-yourself aircraft for personal convenience need not have special con-
   veyance authorized in orders.
       3.3.8.1. In orders for fly-it-yourself aircraft if a special conveyance is to be hired, include: "Hire
       of fly-it-yourself aircraft as a special conveyance authorized between______ and _______ as
       more advantageous to the government."
       3.3.8.2. Include in the order "Contact your TMO who is required to arrange for the hire of
       fly-it-yourself aircraft." (JFTR, paragraph U3415B, and JTR, paragraph C2102.2).
NOTE: AOs do not authorize private aircraft to carry passengers, unless the pilot has a commercial
pilot's license (AFI 24-101) or a private pilot's license and are also instrument rated. This requirement
does not apply to Aero Club aircraft.
   3.3.9. Extra Fare Train (AFI 24-101). Statement for orders: "Travel is authorized by extra fare
   train."
   3.3.10. Privately Owned Conveyance (Including Privately Owned Aircraft) Ad vantageous to
   the Government (JFTR, paragraph U3305 and JTR paragraph C2151). Statement for orders:
   "POC. This mode has been determined more advantageous."
   3.3.11. First Class Air Accommodations (JFTR, paragraph U3125 and JTR, para g r a p h
   C2204). Statement for orders: "Travel is authorized by first class commercial air per approval of Sec-
   retary of the Air Force."
NOTE: When first class evening fares do not cost more than normal day coach fares, they do not require
a special authorization.
   3.3.12. Commercial Air to and From CONUS (AFI 24-101). Statement for orders: "Travel autho-
   rized by commercial air per approval of ______ ."
   3.3.13. Travel Within and Around Duty Station (JTR, Paragraph U3500 and C2400). State-
   ment for orders: "Reimbursement of transportation expenses necessarily incurred in the conduct of
   official business in and around a temporary duty station is authorized."
   3.3.14. Excess Accompanied Baggage Allowance Authorization.
       3.3.14.1. When excess accompanied baggage allowance has been approved, include in travel
       orders: “___ pieces excess accompanied baggage authorized according to AFI 24-101."
       3.3.14.2. To authorize excess accompanied baggage for dependents traveling by AMC aircraft,
       include: " pieces excess accompanied baggage authorized for each dependent, according to AFI
44                                                                           AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005


        24-101." For travel by AMC aircraft, excess accompanied baggage must be stated only in pieces.
        For travel by commercial air, the excess accompanied baggage must be stated in terms of pounds
        and pieces, depending on the carrier's allowance as determined by TMO. For travel by other
        modes, see AFI 24-101.
     3.3.15. Shipment of Household Goods (HHG) Under Military TDY Orders. When shipment of
     HHG are authorized IAW JFTR, paragraph U4705, the orders must include a statement of authoriza-
     tion.
     3.3.16. Personally Procured Transoceanic Travel. If travelers personally arrange and pay for tran-
     soceanic travel, they may not be reimbursed unless it is authorized in their orders. A special authori-
     zation must be approved. The "letter request" will first be routed through TMO and approved by the
     traveler’s squadron commander. Approval authority will not be further delegated. State on the orders:
     "Traveler authorized to personally procure transoceanic transportation."

3.4. Variations in Itinerary. This permits omission of travel to a place (or places) stated in a travel
order; changes in the order of travel to places shown; and travel to places not shown. It is not used in place
of adequate advance planning nor is it interpreted as granting blanket travel authorization. It is permitted
only when essential to the success of the mission.
     3.4.1. When Variations are not Authorized.
        3.4.1.1. Do not use variations because of probable flight changes caused by weather, mechanical
        failure, or requirement to remain overnight at other than duty points.
        3.4.1.2. When purpose of TDY is to attend a technical, scientific or professional meeting.
        3.4.1.3. When purpose of TDY is to attend a school or course of instruction, except when unspec-
        ified field trips or flight training outline or AFCAT 36-2223.
        3.4.1.4. On a PCS order, except in TDY enroute.
        3.4.1.5. In an amendment to an order after travel is completed (see paragraph 1.2.14.1.).
NOTE: Variations in overseas travel do not exempt requirements for foreign area clearances.

3.5. Classified Orders. You can often avoid classification with careful wording, especially in duty to be
performed. For example, if the purpose is to inspect a piece of classified ordnance, the order may read:
"To inspect ordnance material." This statement gives the purpose as official Air Force business, but does
not identify the classified equipment being inspected. Also, to avoid classifying an order if TDY is at a
classified location. Include the name of a nearby location in the itinerary if the rate of per diem is the
same and authorize variations in itinerary. When an order must be classified, mark and handle it according
to AFI 34-401. You may also make extract copies using asterisks in place of the classified data. When
presenting orders to unofficial agencies such as rental car companies, hotels, etc., it is permissible to
delete or obliterate certain data such as grade, position, title, security clearance, and purpose of travel.
Although this data in itself is not classified, it may be sensitive in the wrong hands.
NOTE: In using a nearby location, ensure you do not inadvertently identify classified data; e.g., the the-
ater of operations, if classified, or other classified or security related data associated with deployment
operations. Always check the latest security classification guidance to ensure you are not disclosing clas-
sified information when completing the orders.

             PROPORTIONAL PER DIEM (PPD) BACKGROUND AND GUIDANCE
1. On 1 Oct 96, a change to the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) and Joint Travel Regulation (JTR)
introduced the PPD rate as an additional means of determining meal reimbursement for TDY travelers. It
occurred in conjunction with a scheduled reduction in surcharge rate assessed in military dining facilities
and a determination that most dining facilities are open to all TDY travelers, officers and civilians
included, as listed in AFI 34-602. PPD was created:
       a. To coincide with a surcharge reduction in military dining facilities, reducing the cost from
$18.15 to $7.00 per day.
       b. To bring parity between officer and enlisted per diem.
       c. Remove cumbersome meal counting for determining per diem.
2. Previously, TDY travelers were either reimbursed for meals at the government meal rate, at the locality
rate; or at a meal-by-meal rate. Meal-by-meal rate was replaced by PPD which is a “middle rate” of per
diem designed to adequately reimburse members who eat one or two meals in a government dining facil-
ity. It is computed by adding the locality (meal) rate to government (meal) rate and dividing by two. Note:
Travel days are still computed using 75% of the locality rate no matter dining hall availability or meal
direction.
3. The AO decides which per diem is applicable. The AO marries meal availability in AFI 34-602 with
mission requirements to determine which rate applies: locality, PPD, or government rate. Rank or posi-
tion is not a determination of per diem since the new procedures apply to both officers and enlisted per-
sonnel.
4. The AO must select one of three options listed on all travel orders:
       a. All government meals are available and directed.
       b. Partial government meals are available and directed.
       c. Government meals are not available or directed.
5. If the traveler finds out meal availability has changed or the mission didn’t allow consuming meals in
the dining hall as directed by the AO, the AO may make changes to the orders after the fact to reimburse
the traveler at a higher rate. The AO makes changes, if warranted, based upon a reasonable request by the
traveler. See Figure 2.1. for guidance on making changes to orders after the fact. Some (but not all) fac-
tors that may necessitate a change:
         a. Billeting availability changes and the traveler must be billeted off base. In this instance, the
FSO automatically pays the locality rate and no annotation is required by the AO or traveler. Nonavail-
ability information is required.
       b. Dining hall hours/availability were different than originally understood.
       c. Mission required abnormal work hours.
       d. Eating at the dining hall was too difficult given distance and transportation considerations.
6. If the AO fails to make the mandatory meal determination on the travel orders, the FSO may send the
orders back for correction if that task may be completed before travel occurs. If the AO fails to make a
AFI65-103 5 AUGUST 2005                                                                                     65


meal determination and the orders aren’t corrected before travel occurs, the locality rate applies unless a
meal was provided with a conference and that fact was not known before travel. The FSO will confer
with the AO if meal direction does not appear in blanket travel orders.
7. If a military member is lodged off-base, the AO may not direct use of the government mess and the
member receives the full locality rate. However, the military member may consume meals in the dining
hall without a reduction in per diem even if allowed the locality rate. No stigma is attached to the military
member for eating in dining halls although not directed to do so.
8. Civilians may not be required to eat in a military dining facility but may eat in dining facilities if they
wish. Their per diem is reduced to the PPD rate or the government rate if they consume meals in a gov-
ernment mess and they must claim the meals on their travel voucher.
9. Both civilians and military are subject to lower per diem, as applicable, if meals are provided in con-
junction with a conference, exercise, or deployment. If all three meals are provided, the incidental rate
applies.
10. Military are paid PPD for travel less than 10 hours and meal(s) are claimed (excluding the $2 CONUS,
or $3.50 OCONUS incidental expenses). The “occasional meal” has been replaced by PPD. 75% of the
locality rate is paid for TDYs over 10 hours. Civilians are not paid for meals when the TDY is less than
12 hours.
11. If not contacted before the TDY, government mess is considered available at other services’ installa-
tions.
12. For blanket orders, the AO directs government meals and then adjusts, as necessary after the TDY as
in other travel. This policy is IAW per diem committee guidance to only increase entitlements after the
fact, never decrease.
13. PPD rules apply to Contingency/Exercise/Mobility (CEM) and flight orders. The OpPlan for the par-
ticular exercise states what reporting instructions will be used as far as availability of quarters and mess.
14. Open mess availability does not directly effect PPD computation except in some OCONUS locations
where the locality rate is reduced. Refer to Appendix B, Footnote 2, JFTR.
15. Box lunches are considered a meal in a government mess. (The issue usually only arises when the all
meals available rate is directed or under field conditions). However, according to U4125, “box lunches,
in-flight meals and rations furnished by the government on a military aircraft are not considered to be a
government mess for per diem computation purposes.” If the box lunch is consumed in the air, it doesn’t
count for per diem purposes. If the box lunch is consumed on the ground, it counts for per diem purposes.

IC 2001-2 to AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders
23 FEBRUARY 2001
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change is to incorporate IC 2001-2, which provides new guidance on Personnel Tempo (PersTempo)
Codes on Temporary Duty Orders (paragraph 2.1.7. and Table 2.1.).
2.1. Qualifications and Responsibilities of the Orders Approving Official (AO)
2.1.7 Travel Order Personnel Tempo (PersTempo) Codes. Include, in the “Remarks” block of the order,
the appropriate “Travel Order PersTempo Code” and corresponding definition title listed in Table 2.1.
This code is used in the voucher settlement process to flow information back to the personnel system.
Additional information on the Duty Status Codes that fall under each “Travel Order PersTempo Code”
can be found in AFI 36-2134. A travel voucher supported by an order that does not have a “Travel Order
PersTempo Code” will be processed as an “Q” Travel Order PersTempo Code during settlement. This
travel will not accumulate for the payment of high-deployment (Burdensome Tempo) pay.

This revision incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2005-1 and adds the requirement that each travel authori-
zation contain a statement indicating whether the traveler is authorized to purchase transportation tickets
using a centrally billed account (CBA) or an individually billed account (IBA). A bar ( | ) indicates a revi-
sion from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.
2.1.4.5. Ensure each travel authorization contains a statement indicating whether the traveler is authorized
to purchase transportation tickets using a centrally billed account (CBA) or an individually billed account
(IBA).
