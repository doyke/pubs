SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised. It has been changed from AFPAM 34-261 to AFPAM
34-506. Other changes include updates to the mortuary services and entitlements of members
who die on active duty and added those that are in active duty status.

1. Mortuary Services. Members who die while on active duty or in active duty status (IAW
Title 10 United States Code Section 1481) are authorized certain mortuary benefits. Recognizing
the honorable, faithful service given to our nation, the Air Force continues to care for its own and
stands ready to assist and extend mortuary services benefits to the extent possible as permitted by
 2                                                            AFPAM34-506 12 AUGUST 2011


law. Following official notification, the person you have designated as the person authorized to
direct disposition (PADD), of your remains, will be briefed by a mortuary officer.
     1.1. The PADD is the individual predetermined by you to direct disposition of your remains
     as indicated on DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data, or virtual Record Emergency Data
     (vRED). If for any reason the PADD is not predetermined by you on DD Form 93 or vRED
     or if the PADD waives his/her right to direct disposition, this role will automatically fall
     upon the next of kin (NOK) based upon order of precedence delineated in Title 10 United
     States Code Section 1482 (spouse, children over 18 in order of age, parent or legal guardian,
     siblings, grandparents, and so forth).
2. Deaths Occurring in the United States Including Alaska and Hawaii. Entitlements are
provided to the PADD as follows:
     2.1. Each active Air Force installation appoints a mortuary officer (MO) who administers
     and executes the mortuary program for the installation commander. The MO will be the
     Force Support Squadron (FSS) Commander and the alternate mortuary officers will be the
     FSS Deputy and/or Operations Officer.
     2.2. When an active duty member dies and Air Force Casualty confirms that all notifications
     are complete, the MO nearest the place of death will brief the PADD and obtain disposition
     instructions by telephone or personal visit depending on the distance between the MO and the
     location of the PADD.
     2.3. The MO is responsible for the search, recovery, and identification of remains; the care
     and handling of remains; assisting the PADD with disposition arrangements; transportation
     of the remains; providing an escort; arranging for military honors at the place of burial; and
     return of all personal effects and property to the person eligible to receive effects (PERE).
     Additionally, the MO will arrange travel to and from the place of final disposition for all
     authorized travelers.
     2.4. Titles 10 and 37 United States Code, specify the basis for all care of remains and
     assistance to NOK. Consequently, limitations, regardless of how emotional they may be, do
     apply.
3. Deaths Occurring Outside the United States Excluding Alaska and Hawaii. When a
death occurs Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), the location of the PADD is the
determining factor as to where the MO support will be assigned. Either the installation MO or a
MO from the Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operation Center, Mortuary Affairs Division
(AFMAO/MA) will brief the PADD and obtain their instructions for the disposition of the fallen.
     3.1. Care and Return of Remains From OCONUS.
        3.1.1. The Air Force and the other services operate mortuaries in certain overseas
        locations for deaths occurring in the geographic areas served by those mortuaries.
        3.1.2. As soon as the overseas mortuary receives the fallen, they care for them as
        expeditiously as possible and promptly return them to the Continental United States
        (CONUS). However, when a death occurs overseas, there is a lapse of several days
        before the remains arrive at a CONUS port of entry, AFMAO Port Mortuary, Dover
        AFB, DE or receiving funeral home. There are several reasons for the lapse time:
AFPAM34-506 12 AUGUST 2011                                                                      3


          3.1.2.1. Upon the death, local civil authorities may hold the remains for a period of at
          least a day or more for their investigative purposes and to provide the required
          documents to move the remains out of country.
          3.1.2.2. When the host foreign nation or United States military medical authorities
          require an autopsy, this can take another day or two. This timeline can be extended
          due to holidays or weekends in which they choose not to complete their investigation
          and release the fallen.
          3.1.2.3. Transferring the remains to the responsible military mortuary and preparing
          (embalming) them for movement to CONUS usually takes 24 to 36 hours.
          3.1.2.4. The overseas mortuary places the embalmed remains in an aluminum
          transfer case for transfer from the overseas mortuary to the CONUS port mortuary or
          a military specification casket for transfer directly to a receiving funeral home. The
          overseas mortuary arranges for the return of the remains to the United States on either
          the first available Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft bound for the CONUS port
          or on a commercial aircraft. The remains could leave the same day they are released
          by the mortuary or the next day, depending on the availability and scheduling of the
          aircraft. Therefore, another day’s time is expended in the return of the remains.
          Weather or maintenance problems may provide additional delays.
   3.2. CONUS Port Mortuary Operations.
      3.2.1. Upon arrival at the port mortuary facility, the remains are processed or reprocessed
      and prepared for onward movement to final destination usually within a 48-hour period.
      3.2.2. The port mortuary personnel perform the following actions:
          3.2.2.1. Process or reprocess remains and administer additional treatment, to include
          wrapping non-viewable remains, performing restorative artwork, applying cosmetics,
          and dressing viewable remains.
          3.2.2.2. Ensures the fallen is placed in the Armed Forces specification casket selected
          by the PADD, and encases the casket in an outer shipping container (air tray).
          3.2.2.3. Brief the military or special escort on his or her duties and provide proper
          documents. If an escort is not identified, the Port Mortuary will appoint one of equal
          or higher rank.
          3.2.2.4. Prepare all necessary documents, permits and performs final quality
          assurance inspection prior to departure.
          3.2.2.5. Schedules military/contract military air, commercial air, or hearse delivery to
          transport the remains and escort to the final destination.
      3.2.3. When the PADD requests cremation, the MO will provide a cremation permit and
      the specification urn selected by the PADD.
4. Mortuary Services Benefits.
   4.1. When remains are recovered and individually identified, the PADD may direct the Air
   Force accomplish the following through its contract funeral home (or government operated
   overseas mortuary).
 4                                                              AFPAM34-506 12 AUGUST 2011


        4.1.1. Remove the remains from the place of death or the place where authorities release
        the remains to the contract funeral home.
        4.1.2. Prepare (embalming) the remains.
        4.1.3. Wrap non-viewable remains and position remains and uniform in the casket or
        restore, cosmetize, dress, and casket viewable remains.
        4.1.4. The PADD may select one of two Armed Services specification caskets.
            4.1.4.1. An 18-gauge metal protective casket. The exterior is silver, silver tone or
            gray in color. The interior of the casket is equipped with an adjustable innerspring
            mattress, and the casket is upholstered with a white or eggshell crepe fabric.
            4.1.4.2. A solid hardwood casket. The exterior is walnut in color. The interior of the
            casket is equipped with an adjustable innerspring mattress, and the casket is
            upholstered with a rose, tan or ecru crepe fabric.
        4.1.5. Provide an outer shipping container (air tray) for the casket. This is to protect the
        casket while in transit.
Note: The Air Force provides all items of service or merchandise listed above at no cost to the
PADD.
     4.2. If the PADD prefers to make his or her own arrangements for the above items, he or she
     may do so, but this alternative is generally limited to deaths occurring within the United
     States due to the complexity involved in the transportation of remain when outside the United
     States. The MO will provide the current monetary allowances for this option during the
     mortuary briefing.
        4.2.1. The Air Force will reimburse the PADD up to the maximum authorized amount
        for Option 5, which includes all associated funeral and cemetery expenses.
        4.2.2. In addition, the Air Force will reimburse all expenses for the transportation of
        remains.
5. Remains Disposition Options. The PADD may elect to effect disposition by one of the
following options. The mortuary officer provides monetary reimbursement allowances for each
option in the entitlements briefing. The reimbursement amounts are not published due to
continued adjustments in the entitlements. The MO will provide the current entitlements at the
time of the PADD briefing.
     5.1. Option 1. Consign the remains directly to a government cemetery. This means there
     would be no funeral home used and there would be no funeral service. Since there would be
     no expenses incurred at the government cemetery, the PADD is reimbursed a limited sum to
     help pay for an expense such as the purchase of a floral arrangement, acknowledgment cards,
     newspaper notice, and so forth.
     5.2. Option 2. Consign the remains to a funeral home selected by the PADD to conduct
     desired visitations and services, followed by interment in a government cemetery. Since
     expenses would be incurred with the funeral home, the PADD may be reimbursed a limited
     sum to help pay for expenses, such as the professional fee of a funeral director, use of the
     funeral home and equipment for a visitation and funeral service, motor vehicles (limousines,
     floral delivery vehicle, lead car, car for the clergy), purchase of a burial vault or grave liner,
AFPAM34-506 12 AUGUST 2011                                                                      5


   religious item for the casket, flowers, register book, prayer cards, acknowledgment cards,
   funeral programs, newspaper notice, clergy honorarium and music (organist, vocalist), and so
   forth.
   5.3. Option 3. Consign the remains to a funeral home selected by the PADD to conduct
   desired visitations and services followed by interment in a non-government (private)
   cemetery. Since expenses would be incurred at both the funeral home and the cemetery, the
   PADD may be reimbursed a limited sum to help pay for expenses already specified in Option
   2 and cemetery expenses such as purchase of a single grave space, outer burial container,
   opening and closing of the grave, use of cemetery equipment, purchase of a headstone from a
   commercial         monument company, and so forth.
   5.4. Option 4. Consign the fallen to a funeral home, selected by the PADD, to conduct
   desired arrangements that can include a visitation and services followed by cremation.
       5.4.1. The fallen will be prepared and placed in a solid hardwood casket. The casket will
       be draped in a US Burial Flag and escorted to the receiving funeral home.
       5.4.2. The receiving funeral home will perform the cremation in accordance with
       statutory provisions and the Air Force will assume the cost.
       5.4.3. The Air Force provides the PADD a choice of two Armed Forces specification
       urns, a solid walnut urn or bronze urn. Each are cube-like in design with the US Air
       Force seal affixed and either will be engraved with the name, grade, date of birth, and
       date of death of the fallen.
           5.4.3.1. The receiving funeral home will ensure the cremated remains (the skeletal
           remains collected for processing after the cremation is complete) in the urn selected
           by the next of kin.
6. Interment Flag(s) and Flag Case(s). A United States of America flag and a solid hardwood
flag case will be presented to those listed in paragraphs 6.1 through 6.4 at the conclusion of the
service.
   6.1. Spouse
   6.2. Children
   6.3. The father and mother (if not the primary next of kin). If legally separated or divorced,
   each parent will receive a flag.
   6.4. The PADD if not already covered in paragraphs 6.1 through 6.3
7. Escort for the Remains.
   7.1. Special Escort. The PADD may request, by name, a special escort to accompany the
   remains to final destination.
       7.1.1. A special escort is any person named by the PADD. This can be a relative, a close
       friend, someone presently on active duty, a retired military member, or a civilian.
       7.1.2. The Air Force pays for the special escort’s round-trip travel and per diem.
 6                                                             AFPAM34-506 12 AUGUST 2011


     7.2. Appointed Escort. If the PADD desires no special escort, the mortuary officer
     designates a military escort of equivalent or higher rank to accompany the remains to the
     final destination. All efforts will be made to utilize a member of the deceased unit.
8. Military Honors.
     8.1. Military honors are furnished at the place of burial, if possible. Military honors consist
     of pallbearers, firing party, bugler, color guard, and an Air Force chaplain, if specifically
     requested by the PADD.
     8.2. Flyover. If you are serving as a rated officer or enlisted aircrew member and hold an
     aeronautical rating on an active duty status, or pursuing a course of instruction leading to
     such a rating at the time of death, your PADD may request a flyover at the place of burial.
     The performance of a flyover depends on the availability of aircraft at the given time and
     date, minimum weather requirements, and approvals for the required air space.
9. Veterans Administration Benefits.
     9.1. The Veterans Administration will provide a government headstone free of cost to mark
     the grave. The type and style of headstone depends on the requirement or restrictions
     specified by the cemetery concerned.
     9.2. Veterans may be interred in a national cemetery. A veteran’s spouse and dependent
     children may also be buried in the same grave site. The MO will discuss the limitations in
     detail during the PADD briefing.
10. NOK Funeral Travel. Authorized travelers to include spouse, dependent children, parents
(including step-parents), the parents of the spouse of the member, siblings of the deceased, and
the PADD, if different from those listed above, may receive round-trip travel at Air Force
expense to attend the funeral. If, other than the PADD, there are no other travelers from the list
above, the PADD may choose two persons closely related to the deceased. Additionally, an
individual may be authorized to travel to serve as an attendant for small children or a
handicapped traveler when none of those listed are traveling the same route. The MO will assist
the travelers in making proper travel arrangements. Following travel, the Air Force will help the
authorized travelers complete and submit a travel voucher for payment of limited per diem.
11. Disposition of Personal Property. The MO is responsible for the return of all personal
effects and property to the eligible recipient, as specified by law. A summary court officer is
appointed to safeguard, collect, inventory, and ship the property to a destination specified by the
recipient. As a matter of information, the person eligible to receive effects (PERE) is not always
the same person who is directing disposition for the remains. The family structure of the
deceased and marital status at the time of death are governing factors in applying the law as to
who is the recipient for the property.
12. Death Certificate.
     12.1. For deaths occurring in the United States, the PADD will be provided ten (10) copies
     of a certified state death certificate. Additional copies may be provided at the PADD’s
     expense. The contract funeral home will obtain death certificates as part of their contractual
     requirements. Families may contact the Office of Vital Statistics in the county where the
     death occurred should additional copies be needed in the future.
AFPAM34-506 12 AUGUST 2011                                                                         7


   12.2. For deaths occurring outside the United States and its territories, the PADD will be
   provided ten (10) copies of the DD 1300, Report of Casualty and/or certified copies of the
   DD 2064, Certificate of Death (Overseas). The DD 1300 may be used in lieu of a death
   certificate when proof of death is established and no remains are recovered. The State
   Department may also issue a Report of Death Abroad for unique circumstances.
13. Available Benefits When Remains Are Recovered But Cannot Be Individually
Identified by Scientific Means (Group Burial). This circumstance requires the Air Force to
arrange and effect a group burial for those remains that are not individually identified. The Air
Force will do the following:
   13.1. Casket remains in specification metal protective caskets. The number of caskets is
   predicated on the volume of remains, not the number of persons included in the group burial.
   13.2. Arrange the interment to be effected in Arlington National Cemetery.
   13.3. Arrange and pay for the round trip travel of authorized travelers as described by
   paragraph 10. to attend the funeral.
   13.4. Assign an escort to accompany each casket that will be used.
   13.5. Conducts a nondenominational interment service.
   13.6. Provide full military honors. Details pertaining to military honors are contained in
   paragraph 8.1
   13.7. A United States burial flag will drape the group casket. It will be folded at the
   completion of the military funeral honors. This flag will not be presented but retained by the
   Air Force. United States burial flag(s) will be presented to those delineated in paragraphs 6.1
   through 6.4 unless an individual burial has already been conducted. In that case, only the
   Primary Next of Kin (PNOK), for each fallen Airman, will be presented a flag and flag case.
   13.8. Provide a specially fabricated headstone to mark the group burial site.
   13.9. Provide each PADD with a specified allowance to help pay limited expenses that may
   be incurred for the interment service. This may be for the purchase of a floral arrangement,
   acknowledgment cards, etc.
   13.10. Return personal property and effects to the authorized recipient, as specified by law.
14. Available Benefits When Remains Are Not Recovered (BNR). This situation may be due
to the type of incident that occurred or prevailing conditions at the scene, rendering the remains
non-recoverable. Whatever the case, this circumstance precludes any funeral service and
disposition of remains, so the Air Force will assist the PADD in arranging a memorial service, to
honor the sacrifice of the fallen, with Air Force participation.
   14.1. Memorial Service. The memorial service may be conducted at a place selected by the
   PADD to include a place of worship, a funeral home, a cemetery (national or private), or a
   combination thereof.
       14.1.1. Military honors will be provided at the place of service. The extent of those
       honors depends on the PADD’s desires. If the deceased held an aeronautical rating or
       meets criteria outlined in paragraph 8.2, the PADD may request a flyover.
 8                                                            AFPAM34-506 12 AUGUST 2011


        14.1.2. At the conclusion of the service, a flag of the United States of America and a flag
        case is presented to those delineated in paragraphs 6.1 through 6.4
     14.2. Funeral Travel. Round trip travel will be provided at Air Force expense to attend the
     memorial service arranged by the PADD. Travel is authorized for those individuals
     described in paragraph 10.
     14.3. Memorial Marker. The Veterans Administration provides a memorial marker which
     may be placed in a national cemetery or private cemetery.
     14.4. Memorial Service Allowance. The Air Force will provide the PADD reimbursement
     for a memorial service to help pay for expenses not to exceed the amount allowed for a
     funeral with subsequent interment in a government cemetery.
     14.5. Personal Property. The Air Force will return personal effects and property to the
     authorized recipient as specified by law.
15. Future Planning. A “Mortuary Planning Sheet for Active Duty Air Force Members.” is
provided in Attachment 2. This guide is designed to alleviate undue burden on your family
members should you become a casualty. Take the time to carefully review the information and
complete the attachment. Provide copies of your expressed wishes contained within this
attachment to your family members. Questions concerning benefits or discussions about
mortuary matters can be answered by the installation MO.
