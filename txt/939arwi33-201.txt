                                         REQUIREMENTS

2.1. SYSTEM MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY PLAN (SMSP). All 939 ARW LAN users with
access to 939 ARW LAN resources must be familiar with applicable procedures in this instruction. Fail-
ing to adhere to this instruction is grounds for denial of service by 939 ARW LAN personnel and may be
grounds for administrative or disciplinary action against individuals involved. The CSO will ensure this
instruction is available to all affected personnel via 939 ARW LAN’s intranet or other publicized means.

2.2. NOTICE AND CONSENT FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS MONITORING. General notifi-
cation is hereby given to users of DoD telecommunications systems or devices DoD provides such sys-
tems and devices for conducting official government business. Use of government telecommunications
systems and devices constitutes consent by the user to telecommunications monitoring. See AFI33-219,
Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP).

2.3. CONTINGENCY PLANNING.
   2.3.1. Contingency Planning Requirement. All 939 ARW units using the 939 ARW LAN are respon-
   sible for creating, coordinating, and maintaining their contingency plans in the event of an extended
   939 ARW LAN outage. Plans should be coordinated through your unit WM, the wing CSO, and wing
   plans to ensure feasibility and licensing commitments are met.
   2.3.2. Data Storage on 939 ARW LAN and Backup. In addition to basic administrative support con-
   siderations (e.g., word processing, E-mail, etc.), 939 ARW units must evaluate and document their
   data stored on 939 ARW LAN servers and implement backup procedures based on the impact of loss
   of access to 939 ARW LAN by identifying the criticality and currency of the data. When possible,
   backups should be performed to media other than that of the 939 ARW LAN (i.e., user’s hard drive,
   tape backup in user’s work center, user’s floppy disk, etc.).
   2.3.3. Directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the information threatcon (INFOCON) system presents a
   structured coordinated approach to react to and defend against adversarial attacks on DoD computers,
   telecommunications and networks. Information protection is protection to preserve the availability,
   integrity, and confidentiality of the systems and the information contained within the systems. Incor-
   porating information protection is an integral part of all planning. The wing point of contact for all
   INFOCON actions is the 939 ARW LAN Manager. The 939 ARW must abide by the direction from
   our higher headquarters and our host IA authority on specific threats known to our installation and
   systems.
       2.3.3.1. INFOCON levels are prefaced with the term INFOCON, followed by ALPHA, BRAVO,
       CHARLIE and DELTA.
       2.3.3.2. As the INFOCON threat escalates, specific network security requirements will be insti-
       tuted that affect all aspects of network computing to include but not limited to:

                                                Chapter 3

                      USE OF 939 ARW LAN AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS

3.1. GENERAL USE. Any activity on or through the 939 ARW LAN constitutes use of a government
resource. Government-provided hardware and software are for conducting official and authorized govern-
ment business. This does not prohibit commanders from authorizing personnel to use government
resources if they determine it is in the best interest of the government and authorization is documented by
letter, local operating instruction, or explicit policy. Using the 939 ARW LAN for other than authorized
purposes may result in adverse administrative or disciplinary action.

3.2. OFFICIAL USE. There are no restrictions on official uses. Official uses include emergency com-
munications that the Air Force determines are necessary in the interest of the federal government. Official
use may include, when approved by theater commanders in the interest of morale and welfare, communi-
cations by military members and other DoD employees who are deployed for extended periods away from
home on official DoD business.

3.3. AUTHORIZED USE.
   3.3.1. As covered within AFI 33-119, and AFI 33-129.
   3.3.2. Authorized personal use includes brief communications made by authorized users while travel-
   ing on US government business to notify family members of official transportation or schedule
   changes. It includes personal communications from the authorized user’s workplace that are most rea-
   sonably made while at the workplace (such as checking in with spouse or minor children; scheduling
   doctor, automobile, or home repair appointments; brief Internet searches; or e-mailing directions to
   visiting relatives), when the unit commanders permits such categories of communications.

3.4. UNAUTHORIZED USE.
   3.4.1. As covered within AFI 33-112 and AFI 33-114, Software Management.
   3.4.2. Additionally the following activities involving the use of government-provided computer hard-
   ware or software are specifically prohibited:
       3.4.2.1. Installing any software, whether received in an official government capacity, purchased in
       addition to the standard software applications authorized, or personally owned without going
       through your WM for assistance or direction.
       3.4.2.2. Changing AF, AFRC or locally implemented configuration settings, including but not
       limited to display settings.
       3.4.2.3. Using personally owned equipment without going through your WM for assistance or
       direction.
       3.4.2.4. Using personally owned personal digital assistants (PDA), such as Palms, Visors, IPAQs,
       or Jornadas are not authorized even with local permission.
       3.4.2.5. Downloading freeware, shareware, personal internet provider, instant messaging, and tel-
       net chat applications.
       3.4.2.6. Sharing hard drives, removable drives and folders over the network.
12                                                                        939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003


        3.4.2.7. Saving personal data to network shared drives.
        3.4.2.8. Accessing unauthorized web sites from your government system.
        3.4.2.9. Using unauthorized E-mail service. This includes but is not limited to all web based mail
        such as Hotmail.
        3.4.2.10. Installing third party software for viewing of personal or civilian job related E-mail
        including but not limited to instant messaging.
        3.4.2.11. Installing third party or peer to peer software for continuous web updates and free down-
        loading services including but not limited to PointCast or any media related download sites.
        3.4.2.12. Auto forwarding of your government E-mail to your personal or civilian job e-mail.
        Government e-mail must be protected from residing on commercial servers in order to protect pri-
        vacy act material (PA), for official use only (FOUO), and possible classified information mistak-
        enly delivered to an unclassified account.

3.5. USE OF PERSONAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ON 939 ARW LAN. Use of personal
hardware and software on 939 ARW LAN or systems connected to 939 ARW LAN must be identified in
the systems accreditation package and approved by 939 ARW ECO, 939 ARW CSO and 939 ARW DAA.
Exceptions are addressed above in paragraph 3.4.2.3. Such use must be in accordance with AFI 33-202,
Computer Security.

3.6. PREVENTING, MONITORING AND REPORTING ABUSE.
     3.6.1. Preventing Abuse. Network/system managers will employ practical, cost effective methods to
     prevent users from accessing or transferring information that could reflect adversely on the Air Force
     or DoD or create an undue burden on the communications-computer system or result in significant
     cost to the government. This should include, but is not limited to, user education and blocking unde-
     sirable Internet sites (e.g., pornographic sites, hate literature sites). This may be extended to prevent-
     ing access to sites that serve no benefit to the Air Force, primarily if the communication-computer
     system is becoming overburdened or the activity is impeding the conduct of official business or result-
     ing in a significant cost to the government. Actions taken to prevent abuse should not interfere with
     beneficial uses of sites or services.
     3.6.2. Monitoring Systems. If, in the course of day-to-day operations, suspicion of abuse or misuse of
     government systems arises, the suspicious activities must be reported according to the following para-
     graphs:
        3.6.2.1. 939 ARW LAN personnel must report incidents according to AFSSI 5021, Vulnerability
        and Incident Reporting.
        3.6.2.2. Any suspicious activity must be reported to the 939 ARW CSO.
        3.6.2.3. The CSO will contact appropriate officials if waste, abuse, inappropriate or illegal activ-
        ity is validated.
     3.6.3. Reporting and Acting on Suspected Abuse. Abuse of government systems falls into two cate-
     gories of illegal use: criminal use and general unauthorized use. Care must be taken when fixing
     blame for suspected abuse/activities. The identification of a PC or user account involved in suspicious
939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003                                                                                13


  activity does not necessarily identify the actual offender. Legal advice/coordination must be obtained
  prior to taking action.
     3.6.3.1. Illegal (Criminal) Use. If monitoring of government systems or reports of their use results
     in suspicion of illegal activity, the CSO will notify the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
     (OSI), 142 SFS/SPAI and 939 ARW/JA immediately.
     3.6.3.2. General Unauthorized Use. If monitoring of government systems or reports of their use
     results in the suspicion of unauthorized use, the 939 ARW CSO must be notified. The nature/
     severity of the unauthorized use will determine the corrective action to be taken. Activities which
     result in suspicion of significant violations (i.e., activities involving pornography, sexually explicit
     material, classified information at a level above that which is authorized on the system as covered
     within AF 33 series instructions) of a government system, must be acted upon. A sample letter will
     be provided to a commander upon initial investigation of the suspected abuse.
     3.6.3.3. Based on initial fact- findings of the reported suspected violation, the CSO must report
     any significant findings to the group commander, residing over the equipment or personnel. The
     CSO will also provide a courtesy copy to the 939 ARW DAA, JA, SA, MSG/CC, and CF/CC.
     3.6.3.4. Upon receipt of the CSO report, the commander will review and take action as deemed
     appropriate. The commander or appointed investigating officer may respond to the CSO in writing
     to request additional fact finding information or to request the cleansing of the computer system
     once the information is no longer needed for possible administrative action.
     3.6.3.5. When the CSO receives the above request from the commander or investigating officer,
     the 939 ARW/JA will be contacted for concurrence. With this concurrence, the system is cleansed
     (all inappropriate electronic information is removed). It will then be returned to the work center.
     3.6.3.6. In the event that additional reports are received for the same computer system, the fact
     finding process will remain the same. Upon three (3) violations, the computer system will be
     removed from the work center for a period of time to be determined by the severity of the abuse,
     through the CSO, JA and group commander with a report forwarded to the DAA. The entire work
     center must receive additional information assurance awareness training and education on the use
     and operation of government computer equipment and network capabilities.

3.7. ACCOUNTS.
  3.7.1. All 939 ARW LAN users must complete IA Awareness Training prior to being granted access
  to the 939 ARW LAN IAW AFI 33-204, Information Assurance (IA) Awareness Program.

  31-501, Personnel Security Management Program, Para 3.27.
  3.7.3. All 939 ARW LAN account requests must be submitted using PIA Form 33-115, Request for
  Network and System Access.
  3.7.4. Inactive 939 ARW LAN Accounts:
     3.7.4.1. In order to assure information is safeguarded and the network is secure for all users, net-
     work accounts with no activity for more than 120 days are considered inactive.
     3.7.4.2. Inactive accounts cause unnecessary overhead and increase network vulnerabilities since
     those accounts are not regularly monitored for suspicious activity.
14                                                                      939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003


        3.7.4.3. All inactive accounts will be reviewed monthly by the LAN manager.
        3.7.4.4. The 939 ARW LAN Manager will provide the CSO with an inactive accounts report.
        3.7.4.5. The CSO will review and send a letter to each group commander with a listing of individ-
        uals with inactive accounts.
        3.7.4.6. The inactive accounts will be closed and all associated files deleted 30 days following
        distribution of the letter unless the unit contacts the CSO to request an extension due to extenuat-
        ing circumstances.

3.8. FILE MANAGEMENT.
     3.8.1. The information usage and management apply to all 939 ARW personnel at Portland IAP, OR.
     It is the responsibility of 939 CF/SCBN network control center (NCC), System Administrators (SAs)
     workgroup managers (WMs), records managers and each commander to ensure adequate accounting
     and control procedures are in effect to properly manage this program.
     3.8.2. To manage effectively our electronic information resources the following applies:
        3.8.2.1. All domain administrators will ensure that application and system files are saved to the
        common applications (Apps) shared drive.
        3.8.2.2. Data saved on the “Public” shared drive (P: drive) will only pertain to wing level.
        3.8.2.3. Any information saved to the organizational drive (Y: drive) will be into an approved
        electronic file plan. All such information will be maintained in accordance with applicable records
        management disposition instructions.
        3.8.2.4. The only files allowed on a user’s home directory (Q: drive) are their personal address
        book and e-mail personal folders.
        3.8.2.5. With exception to electronic data in Paragraph 3.8.2.1.1., there will be no archival of
        personal information on the PDXAFRES domain servers.
     3.8.3. Privacy Act and for official use only (FOUO) data will be restricted access through user group
     or password protection. Enlisted Performance Reports (EPRs) and/or Officer Performance Reports
     (OPRs) are not allowed on the PDXAFRES domain servers.
     3.8.4. Any electronic information found contrary to the above statement is subject to removal.

                         INFORMATION PROTECTION AND SECURITY

NOTE: 939 ARW LAN POCs and 939 ARW LAN users must be aware of and adhere to virus procedures
contained in this directive. Failure to adhere to the following guidance is grounds for denial-of-service by
939 ARW LAN personnel.

4.1. REPORTING PROCEDURES (ATTACKS, VULNERABILITIES, INCIDENTS, VIRUS,
ETC). Report all automated information system (AIS) vulnerabilities, suspected intruder activity, secu-
rity incidents, and virus (malicious logic) attacks to your SA, WM or the 939 ARW CSO. All reporting
must be accomplished according to instructions outlined in AFSSI 5021. This does not negate other trou-
ble, discrepancy, or incident reporting mandated by other directives (i.e., AFI 31-401, Information Secu-
rity Program). Other 939 ARW LAN unique reporting requirements are incorporated into this instruction.
All virus incidents must be reported according to AFSSM 5023, Viruses and Other Forms of Malicious
Logic, and AFSSI 5021.

4.2. ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.
   4.2.1. Use anti-virus software available through the 939 ARW LAN. The 939 ARW LAN will provide
   automatic updates to users through the local Norton Anti-Virus Corporate server. It is not authorized
   for any 939 ARW LAN user to go outside the network (such as the internet or through FTP channels)
   to download auto update capabilities through the anti- virus software sites. This is only accomplished
   by the LAN manager and is provided for all users on the 939 ARW LAN.
   4.2.2. Systems Connected to 939 ARW LAN. All systems connected, directly or indirectly, to 939
   ARW LAN will use antivirus software when such software is available for the system. Users may not
   disable anti- virus software. If an antivirus software package is creating problems on a system, request
   assistance from your WM, SCBN or CSO. If the CSO is unable to resolve the problem, the software
   package may be disabled; AFRC Network Operations Systems Center (NOSC) will be contacted to
   correct the problem. If AFRC is unable to resolve the problem, other DoD antivirus software must be
   utilized and documented for accreditation purposes.
   4.2.3. All stand-alone systems (not connected to the 939 ARW LAN), such as notebooks/laptops or
   desktops not connected to the 939 ARW LAN, must obtain the available software and virus updates
   from the WM or the 939 ARW LAN Manager office weekly. A checklist shall be used to document
   compliance.
   4.2.4. Where feasible, scan all incoming traffic for viruses before use.
       4.2.4.1. The antivirus server will be configured to force client stations to perform automatic virus
       scans on a daily basis.
       4.2.4.2. Virus scan any data media transported between computers at home and work (etc., floppy
       disks or CD-RWs.)
       4.2.4.3. Virus scan all commercial off the shelf (COTS) software prior to installation on opera-
       tional AIS.
   4.2.5. 939 ARW LAN POCs include virus prevention, detection, eradication, and reporting proce-
   dures in user awareness training.

     4.2.6. 939 ARW CSO will include awareness training through e-mail to all air reserve technicians
     (ART) and wing DoD civilian employees highlighting information to be passed on to all users.

4.3. VIRUS ERADICATION ASSISTANCE. Users requiring assistance with virus or suspected virus
activity must first contact their WM, 939 ARW LAN Manager or the CSO.

4.4. REPEATED VIRUS INFECTION. Users and systems found to be repeatedly infected with a
virus may be denied service by 939 ARW LAN personnel until their systems, disks, and practices are
shown to be clean and unlikely to cause re-infection.

4.5. PASSWORD MANAGEMENT AND TERMINAL SECURITY.
     4.5.1. Each user is responsible for meeting the basic criteria for password composition, length,
     life-cycle, ownership, distribution, entry, authentication period, and safeguarding, as set forth in appli-
     cable AF directives. The following provides password and terminal rules and guidance for users of
     939 ARW LAN.
        4.5.1.1. 939 ARW LAN Access. Initial passwords to access 939 ARW LAN will be issued after
        completion of the training in accordance with paragraph 3.7. 939 ARW LAN personnel do not cre-
        ate or provide default passwords and do not provide them over the phone. Each user will contact
        the appropriate WM or 939 ARW LAN Manager office and present the proper identification to
        obtain an account and set his/her password
        4.5.1.2. Unattended PCs/Terminals/Workstations. If a terminal needs to be left unattended while
        logged in to 939 ARW LAN, a screen saver must be used with the password option activated or
        use the ctrl+alt+delete function to lock the workstation.
        4.5.1.3. As a minimum, all unattended workstations will be password protected. Those users who
        do not comply with this policy will have their computers set with a password enabled screen saver
        with a default timeout of 5 minutes.
     4.5.2. Other Password Rules/Guidance:
        4.5.2.1. At a minimum, you must safeguard all passwords as “For Official Use Only” (FOUO).
        4.5.2.2. Do not set 939 ARW LAN or leave e-mail passwords set to ‘password.’
        4.5.2.3. 939 ARW LAN account and e- mail passwords must use a mixture and at least one of
        each of the four following choices; upper case, lower case, numeric, and special characters
        (~!@#$%^*()+).
        4.5.2.4. Passwords must be at least eight characters in length.
        4.5.2.5. Password cannot be one of the last five passwords used.
        4.5.2.6. Enter passwords in such a manner that the password is not revealed to anyone observing
        the entry process.
        4.5.2.7. Protect your password so you are the only one to know it. No one from 939 ARW LAN
        will ask for your password in person or over the phone. Do not let other individuals use your
        account.
939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003                                                                          17


     4.5.2.8. Contact your WM or 939 ARW LAN Manager if you suspect your password has been
     compromised.
     4.5.2.9. Passwords Sample: %Iwnt$$2dY
     4.5.2.10. Do not construct passwords related to:
        4.5.2.10.1. Your personal identity or other identifiers such as SSN, phone numbers or a license
        plate number or family.
        4.5.2.10.2. Passwords from the dictionary, slang words, names, or profanity.
        4.5.2.10.3. Placing a single number at the beginning or ending of a password does not prevent
        it from being cracked. Most password cracking programs will check for and crack these pass-
        words.
     4.5.2.11. Please be aware the CSO continuously runs automated vulnerability software which
     checks for ineffective passwords. Any user whose password does not meet Air Force criteria will
     have their account disabled and be directed to change their password.

                  ADDING AND MAINTAINING 939 ARW LAN CONNECTIONS

5.1. ADDING 939 ARW LAN CONNECTIONS.
     5.1.1. All connections to 939 ARW LAN must be authorized by the 939 ARW LAN Manager, CSO
     and DAA. All connections must adhere to 939 ARW Certification and Accreditation (C&A) in con-
     junction with the 939 ARW System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA). To add new users to
     the 939 ARW LAN, please refer to Chapter 3, paragraph 3.7.. Exceptions to the C&A and SSAA
     must be documented via letter of agreement/memorandum of agreement (LOA/MOA) and indorsed
     by the CSO and DAA. All changes to an existing 939 ARW LAN connection must be authorized by
     the 939 ARW LAN Manager and CSO. Changes include, but are not limited to:
        5.1.1.1. Adding hubs, ports, routers, etc. to existing connections.
        5.1.1.2. Changing a user LAN connection or a network printer connection.
        5.1.1.3. Changes regarding modems including modem configuration changes, etc.
     5.1.2. All requests for connections, changes, or services require an approved AF Form 3215, C4 Sys-
     tems Requirements Document, be submitted to 939 CF/SCBN office.
     5.1.3. Each AF Form 3215 will be reviewed, approved or disapproved for security, feasibility, stan-
     dards as set by AF, HQ AFRC, host base and the 939 ARW C2WG standards.

5.2. ACCREDITATION/APPROVAL TO OPERATE.
     5.2.1. IAW AFI 33-202, Computer Security, all systems connected to 939 ARW LAN must have a
     current, up-to-date, approval to operate (accreditation) signed by the DAA. For assistance, contact
     your SA, WM, 939 ARW LAN Manager or CSO. Certain desktop systems fall under the 939 ARW
     LAN accreditation umbrella and do not require a separate accreditation. The list below describes non
     standard systems. If any desktop system meets any of the following criteria it must have separate
     approval to operate on the 939 ARW LAN:
        5.2.1.1. Software not standard to a 939 ARW LAN desktop. Reference Paragraph 6.3. below.
        5.2.1.2. A modem connected to a phone line.
        5.2.1.3. A connection to a non-939 ARW LAN system, even if the connection is not active during
        939 ARW LAN sessions.
        5.2.1.4. Operates in a classified mode.
        5.2.1.5. Intended for use in a stand-alone (separate from 939 ARW LAN) mode.
        5.2.1.6. Any feature (software, hardware, connection, etc) making the system significantly differ-
        ent from a standard 939 ARW LAN desktop machine.

5.3. ACCREDITATION REVIEW. Copies of signed approval to operate letters, as required above,
must be forwarded to the 939 ARW CSO, along with the accreditation package for review.
939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003                                                                        19


5.4. MODEMS.
  5.4.1. Modems pose a significant risk to the 939 ARW LAN. Improperly connected/configured
  modems can allow access to the 939 ARW LAN by unauthorized personnel, circumventing security
  barriers to prevent such access. All PCs with modems connected to phone lines must be identified in
  the PCs accreditation package and to the 939 ARW LAN CSO. Justification for the modem connec-
  tion and configuration information must be included in the accreditation package. Configuration
  information must include, but is not limited to, status of dial- in capabilities. 939 ARW LAN users
  must submit an AF Form 3215 for any of the following:
     5.4.1.1. Plugging a modem in to a phone line.
     5.4.1.2. Changing configuration settings on a modem.
     5.4.1.3. The AF Form 3215 must be reviewed by the 939 ARW LAN Manager and CSO.
     5.4.1.4. Once approved by the 939 ARW LAN Manager and the CSO, the change must be
     updated in the 939 ARW LAN accreditation package and the PCs accreditation package.
     5.4.1.5. Any modem connection allowing dial- in capability to the PC on 939 ARW LAN must be
     approved by the CSO and DAA prior to activation of dial-in capability.

                              SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

NOTE: The 939 ARW software management policies, as outlined in the paragraphs below, apply to all
939th Air Refueling Wing personnel at Portland IAP, OR. It is the responsibility of 939 CF/SCBN net-
work control center (NCC), each commander, and the workgroup managers (WMs) to ensure adequate
accounting and control procedures are in effect to properly manage this program.

6.1. 939 ARW SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT.
     6.1.1. WMs will originate all new software purchases using an AF Form 3215 for justification. Infor-
     mation Assurance (IA) and NCC coordination are required prior to purchase and/or use.
     6.1.2. IA must keep all original software and licenses in a secure cabinet. IA will maintain a written
     inventory of original software, licenses, and keys which will be kept up to date at all times. This
     inventory must match the systems management server (SMS) and Bell Manage application inventory
     maintained by the network configuration manager.
     6.1.3. The NCC will receive and inventory network software, test and validate new software applica-
     tions and network operating systems.
     6.1.4. New software included with a new computer system must be inventoried by WMs and added to
     the software management database maintained by IA.
     6.1.5. Virus checks will be ongoing using server-managed Norton Anti-virus. Norton Anti-virus will
     be activated at all times.
     6.1.6. To maintain software releases and updates, the NCC and WMs will use a combination of SMS
     automated updates and suspense implementation.
     6.1.7. Removal of unauthorized software.
        6.1.7.1. It is the users responsibility to justify the use of the software using the software authori-
        zation process as outlined in Paragraph 6.1.2.
        6.1.7.2. If unauthorized software is found, it will be removed immediately.
     6.1.8. Do not install and use copies of government-owned software on a home computer unless the
     software license explicitly allows users to do so and the wing communications and information sys-
     tems officer (CSO) has authorized such use. When authorized for installation on a home computer, the
     software may be used only for official AF business. Do not make any copies of copyrighted software.
     6.1.9. WMs and the network configuration manager will conduct a software inventory and IA will
     review site license agreements once a year. Recommend the month of February following annual
     IPMS systems inventory.

6.2. SOFTWARE LICENSING. Care must be taken to ensure compliance with software licensing/
copyright agreements. All 939 ARW LAN POCs and WMs must be familiar with software licensing rules.
These individuals are responsible to ensure 939 ARW LAN users in their unit or area, are familiar with
licensing rules. Failure to adhere to licensing agreements is grounds for legal and or disciplinary adminis-
trative action, in addition to denial of service by 939 ARW LAN personnel.
939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003                                                                              21


6.3. SERVED NETWORK SOFTWARE. Served network software is software residing on a network
server, intended to be run by users on their desktop PC. This software may not be copied to the local desk-
top PC disk drive(s), floppies, or other network drives by users. Doing so, may violate software licensing
agreements. If any served software is installed separately on a desktop PC hard drive, the user (unit) must
be able to produce documentation proving a software license exists that is dedicated to that PC or a site
license that covers that PC.

6.4. CHANGING SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT. Due to the continuously evolving 939 ARW LAN
environment, the CSO is responsible to periodically update a list of 939 ARW LAN software. This list
will indicate 939 ARW LAN software packages authorized on the local PC and those only authorized to
be served out from a network server (not authorized on the local PC without an independent license). This
listing will be made available to users upon request and through the 939 ARW Intranet Site, Support
Group/Communications Flight web site.

6.5. CONTINGENCY BACKUP OFFICE AUTOMATION SOFTWARE. Units desiring to main-
tain software on the local PC in the event of a 939 ARW LAN outage, or for any other reason, must have
independent software licenses dedicated to that PC (or appropriate site license).

6.6. COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE INTRODUCED TO 939 ARW LAN SERVERS. Users are not
authorized to copy, install, download, or backup copyrighted software or executable software (e.g., ‘.exe’
files) to 939 ARW LAN servers (e.g., ‘Y’, ‘W’ or unit designated drives, etc). Exceptions must be
approved by the 939 ARW LAN Manager and CSO via an AF Form 3215. Additional space required by a
user must also be submitted on an AF Form 3215 to the user’s WM.

6.7. ENSURING COMPLIANCE. All units/agencies with desktop PCs connected to 939 ARW LAN
are subject to 939 ARW LAN software licensing compliance reviews by the CSO, 939 ARW LAN per-
sonnel, or WM within your group. Lack of cooperation (i.e., access to PCs connected to 939 ARW LAN)
during such reviews or inability to produce requested licensing documentation for PCs connected to 939
ARW LAN are grounds for denial-of-service by 939 ARW LAN personnel. All 939 ARW units will con-
duct inventories of software and licenses at least annually. Software copyright violations must be resolved
via removing software in question or taking appropriate action (i.e., purchasing software, and locating
licenses).

                                                 Chapter 7

                                       CLASSIFIED PROCESSING

7.1. CLASSIFICATION. 939 ARW LAN is a sensitive but unclassified AIS. Processing classified
information on 939 ARW LAN is prohibited. Processing includes, but is not limited to, viewing, printing,
creating, transferring, editing, downloading, uploading, opening, copying, and transmission of classified
information over 939 ARW LAN.

7.2. SECURITY INCIDENTS. When classified information has been identified as having been intro-
duced to 939 ARW LAN (i.e., e-mail, user or group network drive, PC connected to 939 ARW LAN, etc.)
or any other unclassified systems or equipment, the following requirements must be followed. (Contami-
nation occurs via ANY activity involving classified information on an unclassified system):
     7.2.1. Incidents involving information that is suspected to be classified will have the classification
     verified by the appropriate OPR and/or via the security classification guide prior to initiating the san-
     itizing process.
     7.2.2. The 939 ARW LAN Manager or CSO will initiate a lockdown of the affected account, file or
     system, in order to protect the potentially classified information until a final determination has been
     made.
     7.2.3. Simply deleting E-mail or disk files IS NOT sufficient to clean up classified information on an
     automated system, no matter how minor you feel the incident or type activity is. Just viewing or print-
     ing a classified document can contaminate a system, requiring clean up, even if you didn’t save it.
     7.2.4. DO NOT delete or destroy anything (E-mail, disk files, hard copies, etc). The 939 ARW LAN
     Manager and CSO must have specific information about the suspected documents or information in
     order to ensure thorough clean up is accomplished. This is required to verify the clean-up process was
     successful. If adequate information is not available, security team personnel may require affected
     equipment’s hard drives be completely wiped vice ‘surgical wiping’.
     7.2.5. Immediately notify the 939 ARW LAN Manager or CSO (or HQ AFRC/NOSC if after normal
     duty hours). Specific information about the location of classified information that has been introduced
     to an unsecured system is, at a minimum, extremely sensitive information (i.e., user name, user ID, PC
     location, etc), especially when identifying the fact that there may be classified information contained
     thereon. If the 939 ARW LAN Manager or CSO cannot be notified in a reasonable amount of time, the
     following must be accomplished:
        7.2.5.1. Discontinue use of contaminated systems and physically disconnect the contaminated
        system from all unclassified connections until the system has been sanitized or sanitation proce-
        dures require reconnection.
        7.2.5.2. Change all involved passwords and handle as classified at the level of classified informa-
        tion involved. For e-mail incidents be sure to password access all contaminated E-mail folders as
        well as your main 939 ARW LAN logon password. (Exchange uses the 939 ARW LAN logon
        password to access your E-mail on the Exchange server.) Notify your ISSO or equivalent. (The
        ISSO may be identified as the WM).
        7.2.5.3. Provide assistance to and follow any procedures provided by 939 ARW LAN personnel.
        Failure to follow instructions provided by 939 ARW LAN personnel may result in denial of ser-
939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003                                                                                23


     vice and could result in administrative or disciplinary action for failure to protect national security
     information.
     7.2.5.4. Secure all classified materials in approved containers. Secure contaminated equipment
     based on the level of classified involved and the degree of security provided by your facility, the
     duration over which the equipment will remain contaminated, and the magnitude of the incident
     (i.e., number of users involved). If the incident involves a contaminated PC, change or activate the
     PC BIOS password via the PCs setup process.
     7.2.5.5. Notify your wing security manager. Handle and report the incident as an information
     security incident according to AFI 31-401.
  7.2.6. 939 ARW LAN Manager or CSO will:
     7.2.6.1. Take all necessary actions to ensure protection and sanitation of affected network systems
     using methods fulfilling the requirements of AFSSI 5020, Magnetic Remanence. Reasonable
     efforts must be made, first, to protect the classified information, and second, to sanitize all affected
     accounts and systems as expeditiously as possible. Deviation from standard sanitation methods
     due to extenuating circumstances (i.e., mass contamination of user accounts/PCs, etc) must be
     coordinated through 939 ARW DAA, HQ AFRC/NOSC and the owner/originator of the classified
     information.
     7.2.6.2. Protection Via 939 ARW LAN Shutdown or Isolation (partial or complete). Contemplat-
     ing shutdown or isolation of 939 ARW LAN must take into account the following:
        7.2.6.2.1. Level of classified involved and its potential damage to national security if compro-
        mised or further compromised. Consult appropriate agencies when special category informa-
        tion is involved.
        7.2.6.2.2. How widespread the contamination is.
        7.2.6.2.3. Amount of time it will take to disable affected accounts.
        7.2.6.2.4. Amount of time it will take to sanitize accounts and systems involved.
        7.2.6.2.5. General exposure/vulnerability of the information to compromise.
        7.2.6.2.6. Cost in work hours due to unavailability of network resources to users and organi-
        zations.
     7.2.6.3. Disable (make inaccessible) affected user accounts and e- mail accounts until contami-
     nated accounts are sanitized or until access is required for the sanitation process.
     7.2.6.4. Provide users and ISSOs instructions and assistance.
     7.2.6.5. Request assistance from the HQ AFRC/NOSC as needed.
     7.2.6.6. Report the incident to the 939 MSS/SFI, HQ AFRC/NOSC, and HQ NAF.
     7.2.6.7. Provide the necessary information and cooperation to ensure all contaminated systems
     outside 939 ARW LAN are notified of the incident and provide necessary information to aid in
     sanitizing their systems.

                                                 Chapter 8

     MANAGING COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE

8.1. ACCOUNTABILITY. All 939 ARW communications and computer equipment and software are
accountable government assets. Government assets are managed by a strict set of rules to protect govern-
ment resources from misuse, theft, damage, or destruction. The CSO will determine the items to be
included in the accountability system, Information Protection Management System (IPMS).
     8.1.1. AFI 33-112 states that any item of $500 or more must be tracked within IPMS. For 939 ARW,
     equipment or software that may be considered of significant value and pilferable will be tracked
     regardless of the cost of the equipment or software. Higher headquarters, wing DAA and 939 ARW
     LAN Manager will establish policy and guidance on what is of significant value and pilferable.
     8.1.2. All software whether freeware, shareware or licensed is accountable.

8.2. RESPONSIBILITIES. Responsibilities on the management of communications and computer (C4)
equipment and software are outlined in AFI 33-112 and AFI 33-114. This instruction supplements higher
headquarters direction.

939 ARW LAN POC—Individual assigned the additional duty of CSSO, TASO, TCM, and WPM.
Accreditation—Written documentation by a designated approving authority (DAA) that a C4 system is
approved to operate in a particular security mode using a prescribed set of security features or safeguards
for a specified period of time.
Automated Information System—Any equipment or interconnected system or subsystems of
equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement,
control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data and includes software,
firmware, and hardware. NOTE: The term “AIS” includes stand-alone systems, communications
systems, and computer network systems of all sizes, whether digital, analog, or hybrid; associated
peripheral devices and software; process control computers; security components; embedded computer
systems; communications switching computers; personal computers; workstations; microcomputers;
intelligent terminals; word processors; automated data processing (ADP) systems; office automation
systems; application and operating system software; firmware; and other AIS technologies, as developed.
Certification—Comprehensive evaluation of the technical and non-technical security features, and
countermeasures of an AIS to establish the extent to which a particular design and implementation meet a
set of specified security requirements.
30                                                                       939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003


Certification and Accreditation—C&A is a method for ensuring that appropriate combinations of
security measures are implemented to counter relevant threats and vulnerabilities.
Certifying Official—Individual responsible for making a technical judgment of the AIS compliance with
stated security requirements and requesting approval to operate from the DAA.
Communications-Information Systems Officer or Computer Security Officer(CSO)—T h e t e r m
CSO identifies the supporting CSO at all levels. The commander of the communications flight is the
primary CSO for the 939 ARW; the information assurance officer is the alternate CSO for the wing. At
MAJCOM and other activities, it is the person designated by the commander as responsible for overall
management of communications- information systems budgeted and funded by the MAJCOM or activity.
The CSO function uses the office symbol “ARW/CSO” which is expanded to three and four digits to
identify specific functional areas. CSOs are the accountable officers for all automated data processing
equipment in their inventory.
Computer System(s) Manager (CSM)—Official with supervisory or management responsibility for an
organization, activity, or functional area that owns or operates an AIS. The CSM is operationally and
administratively responsible for a system's mission performance. The CSM establishes and monitors the
security program for a system and approves procedures at its remote sites. The CSM is responsible for
security for the system's facility. For office automation systems, the CSM is usually the office chief.
(Note: they are normally the senior communications officer, office chief, etc.). The CSM obtains approval
to operate from the DAA prior to operating their system(s). They plan and program budgetary, manpower,
and training support for the operation and security of the system. They also develop administrative
procedures (controls) to ensure the secure operation of the system.
Countermeasure—The sum of a safeguard and its associated controls.
Data Aggregation—The convergence of information. This becomes a problem when certain information
or data elements at one sensitivity level, requires reclassification at a higher level when combined or
associated with other information. Aggregate data would require classification if the new information
meets the specific classifying criteria as defined in DoD 5200.1-R or reclassification according to
classification guidance provided by the functional OPR.
Designated Approving Authority (DAA)—Official with the authority to formally assume responsibility
for operating an AIS or network within a specified environment.
End Users—The end users support the certification process by providing statement-of-need, operational
concepts, and security requirements inputs to the PM and certifying official.
Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI)—Key questions likely to be asked by adversary
elements about specific friendly intentions, capabilities, and activities, so as to obtain answers critical to
their operational effectiveness. (Joint Pub 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and
Associated Terms) (Valid answers to EEFI normally constitute classified information)
Firewall—A protection scheme that assists in securing internal systems from external systems.
Functional Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—Organization (e.g., division, directorate, or unit)
that employs, but may not own, an AIS to perform its mission (function). NOTE: Normally, they own the
data that is stored or processed on the AIS.
Home Page—A starting point or center of an info structure on the WWW. A typical home page will
consist of hypertext links (pointers) to other web documents.
939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003                                                                              31


Incident—Unauthorized access or entry (or attempt) to an AIS. It can include browsing; disruption or
denial of service; alteration or destruction of input, processing, storage, or output of information; or
changes to AIS hardware, firmware, or software characteristics with or without the user’s knowledge,
instruction, or intent.
Information Protection Office—Formerly C4 Systems Security Office (ISSO).
Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO)—Official who manages the COMPUSEC program for
an AIS assigned to them by the CSM; including monitoring AIS activities, and ensuring that the AIS is
operated, maintained, and disposed of according to security policies and practices. The ISSO administers
the system security policy in the operational environment, performs security-related tasks as required by
the DAA, and ensures that only the system maintainer modifies the system. The ISSO prepares
certification and accreditation plans for systems as defined in Section D. The ISSO maintains certification
for the fielded system. The ISSO assists in the development of the system security policy and ensures
compliance on a day-to-day basis. They identify and/or report security incidents, provide user training,
and identify pending system or environment changes that may require re-certification or re-accreditation
of the system. The ISSO must be intimately involved during pre-certification, certification, and
accreditation phases of the C&A process. Their most important role is during the post-accreditation phase
where they ensure the security posture of the system and the accreditation are maintained.
Internet—An informal collection of government, military, commercial, and educational computer
networks using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to transmit information.
The global collection of interconnected local, mid-level, and wide area networks that use IP as the
network layer protocol.
Intranet—A restricted-access network that works like the web, but isn’t on it. Usually owned and
managed by an organization, an intranet enables an activity to share its resources with its employees
without sensitive information being made available to everyone with internet access. Intranets may allow
connection outside of the intranet to the internet through firewall servers and other security devices that
have the ability to screen messages in both directions so that the organizations security is maintained.
Intruder—Unauthorized person who accesses an AIS with or without an unlawful intent. Typically an
intruder breaks into a system for the challenge of defeating the system's security features.
Local Area Network (LAN)—A telecommunications system, within a small, specified geographical
area, designed to allow a number of independent devices to communicate with each other over a common
transmission topology. LANs are usually restricted to relatively small geographical areas (i.e., rooms,
buildings, or clusters of buildings) and utilize fairly high data rates. Depending on the implementation,
these communications networks can provide internal interchange of voice, data, graphics, video, or other
forms of electronic messaging.
Log in—Procedure used to establish the identity of the user, and the levels of authorization and access
permitted.
Log off—Procedure used to end a user’s access to a system.
Malicious Logic—Intentional inclusion of hardware, firmware, or software to disrupt AIS availability,
integrity, or confidentiality. NOTE: Trojan Horse is a form of malicious logic.
Network Account—User ID & Password which allow a user to log on and access resources on the 939th
Local Area Network.
32                                                                     939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003


Network Manager (NM)—The individual who is responsible for the operation of a network.
Page Maintainer—The creator and, or focal point for specific material posted on the organization’s
home page.
Password—Protected and private character string used to authenticate an identity or to authorize access
to data.
Penetration—The successful unauthorized access to an AIS or act of bypassing the AIS security
controls.
Personal Password—Password known by one person and used to authenticate that person’s identity.
Risk Management—The total management process of identifying, measuring, controlling, and
minimizing uncertain events affecting AIS. NOTE: Risk management activities directly support
certification and affect the accreditation decision.
Safeguards—Protective measures and controls prescribed to meet the security requirements of AIS.
NOTE: Safeguards include security features and management constraints from the various security
disciplines (i.e., administrative, procedural, physical, personnel, communications, emanations, and
computer security), used in concert to provide the requisite level-of protection.
Security Feature—A hardware, firmware, or software controlled access protection to meet the security
requirements of identification and authentication (I&A), mandatory access control (MAC), discretionary
access control (DAC), object reuse, or audit. Security features are a subset of AIS security safeguards.
Sensitive, But Unclassified (SBU) Information—Unclassified information that is considered sensitive
because it requires protection due to the risk and magnitude of loss or harm that could result from
inadvertent or deliberate disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the data. The term includes information
whose improper use or disclosure could adversely affect the ability of an agency to accomplish its
mission, proprietary data, records about individuals requiring protection under the Privacy Act, and data
not releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. (Office of Management and Budget Circular No.
A-130, Dec. 12, 1985.) See Attachment 2 of AFSSI 5102 for identifying SBU information.
Software—A set of computer programs, procedures, and associated documentation concerned with the
operation of a data processing system, e.g., compilers, library routines, manuals, and circuit diagrams.
(See JP 1-02.)
System Security Policy—Set of laws, rules, and practices that regulate how sensitive (SBU and
classified) information is managed, protected, and distributed by an AIS. NOTE: System security policy
interprets regulatory and operational requirements for a particular system and states how that system will
satisfy those requirements. All systems or networks that process SBU or classified information, will have
a security policy.
Threat—Current and perceived capability, intention, or attack directed to cause denial of service,
corruption, compromise, or fraud, waste, and abuse to a system.
Unit COMPUSEC Manager—The unit COMPUSEC manager is the single individual within each
organization responsible for developing and managing the COMPUSEC program on a day-to-day basis.
Normally, they require assistance and assign ISSOs to particular systems or groups of systems.
User—Person or process accessing an AIS by direct connections (e.g., via terminals) or indirect
connections.
939ARWI33-201 1 APRIL 2003                                                                             33


User Representative—The user representative is the focal point for the end users. They provide the voice
in identifying the user’s roles, responsibilities, and capabilities. The user representative, at minimum,
reviews and approves the security requirements, assurance factors, certification results, and any proposed
security features.
User Identification (User-id)—Unique symbol or character string used by an AIS to uniquely identify a
specific user.
