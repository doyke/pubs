       for developing specifications and sources for equipment items being considered for
       procurement.
       1.2.3. Provides an equipment quality assurance program that identifies and corrects
       equipment hazards and defects. Investigates incidents/occurrences involving medical
       equipment and assists in preparing Materiel Discrepancy Reports per the Safe Medical
       Device Act. Maintains maintenance data and documentation records in an Equipment

      Prevention and Control Program.
      1.3.6. Immediately impounds any equipment and consumables suspected of being
      involved in an incident. Promptly notifies Clinical Engineering when medical equipment
      is suspected of being involved in any incident involving injury or potential injury to
      patient, staff, or visitor. After normal duty hours, Clinical Engineering may be contacted
      through the Medical Control Center (MCC) at 292-7674. If the incident occurred
      between the hours of 0001 and 0500, the Clinical Engineering Flight may be reached by
      contacting Medical Response Center at 292-1800.
      1.3.7. Maintains an accurate inventory of on-hand equipment, identifies equipment
      requirements by initiating request for purchase through Medical Equipment Management
      Office and prepares documents to turn in unneeded or replaced equipment.
   1.4. Medical Equipment Management Office. Processes all requests for medical, dental and
   research equipment or upgrades from any source (i.e. purchase, gift, rented, trial unit or
   loaner item), as well as equipment receipt (gains) and loss (turn-in) actions. (See AFI 41-
   209, Medical Logistics Support, and 59MDWI 41-209, Equipment Item Accounting)
2. Procedures for Obtaining Maintenance Services.
   2.1. Scheduled Maintenance. Routine scheduled maintenance, other than that accomplished
   by the operator, is scheduled by Clinical Engineering and does not require a user request. Air
   Force Medical Logistics Office (AFMLO)/FOE establishes minimum scheduled maintenance
   requirements/schedules based on equipment function, physical risk or consequence of failure
   and environment of use. Scheduled maintenance frequency requirements are found in the
   Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) System.
   2.2. Unscheduled Maintenance.
      2.2.1. Routine and Urgent Equipment Maintenance Requests.
          2.2.1.1. Transportable Equipment.
              2.2.1.1.1. Deliver all "readily transportable" defective equipment to Room BM
              10M (located near the Urgent Care and Basement Pharmacy) between normal
              workday duty hours of 0730-1045 and 1130-1545.
              2.2.1.1.2. Complete an AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag. The
              lower portion of the AFTO Form 350, listing the noun (item description), work
              order number and quantity, will be given to the customer as means of maintaining
              equipment accountability pending completion of repairs.
          2.2.1.2. Installed medical equipment. Maintenance issues will be reported to Clinical
          Engineering at 292-5103. Clinical Engineering will prepare a work order and repair
          equipment on-site.
      2.2.2. Emergency Equipment Repairs and Incidents involving medical equipment.
          2.2.2.1. Normal duty hours. Report emergency repair of medical equipment to
          Clinical Engineering by calling 292-5103.

       group commander to the 59 MLRS/CC who will route it to the 59th Medical Wing
       Commander, or designee for approval. The request must include a complete
       justification, drawings and essential purpose to be served.
           2.2.3.2.1. Approved requests will be routed to Clinical Engineering who will
           provide a list of materials required for the requestor to purchase. Upon receipt of
           needed materials, Clinical Engineering performs the modification.
           2.2.3.2.2. Disapproved requests will be returned, through the appropriate group
           commander, to the initiating requestor.

Terms
Accessories, Components, Repair Parts and Consumables—(1) Accessories can stand on
their own to independently perform a desired function, but are used with an end item enhance the
usefulness of the end item. (2)Components are parts or assemblies that cannot be used
independently. They depend on an end item to function must be used in conjunction with an
equipment end item (the end item is not dependent on the component to operate). (3) Repair
parts defective pieces or assemblies that the end item is dependent on to operate (the Clinical
Engineering Technician normally replaces such parts). (4) Consumable parts or assemblies do
not affect the life or condition of the end item (e.g., EKG straps, EKG electrodes, temperature
probes, suction bottles, lamps, transducers and batteries). The user installs these items.
Emergency Maintenance—Equipment presents a safety hazard, places the operator or patient in
danger, or must by the most expeditious means because equipment: (1) is one of a kind and
required to prevent patient suffering or death, or unacceptable delay in services, (2) places the
operator in danger, (3) is utilized in an experimental capacity and by not being operable is
delaying or endangering a mission or program.
Maintenance—Any action accomplished to maintain or restore equipment to a serviceable
condition. This includes actions to modify or improve the capabilities of existing equipment.
Medical/Dental Equipment—Equipment that retains its identity while performing medical
diagnoses and treatment.
Preventive Maintenance—Systematic servicing, and inspection of equipment to keep it safe
and serviceable. It is a joint responsibility by the equipment operators and Clinical Engineering
to prevent, detect and correct minor faults before they become major defects.
Routine Maintenance—Equipment usually permits continued operation without incurring
additional equipment damage.
Scheduled Maintenance—Service to insure optimum performance, safe operation, minimum
downtime, and maximum useful life falls into two categories: (1) preventive maintenance, and
(2) calibration and certification.
Test Measurement Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE)—Tools, test and calibration equipment
specifically for repair, inspection, calibration, or adjustment of equipment/systems. TMDE
provides a known reference of comparison for performance measure.
Unscheduled Maintenance and Repair—Actions necessary to restore normal function, safety,
performance, and reliability to malfunctioning equipment. Normally requires the services of a
trained Biomedical Engineering Technician (AFSC 4A2X1). Unscheduled maintenance is
divided into the following DMLSS categories.
Urgent Maintenance—Equipment is usually inoperative, but delays in making the required
repairs will not cause serious damage or cause complete work stoppage in the department
concerned.
