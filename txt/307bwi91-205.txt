                            SPECIFIC SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

A2.1. Combat Arms or CA trained personnel will supervise the issue all blank ammunition.
A2.2. Blank ammunition will not be fired from any weapon that does not have a blank adapter
installed.
A2.3. Standard weapon safety procedures will be observed at all times.
A2.4. Blank 5.56mm (M16) will not be fired at personnel any closer than 30 feet, T.O. 11W3-5-
5-1). M-249 SAW no closer than 30 feet, T.O. 11W3-5-5-51. M-240 MG no closer than 40 feet,
T.O. 11W1-12-8-52.
A2.5. After the completion of any exercise scenario using blank ammo, the person in charge,
will ensure all weapons are cleared/empty prior to leaving the exercise area: All cartridge cases
and links will be collected and turned-in as munitions residue. Loading/Unloading of weapons
will be performed at approved clearing barrel areas.
A2.6. Weapons will NEVER be fired from inside buildings.
A2.7. Blank firing adapters will NEVER be covered or camouflaged in any way and will only
be hand tightened.
A2.8. When in field conditions where no clearing barrel is present, clear all weapons by pointing
them in a safe direction i.e., toward the ground, in such a way as to contain (capture) any and all
projectiles that may be propelled from the weapon to prevent striking people/buildings.
A2.9. Simulators and Smoke Producing Munitions. See (AFMAN 91-201_BAFBSUP1,
Explosive Safety Standards, paragraph 2.35) for licensing requirements. The following applies to
the use of these devices during exercises and training: (Refer to BAFB Pamphlet (PAM) 91-9,
Simulator and Smoke Producing Munitions for installation specific requirements.)
   A2.9.1. Only United States Air Force (USAF) stock-listed items are authorized for use.
   Other military services will use Department of Defense (DoD) approved items only, when
   using USAF ranges or facilities.
   A2.9.2. AFRC qualified personnel are those individuals who are trained and certified by
   EOD to provide simulator and smoke producing munitions training to other base personnel.
   As a minimum, training will be both academic and practical. Academic training includes
   item description and associated hazards; safety and handling precautions; technical data
   warnings/ cautions; pre-use, post-use inspection criteria; misfire, Disconnected Unauthorized
   Device (DUD), and munitions residue disposition procedures. Practical training will not
   commence prior to successful completion of the academic portion.
   A2.9.3. Minimum Distances Separations.
       A2.9.3.1. Personnel or vehicle: Maintain a minimum of 125 feet separation. Personnel
       who initiate these munitions may be closer than 125 feet, but they should be as close to
       125 feet as possible and have their back to the munitions. Exception: no specific distance
       is required for non-toxic colored smoke grenades. Avoid the smoke or follow actions
       required in AFMAN 91-201, Table 2.3.
12                                                         307BWI91-205 22 MARCH 2011


  A2.9.4. Smoke from grenades and pots is sometimes toxic in high concentrations. Contact
  Environmental Management and the Fire Department prior to use. These items, along with
  generators and flares present a fire hazard. Remove combustible materials before
  functioning. Consider winds and fire hazards such as dry grass or fire bans. Consider using a
  barrier to control spread of heat during functioning of grenades and smoke pots.
  A2.9.5. Ground burst or hand grenade simulators present a blast hazard. Exercise caution
  around people, facilities and equipment. Free the area of combustible material within a ten
  feet radius. Monitor for proper functioning and disposal of residue. Notify EOD or other
  qualified personnel when munitions malfunction. The on-scene commander will determine
  minimum withdrawal distance for malfunctioned ground burst or hand grenade simulators for
  the given situation. This distance will never be less than the minimum distances given in
  AFMAN 91-201, paragraph 2.24.2 applicable item TO's, whichever is greater.
  A2.9.6. Only qualified personnel are able to prepare and activate simulators and smoke
  producing munitions. Personnel will receive annual training to use these types of assets.
  Documentation of training will be reviewed by the wing safety office prior to any issue of
  simulators and smoke producing munitions.
