This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and
Facilities. The purpose of this instruction is to provide instruction and guidance for those
responsible for planning, programming, and executing real property Facilities Operation
requirements (formerly known as Real Property Services) in compliance with public law,
Department of Defense (DOD), and Air Force (AF) policies. It applies to individuals at all levels
who plan, program, budget, and execute funding of Facilities Operation (FO) funding, including
Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. FO addresses
―municipal-like‖ installation activities that are directly related to real property. FO resources
complement Defense-wide sustainment and recapitalization programs to provide a
comprehensive view of the requirements and costs associated with existing DOD facilities and
infrastructure. To ensure a full understanding of the process of providing operational
requirements to real property, users of this instruction must also be familiar with other Air Force
32-(Civil Engineer) and 65-(Budget) series publications (AFI 65-601, Volume I, Finance
Management, Budget Guidance and Procedures, is particularly important).                       Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route

                                           OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to provide instruction and guidance for those
responsible for planning, programming, and executing real property Facilities Operation
requirements in compliance with public law, Department of Defense (DOD), and Air Force (AF)
policies.
   1.1.1. Facilities Operation (FO): The FO program encompasses those ―municipal-like‖
   functions performed on an installation that are directly related to real property. FO also
   includes Civil Engineer (CE) combat capabilities (i.e. Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force
   (BEEF)). The FO Program covers 10 activities, which are discussed further throughout this
   document. These 10 functions are:
       1.1.1.1. Fire Prevention and Emergency Services(See chapter 2)
       1.1.1.2. Utilities(See chapter 3)
       1.1.1.3. Pavement Clearance (See chapter 4)
       1.1.1.4. Integrated Solid Waste Collection and Disposal(See chapter 5)
       1.1.1.5. Real Property Leases(See chapter 6)
       1.1.1.6. Grounds Maintenance and Landscaping(See chapter 7)
       1.1.1.7. Pest Management (Control)(See chapter 8)
       1.1.1.8. Custodial(See chapter 9)
       1.1.1.9. Real Property Management and Engineering Services(See chapter 10)
       1.1.1.10. Readiness Engineering(See chapter 11)
The FO program includes manpower authorizations, support equipment and furnishings,
contracts, and associated costs belonging exclusively to and required to plan, manage, and
execute the functions defined throughout this document. The FO program excludes sustainment,
restoration and modernization (SRM) of facilities, environmental services (such as disposal of
hazardous materials), Installation Services, and mission-funded costs which are funded through
other Program Elements (PE).
   1.1.2. Real Property Services to Facilities Operation Background: In order to improve the
   management of base support programs and strengthen the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense’s (OSD) ability to track funding in programming, budget development,
   congressional appropriations and execution, the Principal Assistant Deputy Under Secretary
   of Defense (Installations and Environment) (PADUSD (I&E)), directed the standardization
   of Real Property Services (RPS) across the Department of Defense and directed the Services
   to realign funding in their existing RPS program in accordance with the new OSD
   standardized FO definitions. This standardization allowed OSD to develop the Facilities
   Operation Model (FOM) to forecast the Services’ and other DOD Agencies’ FO
   requirements. As a direct result of standardization, the former Real Property Services
   program was realigned and is now classified as the FO program. The AF realigned its former
6                                                           AFI32-10140 19 FEBRUARY 2010


    RPS program with OSD’s new FO program definitions. These changes were made effective
    in FY07 for planning and programming purposes and in FY08 for execution.
       1.1.2.1. MAJCOMs realigned funds from their RPS program (PE XXX79F) for service
       contracts designed to keep facilities in good working order (e.g., elevator or facility crane
       inspection and maintenance, hangar door maintenance, etc.) to the Facilities Sustainment
       PEs (PE XXX78F).
       1.1.2.2. MAJCOMs realigned funds from their RPS program for operation of permanent
       party unaccompanied housing, including funds required to provide and sustain
       furnishings/appliances, into a new series of PEs. These new PEs are defined by OSD
       Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) as follows, ―Includes manpower
       authorizations, peculiar and support equipment, necessary facilities and the associated
       costs specifically identified and measurable to Permanent Party Unaccompanied Housing
       Operations and Furnishing: management, housing assignment, care of quarters,
       provisions, care preservation and maintenance of furnishings/appliances. Excluded are
       functional categories, which are funded and reported under separate PEs. Examples
       include: SRM of facilities, environmental services and base communications.‖ It must
       be noted that not all PEs ending in ―79F‖, are part of the FO PE series.
       1.1.2.3. MAJCOMs realigned funds for recurring non-hazardous recycling operating
       costs from pollution prevention PEs (PE XXX54F) to the FO PE series (PE XXX79F).
       Only the recurring non-hazardous recycling costs from the pollution prevention PE for
       the solid waste stream that typically goes to municipal solid waste landfill are considered
       FO. FO does not include special waste, hazardous waste, classified waste, or other
       wastes. ―Other wastes‖ are those that if not recycled will be transferred to a hazardous
       waste or special industrial waste landfill (See chapter 5).
       1.1.2.4. MAJCOMs realigned funds for overhead management of the Programs Flight
       Chief, the Operations Flight Chief, and their direct administrative support within the civil
       engineer squadrons from facilities sustainment PEs (PE XXX78F) to the FO PE series
       (PE XXX79F). For the Programs and Operations Flights, the supervisors for the
       "Sustainment" shops/zones/work centers are included in the Facility Sustainment Model
       (FSM) cost factors and did not move to FO. Programs and Operations Flight Chiefs,
       their Deputies and their direct administrative support are considered "overhead
       management" not related to sustainment, and, therefore, funded out of FO (See chapter
       10).
       1.1.2.5. MAJCOMs realigned funds for the base comprehensive planning and base
       facility project programming positions within the Civil Engineer Squadron Programs
       Flight from facilities sustainment PEs (PE XXX78F) to the FO PE series (PE XXX79F).
       The intent is not to split work centers. Therefore, those personnel responsible for base
       comprehensive planning and facility project programming are assigned to Responsibility
       Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) XX4420, Programs Flight. Design and construction
       management type inspection functions being performed in-house (to include reviewing
       Architectural and Engineering designs, developing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite
       Quantity Statements of Work for example) are covered in the Sustainment Cost Factors
       of FSM. These functions within the Programs Flight will remain in sustainment and are
       assigned to RC/CC XX4421, Project Management. However, the base developers and
AFI32-10140 19 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    7


       programmers are not covered in the Sustainment Cost Factors; their role is more of a
       general service and is included in FO (See chapter 10).
       1.1.2.6. MAJCOMs realigned real property lease funds from the Installation Services
       PEs (formerly Base Operating Support (BOS) PEs) to the FO PE series (PE XXX79F).
       See chapter 6 for inclusions and exclusions.
   1.1.3. Facilities Operation Model (FOM): The FOM is a requirements projection tool
   developed by OSD and the Services. FOM works in a similar fashion as the Facility
   Sustainment Model (FSM) in that it uses the real property inventory (RPI), commercial cost
   data, area cost factors, and climate/geographic data to project the total FO requirement at a
   macro level.
       1.1.3.1. The following chapters are not exclusively limited to Appn 3400 Operation and
       Maintenance (O&M). In the same fashion that funding at any given base may come from
       several appropriations, FOM computes a FO requirement for all fund streams. Each FO
       function may have multiple fund sources (e.g., Military Family Housing, Transportation
       Working Capital Fund, Defense Health Program, Active O&M, Air National Guard
       (ANG) O&M, or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) O&M components). The
       appropriation code associated with any ―A‖ or ―D‖ record in the RPI is the guiding field
       that will initially determine the appropriation. Specific business rules in FOM may
       further modify the designated Appropriation.
       1.1.3.2. The purpose of FOM is to better align the Defense Budget with projected
       requirements, strengthen the justification for resources to operate facilities and to
       standardize the requirements generation process across the DOD. Therefore the primary
       use for FOM is in developing the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) at
       Headquarters Air Force (HAF). FOM is a macro-level model and it is not intended to be
       used to determine the specific requirements of any one installation or any particular FO
       function.
       1.1.3.3. Base level activity managers in the executing flight, working with resource
       advisors, must capture and execute requirements in the appropriate PE and function to
       ensure obligations are accurately captured and correlate properly to the FO accounting
       structure. This is essential for evaluating the accuracy of the model and comparing AF
       obligations against programmatic goals.
   1.1.4. Common Levels of Service. Common Levels of Service may be established by HAF
   to manage service contract costs while minimizing impacts to installations. MAJCOMs are
   responsible for planning, programming, and budgeting appropriate funds to ensure a
   standardized approach providing consistent levels of service without exceeding HAF-
   established standards.

        be any XXX79F or XX969F coded positions at the HQ level.
3.4. Special Considerations.
     3.4.1. Reimbursable Customers: Per DODI 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental
     Support, utilities are customarily reimbursable, unless specific Memoranda of Agreement
     (MOAs), Interservice Support Agreement (ISSA), Joint Basing Agreement, etc. mandate
     otherwise. Utility rates are calculated annually. AFI 32-1061, Providing Utilities to US Air
     Force Installations, provides particular instructions on the calculation of utility rates for
     reimbursable customers to account for the cost of the commodity, line loss, system operation
     and maintenance, other utility costs, capital charges, and administrative overhead.
     Reimbursements shall be accounted for in RC/CC XX440E, Reimbursements - Utilities, in
     the EEIC in which they were expensed. Reference AFI 65-106 and AFI 34-211(I), Army and
     Air Force Exchange Service General Policies, for definitive guidance on reimbursable
     customers. Reimbursable customers fall into the following categories:
        3.4.1.1. DOD organizations/activities:
            3.4.1.1.1. Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) / Nonappropriated Funds (NAF)
            Functions. The MWR and NAF Category C Functions (excluding Golf Courses) rate
            includes the commodity cost only. Utilities are provided without reimbursement at
            overseas and remote and isolated locations. Golf Courses and support facilities are
            charged the same rate as DOD agencies. Based on availability of resources,
            commanders may elect to use APFs to pay utility charges for qualifying CONUS
            Category C NAF activities. Reference AFI 34-211(I) and AFI 65-106 for specific
            guidance on MWR and NAF Category C functions.
            3.4.1.1.2. Medical Support Facilities Account.
            3.4.1.1.3. Government Owned MFH.

     FUNCTION 4 - INTEGRATED SOLID WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL

5.1. Guidance for FO Integrated Solid Waste Collection and Disposal Requirements
Funding Inclusions and Exclusions, including day-to-day composting and non-hazardous
waste recycling operations.
     5.1.1. FO Integrated Solid Waste Collection and Disposal Funded Activities: (1) Non-
     housing and housing, and (2) Solid Waste Diversion/Recycling operations and
     administration. The non-housing and housing requirement includes disposal operations, trash
     collection, recycling fees, and disposal fees. In the recycling operations requirement,
     curbside pickup services and composting are included.
        5.1.1.1. Asset management and civil engineering operations must collaborate and
        coordinate efforts to ensure consistent policy, guidance, and implementation of Integrated
        Solid Waste Collection and Disposal activities. Solid waste disposal data originates from
        FO-funded activities, but is submitted through environmental channels, thus necessitating
        a combined validation effort. Funding for day to day management and operation of
        composting and non-hazardous waste recycling operations, and compliance with and
        implementation of related permit requirement resides in the FO program element code.
        However, asset management is generally responsible for overall solid waste recycling
        policy, program oversight and permits (applications, renewals, oversight, reporting), and
        the development of compliance guidance.
     5.1.2. Funded FO requirements for Integrated Solid Waste Collection and Disposal and non-
     hazardous waste recycling: Accounts for all costs associated with Integrated Solid Waste
     collection and disposal, including day-to-day (recurring) operational costs for non-hazardous
     waste recycling and composting (composting operations and equipment, collections, and
     distribution). This includes manpower authorizations, peculiar and support equipment,
     facilities, contracts, and associated costs to plan, manage, and execute those functions,
     tipping fees, and landfill fees/charges. Integrated Solid Waste collection and disposal cost
     will be captured in RC/CC XX4446 and program element XXX79F.
     5.1.3. Excluded from FO Integrated Solid Waste Collection and Disposal: Integrated Solid
     Waste Collection and Disposal does not include disposal/recycling of hazardous materials. It
     excludes classified, hazardous, biological, toxic, corrosive, reactive, flammable, radioactive
     wastes, and construction and demolition debris resulting from construction contracts.       In
     accordance with AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting, start-up costs required by law or
     regulation for the recycling and composting programs will be programmed in PE XXX54F.
     5.1.4. Recycling Proceeds. Eligible reimbursements include any appropriated funds (such as
     Pollution Prevention (P2) funds) expended in support of recycling operations.
     Reimbursements must first be used to cover program expenses. Recycling proceeds shall be
     processed through the installation qualified recycling program (QRP) in a revenue source
     suspense account, 57F3875.8900, (Proceeds from the Sale of Recyclable Materials, Resource
     Recovery and Recycling). Per Title 10 United States Code Section 2577, ―Proceeds from the
     sale of recyclable materials at an installation shall be credited to funds available for
     operations and maintenance at that installation in amounts sufficient to cover the costs of
AFI32-10140 19 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    23


   operations, maintenance, and overhead for processing recyclable materials at the installation
   (including the cost of any equipment purchased for recycling purposes).‖ For service
   contracts, this will be a reimbursement to the FO account XXXX79F.
5.2. Cost Accounting. Integrated Solid Waste Collection and Disposal, composting, and non-
hazardous waste recycling are captured in RC/CC XX4446, where costs are captured in the
respective FO PE, XXX79F, and the related Functional Account Code (FAC) is 44OE.
5.3. Manpower.
   5.3.1. Base-Level:
      5.3.1.1. Military: Do not allocate permanent military positions to perform duties
      predominantly related to quality assurance of solid waste contracts.

     the tenant requires a special level of effort or contractors supporting the tenant occupied
     facilities, the tenant must pay the costs of the service. However, for off base jointly occupied
     leased real property, the host will be responsible for covering the costs to provide the service
     (AFI 65-601V1, Budgeting Guidance and Procedures). Reference AFI 65-106 and AFI 34-
     211(I) for definitive guidance on reimbursable customers. Examples of reimbursable

            (AAFES) will normally provide reimbursement for the service provided (AFI 65-
            106).
            9.4.1.1.2. Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR)/Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF).
            Custodial is considered a direct cost and may be provided to MWR Category ―C‖
            activities on a reimbursable basis. However, if the service is provided to a Category
            C ―Remote and Isolated‖ installation, then the service may be provided on a Category
            B status, that is 50% of APF support may be provided (AFI 65-106).
