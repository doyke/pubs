A34.2.1.6. (Added) Basic Check Verification of Record (BCVR). The BCVR is an
employer/organizational check to ensure the identity of the individual is confirmed. The BCVR
will list the individual’s information at the top and provide documentation for which the
employer/organization verified identity, i.e. passport, drivers license, etc. The BCVR will also
have a professional reference (reference A34.15) listed for a one year time frame or two
references to encompass the one year time frame.
A34.2.1.7. (Added) All documentation (AF Form 2583, BCVR, USAFE Form 19, Residency
Check for Employment for US Air Forces in Europe, as prescribed by AFI 31-501 USAFE
Supplement and the USAFE Form 79, Request for Base Entry Identification, prescribed by AFI
31-501 USAFE Supplement will be maintained in an employee file at the employing or
contracting organization for review by SFS. Employees transferring from one organization to
another will have the above forms re-accomplished and presented to SFS for a LFC prior to the
individual receiving a new USAFE Form 77, Base Entry Identification, and/or USAFE
Installation Pass (IP) as prescribed by AFI 31-501 USAFE Supplement. If the individual has a
current USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP, they need to have it turned into SFS prior to another
USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP being issued.
A34.2.1.8. (Added) Previous employed MOD personnel will have the clearance transferred by
DVA. The clearance once transferred will be valid for only five years versus the ten years when
they were an MOD employee. If the clearance is still considered valid by DVA, the individual
can be issued a USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP. If the clearance is not considered valid once
transferred, because it was downgraded to a five year clearance versus a ten year clearance, a
USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP will not be issued until a current DVA clearance is obtained.
A34.2.1.9. (Added) Once the documentation is presented to the 48 SFS HAC Office (48
SFS/S5PR) and the LFC, DCII and FBI check is conducted and favorable, along with a quality
check of the NSV001, Security Questionnaire or NSV002, Security Questionnaire (DV) as
prescribed by AFI 31-501 USAFE Supplement, the individual may be escorted on the installation
to begin employment. If the MODLO Proforma, Request for DVA Clearance, NSV001, Security
Questionnaire or NSV002, Security Questionnaire (DV) is returned from SFS, MODLO or DVA
for errors, the employing or contracting agency will have the individual correct all mistakes and
have the form re-submitted. If not completed within two weeks from the date notified, the
individual will be treated as if they have not submitted paperwork and will not be allowed to be
escorted for work purposes pending the re-submittal of the corrected form.
A34.3.2.1. (Added) The USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP will not be issued for longer than
1 year at a time.
A34.4.2.1. (Added) Multiple Base Access for Non-US employees and Contractors. Where
positions exist that require an employee to have access to multiple US occupied installations,
those installations must jointly determine position sensitivity. Once position sensitivity has been
determined, a USAFE Form 79 with a request letter will be presented to the HAC Office, who
will ensure valid justification exists for the request. The request letter must come from the chief
HR person or CC in that organization. Once justification has been verified, a LFC will be
conducted and annotated.

A34.4.2.2. (Added) RAF Mildenhall Access Letter. As RAF Mildenhall is in close proximity,
arrangements have been made to allow employees and contractors that work at both installations
access to RAF Mildenhall. A request letter, from the organization’s Chief HR person or CC,
providing full justification for the requested access needs to accompany the USAFE Form 79.
A34.7.1. (Added) Defence Estates and RAF Station Warden. Defence Estates and the RAF
Station Warden are required to provide the following completed documentation to 48 SFS/S5PR
Office: AF Form 2583 and signed verification letter including the following: DVA clearance
type, certificate/reference number, issue date, expiration date, the individual’s full name and date
of birth. 48 SFS/S5PR will conduct a LFC, DCII and FBI check and annotate the AF Form 2583
accordingly; the medical section will be marked not applicable. Once the individual comes in
with the USAFE Form 79 and identification, the individual will be issued a USAFE Form 77
and/or USAFE IP. No temporary USAFE Forms 77 and/or USAFE IPs will be issued without
having a current DVA Clearance.
A34.7.2. (Added) MOD Personnel. MOD personnel will have a USAFE Form 79 and the
signed verification letter presented to the HAC Office for issuance of a USAFE Form 77 and/or
USAFE IP when the individual needs an AF Form 1199C, Restricted Area Badge, as prescribed
in AFI 31-101 USAFE Supplement, The Air Force Installation Security Program.
A34.10.1.1.1. (Added) Employment suitability determination authority, if derogatory
information is identified on the LFC, DCII or FBI check, is delegated no lower than the 48
MSG/CD.
A34.12.2.1. (Added) MODLO Billing Procedures. Monthly, MODLO will forward a billing
invoice of completed background checks to the 48 SFS/S5PR. SF will validate the invoice is
accurate and will complete a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, as
prescribed by Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement Appendix F, Material
Inspection and Receiving Report, to be forwarded to the 48 CPTS for payment. Electronic Funds
Transfer needs to be setup and payment to MODLO needs to be monitored to ensure prompt and
timely payment for completed clearances.
A34.13.2.6.1. (Added) The USAFE Form 79 must contain all original signatures from the
organization. Pass approving officials must have a letter on file at Pass and Registration signed
by the 48 MSG CC/CD delegating them as a Pass Approving Official. The USAFE Form 79,
once signed by the Pass Approving Official, is only valid for 30 calendar days; otherwise a new
request must be generated. Sufficient identification must be provided at the time of issuance of
the USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP. It is incumbent upon the HAC Office personnel to
ensure 100 percent confirmation the individual is who they present themselves to be. This can
be done via the following: passport, driver’s license with photo or other acceptable means
necessary to provide ample evidence of identity. The USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP will
not be issued for more than the contract period or a maximum of one year. The USAFE Form 79
will be annotated in Section VI, Block #2, with the expiration date of the pass as indicated by the
Pass Approving Official. The block will indicate either the contract expiration date or a one year
time frame from the date signed by the Pass Approving Official. It is incumbent on the Pass
Approving Official to ensure all information contained on the USAFE Form 79 is complete and
accurate as the HAC Office will not make corrections. The USAFE Form 79 needs to be either
typed or printed and if pen and ink changes need to be made, initials must accompany the
corrections made by a Pass Approving Official.

paragraph A34.4.2.1.

Defence Estates, Station Warden and MOD civilians to determine if residence within the US
exists for 12 or more consecutive months since the age of 18.
A34.13.2.11. (Added) HAC Appointment Letters. HAC Appointment Letters will be
maintained on file at the HAC Office for all organizations that deal with the employment or
contracting of local nationals and third country nationals. The purpose behind the Appointment
Letter is to ensure smooth transmittal of information from one organization to another, and to
ensure the strictest confidence of personal information. If someone is not listed on the current
appointment letter, information will not be released to that individual. Appointment Letters are
valid for a one year time frame. When changes or corrections are needed, another letter will be
accomplished superseding the previous one on file.
A34.13.4.9.1. (Added) For those nominated as escort officials, a Memorandum for Record
must be generated by the organization stating the full justification of the request. Once issued on
the USAFE Form 77 and/or USAFE IP, the individual will read the 48 FW Memorandum for all
sponsors from the 48 FW/CC. Those that have been identified as violating the wing’s escort
policy will immediately have their escort privileges revoked.
