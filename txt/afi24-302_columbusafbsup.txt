       production lines and designed for use by the general public.
       1.1.1.4. Reportable Vehicle. Reportable vehicles include passenger carrying, cargo and
       utility, special purpose, low speed vehicle (LSV), fire fighting, aircraft refueling, material
       handling equipment (MHE) and base maintenance vehicles/equipment of commercial or
       military design. Vehicular type equipment that meets any of the following general
       descriptions is included in this definition.
          1.1.1.4.1. Designed or used for military field training, combat or tactical purposes.
          1.1.1.4.2. Used principally within the confines of an established AF installation,
          target range or depot.
          1.1.1.4.3. Used by an agency in the performance of investigative, law enforcement or
          intelligence duties if the head of such agency determines that exclusive control of
          such vehicle is essential to the effective performance of such duties.
   1.1.2. Congressional and Executive Order (EO) vehicle reportable categories and definitions
   for energy reporting.
Note: The General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Energy (DOE) and the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have the right to change the types of vehicles that are
reported each year based on Congressional and Executive office of the President requirements.
       1.1.2.1. Vehicle categories required for Congressional and EO reporting purposes (i.e.,
       Annual Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST), OMB Circular No. A-11,
       Preparation, Submission, and, Execution of the Budget (current edition), reports and
       Standard Form (SF) 82, Annual Agency Report of Motor Vehicle Data. The following
       vehicle categories can be commercially/GSA rental/leased or Agency Owned:

           1.1.2.2.3. Non-Tactical Armored Vehicles: OMB requires each agency to report
           their commercially designed armored vehicles and the armor classification. Armor
           levels classifications are as defined in National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Standard
           0108.01, Ballistic Resistant Protective Materials, September 1985.
       1.1.2.3. Vehicles not reported in FAST: Vehicles that do not fall under the data
       requirements of Public Law 102-486, Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 1992), October

           mowers, MHE, forklifts, aircraft servicing/refueling, snow removal vehicles (plows),
           non-LSEV, etc).
Note: Non-LSEVs are vehicles that meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for Low
Speed Vehicles, but are not powered solely by electrical power, and are not licensable for use on
federal highways.
 20                                  AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


            1.1.2.3.3. Any other class or type of vehicles the OMB determines to be exempt from
            reporting requirements.
    1.1.3. Trailers. Trailers that are centrally procured by WR-ALC (to include military design
    (tactical) trailers) will be classified and managed as a registered vehicle IAW with this AFI.
    Any trailers meeting all elements of following criterion will also be classified and managed
    as a registered vehicle IAW AF standards. WR-ALC is the only authorized purchasing agent
    for AF registered vehicles (refer to paragraph 3.10.6).
        1.1.3.1. Measuring 6’x12’ (width x length) or larger.
        1.1.3.2. Has Department of Transportation (DOT) approved lighting.
        1.1.3.3. Has at least two axles.
        1.1.3.4. Has towing vehicle braking system or surge brakes that actuate each wheel.
        1.1.3.5. Has a GVWR of over 6999 lbs.
Notes:
1. Vehicle Management is only responsible for the management and maintenance of the
“registered” trailer itself. All equipment on the trailer that has a specific organizational use will
be maintained by the using organization.
2. When the trailer is manufactured around a specific item that is “permanently attached”
(meaning mounted items won’t be removed to configure trailer for transportation of other items)
as an integral piece of a trailer, and the sole purpose of the trailer is for transporting that item, the
trailer is automatically classified an equipment item and is not a vehicle by AF definition.
Exception: Trailers classified as Construction, Mining, Excavating and Highway Maintenance
Equipment in Federal Stock Class Group 3800 (Examples e.g. concrete mixer, mounted vacuum
cleaner, water distribution tanker, dump trailer, pneumatic drill, sewer trailers) will be classified
as a vehicle.
3. Refer to paragraph 3.17.2. for policy concerning trailers not classified as a “vehicle”.
    1.1.4. Controlled vehicles. Aircraft and ground support equipment tow tractors, major
    crash fire rescue vehicles, MHE, aircraft refuelers, compressed gas servicing equipment,
    special aircraft and missile cranes, personnel lifting mechanisms on high reach trucks or
    cranes, M-series tactical vehicles, support equipment and munitions MHE. Additional
    guidance is provided in AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program,
    for nuclear certified assets.
    1.1.5. AF Executive Fleet.       Authorizations/vehicles assigned to Wing Commanders and
    above.
1.2. Supplements. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs may supplement this instruction to
provide detailed instructions to meet MAJCOM specific needs. MAJCOMS must have
AF/A4LE approval prior to publication. MAJCOMs must route all supplements through
VEMSO for review and forwarding to AF/A4LE for decision.
1.3. Changes to this Instruction. Send recommendations to improve this instruction through
the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff to VEMSO for review and forwarding to AF/ A4LE
for consideration.

1.5. Use of Related Publications. See Attachment 1 for a list of referenced publications.
Management controls, records administration and forms documentation are described in many of
these publications.

Section 1B—AF Vehicle Serviceability Standards and Types of Maintenance Used to Support
Standard.

1.6. Serviceability Standards. Minimum serviceability standards for day-to-day operations are
determined by the VFM/VMS based on his or her experience, manufacturers’ specifications and
applicable technical reference. Ensure AF vehicles are maintained in safe and serviceable
condition.
   1.6.1. The AF accepts the idea that as vehicles age a certain amount of wear and tear will
   occur and that AF vehicles will not be maintained in a like-new condition. Example: The
   condition of a vehicle in its 6th year of use is not comparable with the condition of a new
   vehicle. To be serviceable, a vehicle must first be safe and function as designed.
   Deficiencies affecting safety are not acceptable regardless of whether the vehicle is old or
   new.
   1.6.2. Judge serviceability using the following factors:
       1.6.2.1. Age and mileage of the vehicle.
       1.6.2.2. Requirement for the type of vehicle and job it is designed to do.
       1.6.2.3. Remaining service life.
       1.6.2.4. Value of use returned in comparison with the cost of needed repairs.
   1.6.3. Vehicles and vehicular equipment items identified on the USAF Master Nuclear
   Certification Listing (MNCL) will be maintained IAW manufacture standards, TO 36-1-191
   and other relevant vehicle maintenance technical orders and manuals. “Serviceability
   Standards” are the same for all USAF registered vehicles regardless of “nuclear certified”
   status. Special or more stringent standards for “nuclear certified” registered vehicles and
   vehicular equipment do not exist.
1.7. Organizational Maintenance. Organizational maintenance is accomplished by unit-level
vehicle operators in the various squadrons and activities across an installation. Operators use the
vehicle’s applicable Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, applicable TOs or
Owner’s manual when accomplishing organizational maintenance. Specific organizational
responsibilities are outlined in paragraph 3.19
1.8. Intermediate Maintenance. Intermediate maintenance is accomplished by the base
Vehicle Management, including major and minor repairs. VFM/VMS determine shop capability
and decide which source of repair to use. Manpower, total cost, mission requirements, Non-
Mission Capable (NMC) time, shop tools, equipment and technical capability influence the
decision-making. Normally done in fixed shops, intermediate maintenance includes:
 24                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   1.8.1. Preventive Maintenance and Inspections (PM&I) and Special Inspections.
   1.8.2. Repairing, fabricating or replacing unserviceable components.
   1.8.3. Refinishing, modifying (as directed by TO), repairing accessories and auxiliary
   equipment and doing structural repair.
   1.8.4. Furnishing technical assistance to using organizations.
   1.8.5. When repair exceeds the base capability, maintenance may be performed:
       1.8.5.1. By a local off-base contract.
       1.8.5.2. At a nearby AF base. Comply with AFI 25-201, Support Agreements, if
       personnel adjustments are needed.
       1.8.5.3. Under Inter-Service Support Agreement (ISSA) at nearby military or other
       government shops. Affected commanders or equivalents concur on cost and vehicle
       disposition issues.
1.9. Depot-Level Maintenance. This level of maintenance provides technical aid (see TO 00-
25-4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles and Training Equipment) and overhaul of
specific vehicles (refer to TO 36-1-191). Warner-Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC)
manages depot-level maintenance for AF needs.
1.10. Mobile Maintenance. The nature of certain vehicle repairs requires maintenance support
away from Vehicle Management. The vehicle repair technician will debrief the supervisor in
charge or the vehicle operator concerning vehicle deficiencies. Review the Operator’s
Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for annotated maintenance problems.
   1.10.1. Mobile Maintenance can be used to perform PM&I and Special Inspections on
   vehicles not easily brought to or unable to enter the maintenance shop due to size. Advance
   coordination is essential for proper planning and scheduling. Accomplish a complete
   inspection of the vehicle or equipment item at the time of the PM&I and Special Inspections.
   1.10.2. The Mobile Maintenance truck may be equipped with a tow attachment, a battery
   booster and power plant, per Allowance Standard (AS) 457. The truck may carry tools (AS
   403 and 457) and spare parts so that full PM&I and routine unscheduled work can be done.
   This truck may be two-way radio and/or cell phone equipped.
   1.10.3. The VFM/VMS have the option to expand Mobile Maintenance to include
   performing minor maintenance at selected units. It may be desirable to send a mobile
   maintenance truck to large organizations (Civil Engineer Squadron (CES), Security Forces
   Squadron (SFS), Aircraft Maintenance, etc.) on a scheduled frequency to perform minor
   repairs.
   1.10.4. The VFM/VMS determines, and then justifies, the number of Mobile Maintenance
   trucks necessary to be assigned.
   1.10.5. If the required repairs are beyond Mobile Maintenance capabilities, request wrecker
   assistance from Vehicle Operations. During other than normal operating hours, Vehicle
   Operations will deliver the disabled vehicle to the Vehicle Management parking area. The
   Operators’ Inspection Guide and Trouble Report will reflect the vehicle’s problem and must
   accompany the vehicle. During the next duty day, someone from the using organization must
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      25


   formally turn the vehicle in to Vehicle Management. Note: NMC begins when the disabled
   vehicle is reported to Vehicle Management so if repairs cannot be completed in 2 hours or
   less open a work order to capture all NMC hours.
1.11. Scheduled Maintenance. Scheduled maintenance includes PM&I                      and   Special
Inspections, at regular intervals to maintain a safe and serviceable vehicle fleet.
   1.11.1. The 18-Month PM&I will be conducted using the AF Form 4354, Vehicle Preventive
   Maintenance and Inspection (PM&I), in conjunction with applicable manufacturer
   maintenance requirements.
   1.11.2. Technicians must use AF Form 4355, Vehicle Incoming Inspection, to verify a
   vehicle’s condition when initiating an AF Form 1823, Vehicle and Equipment Work Order,
   or AF Form 1823-1 (computer generated) Vehicle and Equipment Work Order, and accepting
   a vehicle in to maintenance. The use of AF Form 4355 will satisfy the AF obligation to
   inspect a vehicle’s ability to operate safely at least once within a 12-month period, IAW
   DOD 4500.36-R. TO 36-1-191 prescribes scheduled maintenance intervals and is used to
   establish a scheduled maintenance plan.
Notes:
1. The completion of an AF Form 4355 is not required for “Tire-Only Work Orders” or
“Follow-On” warranty/contract work orders.
2. AF Form 1823 is used only in the event that the On-Line Vehicle Integrated Management
System (OLVIMS) is not available. AF Form 1823-1 is an OLVIMS computer generated Vehicle
and Equipment Work Order and is the preferred form for documenting vehicle maintenance
associated data/information. However, specific use and documentation requirements listed in this
AFI are identical. For this reason, the term “AF Form 1823/-1” is used in this AFI to signify that
the context of information is applicable to either form.
   1.11.3. Using organizations will make vehicles available for PM&I and Special Inspections
   or arrange for a rescheduled time before the due date. Using organizations that exhibit a
   trend of failing to provide vehicles for scheduled maintenance at the scheduled time will be
   reported to the next command level (i.e., Mission Support Group Commander, Wing
   Commander, etc.) for corrective action.
   1.11.4. Do not delay PM&I, Special Inspections or any special scheduled maintenance
   actions.
   1.11.5. Consider seasonal needs, labor-hour availability, organizational need and fair
   apportionment of the 18-month requirement when developing a scheduled maintenance plan.
   All shops will use On-Line Vehicle Integrated Management System (OLVIMS) products or
   other automated listings to help complete work on time. Scheduled maintenance has priority
   and is not delayed. When necessary, resort to a two-shift operation, overtime or contract to
   fulfill this need.
   1.11.6. Vehicles used as static training aids (not operated on-base or public highways or for
   driver training) are exempt from scheduled maintenance, FMVRS registration and license
   plate requirements. In addition, vehicles such as mobile communication vans positioned in a
   semi-permanent or permanent site are exempt from scheduled maintenance. Ensure vehicle
   is safe to operate before operating over public roads.

       1.11.6.1. Ensure training aids are on equipment account list.
1.12. Transient Vehicle and Equipment Maintenance. Provide maintenance priority to
transient vehicles according to their mission or circumstance.
Note: The procedures for vehicle operators to have maintenance done on vehicles in-transit are
in AFMAN 24-306_IP, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operator.
1.13. Vehicle Abuse and Accidents Maintenance. Vehicle abuse is considered damage caused
by willful or negligent acts of improper operation or care. Vehicle accident is basically a result
of a collision. The Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) Commander or equivalent establishes
local reporting procedures and these procedures must be fully supported by all commanders to be
totally effective. Using organizations fund for costs associated with government owned,
rental/lease vehicle abuse and/or accident damage.
Note: Publish these implementing instructions at wing–level or equivalents.
   1.13.1. All Vehicle Management operation & maintenance (O&M) funds expended for
   vehicle accident and abuse repair costs, including contract cost, will be reimbursed to
   Vehicle Management by the owning organization or the organization responsible for the
   damage if not the owner.
   1.13.2. Where responsibility cannot be determined, the owning organization will be
   responsible for reimbursement. An Investigating Officer investigates accident/abuse
   incidences and completes Report of Survey (ROS) IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey
   for Air Force Property (being replaced with AFI 23-101, Material Management) when there
   is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use pertaining
   to the loss, damage, or destruction of a government vehicle or when the vehicle property
   records must be adjusted (i.e. the vehicle is a total loss). Vehicle Management notifies the
   applicable commander or equivalent and Vehicle Control Officer (VCO) or Vehicle Control
   Noncommissioned Control Officer (VCNCO) of the unit involved, along with Base Legal,
   Finance and Safety Office (usually by form letter) as applicable.
   1.13.3. In the event of a government owned vehicle accident, include a copy of the accident
   report for Base Safety Office use. Vehicle Management commences repair within a locally
   established time frame unless notified otherwise by the using organization or ROS
   investigating official.
Note: If a government owned vehicle caused a fatality or was involved in a fatality or an
accident with private property the Base Legal Office must release the vehicle before repairs
commence.
   1.13.4. Incidents are classified as damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters,
   mechanical failures or other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided by safe
   operation or adequate vehicle care during non-use. The VFM/VMS is the fleet management
   functional expert with the authority to determine what is/is not classified as an incident.
   Using organizations are not required to reimburse for damage caused by incidents.
Note: Wind damage to vehicle doors is not an act of nature.
1.13. (COLUMBUSAFB) Organizational Commanders must take an active part to ensure
their organizations take an active role in accident/abuse awareness and ensure their unit
funds are used to fund all accident/abuse damage caused by assigned personnel.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     27


   1.13.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Examples of Vehicle Abuse (not inclusive):
       1.13.5.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Failure to perform operator maintenance IAW
       AFI 24-302.
       1.13.5.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Failure to report vehicle discrepancies to vehicle
       management that result in further damage to the GOV. Discrepancies involving safety
       items must be reported immediately.
Non-safety related items should be reported within 24 hours (one duty day).
       1.13.5.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Failure to protect the painted surface from
       oxidization and corrosion.

       1.13.5.9. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Operating vehicles using improperly selected
       gears, such as lugging in high gear and shifting into reverse when traveling forward.
       1.13.5.10. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Using vehicle for other than its designed
       purpose.
   1.13.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Accident and abuse procedures:
       1.13.6.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Using organizations will report vehicle accidents
       to vehicle management as soon as possible and no later than the first duty day after the
       accident. Damaged vehicles will not be driven with accident damage unless it is safe to
       do so and taken directly to the vehicle management compound. Vehicles not capable of
       being moved will be towed by vehicle operations.
       1.13.6.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Vehicle management will initiate a work order to
       repair the damage. Actual repairs will not be initiated for three duty days to allow the
       organization responsible for the damage time to investigate the cause of the accident or
       abuse. A letter identifying the details of the accident or abuse damage will be sent to the
       responsible organization’s commander, VCO/VCNCO, Report of Survey Manager, and
       the Ground Safety Office as required. The unit may waive the three day waiting period
       by submitting an accident release letter from the unit commander.
       1.13.6.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If the owning unit/organization requires
       additional time to investigate the accident and requires the vehicle for investigative
       purposes, the responsible unit’s commander will request a delay in repairs via a
       letter/email to vehicle management. When the vehicle is not
 28                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


required for the investigation, the responsible unit’s commander will notify vehicle management
in writing/email to start repairs.
       1.13.6.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Vehicle management will ensure photos of the
       damaged areas are taken prior to repair. At the request of the using organization’s
       commander, an AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Repairable Value Statement, will be
       prepared by VM&A depicting actual cost expended to repair the vehicle. The AF Form
       20 will be required if liability is assessed in the Report of Survey process.
       1.13.6.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The using organization is responsible for any
       additional photographs or accident reports required for their own investigation.
       1.13.6.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When payment for the damage, either voluntary
       or through the use of DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss,
       is involved, the actual cost of repairs is computed using an AF Form 20 in accordance
       with AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property.
   1.13.6.7. (COLUMBUSAFB) (Added) The organization responsible for the damage is
   accountable for material costs, civilian labor, and contract costs to repair the accident/abuse
   related damage. The responsible organization’s Government Purchase Card (GPC) is the
   preferred method of payment for repairs costing less than $2,500. Repairs over $2,500 will
   require the responsible organization to accomplish an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase. The
   14 MSG/CC is the final decision authority to resolve all conflicts concerning this process.

Section 1D—Items of Interest

1.17. Watercraft.
   1.17.1. AF watercraft (boats or vessels) are requisitioned as organizational equipment items
   (refer to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Chapter 22, for policy on equipment) used
   to support an AF mission. All watercraft must be loaded in Air Force Equipment
   Management System (AFEMS) and accounted for on the owning organization’s Custodian
   Account & Custodian Request Log (CA/CRL).
   1.17.2. Watercraft less than 22 feet in length are managed purely as organizational
   equipment; maintenance support is an owning organization responsibility.
   1.17.3. Watercraft 22 feet or longer are also managed as organizational equipment with one
   noted exception. During annual vehicle control program assistance visits, vehicle
   management personnel will review the records of watercraft 22 feet or longer to verify PM&I
   as per manufacturer’s specifications have been accomplished. Compliance with or deviation
   from manufacturer’s PM&I specifications will be annotated in the report to the unit
   commander. Maintenance support for watercraft 22 feet or longer is an owning organization
   responsibility.
   1.17.4. Units with watercraft required for special operations/tactics, combat or covert
   operations are also accounted for on the owning organization’s CA/CRL. These assets are
   managed and maintained according to user-community defined procedures. Watercraft
   records are not reviewed during the annual vehicle control program assistance visit for these
   units.
   1.17.5. Watercraft purchased with non-appropriated funds, such as Morale, Welfare and
   Recreation boats, are not governed by this publication and are not maintained by vehicle
   management personnel.
Note: Refer to paragraphs 3.11.12., 3.14.9. and 3.17.6. for additional watercraft responsibilities
and guidance.
1.18. Vehicle Management Compliance and Evaluation Checklists.
   1.18.1. AF/A4LE core Compliance Inspection (CI) and core Nuclear Surety Inspection
   (NSI) checklists are available for use and download from the AF Checklist website:
   https://www.my.af.mil/reservenetprod2/checklistservice/home.aspx.
       1.18.1.1. AF/A4LE core CI and core NSI checklist will be used to facilitate MAJCOM
       and Numbered Air Force (NAF) unit-level inspections, evaluations and unit self-
       inspection programs.
   1.18.2. MAJCOM Vehicle Management activities may supplement AF/A4LE core checklist
   (using MAJCOM supplement references only) as required for MAJCOM specific
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     31


   responsibilities. MAJCOMs will not supplement checklists with any guidance authored
   above the MAJCOM level.
       1.18.2.1. MAJCOMs will coordinate all draft supplemental                 checklists   with
       ANG/A4RDV and AFRC/A4RM prior to VEMSO review.
       1.18.2.2. VEMSO will in-turn submit package to AF/A4LE for review, coordination and
       submittal to HAF Inspection Checklist Workflow Mailbox for publication.
Note: Refer to AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System, and the AF Checklist website for
additional guidance.
   1.18.3. HAF level Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) checklist can be
   found on the LCAP Community of Practice (CoP) webpage. For more information
   concerning the LCAP, refer to AFI 20-111, Air Force Logistics Compliance Assessment
   Program (LCAP); to include AFI 20-111, Attachment 1 for listing of LCAP Lead and
   Component MAJCOM designations.
1.19. Reintegration of Fuels Vehicle and Vehicular Equipment Pumping Systems
Maintenance. In 2004 the AF initiated actions to migrate vehicle and vehicular equipment fuels
pumping systems maintenance responsibilities from the 2T3X2B to the 2F0X1 career field. The
anticipated efficiencies have not been realized. In order to ensure optimum combat and home
station operations, the decision to reintegrate the skill sets into vehicle maintenance/management
was rendered by AF/A4/7 in 2010. The reintegration will be conducted in a time phased/spiral
approach to minimize disruption of day-to-day operations. The anticipated Refueling
Maintenance reengineering completion will be in EOY 2013. Concurrently, the vehicle
management community will assume responsibility for maintenance of Fuels Operational
Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE) and Fuels Support Equipment (FSE).
Note: After reintegration, Vehicle Management will maintain the prime pieces of FORCE/FSE,
however the hoses/kits and assorted support equipment “kits” will remain equipment and the
responsibility of fuels management to maintain.
These assets will be identified in OLVIMS and all maintenance actions to include labor, parts,
accident and contract maintenance costs will be entered into OLVIMS. See Table 4.4.,
FORCE/FSE OLVIMS Code Information for OLVIMS information.
1.20. Minimum Configuration Standards Instructions. The Headquarters Air Force Civil
Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) Working Group, Tyndall AFB, will form working groups
to establish Minimum Configuration Standards for base maintenance, construction and fire
protection vehicles.
   1.20.1. Groups are comprised of personnel representing each MAJCOM.
   1.20.2. Personnel must have background in operating or maintaining base construction
   vehicles
   1.20.3. Following criteria established for Minimum Configuration Standards:

      1.20.4.1. All MAJCOMs must provide AFCESA written concurrences for minimum
      Configuration Standards established by working group.
      1.20.4.2. AFCESA will establish Minimum Configuration Standards as outlined in
      paragraph 1.20.3. and coordinate with MAJCOMs then forward concurrences to 543
      SEVSG IPT.
Note: Only specifications that have been unanimously approved by MAJCOMs will be
forwarded and used for procurement.
   1.20.5. MAJCOMs will:
      1.20.5.1. Furnish ordering data to 542 SEVSG IAW approved Minimum Configuration
      Standards.
      1.20.5.2. When Minimum Configuration Standards are applicable, furnish ordering data
      to SEVSG that only contains NSN, Description, Buy Quantity, Use Code and options.
      1.20.5.3. Coordinate corrections or changes to Minimum Configuration Standards with
      AFCESA. As the Subject Matter Experts for Civil Engineer base maintenance,
      construction and fire protection vehicles, changes to the Minimum Configuration
      Standards will not be made without notification and approval from AFCESA.
   1.20.6. 542 SEVSG IPT.
      1.20.6.1. Engineer/Equipment Specialist will:
          1.20.6.1.1. Maintain file copies of all approved Minimum Configuration Standards.
          1.20.6.1.2. Prepare internal ordering data worksheet to include options excluded such
          as manuals, consignee delivery, military markings, etc.
      1.20.6.2. The Program Manager will ensure approved Minimum Configuration Standards
      are posted on SEVSG website.
   1.20.7. Configuration standard changes and reviews.
      1.20.7.1. Existing configuration standards will be reviewed annually and updated as
      required by AFCESA. The following procedure applies.
          1.20.7.1.1. AFCESA, after coordination with MAJCOMs, will notify VEMSO of any
          updated configuration standards.
          1.20.7.1.2. Once coordinated documents are attained, VEMSO will post updated
          configuration standard on the AF Vehicle Management Neighborhood - CoP (VM
          CoP) and notify WR-ALC.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       33


       1.20.7.2. Upon request by WR-ALC, existing configuration standards will be updated as
       required to de-conflict procuring issues with existing standards. The following procedure
       applies.
           1.20.7.2.1. WR-ALC will notify VEMSO of issues/concerns with standards.
Note: WR-ALC will contact VEMSO and AFCESA to resolve any issues/concerns with the
Minimum Configuration Standards for CE or RED HORSE vehicles.
           1.20.7.2.2. VEMSO will contact AFCESA to discuss/resolve vehicle configuration
           standard issues.
           1.20.7.2.3. Once resolution is attained, VEMSO will coordinate with affected
           MAJCOMs, post updated configuration standard on the VM CoP and notify WR-
           ALC.
1.21. Vehicle Validation Visit (VVV) Process Review. During a program review, AF/A4L
tasked VEMSO to develop a plan that would greatly reduce the travel cost and time expended by
base/MAJCOM personnel to accomplish vehicle reviews. As a result, AF/A4L approved a
VEMSO initiative to modernize how we right size base vehicle fleets. The creation of an
enterprise process that leverages current business intelligence capabilities will be developed and
integrated within Logistics Installation and Mission Support Enterprise View Vehicle View
(LIMS-EV Vehicle View) as a fleet management decision support system (FMDSS). The
FMDSS will contain the required logic to facilitate the validation process by replacing the
current method of face-to-face interviews at over 300 locations every three years. It will
systematically generate a validated “core set” of authorizations and a target list of authorizations
that would be further reviewed for validation using email and/or video-teleconference with the
customer, or in rare instances a site visit by a small contingent of functional experts. Anticipated
FMDSS validation will be completed in CY2012.
1.22. Commercial Internet Service Provider (CISP) for Vehicle Diagnostic Equipment.
   1.22.1. Overview. The AF has more than 50,000 intelligent vehicles which use computer
   based diagnostics equipment. This equipment services on-board vehicle computers and
   performs malfunction diagnostics. Vehicle families have different types of diagnostic
   computers, which must be connected to the manufacture’s web site to download vehicle
   executable files and diagnose maintenance problems. Diagnostic equipment is unique to
   each vehicle with some devices running unique operating systems, which are not Standard
   Desktop Compliant (SDC). All devices download executable files from the vehicle vendor’s
   web site for transfer to on-board vehicle computer systems. Consequently, vehicle diagnostic
   devices cannot connect to the manufacture’s web site from AF networks. The only
   connection solution is through use of a CISP. As a result, the AF Chief Information Officer
   (SAF/CIO A6), in coordination with the Designated Accrediting Authority, has authorized
   the procurement and utilization of CISPs in support of AF vehicle diagnostic
   computers/equipment, provided AF/A4L policy and established Rules of Behavior are
   followed and enforced.
   1.22.2. AF/A4L Policy. A vehicle management CISP connection is solely for connection of
   AF vehicle diagnostic equipment to vehicle manufacture and diagnostic equipment vendor’s
   web sites for the purpose of maintaining AF vehicles and equipment. Computers configured
   with vehicle diagnostic software are authorized to use this connection but no other computer
34                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


  endpoint devices are permitted to connect to the CISP. Connection of unauthorized computer

1.23. Green Procurement.
   1.23.1. Background. IAW Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA), Section 9002 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRI) of 2002, and
   EO 13423, Federal agencies are directed to implement sustainable environmental practices
   for the acquisition of green products and services. As a result, Federal Acquisition
   Regulation (FAR), Subpart 23.4, Use of Recovered Materials and Biobased Products, current
   edition, provides policy and procedure towards the procurement of recycled-content and
   biobased products, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-
   designated recycled-content and Department of Agriculture (USDA)-designated biobased
   products, to include, EPA and USDA-designated antifreeze, refined lubricating oil, sorbents
   and vehicle tires.
   1.23.2. The DOD Green Procurement Program (GPP) was established in 2004 and provides
   an agency-wide strategy for implementing an effective program. The purpose of the DOD
   GPP is to enhance and sustain mission readiness through cost effective acquisition that
 36                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   achieves compliance and reduces resource consumption and waste generation. Green
   procurement practices also play a key role in enhancing transportation efficiency and
   sustainable buildings. The DOD GPP applies to all acquisitions from major systems
   programs to individual unit supply and service requisitions. This strategy does not directly
   address the compliance requirements of any specific component of the Federal Green
   Purchasing Program; rather it defines the management framework all DOD organizations
   will use to ensure compliance with procurement preference requirements as a routine part of
   day-to-day purchasing activities, and the AF/A4LE GPP policy maintains that same strategy.
   1.23.3. An AF/CV Memorandum, Air Force Green Procurement Program, June 2, 2011,
   reaffirmed the requirements of existing executive and legislative mandates, and AF GPP
   policy, and required each functional activity to integrate GPP requirements into their
   respective instructions in order to instill a philosophy of sustainability throughout the AF.
1.24. AF/A4LE Green Procurement Program Policy. AF Vehicle Management activities
within the Contiguous United States (CONUS), Alaska and Hawaii will establish a GPP giving
first preference (preferred procurement) to EPA-designated recycled-content vehicular products
and USDA-designated biobased products and shall purchase designated products/items in the
following categories to the maximum extent practical; meeting performance and safety standards
set forth by vehicle manufactures and technical orders, while being procured in a cost-effective
manner.
   1.24.1. Engine Coolants (EPA).
   1.24.2. Engine Oil, Gear Oil, Hydraulic Fluids and Lubricants (EPA and USDA).
   1.24.3. Sorbent Products (USDA).
   1.24.4. Tires (EPA).
Notes:
1. Vehicle Management activities outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS) (except in
Alaska and Hawaii) are not required to have a formal GPP program.
2. EPA Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG) items apply almost exclusively to
CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii installations. However, Vehicle Management activities OCONUS
(except Alaska and Hawaii) are highly encouraged, but not required, to buy recycled-content
products locally whenever these products meet technical needs, are readily available and are cost
effective. The key requirement for OCONUS activities is to be aware that all purchases made in
the U.S. for shipment to an overseas installation must comply with EPA CPG requirements,
unless exception exist.
1.25. General Exceptions. Vehicle Management activities will not purchase EPA-designated
recycled-content or USDA-designated biobased products if any of the following conditions
apply.
   1.25.1. Item cannot be purchased within a reasonable timeframe and mission impairment is
   imminent.
   1.25.2. Item does not meet performance standard or manufactures requirements. This
   exception includes specific restrictions listed in TO 36-1-191 (e.g., retreaded, recapped or
   regrooved tire use/application restrictions), or specific product requirements/restrictions
   listed by manufactures (e.g., the exclusive use of specialized coolants or motor oils).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 37


Note: Refer to paragraph 5.42. for general tire procurement policies and procedures.
   1.25.3. Item is not available at a price equal to/or less than the comparable non-EPA or
   USDA-designated product cost.
   1.25.4. USDA-designated biobased items (i.e., hydraulic fluids and penetrating fluids) will
   not received preferred procurement for either of the following:
       1.25.4.1. In support of spacecraft/launch support equipment.
       1.25.4.2. In support of military-series or tactical vehicles designed or procured for
       combat or combat-related missions.
1.26. Program Responsibilities.
   1.26.1. AF/A4LE.
       1.26.1.1. Provide policy and guidance on implementing the GPP.
       1.26.1.2. Establish procurement data requirements and procedures to collect data that
       meet reporting requirements.
       1.26.1.3. Utilize and analyze procurement data for the purpose of management
       evaluation of GPP performance.
       1.26.1.4. Incorporate GPP requirements into AF compliance inspection checklist.
   1.26.2. MAJCOM.
       1.26.2.1. Provide GPP oversight by validating program management requirements
       though MAJCOM Staff Assistance Visits and compliance inspections.
       1.26.2.2. Recommend changes in policies or procedures to AF/A4LE to improve the
       GPP when necessary.
       1.26.2.3. Providing oversight of contracted vehicle management activity contracts to
       ensure green procurement requirements are addressed in accordance with the terms of the
       contract.
   1.26.3. LRS Commander or Equivalent.
       1.26.3.1. Supporting the Vehicle Management GPP policy and plan.
       1.26.3.2. Ensuring that required Vehicle Management personnel are trained in green
       procurement and such training is tracked and managed as necessary to ensure all
       personnel involved in the procurement process are knowledgeable and competent to
       comply with green procurement requirements relevant to their procurement/purchasing
       action(s).
       1.26.3.3. Conduct routine self-assessments of the effectiveness of GPP awareness
       training, the completeness and integrity of GPP performance data and the overall GPP.
   1.26.4. Vehicle Management.
       1.26.4.1. Vehicle Management activities will identify opportunities to procure green
       products and services in the normal course of business, maintain a list of such
       opportunities, and update the list regularly to reflect changes in the mission and
       availability of green products and services relevant to the mission. The list of green
 38                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       procurement opportunities should be developed and maintained at a level within the
       activity where initial purchasing requirements are defined.
       1.26.4.2. Establish procedures to collect GPP data to support administrative
       requirements.
       1.26.4.3. Recommend changes in policies or procedures to MAJCOM to improve the
       GPP when necessary.
       1.26.4.4. Review and update GPP every three years or sooner if regulations or
       requirements change, new products are designated or operational changes affect
       procurement.
       1.26.4.5. When warranted, apply life cycle cost concepts to determine cost effectiveness
       of green alternatives for use in procurement decisions. For example: a review recapped
       tire longevity and cost data was compare to new tire longevity and cost data. The
       comparison revealed that the average recapped tire only had 50 percent of the service life
       of the average new tire and cost 40 percent less than the new tire price. Based on that
       data, the unit should purchase new tires because it would take two recapped tires to equal
       the service life of one new tire and will cost 20 percent more than one new tire.
          1.26.4.5.1. If using life cycle data to warrant a green purchase exception (see
          paragraph 1.25.3), ensure data is thorough, complete and well documented.
   1.26.5. Purchase Request Originator, Purchaser and Supervisory Personnel. Includes
   personnel authorized to order items using the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), section
   supervisors, Material Control personnel, Government Purchase Card (GPC) holders, supply
   technicians and the VFM/VMS.
       1.26.5.1. Reviewing purchase requests to determine whether green products have been
       considered or requested.
       1.26.5.2. Determining if there is appropriate justification based on price, performance or
       availability for not meeting the purchasing requirements of the GPP.
       1.26.5.1. Determining if recycled content and biobased products satisfy local
       requirements for price, availability and performance.
       1.26.5.2. Identifying opportunities for specifying environmentally preferable products.
       1.26.5.3. Ensuring that relevant green procurement requirements are identified prior to
       submission to Material Control or GPC card holder, so that final/approved purchase
       requests properly address all relevant green procurement requirements.
       1.26.5.4. Following locally established procedures for documenting purchases and
       exceptions to green procurement requirements.
1.27. Training. Although Green Procurement training is required for all Government Purchase
Card (GPC) users, Green Procurement training will also be required for the VFM/VMS, Section
Supervisors, personnel assigned to Material Control and any other personnel assigned to Vehicle
Management with the authority to order or purchase parts and supplies every two years. “Green
Procurement” computer-based training is a Continuous Learning course (CLC 046) available
from the Defense Acquisition University (DAU). Once completed the course will be
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   39


documented in the member’s training record.             Go to DAU’s iCatalog web page
http://icatalog.dau.mil/ for more information and access to the course.
1.28. Purchasing Sources. When a requirement is established for a product in one of the
categories listed above, Vehicle Management activities will review the following sources for
Green Products/Services (designated items):
   1.28.1. Federal Supply. These sources would include the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
   and U.S. General Service Agency (GSA) catalogs and/or websites. Procuring items through
   these sources offers the advantage of competitive bidding, compliance with EPA minimum
   content thresholds for recovered materials, and central tracking. These sources also provide
   an additional service through independent estimation, certification and verification of EPA-
   designated items containing recovered material, thereby reducing overhead costs for buyers
   to monitor vendor compliance with affirmative procurement requirements.
       1.28.1.1. DLA. DLA’s “DOD EMALL” is a web-based eCommerce site that allows
       authorized users to search, compare, and purchase commercial and noncommercial
       products and services through a single interface in an easy-to-use online format. DOD
       EMALL uses a “green tree” icon to identify environmentally preferable attributes.
       Products available include re-refined lubricating oil and reclaimed engine coolant. GPC
       card holder must register with the site before product catalogs can be viewed. Website
       login is at: https://dod-emall.dla.mil.
       1.28.1.2. GSA. The GSA website contains a “Green Products Compilation” page that
       offers a downloadable workbook as a tool to facilitate the procurement of green products.
       The Green Products Compilation workbook is separated into areas to include Vehicle
       Products and Lubricants, Oils, Hydraulic Fluids and Greases. The workbook can be
       accessed at: http://www.gsa.gov.
   1.28.2. EPA-Designated Recycled-Content Vehicular Products. The EPA Database of
   Environmental          Information         for       Products        and          Services
   (http://yosemite1.epa.gov/oppt/eppstand2.nsf) provides a quick reference guide to the
   various programs and products involved in DOD's GPP. The EPA database provides links to
   contract language, specifications and policies; environmental standards and guidelines;
   vendor lists of product brands; and other useful sources of information (e.g., fact sheets,
   guidance, case studies). Additionally, the EPA’s CPG program provides details concerning
   products listed in the Vehicular Products category, Product Resource Guides and Product
   Supplier Directories. Go to: http://www.epa.gov/waste/conserve/tools/cpg/index.htm to
   access information.
   1.28.3. USDA-Designated Biobased Products. USDA BioPreferred® vendors can be
   found on the USDA BioPreferred website: http://www.biopreferred.gov. The site contains
   an electronic product catalog of USDA-designated biobased products, their manufactures and
   locations. Purchasing activities can browse the catalog by subject. Be sure to review all
   categories for potential products that fall into the procurement categories listed above.
Note: There will be some overlap between the EPA-designated items and the USDA list for
biobased items. USDA states that procurements subject to CPG requirements (EPA-designated
items) do not also have to satisfy the new biobased product requirements, if the two sets of
requirements are inconsistent. However, this does not mean that EPA-designated items must
 40                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


automatically be purchased in place of biobased purchases. Purchasers should look at the
benefits and costs of products and select the one that provides the best value overall.
   1.28.4. Local Vendors. Activities may also purchase designated items for local vendors
   provided the items have: 1) the highest percent practical biobased material practical or
   exceed minimum USDA Biobased standards; or 2) have the highest percentage practical of
   recovered material or comply with the EPA’s recommended recoverable materials content
   ranges. Standards and content ranges can be found under the product categories on the
   USDA and EPA website respectively. Material Control or authorized purchasers should
   thoroughly review and exhaust internet resources to find the least expensive products that
   meet Green standards and matches operational/manufactures’ requirements.
1.29. Procurement Standards.
   1.29.1. Tires. Vehicle Management will purchase retread/recapped tires to the maximum
   extent practical before new tires are purchased from any source. Procuring activities will
   establish preference programs consisting of one or both components listed below.
      1.29.1.1. Procurement of tire retreading services for the agencies' used tire casings. The
      EPA recommends that procuring agencies specify that tire repair and retread services
      must conform to Federal Specification ZZ-T-441H (or current version).
      1.29.1.2. Procurement of tires through competition between vendors of new tires and
      vendors of retread tires. The EPA recommends that procuring agencies specify that
      retread tires must meet the requirements of Federal Specification ZZ-T-381, "Tires,
      Pneumatic, Vehicular (Highway) (New and Retreaded).
   1.29.2. Refer to DLA-Columbus, Cooperative Approved Tire List (CATL-1922), current
   edition, for a list of approved Cooperative Tire Qualification Program (CQTP) retread tire
   manufactures.
Note: There is no legal requirement or national government policy mandate for government
agencies to use the CTQP or CATL list when purchasing retread tires.
   1.29.3. Engine Coolants. Vehicle Management will use/procure recycled/reclaimed
   coolants (antifreeze) to the maximum extent possible. Manufacturer specifications must
   specifically state that recycled/reclaimed antifreeze can be used in the vehicle.
      1.29.3.1. Vehicle Management may establish a program for engine coolant reclamation
      (recycling) and reuse that consists of either reclaiming the spent engine coolants onsite or
      establishing a service contract for reclamation of the spent engine coolant for use in
      vehicles.
      1.29.3.2. Vehicle Management may purchase reclaimed engine coolant when making
      direct purchases of this item, such as when necessary to make up for losses due to
      leakage or spillage.
      1.29.3.3. Recycled/reclaimed antifreeze is not always compatible with existing virgin
      coolants and the coolant system must be completely drained and purged prior to the use
      of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze. Be sure to check manufacturer's specifications prior to
      adding or replacing recycled/reclaimed antifreeze. Other general exceptions are as
      follows:
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     41


           1.29.3.3.1. Using recycled/reclaimed antifreeze would void the warranty. However,
           recycled/reclaimed antifreeze will be used if it meets the manufacturer's
           specifications.
Note: After the warranty period expires recycled/reclaimed antifreeze MUST be used
exclusively if approved by the vehicle’s manufacturer. Tech data must specifically state that
recycled/reclaimed antifreeze is approved for use in the vehicle.
           1.29.3.3.2. Some heavy equipment manufacturers do not recommend the use of
           reclaimed engine coolants, particularly in engines meeting the new Tier II and Tier III
           emissions requirements, e.g., the Halverson loader coolant requirement prevents the
           use of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze. Be sure to check manufacturer's specifications
           on the use of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze.
        1.29.3.4. DLA Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) sells both reclaimed and
        virgin engine coolant. DSCR requires that reclaimed engine coolant contain a minimum
        of 50 percent reclaimed ethylene glycol. DSCR offers reclaimed engine coolants
        containing either 100 percent reclaimed ethylene glycol or 60 percent and 50 percent
        blends of reclaimed and virgin ethylene glycol. As shown in Table 1.1, Reclaimed
        Engine Coolant Available from DLA, each blend is available in 1-gallon, 5-gallon and
        55-gallon drum packaging, for a total of nine stock items. These products can be used in
        administrative vehicles, construction and material handling vehicles and equipment, and
        military ground combat tactical vehicles and equipment. DSCR currently contracts with
        Leeder Automotive for reclaimed engine coolant.

   1.29.6. Sorbents. Materials formulated for use in the cleanup and automotive, industrial, or
   kitchen soils and oils, including grease, paint, and other coatings, from hard surfaces - 89%
   Minimum Biobased Content.
   1.29.7. Re-refined Oil. Vehicle Management will use/procure re-refined lubricating oil to
   the maximum extent possible. The EPA recommends that procuring agencies set their
   minimum re-refined oil content standard at the highest level of re-refined oil, but no lower
   than 25 percent re-refined oil. Re-refined oil purchased through DLA meets that standard.
   DOD policy dictates that DLA automatically substitute re-refined oil when activities order
   certain grades of commercial oil.
      1.29.7.1. Vehicle management activities purchasing oil from sources other than DLA
      must comply with the legal requirements to use re-refined oil, meeting the re-refined oil
      content specified above, and is reminded that the central supply system is the preferred
      method of purchasing supplies.
      1.29.7.2. Approved re-refined oil, which can be used in most AF vehicles, will meet
      current American Petroleum Institute (API) standards, evidenced by the "Starburst"
      symbol on the container.
      1.29.7.3. Do not purchase or arrange for purchase of any virgin motor oil when a re-
      refined alternative is readily available and meets vehicle manufacturer recommended
      performance standards.
      1.29.7.4. Model year 2007 and newer diesel engines with new emissions requirements
      should use virgin API CJ-4 motor oil until it is available as a re-refined product.
1.30. Administrative Requirements.
   1.30.1. VFM/VMS will establish an Operating Instruction (OI) outlining the AF/A4LE
   program policy contained herein and how the program will be implemented locally.
   1.30.2. Green Procurement Program Log. Vehicle Management activities will maintain
   “Green Procurement Program Log” and document data concerning the use/procurement of all
   items identified in the designated categories above (to include new/virgin/exempted
   items/products). The GPP Log template available on the VM CoP must be used and will
   include the following headings:
      1.30.2.1. Unit.
      1.30.2.2. Date of Purchase (or Date Recycled for in-house antifreeze recycling).
      1.30.2.3. Product Category (e.g., Engine Coolant, Engine Oil, Hyd. Fluids/Lubricants,
      Tires).
      1.30.2.4. Product Type (Recycled Content, Biobased Content, Retread or New/Virgin).
      1.30.2.5. Procurement Source (e.g., SBSS, GPC, In-House, Contract).
      1.30.2.6. Procurement Exception (e.g., Yes or No).
      1.30.2.7. Exception Reason. This area will be used to identify reason for exception
      (purchasing a non-EPA-designated recycled-content or USDA-designated biobased
      product).

       April and October for the six-month period preceding the reporting month.
       1.30.4.2. Air National Guard vehicle management activities will report data during
       January and July for the six-month period preceding the reporting month.
   1.30.5. Additional Program Resources. Additional information on GPP is available from
   the VM CoP and other internet sources.
1.31. Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles. This AFI now contains the basic
AF directive for MRAP Family of Vehicles (FoV) weapon system management. It provides the
minimum essential guidance and procedures for safely and effectively maintaining and managing
the MRAP weapon system. Managing the complete MRAP as a system-of-systems enables
systematic configuration management while providing visibility of readiness and mission
capability of the entire weapon system. The system used to track, collect and maintain data for
MRAP configuration and life cycle sustainment is the Integrated Maintenance Data System
(IMDS). For further details, refer to Chapter 12, MRAP FoV Maintenance and Management.

                                           Chapter 2

              VEHICLE MANAGEMENT CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS

Section 2A—General Information

2.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes instructions for vehicle management activities
tasked with a deployment mission, Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) responsibility, War
Readiness Material (WRM) management, vehicle deployment tasking and/or supporting Range
of Military Operations (ROMO). Provisions of this chapter apply to steady state, transition to
surge, Major Theater War and reconstitution operations. All Vehicle Management personnel,
regardless of rank, will be familiar with the contents of this chapter.
   2.1.1. This chapter contains guidance primarily for use prior to deployment, during
   deployment and is designed to assist deployed Vehicle Management personnel to establish
   and operate in a contingency environment. Its use is mandatory.
2.2. AEF Overview. The AF’s Total Force is part of the AEF. There are four major elements
of the AEF structure: readily available force, Enabler force, in-place support and Institutional
Force. The first three elements are components that primarily constitute the AF‘s war-fighting
capability and are therefore postured in Unit Type Codes (UTC); the fourth element provides the
AF‘s sustainment capability necessary to meet Secretary Of the Air Force (SECAF) statutory
functions. The readily available force is the primary pool from which the AF fulfills the Global
Force Management Allocation Plan rotational requirements. To meet these requirements, the AF
aligns its war-fighting capabilities into a baseline of 10 AEFs (five pairs), each intended to
contain an equivalent capability from which to provide forces. During periods of increased
requirements, capability areas from these 10 AEFs may be realigned within the Global AEF
construct to a Tempo Band that provides a deeper pool of capability, deploying that capability at
a higher deploy-to-dwell rate (i.e. the ratio of time deployed in support of a contingency versus
the time not deployed in support of a contingency). The baseline AEF (Band “A”) is organized
to support a one-to-four ratio. The alternative Tempo Bands are organized to support an
increasing deploy-to-dwell ratio with Bands “C”, “D” and “E” supporting one-to-three, one-to-
two, and one-to-one ratios respectively. Band “B” (like Band “A”) supports a one-to-four ratio
but with a 6 month vulnerability period vice 4 months; the vulnerability periods for Bands “C”,
“D” and “E” are also six months. Two additional Tempo Bands are designed to support ARC
forces in capability areas that might require mobilization. Tempo Band “M” and “N” are
designed to support mobilization-to-dwell ratios of one-to-five and one-to-four respectively.
When forces are realigned to a different Tempo Band, each block within the Tempo Band is
intended to contain an equivalent capability. For additional information concerning AF planning
and functions of the AEF, refer to AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.

Section 2B—Overall Responsibilities

2.3. AF/A4LE. The AF will have sufficient motor vehicles, manpower, tools, facilities and
shop equipment on hand to support the AF WMP, AEF operations and/or ROMO.
   2.3.1. Adjudicate any vehicle sourcing reclama issues.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  45


   2.3.2. Appoint specific MAJCOM A4, as determined by Area of Responsibility (AOR), as
   POC for logistical support for specific operation.
2.4. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)/DPW:
   2.4.1. Sources personnel after receiving operational plan (OPLAN) or AEF tasking request
   from parent MAJCOM.
   2.4.2. Adjusts or forwards personnel tasking shortfalls as appropriate.
2.5. WR-ALC
   2.5.1. Implements procedures to meet spare parts and TO shortfalls through emergency
   procurement actions to support surge and sustainment phases of contingency operations.
       2.5.1.1. This does not relieve unit responsibility for maintaining duplicate, deployable
       printed or electronic copies of TOs for WRM and Mobility vehicles listed on the Vehicle
       Authorization Listing (VAL) with the following “Use” codes: J – Vehicle Mobility, K –
       Vehicle Base Support, L – Vehicle Joint Use, M – Vehicle Pure WRM.
   2.5.2. Sources vehicles after receiving OPLAN or AEF tasking request from parent
   MAJCOM. WR-ALC will work closely with MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs to
   identify potential sources for Mission Capable (MC) vehicles.
Note: Since WR-ALC is not a force provider, Air Combat Command (ACC), as the air
component to Joint Force Commander (JFCOM), will manage the scheduling and sourcing of
forces (including vehicles) to meet the Combatant Commander’s (COCOM) requirements
through the AFPC/DPW. ACC/A4RE will work directly with WR-ALC to coordinate with other
MAJCOMs, where necessary, to source required vehicle assets. The same process will be
followed by other MAJCOMs who have air component/force provider responsibilities in their
respective AOR.
   2.5.3. Adjusts or forwards vehicle tasking reclama actions as appropriate.
2.6. VEMSO. Provides support necessary to equip expeditionary Vehicle Management forces
with the best tools, equipment, parts, maintenance techniques and general support for deployed
operations. This support is accomplished through research of available commercial products (via
the Product Evaluation Program), capture and formalization of deployment lessons learned and
review policy change recommendations.
   2.6.1. Researches and develops management techniques, procedures and guidance necessary
   to guide Vehicle Management operations in an expeditionary, deployed environment. Tips
   and lessons learned will be captured, developed and distributed to enhance knowledge level
   of personnel subject to deploy.
   2.6.2. Develops vehicle deployment-condition standards to ensure maximum reliability in
   field conditions with minimal investment. Monitors condition of vehicles deployed through
   collection and dissemination of "lessons-learned" and other means to institutionalize
   readiness and maximize return on investment.
   2.6.3. Assists MAJCOM, NAF or deployed VM activities with emergency "reach-back"
   vehicle tech data support for deployed vehicle maintainers.
2.7. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs:

   2.7.1. Develop supplemental guidance specific to theater-unique operations.
   2.7.2. Ensure Vehicle Management activities are equipped and trained to fulfill wartime and
   AEF mission requirements.
   2.7.3. Program for manpower, facilities, shop equipment, technical manuals and tools
   necessary to support organizational and intermediate management concepts for all vehicles
   committed to wartime and AEF missions.
   2.7.4. Manage WRM vehicle assets according to AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM)
   Program Guidance and Procedures, as supplemented.
      2.7.4.1. Assign primary WRM vehicle management function within the headquarters.
      The individual will work with the WRM Global Management staff (ACC/A4RX) and
      Command WRM Officers to manage the WRM vehicles program.
   2.7.5. Contact WR-ALC for vehicle repair assistance above MAJCOM capability.
   2.7.6. Establish minimum reporting requirements to identify on-hand vehicle assets and
   ensure shortages, vehicle MC rates and materiel management support problem areas are
   identified.
   2.7.7. MAJCOMs with host base responsibilities are required to provide Vehicle
   Management and spare parts support for inbound forces identified in OPLAN.
   2.7.8. MAJCOMs with host base responsibilities may direct Individual Toolkits (ITK) for all
   Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) be left in place during rotations. If this happens, the host
   base and MAJCOM will notify inbound forces that ITKs are not required for that operating
   location.
   2.7.9. Where appropriate, tenant MAJCOMs assist the host MAJCOM to source their
   command’s vehicle-specific and peculiar spare parts. The host base Vehicle Management
   organization is responsible for follow-on spare parts support.
   2.7.10. Serve as Functional Area Managers (FAM) on MAJCOM Crisis or Contingency
   Action Teams (CAT) or equivalent. Identify, source and track deployment actions. Provide
   personnel, vehicle and vehicle-related cargo In-Transit Visibility (ITV) to MAJCOM
   leadership as required. Refer to paragraph A2.2 for additional guidance.
   2.7.11. Contact WR-ALC for additional vehicle requirements to support OPLAN and AEF
   tasking.
   2.7.12. Adjust or forward vehicle-tasking reclamas as appropriate.
   2.7.13. Transfer accountability for vehicles that have been deployed from home station. The
   shipping MAJCOM transfers vehicle accountability to the combatant MAJCOM. The
   combatant MAJCOM accepts accountability for vehicles deployed to their AOR. After
   accountability has been transferred, the losing MAJCOM can initiate replacement actions
   with WR-ALC using the command levy process (see paragraph 2.17) or through their
   vehicle buy process. Transfers from AFR and ANG must comply with DODD 1225.6,
   Equipping the Reserve Forces, 7 April 2005.
2.8. Base-Level and WRM Deploying Activities:
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    47


  2.8.1. Maintain WRM vehicles according to guidelines established in this chapter, related
  AF TOs, Vehicle Management publications and AFI 25-101, as supplemented by the
  MAJCOM.
  2.8.2. Comply with the provisions of TO 36-1-191 and other shipping instructions as
  provided by WR-ALC or MAJCOM.
  2.8.3. Identify problem areas which cannot be resolved locally to the MAJCOM.
  2.8.4. Develop local guidance for Vehicle Management wartime concept of operations as
  directed by the MAJCOM. Include procedures for operating in chemical/biological
  contaminated environments and repairing contaminated vehicles. See AFMAN 10-2503,
  Operating In A Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, And High-Yield Explosive
  (CBRNE) Environment, for additional guidance.
  2.8.5. Select best (most serviceable and maintainable) vehicles for deployment. Ensure each
  deployment-tasked vehicle is accompanied with set of spare key(s) and an assembled spare
  wheel/tire. Spare wheel/tires will be provided by the owing organization, or Vehicle
  Management if not available. In addition, each commercially designed light and medium
  duty vehicle (see paragraph 1.1.1) and military designed prime mover must also be
  equipped with lug wrench(es), jack and jack handle. This ensures operators are self-
  sufficient to change out a spare tire; especially, in remote or hostile locations.
  2.8.6. Ship current printed or electronic copy of TO and any other necessary technical data
  for maintenance with each vehicle, unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM. When
  several vehicles of the same make/model/type are deployed as a package, each vehicle should
  be accompanied with a complete TO set. This ensures availability of technical data if vehicle
  is redistributed, diverted or forward deployed. If a unit is tasked to deploy a vehicle and has
  only one TO for the vehicle, the unit ships that TO or a photocopy with the vehicle if
  electronic copy cannot be attained.
  2.8.7. Assemble Temporary Mission Support Kits (TMSK) as directed. TMSKs will be
  affixed to the vehicle or shipped against the appropriate vehicle’s contingency Transportation
  Control Number (TCN). Refer to paragraph 2.14 for TMSK guidance.
  2.8.8. Fuel availability at deployed locations (such as Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel) should also
  be taken into consideration when determining which vehicle(s) to deploy.
  2.8.9. Ensure VFM/VMSs are familiar with current Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
  statement, OPLANs, In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plans (IGESP) and UTC Mission
  Capability (MISCAP) statements.
  2.8.10. Deploy with sufficient skilled personnel and equipment resources to satisfy all
  contingency wartime and AEF requirements.
  2.8.11. Document costs to prepare vehicles, spare parts and tech data for shipment. Units
  will retain all expense data associated with the preparation of vehicles for shipment for
  possible reimbursement.
  2.8.12. Monitor the Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) to ensure tasked
  vehicles are shipped to the correct location on time. For ITV, units are required to provide
  the MAJCOM with the following information concerning vehicle equipment: Deployment
  TCN (F-Prefixed), Unit Line Number (ULN), UTC, vehicle registration number and
 48                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   departure and delivery dates within the allotted transit times. For tracking purposes, when
   Vehicle Management personnel are tasked to deploy with a tasked vehicle (e.g., natural
   disasters) forward the following information to the MAJCOM: Complete name, grade,
   AFSC and last four digits of the social security number. See AFI 24-203, Preparation and
   Movement of Air Force Cargo, for allotted transit times.
   2.8.13. Maintain duplicate printed or electronic copies of TOs to support WRM out-load and
   mobility (identified by Use Code (UC) “A” on VAL) vehicles.
   2.8.14. Deploying units will ensure individual members are trained as required and equipped
   for contingency operations. Individual members will ensure they are qualified and equipped
   for contingency operations
   2.8.15. Fill or shortfall personnel OPLAN or AEF tasking as appropriate.
   2.8.16. Refer to Figure A2.1, Vehicle Fleet Manager’s Pre-Contingency Checklist, for
   assistance on pre-deployment planning.

Section 2C—Steady-State Operations

2.9. Training:
   2.9.1. Repair Operations: Although difficult to predict the actual operating environment at a
   contingency location, it is possible to exercise personnel in a simulated or practice
   deployment.
       2.9.1.1. Deployable personnel need to be prepared for flexible operations under adverse
       conditions. They must also be well trained in the use of all tools and shop equipment.
       2.9.1.2. Pre-deployment training is not required unless specifically addressed via tasking
       “Line Remarks”.
   2.9.2. Contingency Environment: Operations in a contingency environment will expose
   vehicle maintainers to many situations and problems not encountered in normal peacetime
   operations. Training provides the required knowledge and skills to plan for, respond to, and
   recover from conventional and irregular warfare CBRNE events. To complement the
   training, installations must include realistic exercises and scenarios demonstrating the level
   of proficiency required for operating in a contingency environment and for evaluation
   purposes. Refer to AFMAN 10-2503 for additional training information.
2.10. WRM Vehicle Storage. WRM vehicles are authorized to bridge the gap between
peacetime and wartime requirements. These vehicles are authorized and maintained separately
from the active peacetime vehicle fleet and are normally preserved in storage. MAJCOMs
develop specific storage concepts for vehicles identified in the WRM Global Strategy Document
(GSD).
Note: Specific storage concepts for FORCE (or the legacy systems FSE) will be at the direction
of MAJCOM and approved by (or coordinated with) the WRM Global Manger (ACC/A4RX).
   2.10.1. Vehicles are stored in active (ready to roll) or inactive (deep stored) categories.
   MAJCOMs determine the mix of active and inactive stored vehicles. For basic planning, the
   following guidance applies:
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      49


       2.10.1.1. Active stored vehicles: Vehicles stored outdoors, under partial cover or
       vehicles required to support initial incoming forces are preserved to Level C as described
       in TO 36-1-191 or as specified by the MAJCOM.
       2.10.1.2. Inactive stored vehicles: Vehicles will be stored in an enclosed building and
       preserved to Level A storage as described in TO 36-1-191 or as prescribed by MAJCOM
       guidance.
Note: Dense packing of vehicles in an enclosed building does not constitute inactive storage.
   2.10.2. Vehicles are controlled according to AFI 25-101, as supplemented.
   2.10.3. Accomplish lubrication at least every 18 months on active stored vehicles. An oil
   and filter change is accomplished every three years.
   2.10.4. WRM vehicles are rotated into the active peacetime fleet (where like-vehicle
   peacetime authorizations exist) to ensure equipment dependability/life cycle management
   and to equalize utilization.
   2.10.5. Develop a parking plan for each storage location.
   2.10.6. Fire extinguishers and chocks are mounted to or located in each vehicle, or
   positioned in the vehicle storage area.
   2.10.7. When inside storage cannot be provided, outside storage areas are well lit, have
   adequate drainage and are secured by a chain link or equivalent fence.
   2.10.8. Exceptions to Storage Policies. Fuel servicing, fire fighting, aircraft cargo loaders
   and certain other vehicles are equipped with systems that must be exercised more frequently.
   To the maximum extent practicable, fully exercise operational systems on these vehicles
   every 30 days.
2.11. WRM Manpower Determination. Vehicle Management and Manpower Office consider
the following factors when developing manpower requirements supporting vehicle storage:
   2.11.1. The quantity and complexity of vehicles to be stored (vehicle equivalents).
   2.11.2. The storage level (active storage requires more manpower than inactive storage).
   2.11.3. Frequency of inspection and the average amount of time required for each inspection.
   2.11.4. Age of the Fleet. Older vehicles may require more maintenance than pre-positioned
   new vehicles.
   2.11.5. The degree and frequency of vehicle fleet involvement in exercises (that is, used to
   support Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), intra-theater or local exercises).
   2.11.6. Rotation.   This will affect the number of Limited Technical Inspections (LTI)
   required.
   2.11.7. If applicable, the amount of time required for vehicles to be placed in or removed
   from storage.
   2.11.8. Hours of operational coverage, e.g., 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
   2.11.9. Material handling and surface movement of cargo to, from and between operating
   locations in support of surge and sustainment operations at bare base versus fixed facilities.
 50                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   2.11.10. Fleet size for management and dispersed locations.
2.12. Contractor Operated Storage. Contractor operated storage is the AF Standard. Explore
the use of military personnel only if local environment and political conditions prevent contract
establishment. Vehicle Management and Manpower Office also consider manpower ceilings,
contractor availability, cost, location, and duration of storage as governing factors. Assign
technically competent (7-level personnel in AFSC 2T3) AF vehicle repair technicians as Quality
Assurance Personnel (QAP) and ensure QAP-specific training is provided. See Chapter 9 for
additional information on QAP.

Section 2D—Transition to Surge/Deployment Preparation

2.13. Personnel.
   2.13.1. Closely review all deployment tasking MISCAPs and line-remarks. Current
   MISCAP information can be obtained from the Unit Deployment Manager (UDM). Contact
   the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) for assistance if UDM is unavailable.
       2.13.1.1. The MISCAP describes the performance level required by the tasked UTC.
       The tasked unit is responsible for ensuring deploying personnel can meet all MISCAP
       requirements.
   2.13.2. If the unit cannot support the tasking, forward a shortfall request through appropriate
   channels immediately.
   2.13.3. Personnel with AFSCs 2T3X1, 2T3X2A, 2T3X2C and 2T370 will be prepared to
   deploy with an ITK of standard and metric hand tools if specifically directed by MAJCOM,
   or line-remarks, to do so. ITK must also include any AFSC-specific tools required to fulfill
   MISCAP requirements. See Figure A2.4 for recommended items.
Note: ITKs must be assembled as light and compact as reasonably possible to help ensure
commercial air transportation capability. Some domestic flights may have a 50-pound weight
limit. Ensure excess baggage allowance is authorized on deploying member’s orders if the
member is deploying with an ITK.
       2.13.3.1. Personnel with AFSCs 2T370, 2T390 and 2T300 will be prepared to deploy
       with minimum publications and forms listed in Figure A2.2 and Figure A2.3 if directed
       to do so. Ensure all publications and forms are the most current versions. Electronic
       copies (CD, external hard-drives, etc.) are preferable if computer support capable of
       reading media is confirmed.
   2.13.4. Personnel with AFSC 2T3X7 will be prepared to deploy with an ITK consisting of
   laptop, all-in-one printer/ scanner/fax, 30 days of administrative office supplies and current
   versions of electronic publications and forms listed in Figure A2.2 and Figure A2.3 if
   specifically directed by MAJCOM, or line-remarks.
       2.13.4.1. The 2T3X7 ITK will consist of a functional, fully tested and modern laptop
       computer with current AF Standard Desktop configuration that is capable of joining a
       “.mil” domain. Laptop will be exercised before departure to ensure full serviceability
       and internet access capability. A compatible printer with extra ink or toner cartridges
       will accompany the Vehicle Management & Analysis (VM&A) laptop. See Figure A2.5
       for additional 2T3X7 ITK guidance.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    51


      2.13.4.2. If required, the deploying unit will send an in-use OLVIMS computer and
      printer. Replacement computers can be easily sourced for home station use. It is
      imperative the deploying members be able to establish and operate OLVIMS at the
      deployed location as soon as practical.
   2.13.5. Deploying units may also be tasked to assemble and ship an ITK to support Materiel
   Control operations. The ITK will consist of items listed in Figure A2.6. The ITK will
   include administrative office supplies and current versions of electronic publications and
   forms listed in Figure A2.2 and Figure A2.3, unless specially authorized to deviate by host
   MAJCOM.
   2.13.6. The combatant MAJCOM may direct ITKs for all AFSCs to be left in place during
   rotations. If this happens, the combatant MAJCOM must notify inbound forces that ITKs are
   not required for that operating location.
   2.13.7. Mobility processing functions are responsible for ensuring each deploying member
   has all required individual equipment. Items such as steel toe boots, safety glasses/goggles,
   reflective belts and hearing protection are mandatory. Refer to Figure A2.7 for suggested
   individual deployment items member should consider taking if not directed to or issued.
2.14. TMSK.
   2.14.1. If approved by higher headquarters or stated as a line-remark on Vehicle
   Redistribution Order (RDO), deploying vehicles will be shipped with a TMSK.
   2.14.2. Each TMSK assembled is designed to support one vehicle for 30 days with common
   and high-use items in the event of minor malfunctions before the supply chain and/or shop
   stocks are established at the deployed/forward location. Refer to Figure A2.10 for an
   example listing of possible TMSK items.
   2.14.3. TMSKs are individually assembled, boxed, and shipped within the cab, trunk, and
   truck bed or on the forks of each vehicle, if physically possible. If this is not feasible,
   consider placing the most critical items (TO and critical parts) in the cab or other vehicle
   compartments. If items shipped inside the vehicle are not readily visible (e.g., inside high
   reach or telephone maintenance truck compartments), identify location with a prominently
   placed label. Over-sized kits must be shipped IAW paragraph 2.16.12 to ensure the kit
   arrives at the same location with the vehicle.
      2.14.3.1. If more than one vehicle of the same type is deploying to the same location,
      those kits can be consolidated into a larger kit. When consolidating kits, quantities and
      breadth of the kits should be increased. This ensures availability of items if vehicles are
      redistributed, diverted or forward deployed.
   2.14.4. Mark each TMSK exterior with vehicle make, model, registration number, shipping
   unit, gaining unit (if known) and shipping unit POC with Defense Switch Network (DSN)
   phone number. Each TMSK item inside the kit will be individually labeled with part
   number, NSN, description, vehicle type and model year.
   2.14.5. Units with Mobility coded (UC “A” on VAL) and deployment-prone vehicles may
   have pre-built TMSKs only when authorized by the MAJCOM.
2.15. Tools and Equipment Deployment.
 52                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   2.15.1. Vehicle Management leadership at all levels must be aware of 2T3XX UTC
   tasking(s). This information is available from the UDM, base-level Readiness Flight or the
   MAJCOM Logistics Plans and Readiness function.
   2.15.2. Tasked units build and deploy tool and equipment kits from host Vehicle
   Management shops as necessary to meet wartime tasking(s). UTC UFMXK, Transportation
   Vehicle Management Support Kit, is designed to support Vehicle Management operations for
   30 days. Note: Verify required contents with UDM or IDO. The most current inventory list
   can be accessed in Logistics Module (LOGMOD). Additional items for unique situations can
   only be added after MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff’s approval.
   2.15.3. Electrical transformers may be required for some overseas locations.       Contact
   MAJCOM if specific guidance is required.
   2.15.4. Deliver kits in air transportable tool storage cabinets to facilitate shipping and
   secured storage at pre-positioned and contingency locations.
2.16. Vehicle Deployment Process.
   2.16.1. Vehicle Tasking Flow.
      2.16.1.1. The "Forces For " Memorandum assigns forces to the combatant commander’s
      (COCOM) authority. COCOMs are AFRICOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, NORTHCOM,
      PACOM, SOUTHCOM, etc. Note: Assigned forces may be allocated between
      COCOMs as ordered by SECDEF.
      2.16.1.2. The Joint Force Provider (JFP) provides personnel and equipment identified in
      the COCOM Request For Forces (RFF).
Notes:
1. There are currently three JFPs: USTRANSCOM, USJFCOM and USSOCOM. For example,
AMC sources personnel and equipment in support of Mobility Air Forces
(MAF)/USTRANSCOM requirements, ACC sources personnel and equipment in support of
Combat Air Forces (CAF) and conventional forces/USJFCOM requirements and AFSOC sources
personnel and equipment in support of Special Forces/USSOCOM.
2. USTRANSCOM is currently the JFP for Nuclear and Space.
3. USJFCOM is currently the JFP for ISR.
      2.16.1.3. MAJCOMs other than ACC, AMC and AFSOC do not answer to JFP request
      for the AF. Instead they answer to their respective COCOMs regarding their ability to
      support requirements through their component (NAF/MAJCOM) with their assigned
      forces. Examples include: USAFE (NAF/MAJCOM) answers to EUCOM, PACAF
      (NAF/MAJCOM) answers to PACOM, etc.. Note: MAJCOM vehicle staffs validate
      vehicle and vehicle maintenance personnel requirements generated by NAFs to ensure
      realistic requirements and optimum sourcing prior to the NAF uploading the
      requirements in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).
      2.16.1.4. When COCOM combat/relief efforts requirements exceed the supporting
      MAJCOM capabilities (shortfalls), or needs capability not assigned to support their AOR,
      then an RFF is submitted through the appropriate JFP depending on the type force they
      are requesting (Mobility, Conventional, Special Operations, Space or ISR).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   53


      2.16.1.5. There are some COCOMs that do not have assigned forces, for example
      AFRICOM. In this case, the COCOM goes directly to the JFP with a RFF.
      2.16.1.6. The components build the requirements in the Time Phased Force Deployment
      Data (TPFFD), so once requested and assigned, the requirements flow to AFPC/DPW for
      sourcing.
      2.16.1.7. For all “vehicle sourcing” in response to RFFs, AFPC sends requests to
      ACC/A4R to provide sourcing by Unit Identification Code (UIC). ACC reviews required
      delivery dates/location to identify the most efficient way (cost/time/lift) to support the
      COCOM. For example, for Haiti relief efforts, assets were sourced to units in Florida,
      and/or units that already had lift scheduled to move other cargo.
Note: As AMC is the lead for MHE assets, ACC coordinates with AMC to provide sourcing for
those type assets.
      2.16.1.8. MAJCOM FAM validates TPFDD tasking and the request systematically flows
      to tasked base/unit via Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment
      (DCAPES). MAJCOM FAM also provides tasking and shipping information to
      VFM/VMS based on TPFDD and advises VFM/VMS to contact IDO and/or UDM for
      specific tasking details/timelines that are not generally passed via non-secure networks.
      2.16.1.9. MAJCOM staff tracks TPFDD deployment actions and operates MAJCOM
      CATs or equivalent. See paragraph A2.2 for specific guidance.
   2.16.2. Tasked units send reclama requests back to MAJCOM as soon as possible. This
   enables better decision-making and prevents short-notice tasking(s) to the same or other
   units.
   2.16.3. No vehicle will be deployed from an installation without coordination through the
   host VM&A activity. Units deliver vehicles to Vehicle Management Customer Service
   Center (CSC) for an LTI to ensure suitability for deployment. The VFM/VMS, or designated
   representative, will inspect and approve each vehicle and documentation package prior to
   shipment to ensure suitability and compliance with TO 36-1-191. Unsuitable vehicles are
   either repaired or replaced with another vehicle.
Note: VM&A will contact parent MAJCOM to validate unit identified or non UFXXX-series
vehicle shipments.
   2.16.4. Funding. Tasked units fund all costs to place vehicles into safe and serviceable
   condition (refer to TO 36-1-191, Chapter 1 and/or manufacture specifications) and build
   TMSKs from their O&M budgets, unless otherwise provided in the shipping instructions.
   Units document and retain all expense data associated with the preparation of vehicles for
   shipment for possible reimbursement.
   2.16.5. Preparation for Shipment: Units ensure that only their best (newest/most serviceable
   and maintainable) vehicles are shipped to meet OPLAN, AEF or ROMO shipment tasking(s).
   Rotate vehicles as necessary within the wing to satisfy home station priority needs. Leasing
   may be required. The following steps will be accomplished prior to vehicle shipment:
      2.16.5.1. Perform an LTI.
54                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


     2.16.5.2. Place vehicle in safe and serviceable condition (refer to TO 36-1-191, Chapter
     1 and/or manufacture specifications).
     2.16.5.3. Service vehicle fluid systems or perform PM&I and Special Inspections if due
     within 90 days of shipment date. Complete all Time Compliance Technical Orders
     (TCTO), Service Bulletins (SB), One-Time Inspections (OTI), Manufacturer Recalls and
     delayed maintenance prior to deployment. Contact the MAJCOM for guidance if unable
     to comply before the shipment date.
  2.16.6. Each tasked 60K-loader will deploy with one air transport configuration tool.
  2.16.7. When deploying aircraft refueling vehicles the losing organization will contact the
  gaining organization for specific fuel type, filters and/or additives used at the deployed
  location. Refueling Maintenance will install appropriate filters prior to aircraft refuelers
  being shipped.
  2.16.8. Upon satisfactory completion of LTI, VM&A prepares a deployment package
  consisting of: appropriate Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, Waiver Card,
  DD Form 518, Accident Identification Card, AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt,
  Standard Form (SF) 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report, copy of LTI, Vehicle Historical
  Record and DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document. See paragraph A2.3 for
  more specific guidance. Secure data package and spare keys in cab or operator’s
  compartment for shipment. If shipped data and/or keys are not readily visible, identify
  location with a prominently placed label.
  2.16.9. Prepped vehicles are delivered to the Cargo Deployment Function (CDF) or Traffic
  Management Flight (TMF) as directed by local policy. Vehicle Management may be
  responsible for transporting TMSKs if not affixed to the vehicle. The Installation
  Deployment Plan will provide additional guidance on air and surface shipment standards and
  deploying unit UDM responsibilities.
  2.16.10. Any vehicle or equipment shipped against a TPFDD tasking will have a
  contingency TCN automatically generated from the LOGMOD. The UDM or IDO will be
  able to determine if a vehicle is tasked against the TPFDD. The TCN for a TPFDD shipment
  will start with “FF” if generated correctly.
     2.16.10.1. If LOGMOD is unavailable, use the following guidance to ensure correct
     TCNs have been manually generated: The TCN for each vehicle is built using the ULN
     from the TPFDD. Contingency TCNs are identified by “$” symbols in the 7th and 8th
     position of the 17-character data element. Refer to Defense Transportation Regulation
     (DTR) 4500.9-R, Part II, Cargo Movement, June 2008, and Part III, Mobility, July 2011,
     for additional guidance.
     2.16.10.2. Any vehicle or equipment not shipped against a TPFDD tasking will have a
     standard TCN created. Do not have a standard TCN created for a TPFDD-tasked vehicle
     shipment.
  2.16.11. Vehicle Management will closely coordinate with deploying unit UDM when
  TMSK is not affixed to the vehicle. TMSKs shipped with, but not attached to, vehicles are
  moved as multi-piece shipments. Ensure pieces are correctly marked (i.e., item 2 of 2)
  against shipment’s contingency TCN. Also, ensure the proper priority and Required
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   55


   Delivery Date (RDD) is assigned to all TMSKs that are shipped separately. This ensures the
   kit will arrive in time to support the vehicle if needed.
       2.16.11.1. This data is entered into the Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) or
       Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) and initiates ITV through the
       Global Transportation Network (GTN).
   2.16.12. Document and retain all TCNs for deploying vehicles and related cargo. Monitor
   all shipments and provide all data to MAJCOM and gaining unit.
   2.16.13. Surface Movement: Do not move vehicles to seaport until contacted by Surface
   Deployment and Distribution Command with a call forward date.
2.17. Vehicle Command Levy. VEMSO directs command levy vehicle shipment instructions
to effect permanent inter-command transfer of a vehicle in support of an operational AF
requirement. This action may, or may not occur concurrently with a vehicle deployment tasking
identified in an operational TPFDD. For example, during the build up for Operation Iraqi
Freedom, it was known vehicles deploying to the CENTCOM AOR would not be released from
the theater of operations, so command levy instructions were provided as the operational TPFDD
was developed and executed. In other instances, when short-term contingency or humanitarian
relief efforts transitioned to enduring missions, command levy instructions were provided after
the vehicles had been deployed for a lengthy period. Approved command levy action will be
forwarded to WR-ALC when funding allocation of second destination transportation funds is
required for shipment.
   2.17.1. Vehicles are routinely deployed to support operational requirements via the Vehicle
   Command Levy process. If a vehicle deployment exceeds six months, the owning unit (i.e.,
   the unit that originally deployed the vehicle) will contact their respective MAJCOM vehicle
   staff to determine if the deployed vehicle(s) will be permanently transferred to the deployed
   location via command levy.
   2.17.2. The MAJCOM vehicle staff in turn, will contact the VEMSO and request
   instructions regarding return of the vehicle to home station or command levy action.
Note: For information concerning the RDO process. Refer to paragraphs 4.78. and 8.5.6.
2.18. Home Station Survival. Deployment and AEF tasking(s) can impact home station
operations beyond sustainability. The following paragraphs give VFM/VMS possible options to
mitigate the impact of heavy deployment tasking(s). Refer to the VM CoP for additional
survival tips and examples. Ensure leadership is informed and approves implementation of any
operational changes.
   2.18.1. Manpower.
       2.18.1.1. Augmentation. Explore the use of civilian over hires, or ANG and AFR
       backfills. Contact Base Civilian Personnel Office for guidance on civilian over hires.
       Contact nearest ANG or AFR base for possible augmentation. Additionally, contact
       MAJCOM POC for Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) support. Manning
       Assistance can also be requested through the MAJCOM. Requesting unit is responsible
       for funding Temporary Duty (TDY) costs. A contingency Emergency and Special
       Program (ESP) code may be available for reimbursement.
 56                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


        2.18.1.2. Training. Prior to deployment, accelerate 5-level upgrade training while the
        majority of trainers are still available. Compensate for reduced capability by training
        non-deploying members in critical shop operations. This should help maximize shop
        productivity during heavy deployment periods.
   2.18.2. Shop Operations.
        2.18.2.1. Develop and implement a vehicle-parking plan. Identify serviceable, non-
        essential vehicles to be parked. Identification method could be from across the base,
        focused on deploying unit’s vehicle fleet, commander’s or equivalent’s option or by
        number/type of mechanics deployed. If the last option is selected, compute the total
        number of vehicle equivalents earned by the deploying mechanics, then park the proper
        fleet mix based on the total vehicle equivalents. Extensive coordination with base
        leadership must occur before implementing any type of parking plan. The following
        guidance must be used if a parking plan is implemented.
           2.18.2.1.1. The vehicles must be stored in a controlled and monitored environment.
           They must be parked for the duration of the deployment. A parking plan and map are
           recommended.
           2.18.2.1.2. Ensure parked vehicles are preserved to the appropriate storage level
           IAW TO 36-1-191.
           2.18.2.1.3. Do not cannibalize from parked vehicles. This will cause increased
           workload before vehicles can be returned to using organizations.
        2.18.2.2. Focus on quality of maintenance performed. Use the approved vehicle
        Minimum Essential Levels (MEL) and paragraph 3.32 as a gauge to develop
        maintenance priorities and establish in-house MC rate goals. Established goals will be
        thoroughly briefed and approved by the commander.
        2.18.2.3. Contract Maintenance. Preplanning potential contract maintenance is crucial.
        Contact local Contracting Office to set up Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) or short-
        term maintenance contracts. Maximize use of ESP codes for funding support.
        2.18.2.4. ISSA. If available, contact local DOD components or government maintenance
        operations. Discuss establishing an ISSA for Vehicle Management support during
        contingencies and/or AEF rotations. Ensure any ISSA address AF unique requirements
        for priority, types of maintenance and quality of services.

Section 2E—Deployed Location Operations

2.19. VFM/VMS. After the initial phase of all contingencies, the deployed VFM/VMS
implements responsibilities outlined in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3 of this instruction at the
deployed location. When the deployed LRS does not have a VFM/VMS assigned, the senior
ranking military member with AFSC 2T3XX assumes those duties.
2.20. Safety. Vehicle Management operations will observe and follow all applicable safety
policies and AFOSHSTDs. The Vehicle Maintenance Safety Handbook will be made available
(hard copy or electronically) to all vehicle management personnel at deployed locations.
Note:   VM Safety Handbook is available for download on the VM CoP or the Air Force
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   57


Logistics Management Agency website: http://www.aflma.hq.af.mil/lgj/otherpublications.asp
2.21. Qualification Training. Initiate immediately if needed. The senior deployed 2T3XX
ensures personnel are qualified on available shop equipment, local safety procedures, emergency
response actions and assigned vehicle fleet.
2.22. Mission Critical Vehicle List. Each deployed Vehicle Management operation employs a
maintenance priority system which considers current battle conditions and requirements. The
deployed VFM/VMS assigns priorities as necessary.
Note: Keyed to parts availability and local priorities, sortie-generating vehicles receive
immediate maintenance attention. Refer to Table 2.1., Priority I Vehicles, Sortie Generating,
and Table 2.2., Priority II Vehicles, Sortie Sustaining, for vehicle types and models associated
with these categories and paragraph 4.12. for information concerning MEL and Vehicle Priority
Recall Listing (VPRL) development.

2.23. Materiel Control. Basic Materiel Control functions are specified in Chapter 5.
   2.23.1. Materiel Control personnel will follow standard supply procurement procedures and
   utilize the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) when procuring repair parts and supplies.
   Materiel Control personnel can also coordinate with the servicing Contracting Office to
   establish vehicle parts procurement via local purchase. Innovations in information
   technology, worldwide commercial delivery and government reforms have made internet
   parts sourcing through commercial vendors with BPA and the Government Purchase Card
   (GPC) a viable alternative to traditional parts acquisition methods. Aggressive use will be
   made of commercial style transportation parts delivery alternatives.
   2.23.2. The combatant MAJCOM specifies how to accomplish follow-on spare parts support
   to the theater of operations. A Global Logistics Support Center (GLSC) will be in place to
   support contingency operations. Identify other support systems using theater-unique
   supplements.
       2.23.2.1. The GLSC Ground Support Flight provides service for Vehicle Management
       activities. They manage mission capable (MICAP), awaiting parts (AWP) and NSN
       items. The GLSC will also have a local purchase element to handle non-NSN
       requirements.
   2.23.3. Aggressively follow up with local ELRS Materiel Management function, NAF or
   combatant MAJCOM to establish contact with the appropriate GLSC.
2.24. VM&A.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     59


   2.24.1. A 2T3X7, or qualified vehicle maintenance technician, is responsible for AF Form
   1823/-1 preparation and ensuring vehicle repairs are accomplished consistent with priorities
   established by the VFM/VMS.
   2.24.2. If a 2T3X7 is not available, contact NAF or MAJCOM for additional assistance if
   required.
   2.24.3. All maintenance performed on vehicles requires documentation and reporting IAW
   procedures established by this AFI and as supplemented by MAJCOM. OLVIMS is
   implemented and used as soon as practical, normally within 30 days. See Figure A2.2 and
   Figure A2.3 for publications, TO, and forms needed to operate at a deployed site.
   2.24.4. Establish a vehicle control point upon arrival at a forward operating location. The
   vehicle control point’s primary function is to establish and maintain accountability for the
   base vehicle fleet as soon as possible. Vehicle fleet size is controlled by AS 034 and/or
   vehicle sets identified in the “Force Module Construct”.
   2.24.5. Establish a VCO/VCNCO program. Generate VCO/VCNCO list with 24-hour
   contact information. Brief VCO/VCNCO (in mass or individually as mission permits) on
   official use, accident and abuse procedures, use of DD Form 518 and SF 91, Motor Vehicle
   Accident Report, accountability, host nation/local use restrictions, weather/geographic related
   conditions, drivers license requirements, discrepancy reporting, add-on equipment requests,
   other vehicle management procedures, and vehicle related items listed in AFI 24-301,
   Vehicle Operations (mainly drivers license requirements), AFMAN 24-306_IP and Chapter
   10.
   2.24.6. Manage fleet using LIMS-EV Vehicle View (refer to Attachment 8), the
   Consolidated Request Information System (CRIS) Tool and the Vehicle Data Quality
   Dashboard (VDQD) (refer to Section 4B.)
   2.24.7. Create and maintain a tracking system for all commercial rented/leased vehicles. At
   a minimum, the system will contain: license/tag number, rental/lease date, rental/lease length,
   using organization, monthly rental/lease cost, monthly miles traveled, fuel consumption by
   fuel type, PM&I and Special Inspection intervals.
   2.24.8. Create a contingency vehicle MEL and VPRL if not already established. If both
   listings are already in place, review for accuracy and update if required. Route vehicle MEL
   and VPRL to Expeditionary Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander for final approval.
   Brief vehicle MEL and VPRL purpose and procedures to VCOs and VCNCOs, and to Unit
   Commanders as needed.
   2.24.9. Destroyed/Contaminated Vehicle Replacement. Vehicles may be destroyed or
   rendered unusable by conventional, chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons
   during combat operations. Rotate vehicles from lower to higher priority units to maintain
   base operations. Leasing may be required to fill shortages. Contact NAF or MAJCOM to
   obtain replacement vehicles if necessary.
Note: Contaminated vehicles can be deemed serviceable. Do not abandon or stop reporting
items contaminated. Follow guidance in paragraphs 2.30. and 2.31.
   2.24.10. Urgent Vehicle Authorizations for contingencies (See paragraph 4.24.13).

2.25. Reporting Requirements. Host MAJCOMs and other AF agencies require information
for decisions necessary to support a deployed unit.
   2.25.1. During the deployment phase, report capability to NAF and MAJCOM weekly or as
   directed. Send information copies to the main operating base and tenant organizations.
   Ensure Vehicle Management personnel at NAF and MAJCOM are aware of Situation Report
   (SITREP) inputs.
       2.25.1.1. SITREPs will be provided by classified message or e-mail to the combatant
       MAJCOM Commander, with information copies to the main operating base and tenant
       organizations.
       2.25.1.2. Total “Priority 1” and “Priority 2” vehicles assigned, total vehicle losses, and
       total vehicles Non-Mission Capable-Supply (NMCS) and Non-Mission Capable-
       Maintenance (NMCM). Use LIMS-EV Vehicle View to view up-to-date information
       (refer to Attachment 8).
       2.25.1.3. Facility, equipment, tools, technical data and part shortfalls.
       2.25.1.4. Personnel and skill shortages.
       2.25.1.5. For specific materiel management support difficulties requiring MAJCOM
       assistance, list vehicle registration number and type, part number, date parts ordered,
       requisition number, and status. MAJCOMs develop procedures for reporting vehicle
       status when repairs exceed local capability (including other military and contract
       sources).
   2.25.2. Manage fleet using LIMS-EV Vehicle View (refer to Chapter 4 and Attachment 8).
   Required documents are Ship, Salvage and Rotate Report; Newly Received Vehicle Report;
   and Host Base Transmit/Receive Report. Reports are due to the combatant MAJCOM not
   later than (NLT) the 10th of each month.
   2.25.3. The combatant MAJCOM Commander establishes additional reporting requirements
   and timelines.
   2.25.4. Reports Control Symbol. MAJCOMs and other AF agencies assign a reports control
   symbol to recurring and one-time reporting requirements.
2.26. Facilities.
   2.26.1. Facilities at forward operating locations may consist of host nation buildings,
   expandable structures, tents, or other appropriate mobile units. Vehicle Management
   facilities support PM&I, Special Inspections, unscheduled and intermediate levels of
   maintenance. Care needs to be taken in planning to include utilities (electric and water),
   wash facilities, exhaust ventilation and a compressed air source. For planning purposes,
   shop-working areas must accommodate approximately 5 percent of the fleet at one time in
   addition to ancillary functions. Refer to AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, for exact
   space authorization.
   2.26.2. The Vehicle Management facility is a component of the AS 159 (Basic
   Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) Order of Battle) BEAR Vehicle
   Maintenance/Operations UTC (XF*VC). It comes in two different configurations, either Air
   (XFAVC) or Surface (XFSVC). It is specifically for Vehicle Maintenance, Vehicle
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     61


   Operations and Management Operations. This UTC comes with one small shelter. For
   “maintenance” operations task two each 4K Dome UTCs (XF*AB - also comes in Air or
   Surface) along with AM-2 Matting (XF*AM) for flooring.
   2.26.3. Facilities should be accessible to the key functions supported, e.g., sortie-generating
   (flight line) and Aerial Port Operations Center (ATOC). It may be necessary to establish
   dispersed Vehicle Management locations.
   2.26.4. A separate facility for refueling vehicles is highly desired. Some contingency
   locations may not have the capability to establish a separate Refueling Maintenance facility.
   Those operating locations may be forced by necessity to combine maintenance operations.
   Combined maintenance operations can only be conducted under strict adherence to the
   following guidelines:
      2.26.4.1. Applies only to vehicles transporting diesel or aviation fuel.
      2.26.4.2. Properly train all assigned personnel in fuels management safety procedures.
      2.26.4.3. Maximum of one fuel truck inside shop at any time. Repairs and service will be
      limited to the actual prime mover only (chassis, exterior, drive train, etc.). Drain
      refueling system fuel storage tank as much as possible prior to entering shop to reduce
      mass spill potential. If the storage tank/system cannot be drained, ensure fuel system is
      completely closed and there are no leaks before entering shop. Comply with all
      installation spill containment procedures.
      2.26.4.4. Properly ground vehicle using the vehicle’s static discharge grounding reel.
      2.26.4.5. No smoking within 50 feet of vehicle or shop area.
      2.26.4.6. No spark or flame within 50 feet.
      2.26.4.7. A truck or trailer mounted refueling system will not be opened inside the main
      shop. Repairs and service will be limited to the actual prime mover only (chassis,
      exterior, drive train, etc.). Refueling system repairs must be accomplished in designated
      area/shop and will not be accomplished inside a combined Vehicle Management shop.
      Drain refueling system’s fuel storage tank as much as possible prior to entering shop to
      reduce mass spill potential. If the storage tank/system cannot be drained, ensure fuel
      system is completely closed and there are no leaks before entering shop. Comply with all
      installation spill containment procedures.
2.27. Tools and Equipment:
   2.27.1. UTC UFMXK, Vehicle Management Support Kit (see paragraph 2.15.2), is
   designed to support maintenance operations at a bare base location in the 1-30 day range. It
   is a light, lean, air transportable kit limited to one aircraft pallet position. Each UTC
   UFMXE (Wing Vehicle Management Element Team) tasked to support a bare base location
   should be equipped with one UFMXK. If not, immediately contact local TMF, ATOC,
   Reception Control Center, NAF and/or MAJCOM to determine the UTCs actual location. If
   known, the TCN expedites tracking efforts.
   2.27.2. UTC UFMXT is a heavier follow-on kit designed for arrival in the 30-60 day range.
   The kit contains tire machines, portable shop cranes, wheel dollies, hydraulic hose
 62                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   equipment, heavy jacks, etc. This kit will be immediately requested through NAF or
   MAJCOM if operating location is projected to remain open more than 30 days.
2.28. Parts Organization. Assorted vehicle parts may be on hand from vehicle TMSKs and/or
UTC UFMXK packages. It is imperative that all parts be inventoried and organized as soon as
possible. Shop equipment UTC should include cabinets and tools to expedite organization and
storage efforts. Shop efficiency and mission effectiveness will suffer if the type and quantity of
on-hand items are not known or readily available. Parts should also be secured at any time the
shop is unoccupied.
2.29. Organizational Maintenance. Increased level of operator maintenance is essential during
wartime. Although this expanded role of operation is viewed as a battlefield reality, the vehicle
mechanic will continue to perform the bulk of the intermediate maintenance workload. The
scope of increased operator maintenance and level of maintenance support (parts, tools, etc.) is
determined by the using organization’s VCO/VCNCO and the local VFM/VMS.
2.30. Mobile Maintenance. Several Mobile Maintenance vehicles may be needed depending
on size and scope of operation, mission, location and threat. Vehicles may be tasked to set-up as
a base of operations in an alternate location if main shop is destroyed. Vehicles must be
adequately set-up for any possible tasking.
   2.30.1. Expanded Mobile Maintenance. On-scene support is the goal of this concept. When
   implemented, the expanded Mobile Maintenance concept positions Vehicle Management
   personnel in key areas throughout the base to provide quicker response to major users as well
   as dispersed Vehicle Management assets. An example may be positioning a Mobile
   Maintenance vehicle at or near an aircraft ramp area in support of air freight or aircraft
   maintenance vehicles if a permanent outlying shop cannot be established and/or fully
   manned.
Note: Ensure Mobile Maintenance vehicle fuel tank level is always maintained above ½ tank.
Fuel shortages, enemy action or increased Force Protection Condition (FPCON) may interfere
with resupply actions.
2.31. Vehicle Recovery. Vehicle Operations normally provides this service though it may be
performed by Vehicle Management as locally determined. Ensure only qualified personnel
operate wreckers if local guidance requires Vehicle Management to perform this function.
2.32. Minor/Intermediate Maintenance. If a maintenance capability does not exist at
deployed locations, a minimum essential maintenance capability is established using the
following guidelines:
   2.32.1. PM&I and special inspections are performed only if the capability exists and
   operational mission tempo allows.
   2.32.2. To the maximum extent, unscheduled maintenance is accomplished at dispersed
   locations prior to the onset of hostilities.
   2.32.3. During contingency situations, repairs not affecting safe operation or operational
   capabilities may be deferred or waived. The senior on-site 2T3XX maintenance technician
   determines acceptable vehicle safety and serviceability standards.
   2.32.4. Extensive use of cannibalization may be required to compensate for parts shortages
   and the uncertainty of resupply.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                        63


2.33. Repairs Which Exceed Local Capability: Contact host MAJCOM for procedures when
repairs exceed local capability (including other military and contract sources).
2.34. Battle Damage Assessment. All assigned personnel must be familiar with vehicle battle
damage assessment. They must be able to respond and assess vehicle damage caused by air and
ground attacks. All battle damage assessments need to be reported through the appropriate
channels and relayed to the installation leadership. Fast and accurate damage assessment is the
key to critical decision making.
2.35. Vehicle Triage. Closely related to damage assessment, and done in conjunction with it, is
vehicle triage. Based normally on Priority I and II vehicle MELs, triage is accomplished as part
of the damage assessment process. Triage is the process of assessing damage, putting the
priority vehicles first, and doing cannibalization or whatever it takes to get those vehicles back in
commission. TO 36-1-191 standards may be waived as necessary during active conflict. Field
repairs may be the norm. Many vehicles can still do their job without a fender or non-critical
part/component. Refer to TO 36-1-181, Battlefield Recovery/Evacuation & Repair, for
additional reference information.
2.36. Destroyed Vehicle Replacement: Vehicles may be destroyed or rendered unusable by
conventional, chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons during combat. Rotate
vehicles from lower to higher priority authorizations to maintain base operations. Leasing may
be required to fill shortages. Contact host NAF or MAJCOM to obtain replacement vehicles if
necessary.
2.37. Maintaining Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances (OGMVC) in
Contingency Environments. All OGMVCs will be inspected and maintained to manufacturer
specifications. This ensures both safe operations and full life expectancy from AF equipment.
Owning organizations will have OGMVCs and non-SBSS (not on a vehicle account) reportable
LSVs maintained through a local vendor contract. If a local contract is not a viable option,
Vehicle Management will be responsible for maintaining these assets. For additional guidance
refer to paragraph 3.17
2.38. Continuity. Establish continuity books, folders, files, etc. as appropriate for the location.
Continuity is the key to seamless transition as personnel are replaced. Confusion over
local/unique Vehicle Management procedures can create delays in personnel departure, cause
inefficient repair operations and hamper mission accomplishment. Sample information can be
located       at      the      VM      CoP/AFCENT           Contingency         Units       folder:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-LG-AF-66-
22-2&Filter=OO-LG-AF-66.
2.39. Contaminated Environment Operations. Detailed guidance for Vehicle Management
operations in a CBRNE environment are contained in AFMAN 10-2503.
2.40. Contamination Control Team (CCT). Unit CCT activation is not normally required for
wartime immediate and operational levels of decontamination. All personnel are expected to
perform these levels of decontamination using the M291 and M295 decontamination kits or
expedient methods. Vehicle, equipment, munitions, aircraft maintenance and base populace
personnel are expected to execute immediate and operational decontamination on their assigned
assets. The installation commander will have to decide if the accomplishment of thorough
decontamination is likely to produce an operationally-beneficial result, and if the time and
 64                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


resources required conducting decontamination operations is worth the effort to increase
operational tempo or reduce the MOPP level. The installation commander will determine if
there is a need for an installation CCT or if those units identified to establish CCTs are required
to conduct those decontamination operations. For example, if there are a large number of
vehicles that must be decontaminated; the installation commander can decide to have the LRS
conduct the decontamination operation or set up a team from several base agencies with an LRS
representative to oversee the operation. Teams will receive just-in-time training from the
Readiness and Emergency Management Flight when the requirement for CCTs is established.
Additional CCT guidance is contained in AFMAN 10-2503.
2.41. Hazardous Material (HAZMAT). Coordinate with the Civil Engineering (CE)
Environmental Section and Base Supply for the purchase of HAZMAT and waste storage
containers if the site is projected to remain open more than 30 days. Also coordinate procedures
for collection and disposal of hazardous waste with the CE Environmental Section. Download
Material Safety Data Sheets for HAZMAT used in the work center from the website:
http://www.msdssearch.com.
2.42. Forward Vehicle Deployment. Forward vehicle deployment refers to moving vehicles
from one forward operating location to new or captured bases. The unit may have minimal
response time to meet forward deployment tasking(s). New or captured bases will be operating
with minimal support functions. It is imperative that the best vehicles and equipment are
forward deployed. To ensure full MC; the following vehicle shipment standards apply:
   2.42.1. Perform an LTI and service all fluid systems. Vehicle must be safe and serviceable.
   Vehicle must be able to perform assigned mission with no or very minimal support. Vehicle
   will be shipped with an assembled spare wheel/tire and all applicable TOs. Commercially
   designed light and medium duty vehicles and military designed prime movers must be
   equipped with lug wrench(es), jack and jack handle.
   2.42.2. Assemble TMSK as directed. See paragraph 2.14 for TMSK shipment guidance.
   2.42.3. Secure OLVIMS data, TOs and spare key(s) in cab or operator’s compartment.
   Shipping base will maintain copy of historical data until gaining location accepts and loads
   vehicle. If shipped data and/ or keys are not readily visible, identify location with a
   prominently placed label.
   2.42.4. Contact NAF or MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs for guidance if unable to
   meet the above standards by the shipment deadline.
Section 2F—Reconstitution
Note: “Reconstitution” in the context of this publication refers to drawdown and base closure
operations after hostilities have ended. Reconstitution includes activities at home station and the
deployed location.
2.43. Personnel (Home Station).
   2.40.1. Training. Evaluate training status after personnel have returned to home station.
   Initiate training for any appropriate areas. Ensure all personnel supporting OPLAN and AEF
   tasking(s) can fulfill MISCAP requirements.
   2.40.2. Reporting. IAW AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS).
   Accurately report status of all personnel UTCs in the Air and Space Expeditionary Force
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    65


   Reporting Tool (ART). Ensure training status and skill level concerns are reflected in the
   comments section. Reporting in SORTS does not fulfill ART reporting responsibilities.
2.44. Vehicles (Deployed Location):
   2.44.1. Accountability. Maintain accountability of all vehicles that have been redeployed
   from closing locations. AF, NAF or MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs will provide
   redeployment/ shipment guidance. Provide current shipping status to NAF and MAJCOM
   Vehicle Management Staffs as required.
   2.44.2. Disposition Authority (USAFCENT AOR Only). Deployed sites do not have local
   authority to salvage vehicles. For non-critical vehicles that are replacement eligible or have
   exceeded the one-time repair limit, this decision is left to USAFCENT/A4RV. All other
   disposition decisions will be made by the MAJCOM. To request salvage instructions units
   need to submit an Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 91, Limited Technical
   Inspection-Motor           Vehicle,          to          USAFCENT/A4RV,                e-mail:
   AFCENTA4RVShawDistro@afcent.af.mil.
   2.44.3. Defense Logistics Agency – Disposition Services (DLA-DS) Procedures. Contact
   Regional or Zone DLA-DS Manager for processing guidance after a vehicle has been
   approved for DLA-DS. Notify NAF or MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs if unable to
   locate a Regional or Zone DLA-DS Manager for the current theater of operations. If DLA-
   DS representation is not able to assist with disposal, the MAJCOM or NAF Vehicle
   Management Staffs will direct disposal IAW DOD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition
   Manual, DLA-DS 18 August 1997, Chapter 8, Abandonment or Destruction (A/D). Some
   general guidance is listed below:
      2.44.3.1. Property cannot be A/D without proper confirmation that necessary Defense
      Militarization (DEMIL) has been completed and certified. DOD 4160.21-M outlines
      DEMIL procedures and certification official criteria. Some A/D Officer and witnessing
      party guidance is listed below.
          2.44.3.1.1. The A/D Officer may not be the Accountable Officer, responsible
          Property Officer or serve as a witnessing party to A/D actions.
          2.44.3.1.2. The witnessing party shall attest to having observed actual
          accomplishment of A/D action. The witnessing party will normally not be involved
          in the receipt, classification or accounting of property.
      2.44.3.2. The "accountable activity" shall document all actions on or attached to, DD
      Form 1348-1A. The 1348-1A will be used to credit the appropriate account.
      2.44.3.3. VM&A personnel will fax, mail or e-mail scanned copy of DLA-DS issued
      1348-1A (for each approved asset) to Langley AFB.
      2.44.3.4. Refer to DOD 4160.21-M and https://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/ for
      more guidance.
   2.44.4. Vehicles Sent to DLA-DS (USAFCENT AOR Only). All SBSS transactions for
   the AOR are processed at Langley AFB. Before HQ ACC will salvage a vehicle in SBSS
   they require a signed 1348-1A for their records, and this form will have to be generated
   locally. Once the form is filled out and signed by all parties, fax to DSN 965-2901 or scan it
   and email to acc.a4tvf.swa@langley.af.mil.

       will check all fluid levels IAW applicable operator/owner’s manual or TOs. General-
       purpose vehicle operators will check and service fuel, engine oil, and the windshield
       washer reservoir. All other fluid levels, i.e., coolant, automatic transmission, power
       steering, brake and batteries are checked by the vehicle operators and reported to Vehicle
       Management for servicing when required. Vehicle Management checks non-operator
       serviced automatic and manual transmissions and differential fluid levels at PM&I
       intervals. Additionally, for special purpose vehicles, vehicle operators check and service
       hydraulic fluid reservoirs on special units or attachments.
Notes:
1. Some vehicle types do not require a documented “full” serviceability/functional check daily,
and/or before use. However, vehicle operators will perform a visual inspection or “walk-around”
prior to use. The vehicle operator will ensure the vehicle does not have unreported damage,
visually low/flat tires, fluid leaks or puddles forming under the vehicle.
2. Vehicle operators are responsible for checking and servicing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)
levels for vehicles that require that product.
       3.19.1.2. Tire pressure checks/adjustments will be accomplished by the 10th of each
       month and documented on the applicable Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble
       Report form. For vehicles equipped with electronic Tire Pressure Monitoring System
       (TPMS), vehicle operators will perform visual inspection of tires to ensure proper
       operation of TPMS dash indicator and check for unusual wear or damage. Refer to
       Section 7B—Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report Forms for further
       guidance.
Note: During the monthly tire pressure check/adjustment, operators will check spare tire
pressure and adjust as needed (if applicable).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   79


     3.19.1.3. Keep vehicles clean at all times to include the interior. Vehicle management
     will not accept dirty vehicles. If excessively dirty vehicles are towed in, the using
     organization must clean the vehicle prior to being accepted in the CSC.
     3.19.1.4. Keep tires properly inflated and change flat tires. Operators may request
     assistance from Vehicle Management for removal and installation of outsized tires.
     3.19.1.5. Operators assist tire shop personnel in the removal and installation of tires on
     vehicles when vehicles are taken to Vehicle Management for tire-only repair work.
     3.19.1.6. Unit VCO/VCNCO will ensure adequate assembled spare wheels/tires and
     tools are on hand to support their requirements. Spare wheel/tires received with new
     vehicles will be given to the using organization. If no spare is included with a vehicle as
     original equipment and a unit requires a spare, or if a unit requires more spares, then the
     unit purchases the initial requirement, and vehicle maintenance covers the cost of
     replacement tires after the original purchase.
     3.19.1.7. Tighten loose nuts, bolts and screws, install light bulbs and windshield wiper
     blades (with CSC assistance).
     3.19.1.8. Using organizations are responsible for purchasing wire ropes/cables on
     assigned vehicles equipped with these items. Operators of these vehicles are responsible
     for replacing defective wire ropes/cables. Operators will notify and provide
     recertification paperwork to VM&A as soon as possible after making the replacement.
     They also make adjustments to mechanisms affecting operating characteristics of the unit
     (for example, crane and dozer clutches and brakes, power control units, shoes, deflectors,
     etc). Inspect and grease vehicles as required by the TO or manual, and report any
     problems to vehicle management.
     3.19.1.9. Fire truck operators maintain and replace accessory firefighting equipment such
     as power saws, air breathing apparatus, smoke extractors, ladders, portable fire
     extinguishers, pike poles, prying or cutting tools, nonattached hoses, rescue and first-aid
     equipment and portable lights or lighting systems even if equipment is shipped as part of
     the vehicle purchase.
     3.19.1.10. Medical personnel maintain and replace non-vehicular medical equipment
     such as life sustaining or support equipment, oxygen systems, rescue, and first-aid
     equipment, even if they are shipped as part of the vehicle purchase.
     3.19.1.11. Organizations assigned tracked vehicles procure and replace track shoes.
     3.19.1.12. Base communications or contract maintenance (arranged for by the using
     organization) repairs two-way mission radio and intercom systems, even if these are
     shipped as part of the vehicle purchase.
     3.19.1.13. Maintenance of locally procured vehicle-mounted equipment and attachments.
     Organizations must coordinate with the VFM/VMS before vehicle-mounted equipment
     and attachments are acquired. Associated O&M costs are paid by the owning
     organization. This topic will be briefed at VCO/VCNCO meetings.
     3.19.1.14. Include maintenance and parts publications in the request to locally purchase
     equipment to be supported by Vehicle Management. Send the publications to Vehicle
     Management after the equipment is received. The VFM/VMS do not assume
 80                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       management responsibility for locally purchased equipment without the necessary
       technical data if, in their opinion, inspection, servicing, adjustment or repair work cannot
       be performed properly.
       3.19.1.15. Buying jacks, jack handles, lug wrenches, wax, highway warning kits, spare
       tires, wheels, tire chains, fire extinguishers, wheel chocks, placards, shoring, dunnage,
       lubricants, lubrication equipment, starting fluid, windshield washer fluid, special tools,
       and accessories to meet operating requirements.
Note: When equipment operators are responsible for lubricating equipment before and during
use, Vehicle Management will advise operators regarding the lubricant to be used, tools needed
and frequency of lubrication. The using organization procures required tools and lubricants, and
is responsible for replacing equipment and special tools lost, worn or damaged beyond
economical repair.
   3.19.2. Vehicle Discrepancies and Maintenance Turn-In.
       3.19.2.1. Vehicle operators record all discrepancies as they perform inspections, or when
       discovered in the appropriate section of the applicable Operator's Inspection Guide and
       Trouble Report. All non-safety related discrepancies/items will be reported to Vehicle
       Management within one normal duty day.
       3.19.2.2. When operators discover discrepancies that can adversely affect the safety of
       personnel or the operation of vehicles/equipment (as referenced in paragraphs 3.19.2.2.1
       thru 3.19.2.2.7 below) the operator will discontinue use, record discrepancy on the
       appropriate Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report and report the discrepancy
       to Vehicle Management as soon as possible. If the discrepancy occurs outside Vehicle
       Management duty hours, discontinue vehicle use, record discrepancy and notify Vehicle
       Management the next duty day. Discrepancies for the following items are considered
       “safety related” and reported to Vehicle Management immediately:
           3.19.2.2.1. Tires or brakes.
           3.19.2.2.2. Steering mechanisms.
           3.19.2.2.3. Operating levers controlling power transmission, hoisting, dumping and
           tripping devices. Warning lights such as turn signals, brake lights, emergency and
           rotating flashers.
           3.19.2.2.4. Headlights, reflectors and clearance lights (unless the vehicle or
           equipment is not used during hours of darkness and restrictions are identified by a
           decal).
           3.19.2.2.5. Windshield wipers and defrosters (when weather conditions require them
           to be operated).
           3.19.2.2.6. Other similar safety and warning equipment and devices peculiar to
           special purpose units.
           3.19.2.2.7. Any other condition reasonably deemed a safety hazard.
Note: The above list is not all-inclusive or may not cover all vehicle type. Vehicle operators
should contact Vehicle Management if there are any questions concerning vehicle discrepancies
and/or safety.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    81


   3.19.3. For nuclear tasked units, the using organization will ensure nuclear certification
   status and configuration of vehicles identified on the MNCL prior to the vehicle being used
   for operations involving nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon systems. Refer to AFI 63-125,
   Nuclear Certification Program.
   3.19.4. CES Responsibilities. Civil Engineering (CE) personnel will:
       3.19.4.1. Change the broom, filter bags, skid plates and deflectors on all sweepers.
       Maintain correct adjustment of brooms, deflectors and caster wheels on all sweepers.
       Change the moldboard cutting edges and shoes on earth-moving and snow-removal
       equipment. Sharpen and change blades and deflectors on grass-cutting equipment.
       Conduct or arrange for weight and dielectric tests and provide documentation to VM&A.
       Replace wire ropes/cables on assigned equipment. The unit VCO/VCNCO or primary
       operator will notify and provide recertification paperwork to VM&A as soon as possible
       after making the replacement. The user and Materiel Management Flight ensure these
       requirements get requisitioning priorities according to the mission being supported.
Note: The using organization funds for and buys these items and associated hardware such as
nuts and bolts.
       3.19.4.2. Maintain installed equipment related to the normal CE function, such as stoves,
       refrigerators, heaters, air-conditioners, sanitary facilities, similar CE items mounted in
       government-owned trailers (including house trailers) and truck cargo compartments.
       3.19.4.3. Fund for and maintain real and non-real property equipment assigned on the
       CES Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) and tenant equipment assigned to
       CES according to AFI 25-201 agreements. This includes mobile (wheeled or skid-
       mounted) engine-driven utility-type generator sets, pumps, air compressors, liquid gas
       generators, house and office trailers, and so forth, to which USAF/AFEMS vehicle
       registration numbers have not been assigned.
       3.19.4.4. Store and inspect seasonal equipment not in possession of Vehicle Management
       every month during off-season months, using the applicable Operator’s Inspection Guide
       and Trouble Report. Operationally check motorized equipment fully during this
       inspection.

Section 3C—Organization

3.20. Organization of Vehicle Management. Organize the Vehicle Management activity IAW
AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. Follow the guidance in AFI 38-101 if directed to contract
Vehicle Management (See Figure 3.1 for a typical shop organization chart). All Vehicle
Management functions are consolidated under the VFM/VMS. AF/A4LE is the approval
authority for requests to deviate from consolidation.
Exception: Mobile units with organic maintenance capability, having separate Vehicle
Management facilities, sufficient manpower and an organizational structure, usually including
VM&A and Materiel Control, maintain their own equipment when in garrison. These units may
be consolidated under the installation VFM/VMS; however, they do not require AF/A4LE
approval to operate independently.
 82                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


3.21. Maintenance Work Centers. Establish work centers as focal points for the labor, parts
and tools needed to do the job. Determine the number of work centers by the type and quantity
of vehicles to be serviced and the location of shop buildings. The work center supervisor is
responsible for all work done in the work center.
3.22. Administration Section. If applicable, the administration section performs administrative
functions as directed by the VFM/VMS.
3.23. CSC. CSC is the POC between the vehicle user and Vehicle Management. CSC
technicians debrief vehicle operators and perform incoming inspections on vehicles for
determining maintenance requirements. The VFM/VMS determines (in an OI) the extent of
completed work to be inspected, what types of repairs and services are inspected, and by whom.
The skill level of personnel, the vehicle complexity and critical mission support are determining
factors. Generally, all completed PM&I, steering and brake repairs receive an outgoing
inspection. The technician in charge of this section is well experienced in all aspects of Vehicle
Management. In this section, consideration of the needs of the using organization is given to
avoid unnecessary vehicle downtime and increase MC time by providing service within the
shortest turn-around time possible. Quality and service is the byword of this section; it must be
readily accessible and recognizable to the customer. VFM/VMS ensures this section provides
timely service. When necessary, personnel from other sections are used during peak workload
periods. Specific responsibilities of CSC include the following:
   3.23.1. Provide fast and dependable service to the user.
   3.23.2. Debrief vehicle operators.
   3.23.3. Verify malfunctions and perform a complete inspection using diagnostic test
   equipment when required. Use AF Form 4355 to document vehicle’s condition.
   3.23.4. Determine if the malfunction is a result of suspected accident or abuse, and if so, take
   proper action; “Waiver” only non-essential work. Using the appropriate series Operator’s
   Inspection Guide and Trouble Report as a permanent waiver card is optional at the discretion
   of the VFM/VMS. Alternatives for tracking waivered items will be established using a
   computer listing, card file index, etc.
   3.23.5. Delay work when necessary, only when safety defects are not involved and when
   deficiencies will not cause further damage to or problems with the vehicle. Complete
   delayed/deferred work as soon as is practical, i.e., parts are on hand and vehicle is in the
   shop.
   3.23.6. Perform minor maintenance as required. Portable test equipment and a small
   working/bench stock enhance the CSC operation. The CSC and outlying work centers use
   AF Form 1827, Minor Maintenance Work Order, for repairs that take no more than two total
   labor hours time for all jobs required and requires only the installation of low-cost stock
   parts. Do not use the AF Form 1827 for PM&I, Special inspections, TCTOs, SBs and OTIs.
   The AF Form 1827 will not be used when the total repair time (including awaiting
   maintenance, awaiting parts and actual labor) exceeds two hours. A normal work order will
   be processed to capture NMC downtime exceeding the two-hour limit. The AF Form 1827
   will not be used to record multiple jobs on the same vehicle during the same repair period.
   Each line on the AF Form 1827 is interpreted as a separate work order in OLVIMS.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    83


  3.23.7. Vehicle and Equipment Work Order and Vehicle Processing (Main Shop). When the
  vehicle operator reports to the CSC/shop with the vehicle inspection guide, the operator stays
  with the vehicle until the inspection and debriefing are complete. Operators will perform
  required operator care (refer to paragraph 3.19), to include interior and exterior cleanliness,
  before turning the vehicle over to the CSC. Processing steps essentially follow the pattern
  below (the VFM/VMS may adjust procedures for vehicle in processing as necessary to meet
  local conditions and mission):
     3.23.7.1. Using the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form along with the
     AF Form 4355, the inspector makes a complete inspection to verify the vehicle's
     malfunctions, validate waived items and to ensure repairs that effect safe vehicle
     operation are addressed. CSC personnel use the proper diagnostic and test equipment to
     identify and isolate the malfunctions when required.
     3.23.7.2. The CSC determines if there are any delayed/deferred or scheduled inspections
     due; installs delayed parts that have been received, workload permitting.
     3.23.7.3. The CSC will initiate an AF Form 1823/-1 if the vehicle requires any one of the
     following:
         3.23.7.3.1. PM&I, Special Inspections, TCTO, SB or OTI are required/due.
         3.23.7.3.2. Repair action takes two or more hours to complete.
         3.23.7.3.3. Vehicle/equipment NMC downtime has been longer than two hours (refer
         to paragraph 3.35.)
         3.23.7.3.4. If required part used is other than low-cost bench/working stock.
     3.23.7.4. The CSC enters the actual/suspected malfunctions on the AF Form 4355, to
     include all tests that have been performed, and the direct labor-hours spent to perform the
     inspections and tests, and forward (and AF Form 1823/-1 if processed in the CSC) to
     VM&A.
     3.23.7.5. The "look phase" of PM&I, lubrications and oil filter changes may best be
     performed by the CSC section. Enter labor-hours for this work on the AF Form 1823/-1.
     3.23.7.6. The VFM/VMS determines which outgoing quality inspections will be done.
     3.23.7.7. Perform road tests as needed. Ensure road test locations are approved in
     advance through SFS and wing safety.

Figure 3.1. Sample Vehicle Management Organization Chart




Notes:
1. Except where approved by AF/A4LE, consolidate all Vehicle Management functions under
the VFM/VMS.
Exception: Mobility units with organic maintenance capability; i.e., RED HORSE, ASOCS, etc.
2. Refueling Maintenance (RFM) is a sub-section of Fuels Management, however Vehicle
Management has ultimate fleet management and repair reporting responsibilities of refueling
vehicle assets and may assign 2T3XX technicians to Refueling Maintenance for chassis
maintenance and/or Fuels Management liaison duties. Refer to paragraph 1.19. for information
concerning future pumping system maintenance reintegration.
3.24. Tire Repair Section:
   3.24.1. Repair all vehicle tires.
   3.24.2. Maintain all assigned tire repair and servicing equipment in a safe operating
   condition.
   3.24.3. Ensure strict compliance with safety standards.
   3.24.4. Personnel assigned to the Tire Shop will be thoroughly trained in all aspects of tire
   inspection and repair procedures. Document training certification on AF Form 55, Employee
   Safety and Health Record, civilian employees and training records for military personnel.
   Copies of TOs 36-1-191 and 36Y32-1-142, Organizational, Direct Support, and General
   Support Maintenance Care, Maintenance and Repair of Pneumatic Tires and Inner Tubes,
   will be available in the Tire Shop. Personnel must be familiar with the instructions outlined
   in these publications. Exercise extreme caution when working with split-rim wheels. Refer
   to AFOSHSTD 91-20 for additional guidance.
   3.24.5. The vehicle operator has primary responsibility for removing and installing mounted
   tires; however, Vehicle Management personnel remove and install mounted tires once the
   vehicle has been accepted into the shop, unless it has been previously agreed upon that the
   operator will provide assistance.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     85


3.25. Battery Shop.
   3.25.1. Maintain an adequate stock of batteries to give quick service.
   3.25.2. Test, fill and charge all batteries.
   3.25.3. Keep all batteries under lock and key to prevent theft.
   3.25.4. Keep all assigned equipment, such as battery chargers, tools and safety equipment in
   good operating condition. Comply with all applicable safety standards.
   3.25.5. Refer to AFOSHSTDs 91-20, 91-66, General Industrial Operations, and 91-501, Air
   Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard, for additional guidance.
3.26. Shop Facilities:
   3.26.1. The AF has a large investment in Vehicle Management shops because the majority of
   intermediate maintenance is done in these fixed facilities. Productivity is increased by using
   new methods and procedures to get the most out of personnel, tools and space. For example,
   to have good workflow, locate VM&A and the CSC in places that are easy for customers to
   reach. Ideally, related work centers are located close together.
   3.26.2. Use AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements, as a guide to compute total space
   needs to provide adequate facilities, to identify deficiencies in the shop, and as the basis to
   initiate corrective action.
   3.26.3. Send requests for real property construction, modification or changes to the CES on
   AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request.
   3.26.4. Send requests for maintenance or repair of real property facilities to the CES.
   3.26.5. Activities that do not have standard AF shops develop a plan to use the shop areas to
   gain the most efficiency and productivity. The VFM/VMS consider the following in their
   plans:
       3.26.5.1. Type, size and number of vehicles to be worked on.
       3.26.5.2. Type of work and service to be done.
       3.26.5.3. Time needed to do a job.
       3.26.5.4. Space required for each type of repair.
       3.26.5.5. Locations of water, air, electrical outlets and exhaust fume ventilators.
       3.26.5.6. Location of shop tools, such as hydraulic floor jacks, transmission jacks,
       portable lubrication equipment, etc.
       3.26.5.7. Locations of COPARS, VM&A, CSC and Materiel Control are as close to each
       other as possible. Be sure that the CSC section is easy for vehicle users to find.
       3.26.5.8. Size of the shop parking area.
       3.26.5.9. Location of vehicle publications.
3.27. VM Training Leader. The Vehicle Management Training Leader develops and
administers a training program as outlined in Chapter 6 and AFI 36-2201.
 86                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


3.28. VM&A. VM&A is the focal point for determining repairs and authorizing the expenditure
of manpower and material through the work centers. It is also the focal point for the movement
of vehicles and equipment to and from the work centers and for commercial contract repair
activities. VM&A will be accessible and recognizable to its customers.
   3.28.1. VM&A ensures the efficient and economical operation of the base vehicle fleet.
   3.28.2. VM&A oversees the VCP, Fleet Analysis and vehicle management/maintenance data
   integrity.
   3.28.3. VM&A personnel will use LIMS-EV Vehicle View or CRIS Tool for hand receipts,
   the VDQD for data integrity and the CRIS Tool for requesting SBSS transactions. Specific
   responsibilities and procedures are outlined in Chapter 4.
3.29. Work Center Supervisors. Work center supervisors are responsible for:
   3.29.1. Coordinating with VM&A to ensure priorities are met and maintenance tasks are
   completed on time.
   3.29.2. Assigning work to personnel commensurate with their skills.
   3.29.3. Ensuring that proper tools and equipment are readily available and serviceable, and
   that subordinate personnel are properly trained in their use. The supervisor reports shortages
   and deficient equipment to the VFM/VMS.
   3.29.4. Ensuring technicians comply with safety procedures and technical data.
Note: Complying with technical data does not mean an open book reference for each repair task.
It does require the technician to be familiar with the procedures for each job. Complex repair
tasks, performance specifications, torque ratings, special tolerance adjustments and so forth, do
require reference to technical data, and, in some cases, repeated reference at the job location.
Technical data for vehicles or vehicular equipment serviced must be current. Any of the
following data sources, in printed or digital form, are acceptable: TOs; commercial manuals,
printed material, microfilm or software provided by or procured from the asset manufacturer;
commercially procured after-market parts and repair manuals, such as Chilton® Manuals; or
digitized technical data such as Mitchell1® or its equivalent.
   3.29.5. Inspecting incoming vehicles and equipment not processed through CSC. The
   supervisor coordinates with VM&A if additional repairs not listed on the AF Form 1823/-1
   are required and revises the Estimated Time In-Commission (ETIC) as needed.
   3.29.6. Inspecting repaired vehicles and equipment to ensure all vehicles are in a safe
   serviceable condition.
   3.29.7. Briefing newly assigned personnel.
   3.29.8. Assigning personnel to duty positions to ensure full use and progression
   opportunities.
   3.29.9. Determining the most efficient and economical means of returning vehicles to
   service. The supervisor will carefully consider the repair or replacement of individual
   assemblies or subassemblies and components to make effective use of resources. In addition,
   adhere to any safety and serviceability standards, and avoid “over-maintaining” the vehicle.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       87


   3.29.10. Informing VM&A of the requirement for more work so that maximum productivity
   may be obtained from assigned personnel.
   3.29.11. Checking with Materiel Control on parts requirements and availability.
   3.29.12. Accounting for labor hours for work center.
   3.29.13. Determining training needs, sending training requirements to the VFM/VMS and
   assisting in OJT.
   3.29.14. Ensuring parts received for vehicles during the work phase are properly protected
   and not improperly stored on the vehicle’s seat or other soft trim.
   3.29.15. Ensuring vehicles are properly prepared and maintained for storage when placed in
   NMCS status (see TO 36-1-191).
   3.29.16. Assisting VM&A by providing accurate data/information in order to properly
   complete and transmit DRs.

Section 3D—Principles

3.30. Cannibalization Rules. The VFM/VMS use cannibalization primarily to meet mission
goals. Cannibalization action is documented according to Chapter 7 and proper cost accounting
will be done.
   3.30.1. MAJCOM or WR-ALC may direct the repair of critical vehicles pending disposition.
   Cannibalization of the major components or assemblies of critical vehicles pending
   disposition instructions must be approved by the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff.
   3.30.2. The AFEMS (C001) provides an on-line query, with the exception management code
   ID (IIEM), to determine the vehicle criticality. A critical vehicle is identified by the critical
   code “C”.
   3.30.3. The    Vehicle     Management       Index     File     (VMIF)     (located     at:
   https://webapps.robins.af.mil/vehicle/vmif/) also identifies vehicles as critical or non-
   critical.
3.31. Contract Operated Vehicle Management Activities. All PWSs for vehicle management
should be performance-based. Vehicle management functional managers at all levels should use
this AFI (citing specific chapters and/or paragraphs) as the basis for developing a PWS. Also,
Chapter 9 should be reviewed for additional information concerning contract activities.
3.32. Maintenance Priorities. Each Vehicle Management activity applies priorities to support
the mission and customer needs as follows:
   3.32.1. Routine Priority: Vehicle Management normally assigns "Routine" priority to all
   vehicles, regardless of type or use. However, vehicles requiring scheduled maintenance
   actions (e.g., PMI, TCTO, Special Inspections or OTI) will receive preferential action over
   routine non-scheduled maintenance actions.
   3.32.2. Red (Urgent) Priority: Vehicle Management assigns “Red” priority when one or
   more of the following conditions apply:
 88                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       3.32.2.1. A unit is below the established MEL for a particular vehicle/equipment type,
       further loss of vehicles or equipment will degrade mission support and other base assets
       cannot fulfill the need of a particular vehicle. Refer to paragraph 3.32.5.
       3.32.2.2. A special project requires a certain type of vehicle in service.
       3.32.2.3. Severe weather or other natural circumstances create a need for certain types of
       vehicles.
   3.32.3. Installed emergency warning lights, military radios or other such accessories do not
   automatically cause a vehicle to be a higher priority. Like and possibly dissimilar vehicles
   without such accessories are generally sufficient to perform the mission until the equipped
   vehicle is returned to service.
   3.32.4. When a replacement vehicle is temporarily given to a user, the prime vehicle
   receives a routine maintenance priority.
   3.32.5. Direct Mission Support Vehicles/Equipment: Vehicles and equipment which are
   used to support combat, tactical or airfield operations (including but not limited to “Sortie
   Generating” and “Sortie Sustaining” vehicles and equipment listed in Tables 2.1 and 2.2).
   MELs for these vehicles will be developed and verified each year between using
   organizations and the vehicle management activity. The MEL shows the number of vehicles
   or equipment, by authorized type and any substitutes, which can be in the shop at one time
   and not seriously affect the user's mission.
       3.32.5.1. The VFM/VMS review the vehicle MEL for maintenance priorities and for
       backfilling primary vehicles when vehicles are in Vehicle Management. Questions on
       the proposed vehicle MEL and any problems in maintaining the levels are resolved with
       the using organization before the final publication of the list. Normally, it is not possible
       to have 100 percent of any vehicle type in an organization listed as MEL. Allowance
       must be made for scheduled maintenance, normal breakdowns, etc. The vehicle MEL is
       presented to the MSG Commander or equivalent for approval. This list serves as the
       vehicle maintenance priority repair list.
       3.32.5.2. Vehicle Management ensures that minimum essential vehicle levels and
       mission needs are met. This may require withdrawing vehicles from organizations
       currently above their MEL or with lower priorities. Within Vehicle Management, it may
       be necessary to consolidate the work force, work overtime, cannibalize parts, delay work
       or make temporary repairs to return priority vehicles to service.
3.33. Vehicle Modification Policy. Vehicle modifications are any alterations to a vehicle that
will change the original configuration or impact the primary structure, hydraulic power system,
load-bearing capacity, steering, braking capability, positive control features, lifting, power train
or restraint systems of a vehicle.
   3.33.1. Modification request should only be forwarded when the customer needs cannot
   otherwise be met; either through vehicle rotation or leasing.
Note: Secondary restraint systems (airbags) will not be disabled unless approved by the
National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). Wing and MAJCOM Safety
and Vehicle Management will validate requests for such action prior to submission to the
NHTSA,.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      89


   3.33.2. All requests for modifications will be submitted to VM&A and routed through the
   MAJCOM Vehicle Management function for appropriate Air Logistics Center (ALC)
   approval. The prime ALC ensures the configuration changes to special mounted equipment
   is documented in appropriate technical data and that necessary adjustments are made to
   logistics support plans.
       3.33.2.1. Permanent local modifications to special mounted equipment are usually not
       approved unless required to correct isolated problems.
   3.33.3. All modification correspondence/approvals will be maintained in the permanent
   portion of the vehicle historical record.
   3.33.4. Additional guidance is provided in AFI 91-103 for nuclear certified vehicles.
Note: Unapproved modifications to nuclear certified vehicles will probably result in the vehicle
being classified as “restricted use”.
3.34. Vehicle “Add-On” Equipment Policy. Adding manufactures’ optional equipment or
after-market optional part/accessory to meet certain operational needs is not considered a
modification if the vehicle is still used for its original purpose and can be returned to original
condition within a reasonable amount of time (i.e., 24 hours) with little or no expense.
   3.34.1. Generally, an add-on will not change the original configuration, or impact the
   primary structure, hydraulic power system, load-bearing capacity, steering, braking
   capability, positive control features, steering, lifting, power train or load carrying/restraint
   systems of a vehicle. Examples of vehicle add-on equipment include (but is not limited to):
   light bar/emergency lights, siren, two-way radio, pintle hook and trailer-hitch assemblies.
   3.34.2. Requesting organizations must submit written add-on equipment justification to
   Vehicle Management. Requests must address the extent of the proposed work, impact if
   denied and availability of funds for contracting the equipment installation.
       3.34.2.1. Organizational justification request for add-on equipment to government
       controlled rented or leased assets will also be sent to Vehicle Management. If approved,
       VM&A will submit to leasing agency (i.e., GSA) to obtain approval for installation of
       add-on equipment to vehicle. Leasing agency's concurrence or non-concurrence will be
       maintained in the requesting organization’s vehicle control records in VM&A.
   3.34.3. Add-on equipment will not be installed prior to VFM/VMS approval.
       3.34.3.1. If approved, when workload and resources permit, Vehicle Management may
       elect to install these items.
   3.34.4. Vehicles will be placed back into original configuration if vehicle is rotated/shipped,
   and at using unit’s cost.
   3.34.5. Add-on equipment will be assigned vehicle equivalents and captured in OLVIMS for
   government owned assets. Vehicle Fleet Managers will consider the following guidance
   when deciding whether to claim additional equivalents for locally added or factory-installed
   optional equipment:
       3.34.5.1. Items are only claimed once, regardless of how many are on the vehicle.
       Examples are pintle hooks on bobtails, roof mounted air conditioning units on buses, etc.
 90                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       3.34.5.2. Some examples of items not to count as add-on equipment are standard
       (original equipment) shelving, bins, flashing lights, additional wiring on ambulances,
       standard plows and blades on snow plows and graders, standard AM/FM radios, anti-lock
       brakes, air bags, mud flaps and electronic fuel injection systems.
   3.34.6. Any requests for add-ons to nuclear certified vehicles will be routed to the Base
   Safety Office for approval. For informational purposes, all add-on requests will be courtesy
   copied to MAJCOM vehicle management prior to approval. Additional guidance for
   modifications of nuclear certified vehicles reference AFI 91-103 and AFI 91-107.
   3.34.7. File approved authorization to install add-on equipment in the permanent portion of
   the vehicle record jacket or scanned copy in equivalent electronic file.
3.35. NMC Hours. NMC hours start on the date and time entered on the Operator’s Inspection
Guide and Trouble Report (the date/time that the discrepancy is reported to Vehicle
Management) or when a request for mobile maintenance (roadside) support is received.
   3.35.1. When initiating a work order, the CSC will adjust the NMC start time to account for
   actual downtime which began with any mobile maintenance or wrecker support request. As
   needed, adjustments will be coordinated with VM&A and/or Vehicle Operations Dispatch to
   confirm the operator’s original request for repair/wrecker assistance.
   3.35.2. Vehicles awaiting accident, abuse and repair decisions/repairs will draw downtime.
   3.35.3. Upon VFM/VMS request, VM&A provides an NMC report reflecting hours
   controlled by Vehicle Management (in-house) and repair hours not controlled by Vehicle
   Management (contract, warranty, etc.).
   3.35.4. NMC time ends after completion and verification of all maintenance actions.
   3.35.5. To support MAJCOM management programs, separate MC percentage goals can be
   established to apply as a metric (management indicator). This may be by major vehicle type
   or overall fleet.
       3.35.5.1. Exclude reporting NMC hours for excess vehicles in status code D, E, I, or N
       and ensure they are opened as “4000” work orders. Repairs of seasonal equipment
       during the off-season such as snow removal, deicing equipment and lawnmowers will
       also be opened as “4000” work orders and will not report NMC hours. Refer to
       paragraph 4.28 for definition of status codes mentioned above.
       3.35.5.2. Exclude reporting NMC hours for vehicles owned or under the control of the
       Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). These vehicles are placed in fleets around the
       AF to collect O&M data in an effort to develop and perfect new technologies for AF use.
       Significant NMC hours are expected during these tests.
   3.35.6. NMCS vehicles are not normally repaired until all the parts have been received,
   unless approved by the VFM/VMS. For example, an engine received for a crash fire fighting
   vehicle may be installed even though a required converter has not been delivered. After the
   engine is installed, the status of the vehicle reverts to NMCS. The supply priority for the
   converter is not downgraded.
Note: Vehicles on NMCS status will be prime candidates for corrosion control repairs. Remove
the vehicle from NMCS status in OLVIMS only until the corrosion repairs are completed, then
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      91


return the vehicle to NMCS status until the parts are received.
   3.35.7. Use MC data to support manning, shop equipment, vehicle replacement criteria, new
   vehicle buy budgets and reliability and deployment programs.
3.36. Reclamation Procedures:
   3.36.1. Accomplish reclamation to the extent necessary before or after processing to DLA-
   DS. VM&A coordinates with using organizations for removal of organizational equipment
   prior to transferring a vehicle to DLA-DS. Document removed parts on AFTO Form 91.
   MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs establish policy regarding retention of DLA-DS-
   bound vehicles for purposes of parts reclamation or for training purposes.
   3.36.2. Withdraw vehicles from DLA-DS for special projects or an authorized need upon
   written MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff approval. VFM/VMS provide technical
   assistance in selecting vehicles to be withdrawn. Procedures for withdrawing vehicles from
   DLA-DS are in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2.
   3.36.3. VFM/VMS will monitor the repair and turn-in of vehicle parts to ensure serviceable
   parts with a foreseeable need are not turned in for disposal. To reduce the potential for fraud,
   waste and abuse, inventory and store serviceable, non-credit turn-in parts for which there is a
   projected need, as work order residue.
3.37. Staff Assistance. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs provide staff assistance to the
base Vehicle Management activity. A visit is made when required by the MAJCOM or
requested by the squadron, group or wing commander or equivalent, and approved by the
MAJCOM.
3.38. Shop Publications. Necessary technical literature, including TOs and service manuals
will be available at all times. Technical data for vehicles or vehicular equipment, must be
current. Any of the following data sources, in printed or digital form, are acceptable: Current
TO or commercial manual; printed material, microfilm or software provided by or procured from
the asset manufacturer; commercially procured after-market parts and repair manuals, such as
Chilton® Manuals; or digitized technical data such as Mitchell1®. When conflict occurs
between technical data sources, or questions arise about the accuracy of any technical data, repair
procedures or replacement parts, other than AF-directed inspection criteria, the final decision
authority lies with the representative or dealer for the manufacturer of the vehicle or equipment
item in question. Rationale being the manufacturer or their representative must have the latest
procedures and parts information available.
   3.38.1. Establish and maintain a Technical Order publication file, commonly referred to as a
   TO Library, accessible to all work centers. The TO Library will be managed and inspected
   IAW TO 00-5-1-WA-1, AF Technical Order System.
       3.38.1.1. Geographically separated work centers will have access to current publications
       such as AFOSHSTDs, TO 36-1-191, etc., available in printed or digital form to prevent
       wasted travel time to the central library. The work center supervisor determines which
       publications are needed in their work center.
   3.38.2. Order commercial books or TOs when new vehicles are received without
   publications, using the emergency ordering procedures in TO 00-5-1-WA-1.
92                           AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


  3.38.3. Report deficiencies of technical publications on AFTO Form 22 IAW TO 00-5-1-
  WA-1. Return all excess copies of new vehicle or equipment TOs promptly to the
  appropriate ALC as required by TO 00-5-1-WA-1.

4.5. Manage and Monitor Repetitive, Warranty, Contract and Authorized Maintenance.
   4.5.1. Before sending an AF Form 1823/-1 to the shop, the VM&A Workload Controller:
       4.5.1.1. Reviews the AF Form 1823/-1, Vehicle Historical Record and the OLVIMS
       repetitive maintenance screen for repetitive maintenance.
       4.5.1.2. Decides whether the repair is covered by a new vehicle warranty or a previous
       contract, COPARS or other parts warranty.
   4.5.2. Procedures for Processing Contract Maintenance Repairs.
       4.5.2.1. VM&A keeps active and inactive files on contract maintenance work order
       correspondence, coordinates with the VFM/VMS and the work center supervisor, plans
       the workload, monitors the funding status and keeps files on work specifications.
       4.5.2.2. VM&A initiates AF Form 1823/-1 and funding documents, i.e., AF Form 9,
       Request for Purchase, or GPC purchases request form, for all work done commercially.
       Documents will include work specifications and other data as needed. The completed
       documents are sent to the VFM/VMS, or designee, for review and signature.
Note: Vehicle down time for contract work orders, including awaiting contract action, is
NMCM time.
       4.5.2.3. After the funding documents are certified or signed, one copy is retained.
       4.5.2.4. VM&A arranges vehicle/component transport to the vendor.
       4.5.2.5. VM&A monitors contracted requirement and informs the VFM/VMS if
       requirement/timeline has changed.
       4.5.2.6. Once completed, the contracted repairs or service are inspected for compliance
       with agreement, estimate and/or industry standard requirements by a qualified technician.
       The VFM/VMS, or designee, checks the AF Form 9 (if used) and the vendor’s invoice
       for accuracy against the AF Form 1823/-1.
           4.5.2.6.1. The original invoice is attached to the original voucher for submission by
           the Accounting Liaison Office (ALO). A copy of the invoice is attached to the ALO
           copy of the voucher and another copy returned to the vendor with the payment. (Not
           applicable if using the GPC).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      99


       4.5.2.7. A “JZ” transaction is accomplished in OLVIMS to input the repair cost. Upon
       receipt of the vendor's invoice, compare the cost to the agreed price and change OLVIMS
       if necessary (not applicable if using the GPC). If an actual vendor's invoice is not
       received with the vehicle, use the price on the contract document.
       4.5.2.8. The ALO develops and certifies SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and
       Services Other Than Personal, (original and three copies) to pay the vendor. The ALO
       reports discounts for prompt payment or other changes to the original invoice cost to
       VM&A for adjustment to the original input to OLVIMS (not applicable if using the
       GPC).
Notes:
1. Warranty provisions are entered during “JZ” transaction processing. Additional warranty
information will be entered in the remarks area of the closed AF Form 1823/-1.
2. Estimates repair costs (for major repairs and repairs that may cause the one-time repair limit
to be exceeded) and ensure repairs are authorized according to TO 36-1-191.
3. When applicable, monitor contract repair funds and advise the VFM/VMS and Cost Center
Manager as appropriate.
4.6. Ensure Economical Repair of All Vehicles.
   4.6.1. Scheduling Maintenance. VM&A exercises flexibility in scheduling work into the
   shop. Parts availability, work center manning and the needs of the customer are considered
   when VM&A plans, schedules and adjusts the shop workload.
       4.6.1.1. Schedule vehicles for needed inspections, services and repairs. An appointment
       system is recommended.
       4.6.1.2. Inform the work center supervisor of scheduled work, TCTOs, SBs, OTIs,
       Manufacturer Recalls, completed defers and other needs.
   4.6.2. Ensure work is authorized before it is started and notify the VFM/VMS of any
   estimated repair costs that exceed the one-time repair limit for the vehicle.
   4.6.3. Assign Work Priority. Refer to paragraph 3.32 Notify the VFM/VMS when mission
   essential vehicles fall below MEL. PCN SB004-008 can be used to aid in this requirement.
   4.6.4. Perform Workload Control Board duties.
       4.6.4.1. Initiate and route AF Form 1823/-1 to the work centers.
       4.6.4.2. Monitor workload status and control work flow through the work centers.
       4.6.4.3. Consider maintenance in progress, backlog maintenance and work awaiting shop
       when an ETIC is requested. The VM&A Workload Controller and the applicable work
       center supervisors jointly determine the ETIC to be assigned.
       4.6.4.4. Update the workload control board with vehicle and personnel status as required
       by the VFM/VMS.
   4.6.5. Delay work when needed. Check the delayed workload and schedule vehicles for
   work when the shop capability and needs of the customer permit.

   4.6.6. Recommend, in coordination with the work center supervisor, contract repair action
   when repair work or the workload becomes too excessive. Initiate contract documents after
   approval is received from the VFM/VMS. See paragraph 4.5.2
   4.6.7. Ensure that vehicle and parts warranties are used/exploited.
   4.6.8. Monitor cannibalization.
   4.6.9. Assist work centers in preparing LTI forms..
   4.6.10. Ensure repairs for TCTOs, SBs, OTIs and Manufacturer Recalls are scheduled,
   tracked, accomplished and recorded.
   4.6.11. Establish and control Vehicle Management labor hour reporting in OLVIMS as
   prescribed by AFCSM 24-1.
   4.6.12. Process OLVIMS Maintenance data, as prescribed by AFCSM 24-1, while ensuring
   100 percent OLVIMS and vehicle data accuracy to include: Vehicle Identification Number
   (VIN), make, model, serial number, fuel code, fuel consumption and mileage/hour reading.
   4.6.13. Closely monitor repairs on vehicles displaying replacement codes A through J .
Note: Replacement codes are used as a maintenance management economical tool only.
Perform only minimum essential repairs on these vehicles to keep them in service until
replacements are received.
4.7. Accident and Abuse Work Order Processing. Refer to paragraph 1.13 for program
policy. The following will take place when the shop receives a vehicle with actual or suspected
accident or abuse damage:
   4.7.1. CSC personnel will notify the VFM/VMS and initiate the appropriate “ Estimate” AF
   Form 1823/-1. The “estimate” work order will be used to estimate accident/abuse repair cost
   only.
Note: When computing estimated cost for repairing accident damage, indirect cost is included
only to determine one-time repair limitations.
   4.7.2. Actual repairs will be documented using an “Accident or Abuse Actual” AF Form
   1823/-1, and will not be initiated until the organization of responsibility “releases” the
   vehicle for repairs. Only accident or abuse related repairs will be documented on the
   “actual” work order. Any other unscheduled repairs or scheduled services will be completed
   on an unscheduled or scheduled maintenance work order to follow.
   4.7.3. VM&A will prepare an AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement,
   when required by local policy or requested by the Surveying Officer.
Note: Both military and civilian Direct Labor charges computed by OLVIMS are used for
determining labor cost for in-house repairs of vehicles/equipment on the AF Form 20.
4.8. Develop Depot Maintenance Plan.
   4.8.1. VM&A is responsible for the effective use of the depot program.
   4.8.2. Initiate and plan depot repair needs IAW TO 36-1-191.
Note: Prior to submitting vehicles for depot overhaul, review the vehicle due-in listing to ensure
a future need exists for the overhauled asset.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     101


   4.8.3. Vehicles at depot will draw downtime. Retain vehicle record in master file while
   vehicle is undergoing depot rebuild so that vehicle downtime is accurately documented.
   4.8.4. Downtime begins when vehicle is removed from service and shipping LTI is
   accomplished (a “4000” work order will remain “open”). Downtime ends after the vehicle
   returns from depot, acceptance LTI is accomplished and the vehicle is available for use.
Note: Vehicle will not draw downtime if vehicle is not being returned to the shipping base.
   4.8.5. Capture depot rebuild cost. Process a “JZ” transaction to capture the cost of depot
   rebuild when the vehicle returns from depot (“JZ” transaction is generated by the “JZ”
   screen” that may be seen on the PCN SB004-005, edit list. “JZ” is used to charge the
   contract cost and establish contract warranty information). The cost will include
   transportation and actual depot repair costs. “JZ” transactions are limited to $99,999 per
   month/quarter. If depot and shipping costs exceed $80,000, split the cost evenly and capture
   the remaining cost the following two quarters. Depot cost is provided by WR-ALC to the
   MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff, which subsequently forwards the cost data to the
   base. Contact servicing TMF for the shipping cost to depot. Use this same shipping cost for
   the return cost from depot.
   4.8.6. Ensure depot rebuild date is captured and properly loaded via the “AZ” (years and
   months) in OLVIMS to prevent premature movement into replacement codes A-J, reference
   AFCSM 24-1 (“AZ” transaction used to load/update/delete a vehicle (static data)).
Note: AF license plates will be removed from vehicles prior to departure for depot. License
plate(s) will be stored in the vehicle’s records jacket (or in VM&A if vehicle records are stored
electronically). If vehicle is being transferred to another location after depot repairs, VM&A will
ship the plates to the new location via registered mail. (Refer to TO 36-1-191)
4.9. Vehicle Shipment to Depot Repair. Certain types of vehicles are eligible for depot-level
repairs. Local Traffic Management Flight will assist with guidance on funding the transportation
costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-203. Criteria for these vehicles are
contained in TO 36-1-191, Chapter 9. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs will provide
shipping instructions for vehicles scheduled for depot repair. Three vehicle status codes apply to
depot shipments. Status codes “B” and “G” (accountability not retained by the shipping base)
require processing of turn-in documents. Input of either of these two codes will automatically
create shipping documents. Status code “R” (vehicle programmed for return to the base)
requires preparation only of an off-line “DO NOT POST” shipping document. An “FCI 2C”
transaction is required to enter status code “R” into the SBSS records.
4.10. Capture/Input Maintenance Historical Data in OLVIMS from Supported Outlying
Work Centers and GSUs.
   4.10.1. Work Order and Vehicle Processing for Outlying Work Centers. The operator
   debriefing and incoming inspections are completed in the work center and repair needs are
   validated. The de-briefer gives the information to initiate the AF Form 1823/-1 to the
   VM&A Workload Controller and makes sure any scheduled maintenance and delayed
   requirements are known. The work center supervisor (or a designated technician)
   accomplishes final inspections, which will be shown on the AF Form 1823/-1.

4.11. Prepare and Submit Deficiency, Warranty and Unsatisfactory Reports. Submit and
prepare reports using the Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS) in conjunction with TO 00-
35D-54-WA-1, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System, and TO 36-1-191 Chapter
7. Note: JDRS user login is mandatory. The JDRS website is located at http://www.jdrs.mil/.
4.12. Develop and Manage MEL and VPRL.
   4.12.1. In conjunction with using organizations, vehicle MELs are established (by vehicle
   type/Mgt Code, to include any substitutes) to reflect the minimum number of vehicles needed
   in service to complete the user's mission. The vehicle types using MELs will be limited to
   those types of vehicles listed in Table 2.1, Table 2.2 or those needed on a seasonal or special
   project basis. MELs will be verified by using organizations and the vehicle management
   activity annually.
   4.12.2. Using organizations will provide justification data to support requested MEL to
   vehicle management.
   4.12.3. VM&A reviews request, analyzes utilization data and maintenance history and
   provides the VFM/VMS with recommendations. The VFM/VMS reviews proposed MEL
   with the using organization VCO/VCNCO before MSG Commander approval and final
   publication of the list. The MSG Commander is the final authority for an unresolved MEL.
Note: It is not realistic to have 100 percent of any vehicle type in an organization listed as the
MEL. Allowance must be made for scheduled maintenance, normal breakdowns, etc.
   4.12.4. The approved MEL list serves as the vehicle maintenance priority repair list when
   the vehicle types identified are below the MEL.
   4.12.5. VM&A manages and executes vehicle priority recalls for the base.
       4.12.5.1. Vehicles listed on the VPRL are grouped by unit and vehicle type and consists
       of vehicles that exceed the MEL required for a unit to accomplish its mission. This
       listing will serve as a recall tool to use for short-term vehicle needs.
4.13. Review and Verify Nuclear Certified Vehicle Certification and Records.
   4.13.1. VM&A will validate, document and ensure the accuracy of nuclear vehicle
   certification status by completing the following actions:
       4.13.1.1. New vehicle. During initial inspection of new vehicles, VM&A will verify
       nuclear certification status by comparing the vehicle’s data plate, shipping documents,
       NSN, make and model information against the MNCL. If the vehicle is nuclear certified,
       enter the nuclear certified vehicle identifier “N” into OLVIMS “AZ” screen (refer to
       Table 4.1)
       4.13.1.2. During scheduled PM&I. Validate the data plate information on Nuclear
       Certified vehicles (to include data plate legibility) and ensure the data matches vehicle
       information contained on the MNCL. Review OLVIMS to ensure the nuclear certified
       status of the vehicle is correctly identified. Reference AFCSM 24-1, section 5.3.11.1.
       4.13.1.3. Additionally, review the permanent portion of the records jacket/file for
       documentation concerning nuclear certified vehicle modification request, DULL
       SWORD reporting and subsequent certification actions (e.g., “Restricted Use”).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  103


      4.13.1.4. Document actions on AF form 4354 and maintained in the active portion of the
      records jacket/file.
   4.13.2. Vehicles that have been properly “restricted” for use during nuclear operations by
   the AFSC (and have been listed as such on the MNCL by vehicle registration number) will
   have the “N” designator removed from the “NUC IND” field on the OLVIMS “AZ” screen
   for that registration number. If the AFSC removes the vehicle’s “restricted” status from the
   MNCL, then the “N” designator will be reapplied in OLVIMS at that time.
4.14. Develop and Maintain 18-Month Scheduled Maintenance Plan.
   4.14.1. Scheduled maintenance includes PM&I and Special Inspections, at regular intervals
   to maintain a safe and serviceable vehicle fleet. The 18-Month PM&I will be conducted
   using the AF Form 4354 in conjunction with applicable manufacturer maintenance
   requirements.
   4.14.2. Consider seasonal needs, labor-hour availability, organizational needs and fair
   apportionment of the 18-month requirement when developing a plan.             Scheduled
   maintenance has priority and is not delayed.
   4.14.3. Vehicles used as static training aids (not operated on base or public highways) are
   exempt from scheduled maintenance. In addition, vehicles such as mobile communication
   vans positioned in a semi-permanent or permanent site are exempt. Perform scheduled
   maintenance before operating these vehicles over public roads.
   4.14.4. Develop, as necessary, work cards and checklists for certain vehicle types or special
   inspection and servicing requirements. Bilingual work cards and checklists may be
   mandatory when local national employees are not required to read and speak English.
4.15. Ensure ETIC Accuracy.
   4.15.1. ETICs will represent the “best estimate” on when all vehicle repairs are
   accomplished and the vehicle is projected to be returned to use.
   4.15.2. The new ETIC field in OLVIMS will be populated for all vehicles with an open work
   order. Once a work order is open a new ETIC will be established. Blank “new ETIC” fields
   are not authorized for any vehicle with an open work order.
   4.15.3. ETICs for vehicles awaiting disposition instructions will be the projected date that
   the vehicle will receive the highest level of disposition instructions.
   4.15.4. The new ETIC will not have a historical date (yesterday or older). ETICs will be
   updated as needed to ensure most accurate estimates are projected.
4.16. Conduct Yard Checks Weekly.
   4.16.1. From home screen press Alt F2, then press Alt F6.
   4.16.2. Select all options and print Yard Check Listing.
   4.16.3. Walk through the VM compound, yard(s) or controlled area and validate all vehicles
   listed on Yard Check Listing are in VM control and the status is accurate in OLVIMS. If not,
   research and take appropriate action to correct.
 104                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   4.16.4. Identify all vehicles in the compound not reflected on the Yard Check Listing.
   Ascertain reason the vehicles are not on the Yard Check Listing and take appropriate action
   to correct as needed.
   4.16.5. Yard checks will be completed weekly or more often as determined by the
   VFM/VMS.
4.17. Ensure Annual Serviceability Inspections are Conducted Using AF Form 4355.
   4.17.1. VM&A will ensure that an AF Form 4355 has been performed (via processing an AF
   Form 1823/-1) for each registered vehicle annually. Completion of the inspection can be
   accomplished via mobile maintenance or shop visit; provided an AF 1823/-1 is initiated in
   OLVIMS. Refer to paragraph 7.37. for AF Form 4355 completion instructions
   4.17.2. For informational purposes only, VEMSO will distribute a report quarterly to
   respective bases and MAJCOMS for compliance/verification action.
       4.17.2.1. The report will list vehicles that have NOT had an AF Form 1823/-1 reported
       (opened) within the proceeding12-month period. VM&A will review the report and take
       action to ensure compliance.
       4.17.2.2. Report will contain MAJCOM, OLVIMS Base/Site Code, vehicle registration
       number, Base and Unit details.
Note: The report will only be valid for vehicle management activities that have submitted
OLVIMS quarterly data IAW paragraph 4.31.4.
4.18. Verify Parts Charges in OLVIMS Daily. Refer to paragraphs 5.2.20 and 5.14
4.19. Manage TCTOs, Service Bulletins, Manufacture Recalls and OTIs. Control of
TCTOs, SBs and OTIs. TCTOs are managed differently than regular TOs. They must be
requisitioned individually and as a series they must be identified for automatic distribution.
TCTOs, SBs and OTIs are managed IAW the following procedures:
   4.19.1. VEMSO is notified by WR-ALC concerning newly released TCTOs, SBs and OTIs.
   VEMSO will provide base-level Vehicle Management a list of vehicles requiring the TCTO,
   SB or OTI. VEMSO will courtesy copy MAJCOMs.
   4.19.2. Units must ensure they are on TO distribution listing for each TCTO series. These
   series are listed in the “-36” index for the type of vehicle they pertain to. The TO monitor
   must review the “-36” index on receipt and ensure that for each type of vehicle assigned, if
   there is an applicable TCTO series that it is on distribution. This ensures TCTOs published
   under that series are sent to the unit.
   4.19.3. VM&A must date stamp each TCTO, SB or OTI once received (electronically dated
   e-mail/message traffic is sufficient); determine TCTO, SB or OTI action and/or parts kit
   requirement by reviewing the TCTO, SB or OTI cover page for affected vehicle registration
   numbers; and notify Materiel Control to order required parts kits after determining and
   verifying base requirements.
       4.19.3.1. Use “T” prefix for work order numbers when a TCTO will be completed on
       that work order.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                               105


     4.19.3.2. Use “S” prefix for work order numbers when a SB or OTI will be completed on
     that work order.
     4.19.3.3. Use “B” prefix to order parts (if required).
  4.19.4. WR-ALC requires verification of correct TCTO or SB ordering before kit is released
  for shipment. Contact the appropriate IM or Equipment Specialist for the affected vehicle
  type by telephone, fax or electronic mail, provide vehicle registration numbers and
  requisition due-in document numbers, obtained from Materiel Control, to enable kit release.
  4.19.5. Take continuous supply follow-up action until kits are received.
  4.19.6. Complete TCTOs, SBs and OTIs actions as soon as possible, before the required
  completion (suspense) date. TCTO, SB or OTI not completed by the “completion date” will
  be considered "outstanding" and places the vehicle’s serviceability in jeopardy.
     4.19.6.1. When directed by the WR-ALC, VEMSO and/or MAJCOM, vehicles with
     “outstanding” actions will be removed from service until the subject TCTO, SB or OTI
     is accomplished.
  4.19.7. Record the completion of the TCTO, SB or OTI on the computer-generated Vehicle
  Historical Record (OLVIMS PCN SB004-829). VEMSO will collect completion/compliance
  reporting via LIMS-EV Vehicle View monthly data files for completed TCTOs and SBs.
  Urgent action TCTO and SB completion reporting will be included with all others, however
  they may require manual completion reporting depending on time constraints and fleet safety
  concerns. VEMSO will notify applicable units and MAJCOMs as the need arises.
  4.19.8. When closing “T” or “S” prefixed work orders (after F3 key is pushed), VM&A
  personnel must ensure the TCTO/SB number entered into OLVIMS is identical the
  TCTO/SB number shown in LIMS-EV Vehicle View/TCTO view for that registration
  number. If they do not match, the TCTO/SB will still show as due in LIMS-EV Vehicle
  View.
  4.19.9. Maintain active master TCTO, SB and OTI files. A rescinded file will be maintained
  when needed for special programs and projects. When a rescinded TCTO is needed, it can be
  obtained by following the procedures in TO 00-5-1-WA-1.
  4.19.10. Verify TCTO status via LIMS-EV Vehicle View. The TCTO view depicts four
  separate, but linked, TCTO requirements by vehicle counts. The available data views are by
  vehicle numbers and percent completed. By toggling between the views, the viewer will
  have an informed look at an individual TCTO or the status of a larger TCTO program
  completion level within a filter set.
     4.19.10.1. Access LIMS-EV Vehicle View and click the TCTO tab.
     4.19.10.2. Data points and definitions.
     4.19.10.3. Total required. Depicts the sum vehicles required to have a TCTO completed
     on them within the filter set. Source of the vehicle count is a sum of the registration
     numbers listed in the TCTO table that matches the filter set.
     4.19.10.4. Complete. Depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers listed within the
     filter set that have a “TCTO COMPLETED DATE” listed.

       4.19.10.5. Due/On-Time. Depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result
       set that require a TCTO be completed that has not passed the “MUST BE DONE DATE”.
       Will be reflected when within 60 days of due date.
       4.19.10.6. Overdue. Depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result set that
       require a TCTO be completed that has passed the “MUST BE DONE DATE”.
   4.19.11. Can toggle between numerical values or percentages in the chart. If a TCTO/SB
   has been completed, and a monthly OLVIMS file has passed to LIMS-EV Vehicle View, and
   the TCTO. SB is not showing complete, the TCTO/SB may not match between what was
   input into OLVIMS and what was listed on the TCTO/SB.
   4.19.12. To correct, edit, add or delete TCTO data, use “CZ” transaction. Must edit “C
   record” in OLVIMS to match (“CZ”, “CV” and “ZH”).
   4.19.13. OLVIMS data crossed in monthly file uploaded to VEMSO (VYHK0D2T.ZIP).
4.20. Ensure Reimbursable Units are Coded Correctly in OLVIMS and Perform Follow
Up Actions for Financial Recoupment.
   4.20.1. Receive Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) code for reimbursable units
   from Finance.
   4.20.2. Send “?ARAD6C.DA1” file monthly to Finance Budget Office.
   4.20.3. Once file is returned from DFAS, reconcile for accuracy.
   4.20.4. Resubmit reconciled “? ARAD6C.DA1” file back to Finance Budget Office for
   recoupment.
   4.20.5. Monitor reimbursement via resource advisor.
Note: Refer to paragraph 7.49. for additional information.
4.21. Ensure Accurate Man-Hour/Labor Accounting. Refer to Chapter 7.
4.22. Vehicle VIL Key. Quarterly (or as required), VM&A will provide Fuels Management a
master list depicting all assigned vehicles and organization codes to include a break out of all
vehicles that have changed since the previous list.
   4.22.1. The list must include the vehicle registration number, unit, all grades of product that
   will be used (e.g., MUR, MRR, DL1, DL2, CNG, LNG, etc.) and if it is alternative fuel
   capable.
   4.22.2. Operation procedures will be developed between VM&A and Fuels Management to
   ensure notification of vehicle deletions, assignments, rotations, nontaxable and alternative
   fuel use.
Notes:
1. Installation Fuels Management is responsible for the Automated Fuel Service Station (AFSS)
equipped for VIL.
2. VIL key requirements/policy for alternative fuel vehicles is located in paragraph 11.6.4.
4.23. Recording Taxable Fuel Consumption. Current Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
guidance identifies fuel for government vehicles operated solely on government installations as
exempt from Federal and some state levied taxes. In order to ensure the DOD obtains
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     107


appropriate tax credit for the fuel consumed by these vehicles the following procedures must be
followed.
Note: If any vehicle uses a county, state or federal highway one or more times during a fiscal
quarter, fuel consumed by that vehicle is taxable for that period. Crossing over a county, state or
federal highway at an intersection does not count as use. All off-road vehicles, e.g., graders,
forklifts and K-loaders, qualify. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy is responsible to issue
guidance clearly outlining taxable and non-taxable guidelines for DOD fuel use. Additional
information can be found on the DLA Energy website.
   4.23.1. VCOs and VCNCOs, in conjunction with VM&A, must verify and list all vehicles
   designated for travel off the installation during the upcoming quarter.
   4.23.2. Once finalized, VM&A then forwards the list of vehicles expected to travel off the
   installation to Fuels Management. Fuels Management then verifies each VIL is encoded to
   properly reflect taxable status of fuel to be consumed by the vehicle. Fuels Management will
   use this list to encode the VIL with a UC.
Note: Recording of taxable fuel consumption and coding VIL keys accordingly is not a
requirement for Air National Guard units.
   4.23.3. Fuel Tax Refund Requests. The AF is not authorized to seek reimbursement for
   DLA Energy owned fuel or fuel purchased under a GSA lease as they are purchased under
   standard pricing. For information on obtaining reimbursement of fuel taxes on non-DLA
   Energy owned fuel or fuel purchased under a GSA wet lease, contact the local Accounting
   and Finance office.
4.24. Review, Validate and Process Vehicle Authorization Requests.
   4.24.1. Vehicle Authorization Review Authority. Only the minimum number of vehicles
   necessary to support the mission will be authorized. The VFM is the vehicle authorization
   review authority for the installation. The VFM or equivalent:
       4.24.1.1. Reviews and validates vehicle requirements and vehicle change requests.
       4.24.1.2. Recommends increases or decreases in vehicle authorizations.
   4.24.2. Considers the following to address additional vehicle authorizations:
       4.24.2.1. Use of vehicles from the U-Drive It (UDI) fleet, priority recall, or short term
       lease/rental to satisfy short duration or sporadic mission requirements.
       4.24.2.2. Types and quantities of vehicles must clearly be the minimum number to
       accomplish the mission.
   4.24.3. Do not authorize vehicles for reasons of grade, prestige, personal convenience or to
   individual persons except as previously stated.
   4.24.4. Use LIMS-EV to review vehicle utilization.
   4.24.5. The AS is a seven-digit code which describes the AS used, Base Code and User
   Code. For example, the AS Code for a registered fleet vehicle (010) belonging to Langley
   AFB (LA), LRS Vehicle Mgt Flt (EG) would be: “010LAEG”.

   4.24.6. All additions or changes to vehicle authorizations, require an authorization request to
   be processed through MAJCOM to VEMSO. To request a new authorization or to request
   updates to an existing authorization MAJCOMs send request to VEMSO org box. VEMSO
   will work with MAJCOM/using VM&A for clarification as needed.
Note: Authorization requests applicable to USCENTCOM AOR will be processed through
USAFCENT/A4RV, IAW USAFCENT VM Pamphlet 23-302.
       4.24.6.1. Authorized quantity increase due to mission change. Requests to increase
       vehicle fleet size must be supported by a verifiable mission change, e.g., OPLAN,
       Provisional Plan (PPLAN), Executive Order (EXORD), Fragmentary Order (FRAGO),
       base layout, operation moved to a different location on base, added a ramp, etc.
       4.24.6.2. All new or increased authorizations will be coordinated with functional
       community. If approved, functional community will request vehicle procurement
       funding for the initial validated vehicle requirements and advocate additional funding in
       the out-years of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for increased vehicle buy
       replacement dollars. MAJCOMs will annotate they have secured funds for initial
       purchase before submitting for approval.
       4.24.6.3. Any non-mission change increase will be offset by adjustments to other vehicle
       authorizations to preclude an overall increase in authorizations. All adjustments to
       authorization quantities must be approved by MAJCOM and then VEMSO (AF/A4LE).
       4.24.6.4. Offset authorization(s) must be equal to or greater than the purchase price of
       the authorization(s) being requested.
   4.24.7. Authorization Analysis. The objective of the analysis is to validate the requirement
   and determine whether a more effective avenue, such as short-term leasing or co-utilization
   of assets, can satisfy the requirement without adding additional authorizations. The VFM
   will use the conclusions of the analysis to make approval/disapproval.
   4.24.8. Justification Requirements. The following data is required on all new authorization
   and change request. Any request that does not contain all required data available will be
   returned for completion.
       4.24.8.1. Indicate if the request is for new, increase, reduction or deletion.
       4.24.8.2. SRAN.
       4.24.8.3. Org and Shop Code for new authorization.
       4.24.8.4. Document Number existing authorization adjustments.
       4.24.8.5. NSN (Prime NSN only, no asset NSNs) from the VMIF.
       4.24.8.6. Use Code.
       4.24.8.7. UTC (for Use Code A authorizations).
       4.24.8.8. Increment Code for Use Code C and D authorizations. For use code “C”,
       populate with two- digit Base Code and two-digit User Code. For use Code “D”,
       populate with two-digit Base Code and an Org code of “BS” (for BEAR) or “WM” (for
       WRM).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    109

      4.24.8.15. Registration Number. The registration number is needed when increasing or
      adding authorizations and an on-hand asset will be used to fill. Provide document
      number and registration number where vehicle is located and where it will be moved to.
      If registration number is not provided by requester, VEMSO will select the oldest vehicle
      and move it to excess in order accommodate authorization request.
  4.24.9. In addition to the required data listed in above, requesting vehicle management
  activities must answer and respond to the following questions:
      4.24.9.1. Does the justification provide the directive, project or publication that
      generated the request, if appropriate?
      4.24.9.2. Does the justification identify expected utilization information?
         4.24.9.2.1. Provide estimated monthly miles/hrs used each month. For passenger
         carrying vehicles (that carry seven or more passengers) list number of passengers
         moved each month and frequency of movement.
         4.24.9.2.2. List equipment/supplies needing towed/hauled (to include dimensions and
         weight) and any special movement requirement (e.g., air ride suspension).
      4.24.9.3. Does the justification list the number of vehicles currently authorized and
      assigned to the requesting unit and justify why co-utilization will not meet mission
      requirements?
      4.24.9.4. Does the request justify why transportation support from Vehicle Operations
      (taxi or UDI) cannot satisfy the vehicle requirement (OLVIMS data must substantiate
      lack of support)?
      4.24.9.5. Does the justification include a mission impact statement on the organization,
      base or wing if the request is denied?
      4.24.9.6. Does the justification cite any actions taken to realign other authorizations to
      accommodate the requirement?
  4.24.10. If a request is disapproved by VEMSO, the MAJCOM Vehicle Fleet Manager may
  appeal the decision to AF/A4LE (2T3 CFM). Appeals beyond AF/A4LE will follow normal
  chain of command elevation.
  4.24.11. An approved request will have a TACR submitted by VEMSO (allowance change
  request) in AFEMS.
      4.24.11.1. After the TACR is approved/AFEMS updated by the AS manager at WR-
      ALC, VEMSO emails the approved request back to the MAJCOM.
      4.24.11.2. VEMSO updates SBSS with the changes in the approved request and notifies
      the base of completed action.
      4.24.11.3. VEMSO will retain copies of approved and disapproved justifications for all
      authorizations as required.
  4.24.12. Authorization requests are not required for excess AS 048.

      4.24.13.1. When an authorization request is validated by contingency staff as “Urgent” it
      is loaded via CRIS Tool using “AID 048XXXX” with a status code of "J” as an interim
      action. Status code "J" represents Vehicle is not yet formally authorized but is in use and
      required.
      4.24.13.2. Urgent authorization justification request are then submitted to MAJCOM
      Vehicle Management Staff for approval/disapproval.
      4.24.13.4. VEMSO will view request via CRIS Tool, load authorization in SBSS and
      mark as "Complete" in CRIS Tool.
      4.24.13.5. Contingency staff will ensure the follow on authorization request to the
      MAJCOM contains the words "Authorization Already Loaded via 048”, the authorized
      NSN, quantity authorized and document number from the "Urgent" authorization request.
      4.24.13.6. When VEMSO receives authorization request containing "Authorization
      Already Loaded" statement, VEMSO will move vehicles assigned to AS 048
      authorization to new authorizations and delete AS 048 authorization for approved
      changes. For disapproved request VEMSO will delete the 048 authorization and notify
      requestor of completed action.
4.25. Monitor Vehicle Data Integrity/Quality/Accuracy. This will be accomplished using
LIMS-EV Vehicle View, CRIS Tool and VDQD.
   4.25.1. LIMS-EV Vehicle View is a “Data Service” that serves as the overarching gateway
   to AF/A4/7 enterprise reporting and analysis. LIMS-EV Vehicle View provides a
   consolidated look at vehicle accountability and sustainment data. Data comes from SBSS
   and OLVIMS and is merged with supplemental tables that are maintained by VEMSO. As a
   result, all information is placed into a usable and accessible format. (See Attachment 8 for
   LIMS-EV Vehicle View navigation details).
   4.25.2. All sustainment data comes from               base    level   OLVIMS       files,   all
   inventory/accountability data comes from SBSS.
   4.25.3. Units will upload “Daily” and “Monthly” OLVIMS files onto the VM CoP. Monthly
   files must be updated by the 15th of the month. On the 21st of each month, the previous
   month’s data will be displayed in LIMS-EV Vehicle View.
   4.25.4. SBSS data is brought into LIMS-EV Vehicle View daily from the AF data
   warehouse.
   4.25.5. WR-ALC will use their Consolidated Analysis and Reporting System (CARS)
   program to update the due-in information into LIMS-EV Vehicle View. This is daily feed.
   Twice a day LIMS-EV Vehicle View conducts an Extract Transform Load (ETL) (0830 and
   2030 US Eastern Time) and pulls in data from the VM CoP and the data warehouse or other
   designated location. At that time, files that were uploaded to the VM CoP or designated
   location are checked for errors.
   4.25.6. If errors exist, files will be ignored and the last “good” file will continue to be
   displayed.
   4.25.7. Units will check the VDQD and ensure their current files were updated. If a file was
   uploaded, and is not reflected in LIMS-EV Vehicle View, contact VEMSO.

   4.25.8. VDQD. The VDQD is located on the VM CoP. The dashboard is broken down into
   tabs and is updated once a month (SBSS Reports, OLVIMS Reports, Data Upload Metrics
   and Applications). The only exception is the SBSS Reports (Vacancies/Overages Panel)
   which is updated daily. Each tab contains specific panels with a built-in search. All panels
   open to full screen and contain moveable/filterable columns that are exportable. Data files
   can be download in Excel, however all filters must be removed before download will execute
   or a download error will occur.
4.26. Using CRIS Tool to Request SBSS Updates.
   4.26.1. SBSS is the “accountable” system for all AF managed vehicles. VEMSO will
   accomplish all vehicle transactions in SBSS.
   4.26.2. CRIS Tool is the transaction-requesting interface between VM&A and VEMSO.
   The CRIS Tool resides on the Pentagon server and is updated by VEMSO daily with SBSS
   data from the data warehouse.
   4.26.3. Access CRIS Tool via LIMS-EV VEHICLE VIEW or save link for accessing
   directly.
   4.26.4. VM&A will use CRIS Tool to request updates to SBSS for the following
   transactions:
Note: Lease vehicles can fill vacant Government Owned authorizations. Government (Blue
Fleet) vehicles will not be used to fill open leased vehicle ”AS 012” authorizations.
       4.26.4.1. Receiving a new vehicle. Prior to assigning a vehicle to an authorization (Load
       Asset); verify an opening exists.
       4.26.4.2. Rotating a vehicle to an existing authorization. Prior to assigning a vehicle to
       an authorization; verify an opening exists.
       4.26.4.3. Shipping a vehicle.
       4.26.4.4. Clearing a vehicle from the AF inventory (e.g., DLA-DS, transferring to other
       services, nations or governmental agencies, etc).
       4.26.4.5. Placing a vehicle in excess. Select Excess Request
       4.26.4.6. Changing registration number. Select Update Asset.
       4.26.4.7. Changing NSN. Select Update Asset.

       4.26.5.1. Select base.
       4.26.5.2. Select request type (i.e., rotate asset).
       4.26.5.3. Select registration number or DOC# from drop down menu (if applicable). All
       asset and authorization data for the registration number selected will be displayed.
       4.26.5.4. Type in requested information, then click submit button.
Note: All data fields in CRIS Tool must be populated and with correct data. Incomplete or
incorrect data will significantly delay requests being processed.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    113


       4.26.5.5. Once request is submitted, it moves to “Awaiting” status and an automated
       email notification is sent to VEMSO.
       4.26.5.6. VEMSO will process requests in SBSS within three business days of
       submission.
       4.26.5.7. Once processed, VEMSO will mark request as complete and request will move
       to “Completed” status.
       4.26.5.8. Local VM&A is the liaison between AFVFSB and supply. Local VM&A/bases
       are responsible for all “accountable” supply documents to include completing local and
       MAJCOM forms. See local Supply Document Control for accountable documents lists
       and local form requirements. See base supply for details. AFVFSB will provide “RVP”
       and “FCH” documents to VM&A.
       4.26.5.9. All VM&A personnel must have Equipment Management Block I training and
       inquiry rights to ES-S.
       4.26.5.10. Completed requests could take up to 48 hours to show in CRIS Tool and
       LIMS-EV Vehicle View after SBSS is updated. Each installation’s SBSS data is passed
       to the warehouse on different intervals. Contact the servicing Supply Customer Service
       section for base specific times/intervals.
4.27. Filling Vehicle Authorization with Most Suitable Asset.
   4.27.1. VM&A MUST fill vehicle authorizations with assets that match the prime authorized
   vehicle type if available in the fleet (B200 authorization filled with B200 asset). If a prime
   vehicle is not available, fill the authorization with the most suitable asset in the inventory.
4.28. Managing Excess Vehicles.
   4.28.1. Excess vehicles are vehicles no longer required for an authorization. Redistribute
   excess vehicles to base activities having open vehicle authorizations or reassign them to
   replace less serviceable and/or maintainable (usually older) vehicles eligible for replacement.
   Do not assign excess vehicles to organizations waiting approval for additional vehicle
   requirements. VM will have physical possession of excess vehicles and VM&A will control
   vehicles pending disposition direction.
   4.28.2. If reassignment to another base activity is not possible, request vehicle be moved to
   excess in CRIS tool. Excess vehicles will be placed in of the following status codes:
       4.28.2.1. D--Disposition instructions have        been   received,    pending    shipment,
       maintenance, transfer to DLA-DS, sale, etc.
       4.28.2.2. E--Vehicle is unserviceable. Accountability is maintained until transfer to
       DLA-DS. Cannibalization is authorized prior to transferring to DLA-DS.
       4.28.2.3. I--Vehicle is awaiting LTI, Vehicle is unserviceable and disposition
       instructions have been requested from the “Using” MAJCOM.
       4.28.2.4. N--Vehicle is unserviceable and dispositions instructions have been requested
       from the owning command.

   4.28.3. Accomplish LTI and forward to MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff requesting
   disposition instructions within 30 calendar days from the date the vehicle became excess on
   the CA/CRL.
   4.28.4. Initiate follow-up action 30 calendar days after the date the LTI was sent to the
   MAJCOM.
   4.28.5. Excess assets will not be used for deployments or special projects without MAJCOM
   approval.
4.29. Review, Validate and Process Rental/Lease Requests.
   4.29.1. Vehicle rental/leases are vehicles on loan from a local vendor with payment made on
   a recurring basis.
   4.29.2. Vehicle rental/lease administration.
       4.29.2.1. Starting in FY14, all leasing of passenger carrying vehicles will occur through
       the LRS. Funding will be consolidated to the **542f PEs under cost category 43100 and
       43200. Units with new leasing needs will coordinate their requirements thru the LRS.
   4.29.3. DOD components may rent/lease motor vehicles when any of these conditions exist:
       4.29.3.1. An Economic Analysis (EA) verifies a cost benefit to the government.
       Reference AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, for EA requirements and procedures.
       4.29.3.2. Vehicle support is required due to unforeseen or scheduled event which is
       unsupportable with existing vehicles on-hand and cannot wait for acquisition through
       normal procurement.
       4.29.3.3. Local laws or Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) prevent using government
       vehicles.
   4.29.4. The rental/lease of passenger sedans, station wagons, mini-vans and SUVs shall be
   limited to those designated as Class I and II by GSA. Class III and Class IV will not be
   rented or leased unless an approved exception to policy from AF/A4/7 (Class III) and the
   Office of Secretary of Defense/AT&L (Class IV) is on file. Refer to paragraph 4.75 for
   vehicle class authorization details.
       4.29.4.1. The requester will not accept Class III or IV vehicles without obtaining the
       appropriate exception to policy approval if the rental/lease agency does not have the
       authorized size vehicle.
   4.29.5. VM&A validates all requests for rentals/leases for installation activities. Coordinate
   with contracting to ensure vehicles are not rented/leased without prior validation regardless
   of who funds for the rental/lease. Rental/leases may be executed with an AF Form 9 or GPC
   where guidance allows. A copy of the validated AF Form 9 or related GPC documents will
   be retained in VM&A.
   4.29.6. VM&A will maintain a log of all rentals/ leases. The log will list each purchase
   request in numerical sequence and the reason for its initiation.
Note: CES occasional leases, and are not exempt from this requirement.
   4.29.7. Requesting units/users provide funds for each rental/lease.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     115


       4.29.7.1. Vehicle rental/leases will not be charged to the Medical Treatment Facility
       (MTF) Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriations (O&M, Procurement, or Research,
       Development, Testing & Evaluation). Vehicle rental/leases must be charged to the O&M
       funds of the installation the MTF supports, or as directed by AF/A4LE. MTFs are not
       authorized to establish vehicle rental/leases outside of those established by the
       installation. All vehicle requirements, whether rented/leased or purchased, are the
       responsibility of AF/A4LE.
   4.29.8. The LRS Commander or equivalent will coordinate on all rental/lease requests prior
   to submission to contracting.
   4.29.9. Upon termination of a vehicle rental/lease VM&A verifies and certifies charges.
   4.29.10. Short-Term Rental/Lease. LRS Commanders or equivalents may authorize vehicle
   rentals/leases to meet peak workloads and unusual or emergency requirements. Vehicle
   leases/rentals are funded by unit O&M funds. Rentals/Leases will not exceed one-year. See
   AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Section 10M, for guidance
   pertaining to leases.
       4.29.10.1. Do not use this authority to provide transportation for normal or routine
       purposes, when vehicles are available.
       4.29.10.2. The MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff will be notified if any rental/lease
       vehicle is required for more than 60 days. When notifying MAJCOM, VM&A will
       specify the vehicle type, quantity and anticipated duration of the rental/lease requirement.
       Rentals/leases that exceed one-year are not authorized unless a valid authorization has
       been established. Rental/leases that exceed 18 months must be coordinated with
       contracting and must be justified IAW Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Part 207,
       Acquisition Management, current edition.
       4.29.10.3. Use GSA vehicles when available. Confirm non-availability from MAJCOM
       before executing a non-GSA commercial rental/lease exceeding 60 days for general-
       purpose vehicles. Keep non-availability certification documents for the duration of the
       lease period.
       4.29.10.4. Consecutive short-term rentals/leases are not authorized.
Note: All requests for rental/leases request exceeding one-year are justified using the
MAJCOM-approved vehicle justification request format and forwarded to the MAJCOM Vehicle
Management Staff for action before entering into a rental/lease agreement through contracting.
Approved requests must be retained for the duration of the lease period.
   4.29.11. Long-Term Rental/Lease. Leasing over one-year is generally to fill open
   authorizations not filled through normal acquisition procedures
       4.29.11.1. Funding for Long-Term rental/leased Vehicles. Vehicle rentals/leases are
       funded by unit O&M funds. When executing a long-term rental/lease, contracts with
       option to buy require prior approval by WR-ALC. See paragraph 4.29.7.1 for unit
       funding exception, and see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Section 10M, for guidance pertaining
       to leases.
   4.29.12. Lease with Option to Buy. Lease with option to buy is the preferred method of
   entering into long-term vehicle leases per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 7,
 116                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   Acquisition Management, current edition, and DFARS Part 207. WR-ALC must approve all
   leases with an option to buy clause. In a lease with option to buy contract, the cumulative
   lease costs and the cost to exercise the purchase option must not exceed the purchase cost
   unless fully justified in writing.
       4.29.12.1. Once the lease asset is purchased, an AF Form 601, Equipment Action
       Request, must be submitted through the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff to
       VEMSO to update the allowance standard from a lease authorization to an owned
       authorization and a vehicle registration number must be requested from WR-ALC
       through the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff.
   4.29.13. Insurance Coverage and Maintenance for Rented/Leased Vehicles.
       4.29.13.1. “For Hire” solicitations and resulting contracts provide insurance coverage as
       prescribed by applicable portions of the FARs. Unless the rental/lease company requires
       purchasing insurance, rented/leased vehicles are obtained with the AF providing self-
       insurance.
Note: The U.S. government is self-insured for loss of damage to government property and the
liability of government employees for actions within the scope of their duties. Claims for injury
or death of third parties, or damage to third party property, arising from federal employee
negligence in the operation of government-furnished vehicles are covered by the Federal Tort
Claims Act.
   4.29.14. Vehicle operators conduct daily operator care on rented/leased vehicles unless
   otherwise specified in the contract.
   4.29.15. GSA approved local vendors perform all maintenance on rented/leased vehicles,
   unless prior agreements are made showing it is more economical for the AF to perform
   maintenance or for matters of military necessity. All waivers must be submitted and
   approved by AF/A4LE prior to any maintenance action taken on the vehicle fleet. AF/A4LE
   will only approve waivers based on the lack of a commercial maintenance facility within the
   local area or within permissible operating distance from the base.
   4.29.16. Installation of Radio Equipment in rented/leased vehicles. When two-way radio
   sets are required, rent/lease vehicles with radio equipment already installed. Install radio sets
   in rented/leased vehicles when it is not economical to rent/lease the radio equipment, or use
   portable or non-fixed radios when feasible.
   4.29.17. Exceptions for Acquiring, Renting or Leasing Foreign Made Buses. Federal law
   requires the armed forces to use US manufactured buses to satisfy requirements, unless their
   use is not economical or not in the best interest of the US Government. The rule applies
   when a purchase, rent/lease or contractual arrangements are made for transportation services.
   Exceptions to Federal Law are:
       4.29.17.1. When US manufactured buses are not available to meet requirements that
       cannot be postponed, foreign manufactured buses may be used temporarily. However,
       the rental/lease contract agreement time frame must not exceed the lead-time required for
       acquiring and delivering US manufactured buses. MAJCOMs will submit a waiver
       request to AF/A4LE if it is not economically feasible to rent/lease US manufactured
       buses.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    117


      4.29.17.2. Where foreign manufactured buses are available at no direct or indirect
      acquisition cost to the US Government.
   4.29.18. GSA will send annual lease list to VEMSO for review/approval. VEMSO will
   ensure leased assets comply with energy policies (right size, etc.) and return AF approved list
   to GSA for execution. Refer to paragraph 8.11.1.1
4.30. Correct Errors on Data System Reconciliation Listings Identified on VDQD.
   4.30.1. To correct OLVIMS’ organization code, VM&A must first request a new
   organization code list from VEMSO.
   4.30.2. Using the “new organization code list” identify organization codes for loading in
   OLVIMS using a highlighter.
      4.30.2.1. This is easily accomplished by printing out the vehicle master list in LIMS-EV
      Vehicle View.
      4.30.2.2. The last two characters of the allowance source code (ASC) will identify the
      organization codes used on a specific base. For example: ASC “010SWJP”: “010”—
      identifies Registered Fleet (012 identifies Leased); “SW”—identifies Shaw as the
      assigned base; “JP”—identifies the using org code JP, which is CES Operations Flight.
      4.30.2.3. Using the “OZ” transaction in OLVIMS create the new Organization Codes
      4.30.2.4. During the process, validation of the following should occur:
          4.30.2.4.1. Validate the “RC/CC Code” with the Financial Management Flight.
          4.30.2.4.2. Validate the “Owning” and “Using Commands” with MAJCOM or
          VEMSO.
          4.30.2.4.3. Validate the “R/D code” with the Financial Management Flight.
          4.30.2.4.4. Validate the “Force Activity Indication (FAD) Code” with the LRS
          Supply Customer Service Section.
      4.30.2.5. After creating new organization codes using the “OZ” transaction, VM&A
      must process an “AT” transaction in OLVIMS for each vehicle assigned, by registration
      number, to include those that are excess.
          4.30.2.5.1. “AT” transactions will not accept for vehicles with open work orders or
          those previously transferred in the current month. For those with open work orders,
          there are two options to accomplish the “AT” transaction:
              4.30.2.5.1.1. Option 1 (easiest but harder to track) – Accomplish the “AT”
              transaction after the work order closes.
              4.30.2.5.1.2. Option 2 (more difficult, however accomplishes the entire fleet) –
              Close open work orders, accomplish the “AT” transaction and then re-open each
              work order 1-minute after it has been closed.
      4.30.2.6. Use a copy of PCN 24 as checklist to validate “AT” transaction on all vehicles
      loaded in OLVIMS.
          4.30.2.6.1. Once validation is complete, use a new PCN 24 and re-validate, looking
          specifically for the former organization codes.
 118                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       4.30.2.7. Using the “OT” transaction in OLVIMS delete all old organization codes.
       4.30.2.8. MELs will have to be updated in OLVIMS using the “OE” transaction since
       they are linked to organization codes.
4.31. Upload Daily, Monthly and Quarterly Files to VM CoP.
   4.31.1. VM&A will use the LIMS-EV zip tool to package their OLVIMS files
   (daily/monthly/quarterly) and transfer them to VM CoP.
   4.31.2. VM&A will transfer their daily file to the VM CoP after completing end of day
   processing.
   4.31.3. VM&A will transfer their monthly file to the VM CoP NLT the 15th of the following
   month after completing end of month processing.
   4.31.4. VM&A will transfer their quarterly file to the VM CoP NLT the 15th day of the
   following month after completing quarterly processing.
4.32. Process LTIs.
   4.32.1. Process requests for repair authority and disposition instructions for vehicles to the
   using OLVIMS AFTO Form 91 Automated LTI function.
   4.32.2. Guidelines for determining repair allowances and approval levels are in TO 36-1-
   191.
   4.32.3. All LTIs for disposition/maintenance repair consideration will be sent to the “Using”
   MAJCOM for decision.
       4.32.3.1. Only direct labor and parts costs for actual repairs related to
       serviceability/functioning of asset will be used to determine if a vehicle is economically
       repairable. Do not include aesthetics such as corrosion control, paint complete, etc.
       4.32.3.2. MAJCOMs will forward all AF critical vehicle LTIs to the Item Managers for
       disposition action.
   4.32.4. Vehicle Management must ensure vehicles requiring an LTI for acceptance,
   disposition action and repair decisions are processed within 10 duty days of requirement.
   LTIs for shipping must be completed as soon as practical in order to meet RDO requirements
   (refer to paragraph 8.5.6)
   4.32.5. Vehicle Management must ensure vehicles are placed in proper condition prior to
   shipment IAW TO 36-1-191.
       4.32.5.1. The VFM/VMS will personally inspect all vehicles prior to shipment. Final
       shipping inspection responsibility may be delegated to the most senior-ranking shop
       supervisor during the absence of the VFM/VMS. For contracted vehicle maintenance
       units, vehicles must be inspected and documentation completed IAW the PWS.
       4.32.5.2. When validated by losing MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff (losing and
       gaining MAJCOM when applicable), the losing unit, including contracted vehicle
       maintenance units, are obligated to reimburse gaining unit for unserviceable conditions
       and damage not caused by shipping.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 119


       4.32.5.3. When a vehicle is shipped, it is the losing VM&A responsibility to contact the
       gaining VM&A and provide date shipped, document number, registration number and
       mode of shipment. It is the gaining VM&A responsibility to follow up on vehicles in
       shipment. In transit visibility will be through normal shipment modes not SBSS or
       LIMS-EV VV.
4.33. Establish and Update Supply Organizational Cost Center Records (OCCR) 518
Record.
   4.33.1. Only one (1) 518 Record for vehicles per base is allowed, unless managing vehicles
   owned by more than one MAJCOM, then establish a separate vehicle 518 Record for each
   owning MAJCOM. A separate OCCR must be established for vehicle account/s;
   independent of other type of accounts (Equipment, Bench Stock, etc).
   4.33.2. When reviewing 518 Record, ensure the following fields are complete and correct:
       4.33.2.1. “Organization ID” field will contain the organization ID of the Unit
       managing/signing vehicle account; normally LRS. For example, if the 63rd LRS
       manages/signs account (CA/CRL), organizational ID is “0063LGR70000”.
       4.33.2.2. The "MAJCOM" field is automatically populated by servicing supply function
       based on organization ID provided. Data is acquired from ROF record in AFEMS.
       4.33.2.3. The “Using Command” field will contain the command that programs
       replacement for the vehicles assigned to a particular account. This is the true owner of
       the vehicle assets.
       4.33.2.4. The “Organization Title” field is automatically populated by servicing supply
       function based on organization ID provided. Data is acquired from ROF record in
       AFEMS.
       4.33.2.5. The "Type Organization" field will have a “V” assigned. This identifies OCCR
       is only used for vehicle account(s).
Note: Contact the servicing supply function for assistance.
4.34. Responsible for Accountable SBSS Documents. Local VM&A is responsible for all
accountable supply documents (See local Supply Document Control or applicable section for
details) to include local and MAJCOM supply forms. These documents include: “A2 (X)”,
“REC VEH”, “ISU VEH”, “RVP REC”, “FET”, “TIN VEH”, “SHP VEH”, “FCH”, “1ETT”,
“1ETX”, “1ED”, “1GP”, “SRC” and supporting justifications and documentation for supply
related reports such as “R-59”, “M-10” and “Q-10”. AFVFSB will provide “RVP” and “FCH”
documents to VM&A. AFVFSB will also provide justification for M10 reports to VM&A.
Local VM&A is the liaison between AFVFSB and supply.
   4.34.1. The “R-59” is a supply-generated report that contains delinquent documents
   (accountable documents five days old).
   4.34.2. The “M-10” is an Inventory Adjustment Document register (Monthly) maintained by
   supply that contains changes to quantity or changers to NSN.
   4.34.3. The “Q-10” (Equipment Out of Balance Listing) is a supply maintained report that
   contains allowance (048) authorized and assigned out of balance.
 120                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   4.34.4. The authorized quantity and assigned/on hand quantity will always match.
4.35. Serve as Inspector for Vehicle Equipment Account and Receive Required
Training. This requirement is outlined in AFI 23-110.
   4.35.1. A person (or personnel) from VM&A will be appointed in writing by LRS
   Commander
4.36. Perform Analysis. VM&A is the focal point for collecting, storing, analyzing and
correcting vehicle data used for analysis.
   4.36.1. Effective vehicle management includes continuous process improvement by
   constantly assessing customer needs, analyzing services and monitoring efficiency, economy,
   utilization and cost of the vehicle fleet. The VFM/VMS are responsible for ensuring the
   analysis for evaluating fleet performance is accomplished. Fully document decisions,
   process improvements or corrective action taken as a result of analyst recommendations.
   Monitoring and controlling performance indicators (metrics) are usually done by exception
   when requested by VFM/VMS; however, the following indicators will be monitored
   monthly:
       4.36.1.1. NMC rates.
       4.36.1.2. Costs (per mile, per vehicle, and total).
       4.36.1.3. Maintenance (scheduled, delayed, and unscheduled).
       4.36.1.4. Labor-hours (direct, indirect productive and indirect non-productive).
       4.36.1.5. Utilization analysis.
   4.36.2. VMIF. This file is the source document for several data elements used in VM&A for
   management of the vehicle fleet. Section II of the file provides NSN, management code,
   replacement criteria and standard pricing information for all vehicles. Use of this section
   helps correct programming of OLVIMS vehicle master records and communications
   compatibility between VMIF and SBSS functions within the LRS. This file provides
   information for identifying suitable substitutes for similar vehicle types.
4.37. Degree of Analysis. Circumstances will dictate varying degrees of analysis. VFM/VMS
makes the call as to what performance indicator(s) will be analyzed, charted, plotted or otherwise
trended, and sets the frequencies for such analysis. OLVIMS PCN SB004-115 will satisfy the
data display requirements. LIMS-EV Vehicle View also can display data requirements.
   4.37.1. The level of performance achieved or the symptomatic condition of the indicator
   dictates which analysis action to follow.
       4.37.1.1. An indicator well within a set standard may not need any more analysis for that
       reporting period.
       4.37.1.2. An indicator just barely within a standard will need some analysis for that
       reporting period; it may need some analysis to find out why, whether corrective action is
       needed or other areas it may affect.
       4.37.1.3. An indicator that points to poor performance, worsening trends or unfavorable
       effects that may go on if not stopped, calls for in-depth analysis. In-depth analysis is
       "analysis that shows a performance deficiency or failure to reach a goal, explains why,
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     121


       shows the effect of the deficiency or substandard performance and outlines action that
       will help reach the goal.
   4.37.2. Analysis of the areas set by commanders or equivalents, MAJCOM, VFM/VMS
   make up most of the analysis effort by VM&A. The analyst must be aware of the savings in
   manpower and material cost, and the greater mission capabilities that may be gained by a
   more detailed analysis. During an in-depth analysis, certain factors perceived as the primary
   cause of the problem may not be the root of the problem. The scope of the analysis then is
   expanded, the true cause determined and corrective action is identified.
   4.37.3. Independent studies and analyses may not provide a definite conclusion when viewed
   alone. There are times when a larger base of data will be needed; a sampling may need a
   longer span of time; a first look shows nothing significant is expected to result; or when the
   end can be confidently predicted without doing a formal study.
   4.37.4. Studies and analyses may take the analyst out of the office. The analyst goes where
   the data is or where the process is conducted; this will require reviewing vehicle records
   jackets and vehicle historical records in VM&A, material cost data in Materiel Control, and
   sometimes working with a supervisor in the work center.
4.38. Using Analysis Products. The use of analysis helps management project existing
capabilities into plans and schedules and institute controls against variation. The results of the
review and analysis of collected data are needed in all successful planning phases. To be of
benefit, analysis and recommendations are used as soon as possible after completion.
Presentations are brief, factual, easily understood and must show the picture as it presently
exists. Most effective analysis is in response to VFM/VMS requests for special studies.
   4.38.1. AF/A4LE, MAJCOMs or individual installations may impose standards or develop
   goals for performance measurement.
       4.38.1.1. Standards or goals developed by a MAJCOM are tempered with considerations
       such as geographical location, seasonal peculiarities, deployment tempo, military and
       civilian staff mix, fleet age or composition, and parts availability.
       4.38.1.2. A large part of resource management is based on comparing a computed
       average to set standards that allow the significance of a bulk of data to be understood in a
       single value. An average may be the usual amount, rate, quality or time.
   4.38.2. A goal is a measure taken by general consent to be a basis for comparison. A
   standard may be based on analyzing past data alone, past data weighed with known values or
   on expert opinion. In any event, the criterion for making a valid standard or goal is founded
   on objectivity, suitability and reality. Some sources from which realistic goals may be set
   are: existing programs, maintenance reports, historical reports/records and unit plans and
   needs.
   4.38.3. The analysis process addresses two distinct phases that may or may not be used
   together. These are “production analysis” and “deficiency analysis”.
       4.38.3.1. Through data gathering and surveillance, production analysis is used to identify
       problems, highlight any that need additional study and identify areas that may represent a
       standard of excellence.

       4.38.3.2. The real troubleshooting is done through deficiency analysis as a key part of
       the analysis process. Perform deficiency analysis to whatever degree is needed to
       highlight and bring undesirable performance to an acceptable level.
   4.38.4. Use LIMS-EV Vehicle View to produce utilization analysis report as follows:
       4.38.4.1. From the LIMS-EV Vehicle View start-up page, click on the “Status” drop-
       down menu and select “Utilization”.
       4.38.4.2. Go to “Time Increments” and click on the drop-down menu and select “Fiscal
       Year”. Pull slide to highlight or encompass the year that data analysis is needed.
       4.38.4.3. Click the “All Organizations” drop-down menu and select desired base; click
       “Update”.
       4.38.4.4. In the “Grid View Buy” filter, select “Reg Number”.                Next, select
       “Organization” in the “GroupBy” filter.
       4.38.4.5. The data-grid will now display utilization information for each registration
       number assigned to the organization selected. A “child row” for each registration number
       displayed will indicate if the vehicle is “over” or “under” Fiscal Year (FY) mean mileage
       totals.
       4.38.4.6. The analysis report can be used by Fleet Managers to determine if vehicle
       rotations are justified.
4.39. Method of Presentation. For standardization, a way to present each performance
indicator is given as part of that indicator. For each of the indicators, the level of performance
achieved needs to be graphically displayed in chart form.
   4.39.1. If an indicator does not meet the established standard or goal, the VFM/VMS will be
   informed to determine if an in-depth analysis is needed.
   4.39.2. The analysis or study narrative addresses such things as the primary cause of the
   problem, factors that affect it, recommendations for correcting the deficiency and anticipated
   time required for correction. A narrative may be required on all standard indicators each
   month by the VFM/VMS.
4.40. Presentation of the Analysis. Some general presentation rules are:
   4.40.1. Understanding that the value of management information lies in its being used while
   it is still valid and current. Strive for its use by the appropriate personnel.
   4.40.2. Use flexible rules and techniques. There are circumstances when it may be
   impossible to show a result properly if forced to conform to a rigid method. When possible,
   comply with the rules, but deviate if it allows better analysis.
   4.40.3. Make a briefing which covers the collected data in a professional way. Briefings
   address such things as "what, where, how, when and why" and suggest corrective or
   preventive actions. Briefings are concise, clear and easily understood by those to whom they
   are directed.
   4.40.4. Set up a program to coordinate analysis findings with the VFM/VMS before the
   formal presentation to the LRS Commander or equivalent each month or as scheduled.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     123


   4.40.5. Show statistical or narrative data in some usable form. Properly tabulate and arrange
   data for analysis or projection. Data credibility suffers when shown in a confusing or
   unfamiliar way. Keep it simple and key the presentation to those who will review it. The
   following aids in making graphic presentations:
       4.40.5.1. Plan the construction in advance; keep it simple, honest and accurate. Do not
       give the wrong impression.
       4.40.5.2. Start scale values at zero, or bracket the reference point, and keep the
       background clear of unnecessary gridlines.
       4.40.5.3. Name the presentation fully and accurately; use one subject at a time to keep
       from crowding the material.
       4.40.5.4. Use short but complete notes where necessary and be sure the presentation is
       informative.
4.41. Performance Indicators (Metrics).
   4.41.1. The OSD has issued guidance (DOD 4500.36-R) to measure and monitor labor-hour
   productivity within DOD Vehicle Management activities for the following purposes:
       4.41.1.1. To support vehicle repair decisions and develop budgets at base level.
       4.41.1.2. To determine the number of delayed work-hours attributed to lack of available
       personnel.
       4.41.1.3. To identify training needs, job performance evaluations, shop equipment, tools
       and facility upgrades.
       4.41.1.4. To determine the management efficiency of individuals, work centers,
       management activities and higher headquarters (MAJCOM).
       4.41.1.5. To determine if Vehicle Management personnel are being used efficiently.
   4.41.2. The VFM, VMS, LRS Commander or equivalent, or MAJCOM Vehicle
   Management Staff makes use of these indicators, or develop their own indicators to meet
   their own circumstances. Indicators are analyzed as prescribed by the VFM/VMS and
   recommended actions are provided if the performance does not meet minimum standards.
   Standard performance indicators have been automated and can be obtained each month by
   producing “PCN SB004-115” (OLVIMS Automated Analysis) or using LIMS-EV Vehicle
   View.
4.42. Specific Performance Indicators Products. Various OLVIMS products that will be
reviewed/monitored monthly, with analysis performed as needed, are listed below in Table 4.3,
Specific Performance Indicator Products. See AFCSM 24-1 for explanations and examples of
performance charts that are part of the OLVIMS Automated Analysis Report.

Cost Analysis                                  O&M analysis is required to ensure that money
                                               and manpower are not wasted. The analysis
                                               must identify unfavorable cost trends and
                                               prime vehicles or groups of vehicles using
                                               large amounts of labor or material. O&M costs
                                               are combined and shown as a single cost.
                                               Costs are also available via LIMS-EV
                                               VEHICLE VIEW.
Average Cost Per Unit is Indicator #1 on PCN   See rules 1 through 31, Attachment 6, for
SB004-115                                      analysis procedures.

Average cost Per Mile (Administrative Fleet)   See rules 1 through 31, Attachment 6, for

Delayed Parts Received (Bin Location)(PCN      Monthly use this report with Materiel Control
SB004-062)                                     to jointly verify parts received and bin location
                                               of parts.
NMCM Hours to Direct Labor-Hours               A shop’s ability to respond to workload may
Percentage.                                    be measured by use of this indicator. It checks
                                               the percentage of direct productive labor-hours
                                               in relation to the number of NMCM hours on
                                               AF Forms 1823/-1. The intent is to keep the
                                               spread of these two factors to a minimum.
NMCM Hours or Direct Labor-Hour Ratio          See rule 32, Attachment 6, for analysis

                                                  shops will manually accumulate the total
                                                  backlog hours and track, chart, or analyze at
                                                  least two categories, hours with parts on hand
                                                  and other delayed hours. Over a 12-month
                                                  period, these shops should be able to develop
                                                  an acceptable level of backlog hours, which
                                                  will result in efficient shop management.
Percent Direct Labor is Indicator #8 on PCN       See rules 54 through 58 of Attachment 6 for
SB004-115                                         analysis procedures.
Percent Indirect Labor Productive is Indicator    See rule 59 of Attachment 6 for analysis

Indicator #10 on PCN SB004-115                    procedures. VM&A personnel will use rules
                                                  54 through 60 in Attachment 6 and the data in
                                                  OLVIMS PCNs SB004-029 and SB004-032 to
                                                  check on labor usage by work center.
Percent of Fleet NMCM is Indicator #11 on         See rules 31 through 46 in Attachment 6 for
PCN SB004-115                                     analysis procedures.

Percent of Fleet NMCS is Indicator #12 on         See rules 47 through 53 in Attachment 6 for
PCN SB004-115                                     analysis procedures.
Percent of Fleet NMC is Indicator #13 on PCN      See rules 31 through 53 in Attachment 6 for
SB004-115                                         analysis procedures.

Non-registered Vehicles and Equipment             See rules 31 through 53 in Attachment 6 and
(USAF management codes that begin with a          the data in OLVIMS PCN SB004-008 or
numeric character)                                SB004-032 to see which vehicles or groups of
                                                  vehicles have abnormal NMC rates.
Indicator #4 on PCN SB004-115                     This indicator is longer valid and should be
                                                  disregarded.
4.43. Other Indicators. There is a continuing need to check and measure motor vehicle related
statistical and historical data beyond that outlined in this chapter. There is almost no end to the
material to be reviewed, just as there is no end to the need to improve customer service and save
resources. While some of the following areas may be used as part of any major analysis, they
also lend themselves to independent tests and analyses. In some way, each of the areas affects
the outcome of the total vehicle management effort. They are not listed in priority order, nor can
any be singled out as being more important than the other. The analyst must weigh each on a
basis of what the goal is at a given time. The remainder of this paragraph covers "other
indicators" that will be monitored at the direction of the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs
and/or the VFM/VMS who will set goals to gauge the effectiveness of these indicators.
 126                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   4.43.1. Repeat Maintenance. This is often found to be one of the main causes of high costs
   and low MC rates. A high occurrence of repeat maintenance may indicate improper
   scheduling, inadequate quality control, failure to use test equipment to diagnose malfunctions
   or the need for training. Use PCN SB004-032 - Part 10 to see which vehicles or equipment
   items are in and out of the shop too often. Also, see Rule 14 in Attachment 6 for analysis
   guidance.
   4.43.2. Contract Maintenance and Other Government Agency costs. By analyzing these
   costs, it may be possible to identify inadequate manning, skill levels, shop layout, tools and
   equipment, and the extent to which in-house capabilities may be improved. It may be best to
   check these indicators in major vehicle categories. See PCN SB004-032 for the data to be
   used in this review. See rules 35 and 36 of Attachment 6 for analysis guidance.
4.44. Other Areas to Monitor. The following areas do not need to be charted, but must be
checked by VM&A:
   4.44.1. Vehicle and Equipment Work Order Status. Remove appropriate AF Forms 1823/-1
   from the Work Order Master File Status Report (PCN SB004-018) on a timely basis.
   Validate AF Forms 1823/-1 on the list 45 days or longer.
   4.44.2. Transient Vehicles. Mail, fax or electronically transmit the vehicle repair transaction
   report (PCN SB004-019) and fuel report to the vehicle’s home base as soon as they are
   received.
4.45. Controlling and Evaluating Problem Areas. When unfavorable trends or indicators are
present, VM&A will use Attachment 6 to identify problem areas and their causes and effects.
Attachment 6 also reflects suggested review procedures and preventive measures. When
performing analysis, refrain from using inflation as a cause for increased cost-per-mile, the aging
fleet for increased NMCM rates or other often used ”crutches“.
   4.45.1. When investigating the cause of poor performance or when trying to isolate the
   prime reasons for a bad trend, try all the procedures listed in Attachment 6.
   4.45.2. All situations are not in Attachment 6; conditions that are command or base related
   may affect a situation in one case and may not in another.

Section 4C—Reviewing Base Support and OPLANs with IDRC

4.46. Interservice Vehicle Support. Interservice support among DOD components will be
used where economies can be realized without impairing mission effectiveness. DODI 4000.19,
Interservice and Intergovernmental Support, 9 August 1995, implements policy concerning
interservice support. As a rule, the DOD component having the greater AOR (equipment and
manpower) furnishes the support requested to the extent capabilities and military commitments
permit.
4.47. Arranging for Interservice Vehicle Support. Arrangements for Interservice support
generally provide that DOD components furnishing the service will not assume any liability
whatsoever for personal injury or property damage caused by any vehicle while it is in the
custody of the using component. The using DOD components must:
   4.47.1. Assume the cost of picking up and delivering vehicles.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  127


   4.47.2. Properly operate, maintain and use vehicles in their custody.
   4.47.3. Take administrative action relating to damage/theft of the motor vehicle in their
   custody.
   4.47.4. Assume responsibility for any damages resulting from accidents, abuses or incidents
   while the vehicle is in their possession.
4.48. Activity Pooling. A transportation and equipment (vehicle motor) pool:
   4.48.1. Operates where it will be most economical or provides the most satisfactory
   transportation service.
   4.48.2. Pools full or partial transportation assets of separate activities. The pool segments
   are located within an area most convenient to the majority of the vehicle users.
   4.48.3. Is administered by a lead activity designated by the components. It may be
   subdivided locally as necessary. Agreements for activity pooling are sent through channels
   to AF/A4LE for coordination.
4.49. Establish, Execute, Initiate and Conduct All Vehicle Recalls. Incorporate vehicle
redistribution plans in the transportation annex to the basic plan as applicable.

Section 4D—Vehicle Support Resulting From Terrorist Threats

4.50. Overview. Because of terrorist activities, the AF has a program to provide heavy and light
armored vehicles, domicile-to-duty transportation, and vehicle painting and marking exceptions
for threatened key personnel and senior officers.              AF Criminal Investigation &
Counterintelligence (SAF/IGX) consolidates and validates all requests for these special vehicles
or marking waivers in response to terrorist threats.
4.51. Submission Procedures:
   4.51.1. The requesting MAJCOM, DRU or FOA Vehicle Management Staffs submits all
   requests for special vehicle requirements to SAF/IGX.
   4.51.2. SAF/IGX validates special vehicle requirements based on terrorist threats. Once
   validated, SAF/IGX provides a recommendation to AF/A4L and A4P.
4.52. Armored Vehicle Requirements.
   4.52.1. New Armored Vehicle Procurement. AF/A4PR ensures the recommendation is
   consistent with public law, EOs and DODDs and approves the recommendation.
   Procurement, both quantity and unit cost, must be authorized by Congress. If approved, the
   MAJCOM allocates necessary 3080, BP8200 funds in applicable MBPAC funding line.
   4.52.2. Light Armored Vehicles. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may request SAF/IGX
   approval for procuring and installing approved protection on existing vehicles. Submit
   requests when any of these conditions exist:
   4.52.3. The level of protection required makes the installation of armor on an existing
   vehicle more advantageous or economical.
   4.52.4. Agreements provide separate funding for vehicles and armor.
 128                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   4.52.5. Application of armor on an existing vehicle is the only method for obtaining armored
   vehicles.

Section 4E—VCP

4.53. Establishing and Managing Installation VCP.
   4.53.1. VM&A personnel will develop a training plan and thoroughly train newly appointed
   VCO/VCNCOs on their duties (Refer to Chapter 10). Training will include LIMS-EV
   Vehicle View to show VCO/VCNCOs how to view ETICs, generate hand receipts and
   master reports. The training will also include how to build “saved views”.
       4.53.1.1. Introduction to duties should include a briefing on current wing vehicle
       management or vehicle use policies; such as wing accident/abuse policy or installation
       idling policy (refer to paragraph 10.4.14)
   4.53.2. A knowledge test will be administered to new VCO/VCNCOs after training. A
   passing grade of 70 percent or higher is required in order to assume duties. A sample test can
   be     downloaded        from      the     VCP      folder     within    the     VM      CoP:
   https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/DocMan/DocMain.asp?Filter=OO-LG-AF-
   66&FolderID=OO-LG-AF-66-21-13-13&Tab=0. VM&A personnel may modify or add to
   the questions on the test to meet local requirements.
   4.53.3. Associate units will participate in and support the host VCP. Associate unit VCPs
   are subject to assessment by the host command Inspector General (IG).
Note: AFOSI vehicles leased through GSA in Continental United States (CONUS) are exempt
from inspections and staff assistance visits.
   4.53.4. All units are required to have a VCO/VCNCO if the unit has vehicles or OGMVCs
   assigned. VCO/VCNCOs should refer to Chapter 10 for more information concerning
   duties and responsibilities.
   4.53.5. VM&A personnel will conduct a VCP staff assistance visit with each unit
   VCO/VCNCO annually. The results will be documented to include the topics discussed,
   noted discrepancies and noteworthy comments and provide report to the unit commander or
   equivalent within 30 days after the visit. Copies may be provided to tenant command staff
   assistance teams and IG teams upon request. The VCO/VCNCO is provided the following
   information during each visit:
       4.53.5.1. Issues such as operational problems, security, operator training, licensing,
       lesson plans and misuse will be discussed.
       4.53.5.2. A computation of O&M cost per mile for each unit vehicle.
       4.53.5.3. Utilization/rotational analysis.
       4.53.5.4. Annual Training Requirement IAW AFI 24-301.
   4.53.6. LIMS-EV Vehicle View provides capability to view utilization data to support
   annual rotational analysis requirements. If conducting analysis using LIMS-EV Vehicle
   View, keep the same vehicle types within the same unit or mission types. For example: Two
   B200s assigned to the same unit, one asset with 4,000 miles and the other with 12,000.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  129


   Reassign the asset with the lower miles. To access the “Utilization View” within in LIMS-
   EV Vehicle View, click on the “STATUS” drop down and select “Utilization”. Next, apply
   the applicable organizational and vehicle related filters. Results will display selected
   vehicles and associated mileage along with other asset attributes.
   4.53.7. VM&A will conduct a VCO/VCNCO meeting at least once a year. Topics will
   include: preventative maintenance, official use guidance, safety, operator care and any other
   information deemed necessary by Vehicle Management.
   4.53.8. Vehicle Assessment Inspections. Vehicle Management will perform vehicle
   assessment inspections as part of the VCP. The inspections are used to assess operator care
   and unit/operator documentation requirements.
      4.53.8.1. Conduct inspection of at least 25 percent of each unit’s AF owned or leased
      vehicle fleet every calendar year using AF Form 4431, Vehicle Assessment Inspection.
      CSC personnel will inspect vehicles and complete AF Form 4431.
      4.53.8.2. Inspections will be completed when a vehicle is turned-in for scheduled PM&I
      or before a leased asset is taken for annual inspection.
          4.53.8.2.1. If 25 percent of a unit’s assigned vehicles are not scheduled for a PM&I
          during the calendar year, complete AF Form 4431 in conjunction with unscheduled or
          minor maintenance actions.
Note: If AF Form 4355 completion is due, completion of AF Form 4431 can be accomplished at
that time.
      4.53.8.3. Assessment Scoring. All vehicles start with 100 points. When minor or major
      discrepancy point values are accessed in corresponding areas/item on the AF From 4431,
      discrepancy points will be totaled and subtracted from 100 with the sum being the
      vehicle’s score. A “Minor” discrepancy has a point value of “10” and a “Major”
      discrepancy has a point value of “25”. If either of the following two conditions exists,
      discrepancy points will not be assessed.
          4.53.8.3.1. Vehicle discrepancies or areas that were previously identified (e.g.,
          delayed for parts/maintenance, waivered, “P” coded, etc.) and documented by Vehicle
          Management.
          4.53.8.3.2. Vehicle discrepancies already identified on the appropriate Operator’s
          Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form at the time of the inspection/turn-in;
          provided the discrepancy meets the maintenance reporting/turn-in requirements
          established in paragraph 3.19.2.
      4.53.8.4. Vehicles meeting a condition described on the AF Form 4431 as a “FAILURE”
      is an automatic failure for that vehicle and the recorded score will be zero.
      4.53.8.5. The following rating scale will be used based on a vehicle assessment score:
      Outstanding = 90-100, Excellent = 80 – 89, Satisfactory = 70 – 79, Marginal = 60 – 69
      and Unsatisfactory < 59.
      4.53.8.6. Individual vehicle scores for each unit will be averaged, covering the previous
      calendar year’s assessment period, to produce an overall assessment score for each unit.
      NLT 1 March each year, VM&A will provide average score, analysis, comments and/or
 130                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       trends to using organization’s VCO/VCNCO and commander or equivalent. Copies of
       AF Form 4431 will be provided to VCO/VCNCO or using organization’s commander
       upon request.

     4.58.2.15. Total of sales slips on adding machine tape or other printed media, and
     attached to sales slip.
  4.58.3. Each person authorized to sign for parts is responsible for seeing that the data
  elements listed above are present on each sales slip before signing for the parts. Upon
  completion of the sales slip, the recipient signs the sales slip using the same signature as the
  sample signature on the COPARS authorization list. Materiel Control ensures that discounts
  have been figured accurately and provides them to VM&A, along with the adding machine
  tape or other printed media of the total of all sales slips, on a daily basis. Sales slips for the
  day are numbered consecutively, to include copies of voided slips.
  4.58.4. Process COPARS transactions through OLVIMS each duty day.
     4.58.4.1. VM&A processes the sales slip cost data by line item (except L9999) into
     OLVIMS.
     4.58.4.2. VM&A verifies the sales slip line items with PCN SB004-005 and makes
     corrections as necessary. These sales slips are then returned to Materiel Control for
     filing.
     4.58.4.3. Input all discounts or charges such as premium communications and
     transportation, and COPARS overtime, to OLVIMS, as identified by Materiel Control.
     4.58.4.4. VM&A adjusts cost data in OLVIMS, as identified by the ALO for such things
     as prompt payment discounts or other financial adjustments.
  4.58.5. When a part costing more than $100 comes with a warranty VM&A records the
  provisions in OLVIMS on the "PZ" transaction, which can then be monitored using the PCN
 132                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   49. Specific warranties are noted on the COPARS sales slip. VFM/VMS determines if
   warranty tracking is accomplished for parts costing less than $100.
4.59. Complete CA/CRL Annual Validation. The VFM/VMS, or representatives from
VM&A, will be appointed (in writing) by the LRS Commander or equivalent as the equipment
custodian for their vehicle accounts. The equipment custodian will be responsible to sign the
CA/CRL annually or when custodian changes to validate the inventory actually took place and to
verify that action has been taken to resolve any noted discrepancies.
   4.59.1. The LRS Commander or equivalent will review and endorse the CA/CRL after
   VFM/VMS or representatives from VM&A have accomplished the inventory.
4.60. Turning In Vehicles to DLA-DS. Policy and processes associated with turning in
vehicles to DLA-DS are covered in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 4. Additional
information is available at https://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/.
4.61. Withdrawing Vehicles from DLA-DS.
   4.61.1. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff must approve vehicles withdrawn from DLA-
   DS to be placed in the AF inventory. Vehicle Management must certify a vehicle as
   economically repairable and warrants withdrawal action.
   4.61.2. Vehicles previously loaded in the AF inventory can be withdrawn for use in AF
   training courses as a Vehicle Management training aid for non over-the-road use with
   approval from MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff. Submit request through the LRS
   Equipment Liaison Office.
4.62. Vehicle End-Of-Life (EOL) Determination.
   4.62.1. Vehicle EOL (when the vehicle should be retired and replaced with a new asset) is a
   calendar year (CY) value (e.g., 2012, 2013, etc). Vehicle EOL values are available in LIMS-
   EV Vehicle View. Click “Status” and select “Requirements”. View by searching on
   registration number or any other asset attributes. The EOL model incorporated into LIMS-
   EV Vehicle View was designed using a similar methodology as used in civilian industry.
   EOL model provides a more dynamic logic that includes flat line depreciation and
   sustainment costs. Two assets purchased in the same procurement year could have different
   EOL values depending on sustainment costs for each vehicle.
   4.62.2. Methodology or Logic:
       4.62.2.1. The model uses the NSN, management code and standard price to depreciate a
       vehicle 15 percent each year over a 20-year period, based on the established depreciative
       value of the prior year. For vehicles that have a standard price over $250,000, the
       depreciated value will be 20 percent a year based on the established depreciative value of
       the prior year.
       4.62.2.2. The model uses previous year's O&M costs and increase by three percent each
       year for 20 years. Obtain the baseline Operations and Maintenance cost data from the
       monthly VEA files by summing the following fields: Contract Maintenance Costs, Total
       Direct Labor, Total Parts Cost, Other Government Agency Cost, Contract Costs (Exclude
       any figure over $50,000 because the depot rebuild costs are used as a part of the direct
       maintenance costs will temporarily cause the life expectancy to decrease).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      133


Note: If a year's worth of data is not available, then for estimating the annual direct operations
and maintenance costs the model will use what is currently available.
       4.62.2.3. The EOL value will be determined when projected operations and maintenance
       costs exceed the depreciative value of the vehicle. The actual estimated replacement year
       will be the year that the direct operations and maintenance costs exceed the depreciative
       value of the vehicle. Then subtract the X number of years needed for budget forecasts
       purposes.
       4.62.2.4. When viewing an asset EOL in LIMS-EV VV there are three values tied to the
       vehicle: “Replace Year”, “Calculated Replace Year” and “Calculated Life In Years”.
           4.62.2.4.1. Replace Year - Indicates the CY that an asset should be funded for
           replacement. It will always be the current CY or out years. All vehicles that have
           already reached EOL but continue to be utilized will have a replace year equal to
           current CY. Any vehicle not at EOL will have a replace year equal to the calculated
           replace year.
           4.62.2.4.2. Calculated Replace Year - The CY year an asset reaches EOL. This value
           will match “Replace Year” when the projected EOL value for the asset is equal to or
           beyond current CY.
           4.62.2.4.3. Calculated Life In Years - The expected life in years an asset will be
           utilized and is dependent upon the acceptance year and EOL year.
Note: Refer to Attachment 9, Capability Based Funding and Vehicle Prioritization Model,
for additional information.
4.63. Interagency Motor Pools and Systems.
   4.63.1. IAW Title 40 United States Code Section 601, the Administrator of GSA has the
   actual responsibility for the establishment and operation of interagency motor pools and
   systems. GSA develops necessary data and cost statistics to determine the economic
   feasibility of establishing a motor pool in an area. DOD components are notified if
   consolidation is feasible.
   4.63.2. Managing GSA Vehicles. Use GSA vehicles for official purposes only. If leasing
   GSA vehicles is more expensive than using AF-owned vehicles, or the AF cannot resolve
   operational problems with the interagency Motor Pool, AF activities will send full details
   through channels to AF/A4LE for resolution.
   4.63.3. Discontinuing Interagency Motor Pools. The Administrator of General Services
   shall discontinue a motor vehicle pool or system if there are no actual savings realized (based
   on accounting as provided in 40 USC § 605) during a reasonable period of not longer than
   two successive fiscal years.
4.64. FORCE/FSE Management Codes. Use the management codes and standardized
Vehicle/Make/Type listed in Table 4.4 to load FORCE equipment into OLVIMS. The same
management codes will continue to be used for FSE; the year model in the registration number
will provide an easy means to differentiate FORCE and FSE.

Section 4G—Registration Numbers, License Plates, FMVRS Requirements, Special
Identification and Marking

4.65. Registration Numbers.
   4.65.1. SBSS reportable registration numbers are assigned to motor vehicles and designated
   non-motorized vehicular equipment. Registration numbers are also required for all AF
   activities (including the ANG and the AFR) that record vehicles on any type of property
   account.
   4.65.2. The following items do not require SBSS reportable vehicle registration numbers:
       4.65.2.1. Vehicles that are withdrawn from DLA-DS (IAW paragraph 3.36)
Note: Vehicle assets in DLA-DS are not eligible for X-registration numbers. If such assets are
to be withdrawn and placed into service, requirements in paragraph 3.36.2 must be complied
with and asset will have normal registration number assigned.
       4.65.2.2. Non-self-propelled MHE. Examples include two- or four-wheeled hand trucks,
       warehouse trailers or hoists.
       4.65.2.3. Aerospace ground or hanger equipment. Examples include bomb lift trailers,
       trailer-mounted air conditioners and oxygen or nitrogen-servicing carts.
       4.65.2.4. Vehicle attachments. Examples include bulldozer and snowplow blades or
       refuse containers.
       4.65.2.5. Non-motorized bicycles.
       4.65.2.6. Non-self-propelled agricultural implements.
       4.65.2.7. Mobile homes or house trailers.
       4.65.2.8. Vehicles earmarked for the Military Assistance Program (MAP).
   4.65.3. The appropriate vehicle IM at WR-ALC assigns all vehicle registration numbers.
   4.65.4. VM&A requests X-registration numbers from VEMSO considered by the IM as not
   requiring SBSS control. X-registration numbers are not reportable in SBSS (not on a vehicle
   account).
       4.65.4.1. Vehicles changed by modification to a different basic type must have old
       registration numbers canceled by the losing IM and new registration numbers assigned by
       the gaining IM.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 135


      4.65.4.2. The responsible IM obtains registration numbers for vehicular support
      equipment from WR-ALC. These numbers must have an alpha "W" in the third position.
      They are not reportable in SBSS (not on a vehicle account).
   4.65.5. The VCO/VCNCO submits a request for a registration number to VM&A. The
   VFM/VMS forwards approved recommendations through the MAJCOM Vehicle
   Management Staff to the appropriate IM at WR-ALC for any vehicle that does not have a
   registration number but meets the above criteria. If doubt exists, VFM/VMS will request a
   registration number. The IM either assigns the number or advises VFM/VMS to request an
   X-registration number from the VEMSO.
      4.65.5.1. Registration number requests will include NSN, description, model year or year
      of manufacture, and chassis serial or VIN of the vehicle. AF Form 86, Request for
      Cataloging Data/ Action, lists this information if the vehicle does not have a valid NSN.
      4.65.5.2. As soon as practical after the receipt of registration number, order the
      applicable AF license plate(s) from UNICOR with the registration number embossed on
      the plate(s).
   4.65.6. WR-ALC will:
      4.65.6.1. Assigns registration numbers or advises activities to request an X-registration
      number from VEMSO.
      4.65.6.2. Makes sure a current listing of reportable vehicle NSNs is maintained.
      4.65.6.3. Makes sure that other AF publications citing definitions or registration
      techniques conform to this AFI.
   4.65.7. Vehicle Management will:
      4.65.7.1. Ensure registered vehicles display registration numbers using appropriate AF
      license plates or stenciled markings IAW TO 36-1-191.
   4.65.8. Destroy or return license AF05 plates to UNICOR, or obliterate registration number
   stencil, IAW TO 36-1-191 when vehicles are removed from the AF inventory and transferred
   to:
      4.65.8.1. The DLA-DS.
      4.65.8.2. Another agency for other than repair and return.
      4.65.8.3. A MAP.
      4.65.8.4. Conversion to a training aid.
4.66. Vehicle License Plate Program. Additional information can be found in paragraph 8.8
and TO 36-1-191.
   4.66.1. Procurement. UNICOR is the only source for AF approved license plates for AF
   registered vehicles, OGMVCs, trailers not classified as a vehicle or motorcycles. Vehicle
   Management personnel must request authorization to order/purchase AF approved license
   plates. MAJCOMs approve unit license plate purchaser request.
   4.66.2. To become an authorized license plate purchaser go to the VM CoP and on the
   bottom left of the home page (under Vehicle E-tools) click on the "AF License Plates" link.
 136                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   Complete the form then click on “submit” button at the bottom of the form. Form will be e-
   mailed to the unit’s MAJCOM for approval.
Notes:
1. On the request form, use the comment block to provide the names of the individual(s) being
removed or replaced.
2. UNICOR limits authorized purchasers to two per unit.
   4.66.3. Disposition of plates. Vehicle Management will return all AF05 license plates to
   UNICOR for destruction for vehicles sent to DLA-DS or having expired license plates.
   Senders will need to fill out the “Federal Motor Vehicle License Plate Return Form” located
   on the VM CoP under the topic “FMVRS” in the Discussion Forum.
       4.66.3.1. All other AF plates (those without a bar code and expiration date) can be
       destroyed locally or returned to UNICOR for destruction.
Note: UNICOR will provide Vehicle Management a certificate of destruction. VM&A will
establish a license plate program management file (electronic or hard copy) for the storage of all
UNICOR correspondence to include certificates of destruction.
   4.66.4. The status of all AF05 plates must be changed to “PD-Pending Destruction” in
   FMVRS.
4.67. Lost or Stolen AF License Plates. IAW GSA directives, under the authority of the
Department of Home Land Security, UNICOR cannot remake or reissue duplicate pre-stamped
plates until such time the original plates are returned to UNICOR.
   4.67.1. If new (replacement) plates (AF05R) are needed because the original plate(s) cannot
   be recovered, Vehicle Management will be required to order replacement license plates with
   a “R “suffix through UNICOR web site; for example “AF11B12345R”.
   4.67.2. All orders for replacement plates will require approval from VEMSO prior to
   UNICOR acceptance. The following steps must be taken to secure the AF05R plate:
       4.67.2.1. Notify local authorities (SF and OSI).
       4.67.2.2. Change lost/stolen plate status to "MS" (missing) in FMVRS.
       4.67.2.3. Login to UNICOR and order "AF05R" plate (this plate is located under the
       "Replacement Tags" tab).
       4.67.2.4. Send VEMSO a copy of the Police report or a letter from the Squadron
       Commander authorizing the purchase of replacement plate. UNICOR will not send a
       replacement plate until the AF Program Manager "VEMSO" has validated the
       requirement on "R" plate orders. Note: AF05R replacement plates are not required for
       "damaged" plate replacement. Damaged AF05 plates will be exchanged for replacement
       AF05 plate(s) with UNICOR.
4.68. FMVRS Registration Requirements. VM&A personnel are required to utilize FMVRS
to manage and update vehicle and AF license plate status.
Notes:
1. Only those vehicles that display or will display plate number AF05(R) are required to be
registered on the FMVRS website https://fmvrs.fas.gsa.gov/.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    137


2. AFCENT locations are exempt from FMVRS.
3. Additional information concerning FMVRS requirements and UNICOR plate ordering
registration can be found on the VM CoP.
   4.68.1. To register for an FMVRS account (or have an account unlocked) contact VEMSO at
   afelm.vemso@langley.af.mil.
Note: FMVRS accounts are established for vehicle fleets, not individuals.
   4.68.2. Loading vehicles into FMVRS. There are two methods for this type of transaction,
   bulk vehicle upload and individual vehicle upload.
       4.68.2.1. Bulk Vehicle Upload: Populate excel spreadsheet at bottom of the FMVRS
       main menu. Then click on the “Bulk Data Upload” button in middle of the main menu
       page.
       4.68.2.2. Individual Vehicle Upload: Accomplished by clicking the “Vehicle Detail”
       link from the FMVRS main menu and filling in all appropriate data.
Notes:
1. DO NOT enter the vehicle registration number in the “FEDTAG” field during vehicle upload.
The actual vehicle registration number can be entered in the “Equip Number” or “Additional
Tag” field.
2. Make sure all data is correct prior to loading. Additionally, make sure that the VIN and Tag
Number are not already loaded in system.
3. If the vehicle was purchased during a normal bulk buy through GSA's Auto Choice it will be
loaded at the time of purchase by VIN only.
4. Tag numbers (i.e., AF11B12345) are loaded by UNICOR upon shipment of license plates.
Once UNICOR loads the tag number in the system it will need to be assigned using the "Assign
License Plate to VIN" link on the main menu of FMVRS.
5. All X registration number must be verified by VEMSO prior to loading in the FMVRS to
eliminate duplicates.
       4.68.2.3. When a new vehicle is assigned, and already loaded in FMVRS, change the
       status of vehicle to “Active” and update the contact information.
       4.68.2.4. When new plates are received and installed, update the license plate status to
       “AT-Attached”. This will be accomplished no later than 10 duty days from receipt.
       4.68.2.5. When plates are removed, update the license plate status to “DA-Destroyed by
       Agency” or “PD-Pending Destruction” for plates being returned to UNICOR.
       4.68.2.6. Change vehicle status to “SD-SOLD” for all vehicles sent to DLA-DS.
   4.68.3. Agency Vehicle Inventory Listing. To retrieve and sort a vehicle inventory listing
   select " Agency Vehicle Inventory " from the lower left hand side of the FMVRS main menu.
   Select appropriate Command from the drop down menu if not already selected. Enter a
   destination e-mail address for the report to be sent to, then click “Submit”. The system will
   send an e-mail containing a link to the requested list. Once the list is downloaded, filter the
   sheet to the base needed. This can be accomplished by filtering to the city/state or zip
   code of the primary contact.

   4.68.4. Agency License Plate Inventory Listing. To retrieve and sort a license plate
   inventory listing select “Agency License Plate Inventory” from the lower left hand side of the
   FMVRS main menu. Select the appropriate Command from the drop down menu if not
   already selected. Next, select the License Plate Status “Include all statuses except “AT”.
   Enter a destination e-mail address for the report to be sent to, then click “Submit”. The
   system will send an e-mail containing a link to the requested list. Once the list is
   downloaded, filter the sheet to the base needed. This can be accomplished by filtering to the
   city/state or zip code of the primary contact.
4.69. Special Identification.
   4.69.1. General and Flag Officer Identification. Plates indicating the occupancy of a vehicle
   by a general or flag officer are affixed to the front of the vehicle. In addition, AF
   Commanders or equivalents at the installation group level or above, and other persons as
   designated by MAJCOM /CC may display distinguishing metal plates on their motor
   vehicles.
   4.69.2. “White Top” Vehicles. AF owned, commercial or GSA leased vehicles authorized
   for use by Wing/Base Commanders (or equivalent level) are not authorized to have the tops
   painted or marked white.
       4.69.2.1. Wing/Base Commander (or equivalent level) vehicles currently with a "White
       Top" may retain current color scheme at MAJCOM discretion. However, future
       authorizations or replacement vehicles will not be authorized "white tops”.
       4.69.2.2. Additionally, the using organization is responsible for all cost including vehicle
       damage or paint mismatch caused by the 3M Controlac Plus Graphic Film (or equivalent)
       during the removal process on GSA-leased vehicles.
4.70. Markings.
   4.70.1. All markings must comply with TO 36-1-191.
   4.70.2. Remove all vehicle markings when the vehicle is permanently disposed of.
   4.70.3. Exemptions from Identification Markings. Vehicles which are exempt from DOD
   identification markings (paragraph 4.50) shall be registered and inspected IAW the laws of
   the State, Commonwealth, territory or possession in which they are primarily used.
   4.70.4. Motor vehicles regularly used for intelligence, investigative or security purposes are
   exempt from identification and marking provisions. These include vehicles:
       4.70.4.1. Used by the AFOSI.
       4.70.4.2. Required to be exempted under a SOFA.
4.71. Complying with International Agreements. When required by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) or other international agreements, AF vehicles must contain the markings
prescribed in standards that have been ratified by the US commands having jurisdiction over the
military activities in these countries. Unless AF/A4LE instructs otherwise, logistics readiness
officers must make sure military activities comply with these international agreements.

Section 4H—Vehicle Requirements, Procurement and Recapitalization
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    139


4.72. Overview. Federal law controls the purchase of vehicles for government use. Congress
authorizes the purchase of government vehicles through the Appropriations Act and sets
statutory price limitations for purchasing of certain vehicles. Quantities listed in authorization
documents for vehicles determine budgetary requirements and must not include additional assets
for in-maintenance replacements, pipeline or vehicles in depot maintenance. Meet peak
workload and unusual requirements for vehicles by borrowing from other government agencies,
renting or leasing vehicles from GSA or commercial sources. When approved, POVs may be
used on a reimbursable basis according to the JTR.
   4.72.1. WR-ALC initiates vehicle acquisitions for the AF through the vehicle buy program.
   WR-ALC is the central procurement agency for all AF vehicle purchases. AF agencies will
   not purchase vehicles without prior coordination and written approval from WR-ALC
   Program Manager.. WR-ALC is required to go through GSA initially unless they are unable
   to support buy requirements. Annually, WR-ALC will:
       4.72.1.1. Provide MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs with specific vehicle buy
       submission instructions/guidelines.
       4.72.1.2. Compare MAJCOM vehicle buy submissions against requirements stated in
       AFEMS (DSDC001).
       4.72.1.3. Jointly resolve any inventory discrepancies with MAJCOM Vehicle
       Management Staff.
       4.72.1.4. Compile the AF vehicle budgetary requirement.
       4.72.1.5. Is the review authority for specifications, purchase options, purchase
       descriptions and standards for procuring AF vehicles.
       4.72.1.6. Determine MAJCOM allocations and coordinates shipment of assets acquired.
       4.72.1.7. Specification Review. WR-ALC forwards the vehicle specifications for all
       other vehicles by 15 October to the lead command for use during the following FY’ buy
       process. The lead command is usually the dominant user of a specific vehicle type. WR-
       ALC does not review specifications for: Vehicles bought through GSA, M-series vehicles
       or vehicles on an optional or multi-year contract for the follow-on FY.
   4.72.2. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs annually:
       4.72.2.1. Compile and prioritize MAJCOM vehicle requirements via LIMS-EV Vehicle
       View Prioritization Model (refer to Attachment 9).
       4.72.2.2. Work with WR-ALC to resolve any inventory data discrepancies.
       4.72.2.3. Provide WR-ALC with special specification requirements.
       4.72.2.4. Monitor due-ins via LIMS-EV Vehicle View (Due in).
   4.72.3. Lead Command:
       4.72.3.1. Coordinates the specifications with appropriate agencies within that command.
       4.72.3.2. Forwards one copy of the specifications to each “Using” MAJCOM Vehicle
       Management Staff.
 140                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       4.72.3.3. Consolidates all responses and works out all disparities and forwards a single
       coordinated response with recommended changes by 15 February to WR-ALC.
   4.72.4. Using Commands:
       4.72.4.1. Coordinate the specifications with the appropriate command agencies.
       4.72.4.2. Forward a single consolidated response to the lead command by the suspense
       date. Note: Specifications will not be “gold-plated” with “nice-to-have” items or
       capabilities.
4.73. Vehicle Fleet Growth Policy The AF vehicle fleet represents a tremendous
investment for the corporate AF. The vehicle buy program provides funding for programmatic
replacement of existing assets, but is not funded to purchase vehicles for new requirements
(start-ups). MAJCOM, FOA and DRU logistical support staffs must closely scrutinize any
request to increase the size of their respective vehicle fleets. Requests to increase vehicle fleet
size must be supported by a verifiable mission change, e.g., OPLAN, Provisional Plan (PPLAN),
etc. The functional community requesting additional vehicle authorizations will fund the initial
purchase of the vehicles, and advocate additional funding in the out-years of the Program
Objective Memorandum (POM) for increased vehicle buy replacement dollars, or provide
funding annually for leased assets. Any non-mission change increase will be offset by
adjustments to other vehicle authorizations to preclude an overall increase in authorizations.
Authorization decreases resulting from VVVs or previous mission changes (unit deactivation)
will not be used as offsets. All adjustments to authorization quantities must be approved by
VEMSO or other AF/A4LE designated enterprise management authority.
   4.73.1. Non-cataloged vehicle request. Prior to requesting cataloging action, MAJCOM,
   FOA and DRU logistical support staffs will consider offsets, current authorizations and right
   sizing of the vehicle requirement. Staffs will also coordinate with the appropriate Item
   Manager/Equipment Specialist to determine if there is an AF stock listed vehicle to satisfy
   the requirement. If a requirement for cataloging action still exists after completing the
   considerations and coordination above, staffs will submit an AF Form 601 with item
   specifications and justification to VEMSO. VEMSO will review and submit approved
   requests to the AF AS Manager for cataloging action and AS inclusion.
4.74. Major Program Codes, Major Mission Types and Definitions. The AF owned vehicle
fleet consists of a multitude of makes, models, manufacturers and types, all used to support
various mission activities. In order to better define and articulate the relationship of different
vehicle types to AF missions, the following major program codes, along with corresponding
major mission types and definitions, have been developed. These major mission program codes
moves us towards capability based logic and better defines our vehicle procurement requirements
by tying our requirements to capabilities. See Table 4.5 AF Vehicle Fleet Major Program
Codes.

   activities to identify all vehicles used in support of JB activities/functions IAW with the
   Department of Defense Initial Guidance for BRAC 2005 Joint Basing Implementation and JB
   specific Memorandum of Agreement.
4.75. Class I, II, III and IV Vehicles Authorizations
   4.75.1. Class I and II. Public Law stipulates that Class I and/or II vehicles will be used to
   meet daily mission requirements.
   4.75.2. Class III Midsize Sedans or Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) Equivalent. When Class
   I or Class II vehicles clearly do not meet mission requirements, exception authority to
   authorize the use of Class III vehicles must be fully justified and coordinated through the
   Base & MAJCOM/CC or equivalent. Once coordination is approved all requests for
   exception to policy will be submitted to AF/A4LE for AF/A4/7 consideration. MAJCOM,
   wing and unit commanders will heavily scrutinize any exceptions to policy that are not in
   line with the SECAF, CSAF and OSD policy.
Notes:
1. Per DOD 4500.36-R, the AF cannot approve exceptions to policy authorizing Class V
vehicles for personnel not listed in paragraph 4.75.3.
2. Exceptions to policy request for Class V vehicles will follow the same staffing process
outlined above and will be routed to OSD Acquisition, Technology & Logistics (AT&L) for
approval/disapproval. OSD/AT&L heavily scrutinizes and rarely approves Class V exception to
policy requests.

    Morale and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS), for additional
    guidance.
4.76. SUV Authorizations. The following paragraphs establish AF policy regarding SUV
Authorizations.
    4.76.1. DOD 4500.36-R and this AFI require that only the minimum number and minimum
    size vehicles are authorized to meet mission needs.
    4.76.2. Conversion of any type of vehicle authorization to an SUV will not be approved to
    support AFV initiatives or to meet mandated fossil fuel acquisition requirements.
    4.76.3. If a verifiable mission requirement warrants conversion to an SUV authorization then
    the SUV size will be limited to the minimum body size and maximum fuel efficiency.
    MAJCOM Fleet Managers must adhere to the maximum Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)
    restrictions listed in Table 4.8, Sedan to SUV Conversion.
    4.76.4. Per Memorandum from SAF to ALMAJCOM-FOA-DRU, Sport utility vehicles,
    sedans and crossover vehicles may be authorized in direct support of fire, rescue, criminal
    investigative, intelligence and surveillance activities where tactical vehicles are not feasible
    as determined by the MAJCOM; however, the size of the vehicles will not exceed the Class
    II rating.

Table 4.8. Sedan to SUV Conversion.

GSA Classification          Vehicle Type                            Maximum SUV GVW
Class I                     Subcompact Sedan and Station            5,400 pounds
                            Wagon
Class II                    Compact Sedan and Station Wagon         5,400 pounds
Class III                   Midsize Sedan and Station Wagon         5,401-6799 pounds
Class IV                    Large Sedan                             6,800 pounds and higher
Class V                     Limousine Sedan                         6,800 pounds and higher

    4.76.5. For positions in the ranks of Lieutenant General and below, SUVs, minivans or
    crossovers will not exceed 5,400 lbs GVW. In addition, sedans will be limited to compact
    size as per Federal Regulations.
    4.76.6. Exceptions to this policy are limited. Medium sized SUVs and crossovers (GVW of
    5,401 – 6,799 lbs) require SECAF approval before acquisition or rented/leased is allowed.
    Large SUVs and crossovers (GVW of 6,800 lbs or higher) are strictly reserved for SECDEF,
    Service Secretaries and Four Star Officers.
Note: Per SECAF memorandum dated 27 Mar 2009, AF/A4/7 has been delegated the authority
for Class III exceptions to policy.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      145


       4.76.6.1. Waivers to this policy are limited. Temporary waivers are required in order to
       retain/utilize a Class III vehicle until the end of its life expectancy. It would not be cost
       effective to salvage a Class III vehicle prematurely. Requests for temporary waivers
       must be routed through AF/A4LE and are approved/disapproved by AF/A4/7.
4.77. LSV. Each ALC, MAJCOM, DRU and base LRS will have the same “cradle to grave”
management of LSVs as they do with the conventional fleet. MAJCOMs and DRUs (i.e., Air
Force District of Washington (AFDW)) residing on military installations will replace existing
general-purpose assets to the greatest extent possible with LSVs. Even though the goal to
replace 30 percent or more of all applicable LDVs with more fuel efficient LSVs by FY 2012
was met, echelons are still highly encouraged to seize additional opportunities for procurement
wherever practical. See Table 4.9 LSV Sub-Categories below for the new categories and
applicable NSNs.

4.78. Vehicle Redistribution. Ensure vehicles and equipment designated for shipment meet
serviceability standards. Local Traffic Management Flight will assist with guidance on funding
the transportation costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-203, Chapter 7. Unless
directed by the parent MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff for intra-command shipments, for
shipments between commands, vehicles are not redistributed when they reach replacement
eligibility as outlined in TO 36-1-191. The VFM/VMS certifies on an AFTO Form 91 that the
vehicle being shipped meets serviceability standards.
4.79. First Article Testing (FAT). FAT ensures that a contractor can furnish a product that
conforms to all PWS requirements for acceptance. Refer to FAR Subpart 9.3, First Article
Testing and Approval, current edition, and AFMCI 64-110, First Article Management, for further
information.
   4.79.1. When required, a PWS should state that the vendor/contractors must develop at least
   one first article vehicle for full testing. Commands may observe and participate in these
   tests. VEMSO will observe and participate in tests with the lead command. WR-ALC is the
   liaison in this effort.
Note: For base maintenance/construction and fire protection vehicles, AFCESA will observe
and/or participate in first article testing with VEMSO and the lead command.
   4.79.2. Test Parameters. When specified by the PWS, contractors define the test
   parameters for in-plant FAT. When possible, WR-ALC will provide a copy of the
 146                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   parameters to the lead command 15 days prior to the test. WR-ALC can address questions
   about the test parameters.
   4.79.3. Test Procedures. For tests in the factory, the manufacturer normally accomplishes
   the tests and the Defense Contract Administration Service (DCAS) monitors those tests.
       4.79.3.1. WR-ALC can require a second first article vehicle. Commands may assist in
       making that decision. Request a second prototype at the same time the specification
       review response is made. The lead commands provide recommended user test
       parameters and pass or fail criteria. Send the second prototype to the AF base designated
       by WR-ALC and the lead command.
       4.79.3.2. AF personnel and the manufacturer conduct tests at a base. The lead command
       ensures the primary users of the vehicle participate in the tests.
       4.79.3.3. The lead command forwards a report of the test results to WR-ALC 15 days
       after the test is complete.
       4.79.3.4. WR-ALC makes the final decision on specifications, revisions, user test
       parameters and “pass/fail” criteria.
   4.79.4. Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). Use OT&E procedures on major
   MHE, aircraft tow vehicles, large refueling vehicles and most crash fire equipment. The lead
   command and the Vehicle System Program Manager coordinate the use of OT&E on vehicle
   types within six weeks after the Annual Buy Budget Review.

Section 4I—Performance-Based Work Statement GFP Requirements

4.80. AF/A4LE Policy. Contractors are ordinarily required to furnish all property necessary to
perform Government contracts. Contractors are provided GFP when it is clearly demonstrated
that it is in the Government’s best interest, that the overall benefit to the procurement
significantly outweighs the increased cost of administration, including ultimate property
disposal; that the assumption of risk by the Government is not substantially greater if property
were not provided; or that Government requirements cannot otherwise be met; that the
contractor’s inability or unwillingness to supply its own resources is not sufficient reason for the
furnishing or acquisition of GFP (refer to FAR, Part 45, Government Property, Subpart 45.1,
current edition). AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, Chapter 9, provides direction
pertaining to furnishing existing government property. Units should apply the decision matrix in
Table 6-1 to determine the potential advantage of providing GFP. If after applying the matrix,
the host unit determines government furnished vehicles are potentially advantageous to the
Government and the host Financial Analysis Office will perform a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)
to substantiate the cost advantage of providing vehicles. The CBA will include a Certificate of
Satisfactory EA stating the analysis follows AFI 65-501 and AFMAN 65-506, Economic
Analysis, guidance. The Certificate of Satisfactory EA will include signed coordination with
base Finance, Contracting and Vehicle Management.
   4.80.1. Activities must obtain MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff approval prior to
   including any government-owned vehicles as GFP in a PWS.
   4.80.2. If GFP includes government vehicles, the contactor(s) will assume sole responsibility
   for all associated utilization costs of the GFP vehicles, including operations, maintenance,
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 147


  repair, replacement and licensing/registration requirements. The AF will ensure the vehicles
  are identified and retained on the contract GFP listings. The contractor(s) will determine
  replacement based on best business practices/replacement criteria.
     4.80.2.1. If AF vehicles are provided as “agency-peculiar” GFP to a contractor and the
     AF is responsible for providing replacements, use AS 037, Air Force Provided/Replaced
     Contract Vehicles.
     4.80.2.2. If the conditions of paragraphs 4.80 and 4.80.1 are met and GFP vehicle assets
     are provided, the GFP vehicle assets will be accounted for using AS 051 and on the
     contract GFP listing. Appropriate coding establishes that GFP vehicle assets will not be
     replaced by the government and allows quick review and accountability of GFP assets.
         4.80.2.2.1. Vehicles will not be rotated to/from a contractor authorized/assigned
         under ASC 051.
         4.80.2.2.2. The installation contracting officer, or designee, may authorize disposal
         of GFP vehicle assets through DLA-DS or other available options. The installation
         contracting office will coordinate with Vehicle Management for possible
         redistribution prior to any disposition actions.
         4.80.2.2.3. The government will identify if the contractor(s) is responsible for
         obtaining replacement vehicles. At the end of a given contract, all GFP vehicles with
         residual value will be transferred as GFP vehicles on subsequent contracts. The
         number and type vehicles proposed for transfer to the contractor should be included
         in the PWS. A memorandum stating the equipment will be available prior to or on
         the contract start date is to accompany the PWS. Authorizations under this allowance
         will be reduced/deleted upon turn in of the asset to DLA-DS.
  4.80.3. Vehicle rented/leased in support of a contract will be the responsibility of the
  contractor.
  4.80.4. Vehicles owned or provided by the contractor are not subject to the management
  policies contained in this instruction. In very rare instances, Vehicle Management may
  provide maintenance support on a reimbursable basis only, if approved by the MAJCOM
  Vehicle Management Staff.
  4.80.5. The Government procurement process will not be used to purchase replacement
  vehicles for contractors. If the Government pays the contractor the purchase price of a
  vehicle, that vehicle becomes a Government asset.
  4.80.6. If the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) is the successful bidder, assets will revert
  to the original authorizations under the respective AF AS. However, there is potential for
  MAJCOMs to direct reductions based on MEO bid proposals.
  4.80.7. GFP vehicles will not be used on any contract other than for which the vehicles were
  provided, unless approved by the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff. Submit all requests
  through the applicable MAJCOM or DRU Vehicle Management Staff.
  4.80.8. The procedures for managing the allocation, use, operation and maintenance of AF
  motor vehicles are applicable to agency-peculiar assets furnished to contractors.
  4.80.9. IAW 41 CFR Part 101-38, government furnished vehicles are for official use only.

                                          Chapter 5

                                  MATERIEL CONTROL

Section 5A—General Information

5.1. Description of Materiel Control.
   5.1.1. Materiel Control provides support to Vehicle Management using the SBSS, COPARS
   or other decentralized purchasing methods. Materiel Control manages SBSS transactions for
   Vehicle Management. Any action deviating from the procedures and guidance listed in this
   chapter must first be approved by AF/A4LE.
       5.1.1.1. COPARS is a DOD approved method of supplementing SBSS and for getting
       commercially available automotive parts. It reduces research, item identification times
       and costs for parts that are not stock listed or cataloged. Ideally located next to
       COPARS, Materiel Control personnel have many contacts with the contractor each duty
       day. This relationship makes it most important that all Materiel Control personnel read
       and know the terms of the contract. Vehicle Management activities wishing to establish a
       COPARS contract should contact their local Contracting Officer for more information.
       5.1.1.2. Decentralized purchasing methods, such as a BPA or GPC, may be more
       appropriate for some Vehicle Management activities than methods such as COPARS.
       The Contracting Officer is the source for information and advice on COPARS, BPAs and
       GPC provisions.
       5.1.1.3. BPAs for parts purchases are individual contracts with parts suppliers.
       Contracting negotiates for authorized items and discounts, and provides surveillance to
       the BPA. Vehicle Management provides funds and manpower to identify, order
       requirements and document part procurement/ purchase activity for internal purposes.
       Vehicle Management may provide funds; however, they do not have authority to
       purchase (unless it is by GPC) nor do they document contract activities.
       5.1.1.4. GPC is a credit card used for purchasing parts and services within the parameters
       of the program. Contracting approves its use, trains the cardholder, approving official
       and manages the program. Vehicle Management nominates cardholder(s) who become
       Purchasing Agent(s), and are responsible for identifying and buying only authorized
       items, negotiating discounts and documenting GPC purchases.
   5.1.2. Materiel Control is not a unit supply function. The VFM/VMS ensures supply
   functions unrelated to Vehicle Management needs are not given to Materiel Control.
   5.1.3. Manpower for Materiel Control is limited.
   5.1.4. The management personnel supervising Materiel Control may not have much
   exposure to supply procedures, but they must have a basic understanding of the job to
   properly supervise personnel, evaluate supply support and make knowledgeable performance
   ratings. LRS Customer Support Liaison Element provides customer training IAW AFMAN
   23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Standard Base Supply Customer’s Procedures, to fulfill part of
   this requirement. Where this training leaves off, this chapter explains supply terms and
   complicated procedures in language familiar to the maintenance worker.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    149


   5.1.5. The scope of Materiel Control operations requires additional emphasis on training,
   because these specialists must maintain proficiency in the supply career field as well as
   develop a basic understanding of maintenance.
       5.1.5.1. The VFM/VMS ensures Materiel Control personnel become fully qualified in all
       aspects of the operation, including the use of SBSS, OLVIMS, Green Procurement,
       COPARS procedures and all management products.
       5.1.5.2. A qualification training program is set up for all newly assigned personnel to
       ensure they receive proficiency training as soon as possible.
   5.1.6. The concepts and procedures outlined here ensure compatibility with AFMAN 23-
   110, Volume 2, Part 2 and AFCSM 24-1. At the ALC, use AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part
   2, D035K Users Manual, with this chapter. At bases with a manual supply system, use
   AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 1, Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF),
   with this chapter.
   5.1.7. Overseas commands are authorized to establish requirements contracts for
   procurement of parts and supplies to support foreign buy vehicles. Overseas MAJCOMs
   develop procedures for the effective security, control, documentation and issue of parts
   purchased through BPAs. Authority to bypass the stock fund is provided in AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 2, Part 10, Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) Supply Management Activity Group
   (SMAG).

   5.2.13. Materiel Control will coordinate with the VM&A Workload Controller on
   appropriate DIFM status and process, and return DIFM assets to the LRS Customer Support
   Liaison Element as soon as possible.
   5.2.14. Inventory, store and list work order residue. When the VFM/VMS determines
   residue is no longer required, process turn-ins to the LRS Customer Support Liaison Element
   or the DLA-DS IAW appropriate procedures.
   5.2.15. Assist the work center supervisor when requesting adjusted levels (AF Form 1996,
   Adjusted Stock Level) to support new and mission essential vehicles. Act as the focal point
   for the adjusted stock level review, and ensure changes reflect current mission and vehicle
   requirements.
   5.2.16. Assist with and perform parts research.
   5.2.17. Advise the Functional Commander or Functional Director of any COPARS
   problems.
       5.2.17.1. Keep a daily record of COPARS funds on funds ledger and tell the Functional
       Commander or Functional Director when the cost of the delivery order is 85 percent
       obligated. A computerized spreadsheet may be used as the funds ledger.
   5.2.18. Ensure the most economical parts are purchased. Order the least expensive part
   (including rebuilt items) when shop records do not show poor performance, less service life
   or reliability problems with rebuilt items.
   5.2.19. Query parts dealers to ensure new, rebuilt or after-market parts for all vehicles and
   equipment meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications before
   ordering parts.
Note: Individual parts are not specifically nuclear certified by any manufacturer; however, any
part is acceptable for use on certified vehicles and equipment if the part meets or exceeds the
OEM specifications.
   5.2.20. Verify parts charges on the Daily VIMS Materiel Transaction-Non Fuels (D22), and
   ensure all materiel costs are validated and properly charged in OLVIMS.
   5.2.21. Coordinate with the LRS Stock Control Section and work center supervisors in
   updating Initial Spares Support and Follow-on Spares Support Lists for new equipment.
   5.2.22. Establish Minimum Reserve Authorization as needed.
   5.2.23. Perform monthly or quarterly (as directed by VFM/VMS) AF Form 1823/-1
   backorder validation with VM&A.
   5.2.24. Utilize the Hazardous Material Pharmacy (HAZMART) to the fullest extent. Ensure
   the AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Material Request Authorization, reflects an
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 151


   appropriate quantity to fulfill mission requirements but not create undue waste. An approved
   AF Form 3952 must be on file for any hazardous materials (HAZMAT) purchase regardless
   of purchasing method.
   5.2.25. Dispose of waste IAW appropriate directives and laws.

5.5. Use of Reports and Listings. Various reports and listings are available from the SBSS and
ALC supply systems for managing supply support for the shop. Some of these reports are sent
automatically; others are sent based on local needs. All reports are listed in AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 2, Part 2, Chapters 5 and 6, for SBSS bases. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part 2,
Chapter 14, Output Products, discusses the ALC base counterpart. All reports will be neatly
bound in order that they may be easily used. The following paragraphs describe the basic uses of
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   153


the most significant reports and listings (AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, explains most
reports):
   5.5.1. The Daily Document Register (D04) is made in document number sequence and is a
   comprehensive review of the previous day’s supply transactions. It shows exceptional
   transactions that may require analysis; answers questions about supply that the shop may
   have and points out possible abuses of the supply system. It will be checked each duty day
   for issues, due-out releases and cancellation information.
   5.5.2. The Priority Monitor Report (D18) is reviewed each duty day for Urgency of Need
   Designator (UND) "A" requirements and weekly for UND "B" requirements. (The weekly
   and monthly reports exclude bench stock, equipment and supply point requirements). It lists
   outstanding due-outs for each item. It is used to validate all back ordered parts for delayed
   AF Forms 1823/-1.
   5.5.3. The AWP Validation Listing (D19) shows the required information to manage DIFM
   assets, to maintain a current inventory of DIFM items and to reconcile DIFM balances.
   5.5.4. The Supply Point Listing (Q13) lists all items authorized, on hand and due out to the
   supply point. It also has summary data on shortages, excesses and identification of buildup
   items.
   5.5.5. The Organization Bench Stock Listing (SO4) lists all bench stock items for each
   activity that applies. It can be used to find items in the bench stock, to check bench stock
   authorizations and to add new bench stock items. This listing is shown in NSN and item
   number sequence.
   5.5.6. The Due-out Validation (M30) provides data for review of UND "A" and "B" priority
   due-outs. It is also a managerial tool for validating all UND "C" due-outs monthly (except
   equipment, which is validated at least quarterly).
   5.5.7. The Stock Number Directory (M14), or Stock Number User Directory (SNUD), is a
   monthly list of all NSNs stored in the SBSS. It tells whether an item has been loaded in the
   computer as well as data about the item (unit price, unit of issue, source of supply and so
   forth). Due to its volume, this directory is not sent automatically and only a small number of
   copies are made. Materiel Control should tell the Management Systems Flight that it would
   like a copy of the previous month’s list.
5.6. Supply Discipline. Supply discipline is essential to good materiel management and applies
to all personnel. Responsibilities are identified in AFI 23-111, Management of Government
Property in Possession of the Air Force.
   5.6.1. A reparable is as important as a serviceable item, since the reparable may be the only
   source of supply. SBSS considers a DIFM detail as a potentially serviceable asset and will
   print an I023 Asset Management notice on an issue request. Reparable assets removed from
   the end item must be promptly sent through repair channels and controlled throughout the
   repair cycle. Local vendors and COPARS often require a reparable item (core) before a
   serviceable one is sold.
   5.6.2. Double ordering from any source wastes funds, reduces credibility and does not serve
   the shop well. Do not use such practices.
5.7. Priority System. There are five main terms that all Materiel Control personnel will know:
 154                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   5.7.1. FAD. Each organization is assigned a FAD (1 through 5) by the JCS through the
   USAF Program Document. The organizational FAD indicates the relative priority of a unit.
   The FAD code is loaded in the SBSS and will be loaded in OLVIMS. Vehicle Management,
   as a support unit, is rarely assigned a FAD as high as many of the vehicles it works on (such
   as flight line vehicles, fire trucks, etc.). In these cases the FAD of the mission supported by
   the vehicle will be used to order the parts needed for maintenance.
   5.7.2. UND. The UND is a one-character alpha code, used to indicate the urgency of the
   need. There are three primary UNDs: A, B and C.
       5.7.2.1. UND "A" means a lack of the requested item prevents mission accomplishment.
       5.7.2.2. UND "B" means lack of the item impairs mission accomplishment.
       5.7.2.3. UND "C" is used for routine needs not meeting the criteria for a higher UND.
       5.7.2.4. “1” is a fourth UND used to indicate a verified NMCS condition for a MICAP
       reportable vehicle.
   5.7.3. Urgency Justification Code (UJC). The UJC is a two-character code that shows the
   priority and use of the required part (see AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11,
   Customer Requirements). The first character of the UJC is the UND; the second character is
   an alpha code assigned to the type of equipment being worked on. In the case of vehicles,
   the assigned code is "F" or "Q.” When requesting most parts from the LRS Customer
   Service, Materiel Control uses UJC 1F, AF or BF.
   5.7.4. Base Delivery Priority. A local delivery priority is assigned by Materiel Control for
   each demand placed in SBSS. The delivery priorities are in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part
   2, Chapter 11.
   5.7.5. Requisition Priority. The requisition priority is assigned by the SBSS computer based
   on a combination of the FAD code of the requesting organization (or the supported vehicle, if
   FAD override is used) and the UND code. When the property is not available in LRS supply
   system for immediate issue, this priority tells the source of supply the level of urgency.
5.8. Materiel Control and OLVIMS Coordination. Materiel Control has a key role in
ensuring all materiel costs are properly charged in OLVIMS.
   5.8.1. This part of the AFI integrates Materiel Control’s procedural responsibilities for
   OLVIMS with its other responsibilities. AFCSM 24-1 gives further procedures for
   expenditure data input and output using OLVIMS (see Figure 5.1, Materiel Control &
   OLVIMS Cross-Reference Listing).
   5.8.2. Materiel Control personnel must know all aspects of the materiel costing process.
   VM&A is the focal point for OLVIMS and is the main source of information and training for
   new personnel. In addition, VM&A is the POC for keeping all personnel informed of system
   changes. The information in Figure 5.1 below is provided for a quick reference of OLVIMS
   formats and listings used by Materiel Control. All references are from AFCSM 24-1.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    155

   are inputted in OLVIMS. Items are charged in three different ways; to the:
       5.8.3.1. Vehicle on which the item is used.
       5.8.3.2. "High-Cost Bench Stock" account (work order number H8888), for items of
       bench stock or working stock costing $60 or more per unit. Do not charge these items to
       a specific vehicle until the parts are installed.
       5.8.3.3. "Low-Cost Bench Stock" account (work order number L9999), for items with a
       unit of use cost of less than $60. These costs are charged as overhead against the entire
       fleet, rather than to a specific vehicle.
   5.8.4. Items are further identified by charge codes for maintenance or non-chargeable costs
   (“D”, ”M” or “N”). The requester assigns these codes and Materiel Control verifies them.
   For examples of items to be charged to these codes see AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4.
5.9. Adjusted Stock Levels. Adjusted levels provide a means to change base stock levels and
are used when usage experience is not the best predictor of future needs. When wisely used,
adjusted levels are a valuable tool in supporting the mission. Because AF resources are limited,
the approval of an adjusted level frequently means that fewer dollars are available to buy items
with established consumption rates. Requests for adjusted levels must be carefully considered.
Procedures are in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 19, Stockage Policy.
   5.9.1. Requests for adjusted levels are sent to the LRS Stock Control Section on an AF Form
   1996. This form is used to request a change to stocked levels, not to bench stock minimum
   reserve levels.
   5.9.2. Materiel Control initiates the AF Form 1996 in five copies, with help from the
   requester. The VFM/VMS signs as the approving authority.
   5.9.3. One copy of the AF Form 1996 is held in a suspense file, three copies are sent to
   Stock Control Section and one is sent to the requester.
   5.9.4. Initiate follow-up actions if Materiel Control is not notified within 10 days for items
   that require base-level approval or 45 days for items that require IM approval. When
   notification is received, inform the requester, remove the copy from the suspense file and file
   the approved AF Form 1996.
       5.9.4.1. Approved requests are filed in Materiel Control to use during adjusted level
       reviews.
       5.9.4.2. Rejected requests are reviewed with the requester to see whether more action is
       needed.

Section 5C—Issue Procedures

5.10. General Information. This section discusses procedures used in obtaining off-the-shelf
parts from LRS. To be effective, Materiel Control personnel must know the procedures of the
supply system they work with (SBSS, GPC, COPARS or BPAs). These procedures supplement
supply procedures, and generally apply to requesting parts for NMCS and delayed AF Forms
1823/-1. The LRS Customer Service & Training Section gives supply system training when
requested. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, outlines detailed procedures used in issue
requests.
5.11. Identifying the Requirement.
   5.11.1. This section discusses guidelines for determining the source of supply and describes
   the procedures to use. This is one of the most critical aspects of materiel support for the
   shop. Attention to detail in this process goes a long way in ensuring that the right part is
   ordered the first time.
   5.11.2. The technician helps Materiel Control determine the following information about the
   item:
       5.11.2.1. NSN, part numbers and associated manufacturer’s codes.
       5.11.2.2. Nomenclature.
       5.11.2.3. Quantity.
       5.11.2.4. TO, figure and index.
       5.11.2.5. UND
       5.11.2.6. FAD from the AF Form 1823/-1.
       5.11.2.7. Management code.
       5.11.2.8. Make and model of vehicle.
       5.11.2.9. Source code, when available. Check the format of the TO; if no code is
       available or item is coded Local Purchase (LP), COPARS or other sources may be used.
       5.11.2.10. VIN.
5.12. Requests Sent Through LRS Demand Processing.
   5.12.1. Document all parts requested through LRS Demand Processing Section by one of
   three methods:
       5.12.1.1. Initiate AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, according to AFMAN 23-110,
       Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11. Give Demand Processing the original and one copy. Hold
       a copy in suspense until the transaction appears on the D04, D22 (with OLVIMS
       transaction) and the property is received. If the transaction fails to appear on the D04 the
       next computer processing day, follow up with demand processing to find out the status of
       the transaction.
       5.12.1.2. Log all parts requested on AF Form 2413, Supply Control Log. Column G
       contains the work order number and Column N (Mark For) contains the vehicle
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   157


     registration number. Once property is received, highlight the entire entry. Items not
     highlighted are deemed active requests.
     5.12.1.3. Use a locally created database to track part ordering. Procedures are the same
     as AF Form 2413 in the preceding paragraph.
  5.12.2. Several actions take place when an item is issued from LRS Demand Processing
  Section:
     5.12.2.1. The part is delivered along with a DD Form 1348-1A. The part is checked
     against the “suspense” AF Form 2005, supply control log entry or locally developed
     database to ensure the correct item was received. Clearly annotate the AF Form 2005,
     AF Form 2413 or locally developed database to show receipt of property.
     5.12.2.2. Using the D04, verify receipt of all issues and due-out releases. Initiate follow-
     up actions on any property not received by the next duty day.
     5.12.2.3. Using the D22, verify the following fields prior to uploading into OLVIMS and
     forwarding to VM&A:
        5.12.2.3.1. Compatibility of charge code and item (example: A tire Federal Supply
        Class 2610 with a charge code 0 is incorrect).
        5.12.2.3.2. Validity of work order number (example: Real work order number is
        B1234 but shows F1234; L9999 or H8888 improperly used).
        5.12.2.3.3. Suspected unit of issue or extended cost errors.
        5.12.2.3.4. Verification of the cost on issues of $500 or more.
     5.12.2.4. To clear the AF Form 2005 issue suspense, supply control log suspense entry or
     locally developed database entry, Materiel Control must receive both the OLVIMS
     transaction and the item.
     5.12.2.5. Useful data on the D22 listing includes:
        5.12.2.5.1. Heading "CC.” On an issue, an "R" or "N”, if present shows the demand
        code; on a turn-in, the coded entry indicates the action taken.
        5.12.2.5.2. Heading "UJC.” This column is blank for off-the-shelf issues; the
        urgency of need code is shown for all delayed and NMCS issues.
        5.12.2.5.3. Heading "RVP.” This column contains an "R" when a transaction was
        reversed out of the SBSS.
     5.12.2.6. VM&A inputs the “VZ” transaction into OLVIMS. This transaction charges or
     reverses costs for items received from or turned in to the LRS Demand Processing
     Section. All transactions are shown on PCN SB004 - 005. Those that pass all edits (see
     AFCSM 24-1) reflect an Input Record Accepted (IRA) status on the right hand side of the
     list under column "RCDS-1.” If there are any errors shown by the system, an "IRE"
     appears in the columns, as well as an asterisk (*) to the right of the field in error. VM&A
     should be able to correct any error shown for these transactions.
     5.12.2.7. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff may authorize alternative methods to
     check on the receipt of OLVIMS materiel costing transactions and property.
 158                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


5.13. Requests Submitted Through COPARS. A valid AF Form 1823/-1 or work order
number is required to submit request and receive items from COPARS. Organizations other than
the LRS will use their appropriate document to purchase parts from COPARS.
5.14. Requests Submitted Through BPA or GPC. The sales slip or invoice is the source
document for updating OLVIMS. After screening the sales slip or invoice, Materiel Control
forwards it to VM&A for the transaction input into OLVIMS. A separate "PZ" transaction is
input for each item (except L9999 or H8888) and will be shown on PCN SB004-005.

Section 5D—Vehicle NMCS Processing

5.15. General Information. When the required parts are not available from SBSS or other
sources, the vehicle is designated as NMCS. AFI 23-106, Assignment and Use of Standard
Reporting Designators, provides justification and guidance for the use of Standard Reporting
Designators (SURD). A NMCS condition starts extraordinary supply action by Materiel Control.
Track NMCS-reportable vehicles by the MICAP reporting system (if applicable) and the depot
IM until the need has been met. This section describes the procedures Materiel Control uses in
handling NMCS conditions. MICAP reportable vehicles are found in the Standard Reporting
Designator (SRD) list in Integrated Maintenance Data Systems (IMDS) and Supply Systems. A
quick-reference list is provided in Attachment 3. Non-MICAP requisitions coded with a NMCS
and AF UJC are authorized to include a “777” RDD. The “777” identifies the item for fast
transportation (AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 9, Requisitioning). Materiel Control
personnel will ensure the judicious use of this code. The VFM/VMS will ensure appropriate
emphasis is placed on parts procurement priorities by periodically verifying compliance as
necessary to meet mission requirements.
5.16. NMCS Verification Procedures. Prompt, responsive verification is the key to preventing
unwarranted NMCS conditions, cannibalizations, priority system abuses and unnecessary funds
abuse.
   5.16.1. Order UND "A" and "B" requests on a "Fill or Kill" basis, except AWP requests.
       5.16.1.1. When assets are not available to fill the request, a "Kill" action takes place and
       the computer prints an I023 Other Assets Management Notice.
       5.16.1.2. Information on the I023 includes: DIFM details, supply point details with on-
       hand balances, substitute NSNs with the requested Interchangeable Substitute Group
       (ISG) with serviceable balances, percent base repair and whether the item is on a bench
       stock.
       5.16.1.3. Materiel Control immediately verifies the need.
   5.16.2. Verification of requirements includes the following steps:
       5.16.2.1. Materiel Control researches part numbers, TO figure and index, next higher
       assembly or bits and pieces, usable-on-codes, quantity per assembly and source codes.
       5.16.2.2. The verifier checks availability of bench stock assets. If none are available, but
       a substitute item is, the verifier contacts the requester to find out whether it is suitable. If
       the substitute is suitable, Materiel Control makes the necessary arrangements with the
       shop with the bench stock.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      159


      5.16.2.3. If DIFM assets are available, coordinate with the shop work center to expedite
      repair and return of the reparable to satisfy the request in time to meet the need. Materiel
      Control will not verify a repair cycle item as NMCS until it is found that an item cannot
      be fixed locally.
      5.16.2.4. Research the next higher assembly, find out its availability and suitability.
      5.16.2.5. Check the delayed part bins for needed item. Use the PCN SB004-016,
      “Delayed Parts Received”, as an aid to find whether other vehicles of the same type have
      delayed parts on hand. If so, complete an AF Form 1832, Record of Cannibalization
      (Vehicle Maintenance), transferring the parts from the delayed AF Form 1823/-1 to a
      NMCS AF Form 1823/-1. Send the AF Form 1823/-1 to VM&A where an "SW"
      transaction is made to charge the materiel cost from the delayed record to the open
      NMCS AF Form 1823/-1. Materiel Control submits the parts request for the delayed
      part, using the delayed AF Form 1823/-1’s number. The delayed AF Form 1823/-1 will
      be marked accordingly.
      5.16.2.6. If the above actions have still not met the need, consider locally manufacturing
      the part within the shop. If there is no internal capability to do this, find out whether the
      capability exists elsewhere on base. If a base shop is found that can fabricate the part,
      contact Demand Processing Section and send the request as outlined in AFMAN 23-110,
      Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11.
      5.16.2.7. If a new part cannot be obtained, a serviceable used part can be purchased
      under a separate contract on a one-time basis.
      5.16.2.8. Notify requester to determine further actions on UND “B” requests.
      5.16.2.9. If a part is not available for a UND "A" need, the verifier tells the work center
      supervisor or VM&A Workload Controller to verify that a NMCS condition exists. At
      this time, the VFM/VMS decides whether to cannibalize or to confirm an NMCS
      condition. If the VFM/VMS decides the latter, put the start time on the AF Form 1823/-
      1.
5.17. MICAP and NMCS (AF Requisitions).
   5.17.1. Items backordered for a MICAP or NMCS condition (UJC 1F/AF) are shown on the
   D18. Review the report when received to ensure the supply system is acting on the request.
   Materiel Control verifies the following data:
      5.17.1.1. NSN.
      5.17.1.2. Quantity.
      5.17.1.3. Vehicle registration number.
      5.17.1.4. SRD. SRDs that apply to vehicles are in the IMDS and Supply Systems for
      query. Note: PCN SG054-84S, Standard Reporting Designator Codes, lists all SRDs.
      An extract from this report of commonly used vehicle and equipment MICAP Reportable
      SRDs is provided in Attachment 3. If the NMCS part does not appear or does not have a
      due in date the day after the need has been levied, SBSS will be contacted to find the
      cause and correct it.
 160                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   5.17.2. D18 (see AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 3, Customer Backorders, for
   more details). Status will be on the report within a given number of days, based on Military
   Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) priority.
   5.17.3. This status is posted to a status board or automated equivalent, and updated as
   changes occur. The NMCS status board or automated equivalent, has the following
   minimum data and must be readily available in the Materiel Control work center:
       5.17.3.1. Type of vehicle.
       5.17.3.2. Vehicle registration number.
       5.17.3.3. NSN or part number.
       5.17.3.4. Nomenclature.
       5.17.3.5. Quantity and unit of issue.
       5.17.3.6. Due-out document number.
       5.17.3.7. MICAP (1F) or NMCS (AF) backorder date (a color code may be used to
       differentiate between MICAP and NMCS).
       5.17.3.8. Current status.
       5.17.3.9. Source of supply.
   5.17.4. The VFM/VMS makes a policy on which MICAP and NMCS conditions they want
   briefed on and how often. Also set up a general procedure as to what is unsatisfactory status,
   thus requiring more action. Overseas bases supported by the Commercial Administrative
   Vehicle Repair Parts Program, under Project Code JZO, JCM and JZC, look at status policies
   as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 11, Special Logistic Support
   Procedures, before making this determination. With these procedures, Materiel Control will
   keep key management personnel informed on NMCS status and provide follow-up supply
   assistance or supply difficulty action with SBSS, as the case dictates. The Materiel Control
   supervisor ensures that follow-up management actions are tailored to specific shop needs
   rather than a system of arbitrary follow up.
5.18. Supply Assistance and Difficulty.
   5.18.1. Materiel Control will submit follow-up, supply assistance or supply difficulty action
   when bad status is received from the depot. Materiel Control will never allow ineffective
   supply support to be traced to a lack of aggressive follow up on its part.
   5.18.2. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 9, outlines the procedures for following
   up on established due-outs. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 1, outlines the
   policy for sending supply difficulty reports.
   5.18.3. Materiel Control maintains a copy of each request for supply assistance or difficulty
   with the appropriate MICAP, NMCS or delayed requisition.
5.19. NMCS Requirements through GPC, BPA or COPARS.
   5.19.1. View items in this category similarly to those requested through SBSS. Materiel
   Control must contact the vendor each duty day for current status.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     161


   5.19.2. Annotate MICAP and NMCS items ordered through BPA or GPC with the correct
   data on the NMCS status board or automated equivalent.
5.20. Receipt of NMCS Parts.
   5.20.1. Materiel Control immediately informs the VM&A Workload Controller when a
   NMCS part is received so it may be scheduled for work. The parts are binned and the AF
   Form 1823/-1 or parts ordering form marked accordingly. Mark the suspense copy of AF
   Form 2005 or the line entry in the supply control log to show that the part is received.
   5.20.2. An OLVIMS transaction should be received the day following the due-out release.
   After verification against the data on the suspense slip or line entry on AF Form 2413, the
   OLVIMS transaction is sent to VM&A and the AF Form 2005 will be destroyed. The
   suspended entry on the control log clearly shows that both the OLVIMS transaction and the
   part have been received.
   5.20.3. BPA or GPC parts received are binned and documented on the AF Form 1823/-1.
   The sales receipt or invoice is reviewed for accuracy. The AF Form 1823/-1 and sales
   receipt or invoice is forwarded to VM&A for input into OLVIMS and scheduling of the
   repair.

Section 5E—Managing AF Forms 1823/-1 Delayed for Parts

5.21. Importance of Delayed AF Forms 1823/-1. When a lack of parts does not cause a
NMCS condition, a delayed-for-parts AF Form 1823/-1 is initiated and the vehicle is returned to
the user. Delayed parts management is the heart of supply support for the preventive
maintenance program. The importance of this function grows as vehicles get older. Although
delayed parts have a lower priority than NMCS, they need special attention by Materiel Control
to ensure that positive action is taken for each request.
5.22. Delayed Work Order Folders.
   5.22.1. When an AF Form 1823/-1 has been delayed for parts, the VM&A workload
   controller makes a new AF Form 1823/-1 with all the required information, and sends a copy
   of the AF Form 1823/-1 and the parts request to Materiel Control for processing. All parts
   backordered through SBSS are marked on AF Form 2005 or the supply control log.
   5.22.2. VFM/VMS determines filing sequence of delayed AF Forms 1823/-1 folders.
5.23. Monitoring Delayed Work Orders.
   5.23.1. For items requested through SBSS, the first check comes the day after the backorder
   requests are processed. The D04 is sent to Materiel Control for screening. Using the AF
   Form 2005 suspense file, supply control log, AF Form 1823/-1 or parts ordering request,
   Materiel Control verifies all backordered items appear correctly on the D04. The D04 also
   shows all issues, due-out release actions, turn-ins and cancellations. If cancellation action is
   noted, research the cancellation and either reorder using the appropriate NSN or eliminate the
   suspense.
   5.23.2. For items ordered with an UND “A” or “B”, the D18 tells the user the latest status of
   the backorder. The D18 is reviewed each duty day. If the status shown in the report is
 162                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   unsatisfactory, Materiel Control begins follow-up, supply assistance or supply difficulty
   action.
   5.23.3. For items ordered through COPARS, Materiel Control coordinates with the vendor
   for status updates IAW the contract requirements.
   5.23.4. For items ordered through BPA or GPC, Materiel Control coordinates with the
   vendor for status updates. Frequent follow up is essential to prevent unnecessary NMC time.
   5.23.5. The PCN SB004-015 also gives information for management to track delayed
   actions. This report shows delayed AF Forms 1823/-1 with required action by delayed
   maintenance code.
5.24. Processing Parts Receipts.
   5.24.1. Take the following steps when receiving parts from GPC, SBSS, COPARS or BPA.
   Mark the suspense slip, AF Form 1823/-1, parts ordering form or supply control log to show
   the receipt. Hold the parts until the work can be scheduled. Mark the parts with the work
   order number and registration number, and bin them. Parts for the same vehicle may be
   binned together regardless of work order number. Do not mix bench stock, working stock,
   work order residue or delayed parts. Mark the AF Form 1823/-1 and parts ordering form
   (Materiel Control’s copy) with the bin location in the space provided. Then forward the
   information to VM&A.
   5.24.2. When the OLVIMS transaction is received from SBSS, verify the data against the
   suspense copy of the AF Form 2005, parts ordering form or the supply control log, before
   sending to VM&A for input in OLVIMS.
   5.24.3. The receipt process for GPC, COPARS or BPA delayed parts is essentially the same.
   Mark the AF Forms 1823/-1 with the bin location and advise the VM&A Workload
   Controller of its receipt. Verify sales slips or parts receipts and/or invoices before
   forwarding them to VM&A. VM&A inputs a "PZ" transaction into OLVIMS containing a
   "D" charge code and a bin location number.
5.25. Work Order and Backorder Validation.
   5.25.1. Screen UND "A" or "B" requirements and validate as outlined in AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11. The basic record used to do the validation is the Materiel
   Control copy of the delayed AF Form 1823/-1.
   5.25.2. Despite these efforts, the manual records used to track delayed AF Forms 1823/-1
   often disagree with the true needs of the individual vehicles. Consequently, Materiel
   Control, together with the VM&A Workload Controller, conducts an AF Form 1823/-1-to-
   backorder reconciliation and validation.
       5.25.2.1. Reconcile all work orders either monthly or quarterly, or as directed by the
       VFM/VMS, in conjunction with the monthly UND “A”, “B,” and “C” validation outlined
       in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 3.
       5.25.2.2. The first step of validation is a line-item review for each delayed AF Form
       1823/-1. Materiel Control compares its entire delayed AF Form 1823/-1 file to the
       VM&A Workload Controller's file of delayed AF Forms 1823/-1. The delayed
       maintenance report is used at this time. Update both sets of AF Forms 1823/-1 and the
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   163


       delayed maintenance report as needed, to bring all into agreement. Resolve discrepancies
       before updating to ensure all records are accurate. If there are large differences between
       these two files, the local procedures for coordination between the two functional units
       will be evaluated to find the cause.
       5.25.2.3. After VM&A and Materiel Control reconcile AF Form 1823/-1 records,
       Materiel Control ensures all necessary parts are backordered and reflect positive status
       through GPC, SBSS, COPARS or BPA. Materiel Control cancels the backorder for items
       no longer needed.
       5.25.2.4. Materiel Control will accomplish a complete inventory on all AF Forms 1823/-
       1 against which items have been received verifying bin location and quantity. If, after a
       complete search, the items are not available, the shortages are recorded and reordered. If
       this is a common occurrence, implement a local procedure to ensure parts are adequately
       safeguarded.
       5.25.2.5. When these actions have been done:
          5.25.2.5.1. All records will be in complete agreement.
          5.25.2.5.2. All AF Forms 1823/-1 will be shown on the PCN SB004-015 report with
          the partial or complete parts indicator.
          5.25.2.5.3. All parts will have been backordered with positive status (including
          follow-up) or be on-hand.
5.26. Partial or Completed Vehicle and Equipment Work Orders. Materiel Control sends
the completed work order to the VM&A Workload Controller for scheduling. Each time a new
work order is opened on a vehicle, all delayed work orders are thoroughly screened. Every
attempt is made to install received parts or accomplish maintenance that will complete any job
listed in the job description block of the work order.

Section 5F—Bench Stocks

5.27. Purpose of Bench Stocks. Bench stocks are established so that expendable supplies
needed to support the shop are always available. Failure to establish the proper line items and
levels disrupts the shop and can be costly. Bench stock responsibilities and procedures for its
establishment and operation are in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11.
5.28. Establishment of Bench Stocks. Establishment of a bench stock is a coordinated effort
between Vehicle Management and Bench Stock Support. When available, vehicle Initial
Support or Follow-On Spares Support List may be used as a guide in identifying the items and
quantities to be stocked. When those lists are available, the shop or work center supervisor
makes a list, based on his or her estimate and judgment of the need. The VFM/VMS approves
the bench stock and Materiel Control sends the request to Bench Stock Support according to
AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11. Once bench stock is established, a copy of the
Bench Stock Listing (S04) will be readily available and used.
5.29. Shop and Collocated Bench Stocks, Working Stocks and Work Order Residues.
 164                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   5.29.1. Shop bench stocks, working stocks and work order residues may be set up within
   each Vehicle Management shop or its equivalent. Where two or more shops are collocated, a
   single bench stock, working stock and work order residue for their combined use is set up.
Note: Bench stocks, working stocks and work order residue can be collocated; however, they
must be separated and properly binned.
   5.29.2. Under certain circumstances, it may be more advantageous (because of location, total
   number of line items, cost or pilferage) to secure the bench stock, working stock and work
   order residue, and operate it under a staffed environment. When the VFM/VMS finds this to
   be more advantageous, consider consolidating this bench stock, working stock and work
   order residue with a tool room in the work area. In any event, the overriding factor is the
   need of the shop.
   5.29.3. When using co-located bench stocks, working stocks and work order residues, units
   may want to display a bench stock "shadow board" outside the bench stock site, to be readily
   viewed by all personnel. Old and unserviceable parts for each item authorized can be shown,
   with the item or bin number under each asset as an easy means to show its location. Item
   descriptions may also be used in some cases.
5.30. Low-Cost Bench Stocks.
   5.30.1. In Vehicle Management, authorized bench stock items whose unit cost (based on a
   unit-of-use issue from bench stock to an AF Form 1823/-1) is less than $60 is low-cost bench
   stock. (For example, if a box of 12 fittings costs $67.50 and they are issued one at a time, the
   fittings would be shown as low cost).
       5.30.1.1. Replenish low-cost bench stock items using work order number L9999. This
       work order number is limited to "low-cost" items on authorized bench stock. The
       purpose of work order number L9999 is to prorate the cost of commonly used low-cost
       bench stock items against the total cost of maintaining the base fleet.
          5.30.1.1.1. Low-cost parts that do not qualify as bench stock items may be purchased
          through COPARS, BPA or GPC using the work order number or the vehicle
          registration number when an AF Form 1827 is used for minor repairs.
   5.30.2. Low-cost items may be on other unit bench stocks or working stocks.
   Replenishment of bench stock items is IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2 Chapter 11.
Note: If applicable, COPARS working stocks are usually drawn from COPARS like other items.
GPC working stock is replenished by Materiel Control, not to exceed the quantity authorized as
determined by the VFM/VMS.
   5.30.3. Bases are authorized to maintain shop stock. Shop stocks include parts kits
   consisting of universal-type hardware for brake systems, hydraulic systems, electrical
   systems, etc., which are not normally economically handled as bench/working stocks.
   VFM/VMS establish procedures for effective control and management of shop stock.
5.31. High-Cost Bench Stocks.
   5.31.1. Items with a unit cost of $60 or more are defined as "high cost.” Fast-moving, high-
   cost items can be authorized on bench stock when approved by the VFM/VMS. Replenish
   high-cost bench stock using work order number H8888. Use of H8888 causes the parts to be
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  165


   charged against a special "holding" account, rather than against the entire base fleet. When
   the high-cost items are issued to specific AF Forms 1823/-1, they are charged against a
   vehicle using a “QZ” transaction.
Note: Review paragraph 5.44. for additional guidance. High-cost working stock items are not
installed on a vehicle using an AF Form 1827.
   5.31.2. On approval of the VFM/VMS, Materiel Control or VM&A completes an "EZ"
   transaction (see AFCSM 24-1) to add the item to the High-Cost Bench Stock Master List,
   PCN SB004-046.
   5.31.3. Make a line-item entry or attach a preprinted label to the vehicle’s AF Form 1823/-1
   for each high-cost bench stock item issued.
   5.31.4. Materiel Control keeps a current copy of the PCN SB004-046 listing. At least
   quarterly, adjust the prices on the PCN SB004-046 based on the latest M14, the current
   COPARS price list or vendor’s price if purchased with the GPC.
       5.31.4.1. Delete items no longer on high-cost bench stock using an "EZ" transaction by
       placing a “D” in the “Delete Indicator “ block. Input of this transaction clears the item
       from the PCN SB004-046.
   5.31.5. Request a new PCN SB004-046 listing when all changes, additions and deletions are
   made.
5.32. Shelf-Life Items. Control of shelf-life items is the responsibility of the Shop
Bench/Working Stock Monitor once the items are placed in their bench/working stocks. Shelf-
life items are identified in TOs, by markings on the package and on the bench/working stock
labels by the shelf-life code. If the shelf-life item is packaged in a unit pack, the unit pack
containing a quantity nearest the recommended level is issued as the authorized bench/working
stock quantity. Use the oldest items first to prevent waste, First In First Out (FIFO).
   5.32.1. Do not open shelf-life item containers until needed. If shelf-life items are loose in
   the bin and the expiration cannot be found, dispose of the items and replenish.
   5.32.2. Shelf-life items containing a HAZMAT will normally be controlled by the base
   HAZMART. These items will only be issued in pre-authorized quantities to those shops
   authorized the material. Return unused, yet serviceable, HAZMAT to HAZMART if there is
   no immediate need. HAZMATs which have a shelf life are to be purchased for Vehicle
   Management only in a quantity that can be used before its shelf life expires.
5.33. Bench Stock Review. This is the standard method of adding, changing or deleting bench
stock items. The bench stock review will be conducted IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
Chapter 11, Attachment 11D-10.
5.34. Working Stock.
   5.34.1. Working stock is essential to ensure certain fast-moving items are available at the
   Vehicle Management work site to reduce vehicle repair time. VFM/VMS cautiously weigh
   the costs against the benefits when approving stock levels. A separate working stock account
   is established for each outlying work center when approved by the VFM/VMS. Maintain a
   locally developed working stock computer listing for each separate account. The listing
   reflects the following information as a minimum:
 166                                 AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       5.34.1.1. Part description.
       5.34.1.2. Part number.
       5.34.1.3. Unit of issue.
       5.34.1.4. Unit price.
       5.34.1.5. Quantity authorized.
       5.34.1.6. Bin location number.
       5.34.1.7. Low or high cost item.
   5.34.2. Working stock is limited to a 4-week level (based on past experience or
   consumption). Certain bulk items (such as heater hose, etc.) are cheaper and easier to
   manage when bought in bulk; working stocks may be authorized for these and for seasonal
   items, even if their rate of use is low.
   5.34.3. Working stock replenishment is ordered against an L9999 work order number for
   low-cost items (items with a unit cost of less than $60) and an H8888 work order number for
   high-cost items (items with a unit cost of $60 or greater). Low-cost working stock items
   replenished using work order number L9999 are prorated against the entire fleet in the
   overhead labor rate. These items are not charged against individual AF Forms 1823/-1 when
   consumed. Conversely, high-cost working stock items replenished using work order number
   H8888 are held in a special holding account and are charged against the vehicle being
   repaired or serviced on an AF Form 1823/-1 using a “QZ” transaction.

Section 5G—Repair Cycle Asset Management

5.35. General Information. Repair cycle assets are those items with Expendability,
Recoverability, Reparability Code (ERRC) “XD” and “XF”. Examples are tires, some engines,
etc. These items are a large cost investment for the AF and are stringently controlled and cycled
back into the system.
   5.35.1. Materiel Control reviews these items to see that they are processed according to
   AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapters 10 and 13. Materiel Control also ensures that
   all items subject to repair cycle control are managed and controlled according to the DIFM
   concept.
   5.35.2. Use the daily AWP Validation Listing (D19) to perform identification and control
   checks, and prescribed monitoring procedures and files. Close coordination with the LRS
   Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity is a must to ensure strict control of
   DIFM assets.
   5.35.3. DIFM items (whether in repair or in stock) are deemed assets available to satisfy a
   requirement and may be the only source of supply.
5.36. DIFM Issues. A request for repair cycle assets automatically places the transaction under
DIFM control; usually, DIFM issues are for a quantity of one each. For items for which multiple
quantities may be needed (such as tires, matched sets, etc.) a multiple DIFM issue can be made.
When a multiple DIFM issue occurs, the quantity on the subsequent turn-in transaction cannot be
split; therefore, if separate actions are anticipated on the return (e.g., condemned and recapped
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   167


tires), restrict the quantity on DIFM issue requests to one each. Since the DIFM issue document
number is the control element on all DIFM transactions, the duplication of turn-in document
numbers could result in difficulty in tracing the transaction audit trail.
5.37. DIFM Status. The AWP Validation Listing (D19) is a daily listing. The list provides
Materiel Control with current status on each item DIFM. Materiel Control updates the DIFM
detail record each time an item location or status changes. When standard DIFM delinquency
criteria are exceeded, Materiel Control finds the cause and eliminates the delinquency.
Immediately reconcile any discrepancies noted on the D19 with the LRS Flight Service Center or
base Repair Cycle Activity. All daily changes to the D19 report are shown on the next DIFM
listing. OLVIMS, PCNs SB004-016 and SB004-062 show delayed parts on hand that are DIFM
controlled.
5.38. Supply Points. Supply points may be established for tires and other parts at the discretion
of the VFM/VMS. Operate supply points IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 10;
tire supply points, if established, will be IAW TO 36-1-191. Forward supply points will be
coordinated with the Material Management Flight and will be limited to levels not to exceed 90-
day requirements based on historical usage that will be accessed annually. VFM/VMS, and LRS
Stock Control Managers establish manning requirements.
5.39. DIFM and Supply Point Reconciliation. Reconcile supply points each quarter or at an
increased frequency due to high volume of changes.

Section 5H—Other Procedures for Materiel Control

5.40. TCTOs.
   5.40.1. The AF rules on TCTO kit distribution are in TO 00-5-15-WA-1, AF Time
   Compliance Technical Order Process, and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 10.
   The Vehicle IM at WR-ALC makes TO modifications, including assembly, storage and
   distribution of related TCTO kits. Required parts and materials are controlled and sent
   according to the applicable TCTO.
   5.40.2. Materiel Control orders TCTO kits from the AF Form 2001, Notification of TCTO
   Kit Requirements.
       5.40.2.1. Enter the organization and shop code of the Vehicle Management shop
       responsible for doing the modification on part I of the form.
       5.40.2.2. Initiate AF Form 2001 in three copies, with copies one and two sent to the LRS
       Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity and copy three filed in Materiel
       Control.
       5.40.2.3. Provide due-in document number to VM&A when it is available for TCTOs
       requiring a TCTO kit. VM&A provides the document number(s) and registration
       number(s) to WR-ALC to request kit release.
   5.40.3. Materiel Control checks the status of TCTO needs using the D18. Each time a
   TCTO kit asset is received, SBSS generates an “IO29” management notice showing the total
   on-hand balance and each existing due-out detail record. A copy of this notice is sent to
   Materiel Control. Place it in the TCTO jacket file with the AF Form 2001. A display board
 168                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   (the NMCS board or an automated control board may be used) shows the following
   information for all current and outstanding TCTOs:
       5.40.3.1. TCTO number.
       5.40.3.2. Due out document number.
       5.40.3.3. Quantity and unit of issue.
       5.40.3.4. Date requested.
       5.40.3.5. Current status.
       5.40.3.6. Quantity on hand.
       5.40.3.7. Date received.
       5.40.3.8. Mandatory compliance date.
       5.40.3.9. Remarks.
   5.40.4. Materiel Control tells the LRS Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity to
   force a due-out release of the kit for installation when all items are received and the
   modification is scheduled.
   5.40.5. As requested, SBSS produces a monthly TCTO kit reconciliation and status report to
   keep the shop informed of kit availability, shortages, excesses, due-outs and due-ins.
   Materiel Control tells the LRS Flight Service Center or base Repair Cycle Activity of
   excesses, changes or added requirements identified during the reconciliation.
5.41. Tool Accountability and Issue Procedures.
   5.41.1. General Procedures.
       5.41.1.1. The VFM/VMS will develop an OI to specify tool accountability procedures to
       fit the local mission and physical shop layout. At a minimum, the OI will cover
       inventory, spot checks, inlaying tools in foam, plastic, wood and etc., engraving, security
       requirements, reporting and reimbursement procedures for lost and/or missing tools. If a
       tool crib is utilized, its operation is further detailed in this OI.
       5.41.1.2. All tool kits and tool cribs are periodically inventoried and/or spot-checked.
       When accountability changes, a physical inventory is performed by the outgoing and
       incoming responsible individuals, jointly, with Materiel Control. All inventories and spot
       checks will focus on missing tools, serviceability, safety and presence of unauthorized
       items in the tool kit/crib. An inventory record includes the date the inventory was
       completed, the name of the individual who conducted the inventory and a remarks
       column.
          5.41.1.2.1. Technicians will visually inventory their ITKs on a daily basis at the end
          of their shift. Written inventories are accomplished annually by Materiel Control,
          jointly with the technician. Supervisors will spot check ITKs monthly. Spot checks
          will be documented in a locally determined manner.
          5.41.1.2.2. Supervisors (or their designees) visually inventory CTKs on a daily basis
          at the end of the duty day to ensure accountability of assigned tools and to prevent
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     169


           Foreign Object Damage (FOD). Written inventories are accomplished semi-annually
           by Materiel Control, jointly with the supervisor or designee.
           5.41.1.2.3. Materiel Control will visually inventory tool cribs under their control at
           the end of their duty day to ensure accountability of assigned tools and to prevent
           FOD. When tool cribs are managed by outlying sections, section supervisors perform
           this duty. Written inventories are accomplished semi-annually by Materiel Control
           (jointly if assigned to an outlying work center).
           5.41.1.2.4. During inventory, the individual turns in any deleted tools and receipts for
           the remaining tools in his or her possession. Code shortages Not Issued (NI) and
           annotate listing with due-in information for backordered tools. The individual
           completes the certification in ink on each page of the tool list to knowledge receipt of
           the tools.
Note: Any change must be listed in ink and initialed in ink by the individual and Materiel
Control. Destroy any old lists.
           5.41.1.2.5. Materiel Control advises the work center supervisor when backordered
           tools are received. The responsible individual then goes to Materiel Control to pick
           up the tool and shows receipt by lining through the "NI" and dating and initialing the
           entry in ink. All newly received tools must be properly marked with unit or shop
           designator and ITK or CTK number before placement in the ITKs or CTKs.
       5.41.1.3. The VFM/VMS approves initial issue (basic) ITK, CTK and tool crib
       requirements for each functional AFSC, work centers and/or individual tool kits by
       signing the inventory listing prior to issue. Inventory listings include tool NSN and/or
       part number, nomenclature, and quantity authorized.
Note: VFM/VMS may provide blanket approval for initial issue inventories when tool kits are
purchased in quantity as completed preassembled sets or boxes. Blanket approval will be in the
form of a Memorandum for Record, or administrative medium, and will include the effected tool
kit number(s). The VFM/VMS will sign the document and copies will be attached to
manufactures’ original inventory and stored with each tool kit folder.
           5.41.1.3.1. For ITKs being issued, Materiel Control enters the technician’s name,
           grade and tool box number at the bottom of the inventory list, leaving room for
           signature.
           5.41.1.3.2. For CTKs and tool cribs, Materiel Control enters the responsible shop
           supervisor’s (or designee’s) name, grade and kit number at the bottom of the
           inventory list, leaving room for signature.
       5.41.1.4. Warranty hand tools are the standard for vehicle maintenance operations due to
       their high quality and free replacement policy.
       5.41.1.5. Replace damaged and unserviceable tools on a one-for-one exchange basis
       through Materiel Control or the vendor.
       5.41.1.6. Use a separate DLA-DS holding area for condemned hand tools not exchanged
       with the vendor. Transfer condemned expendable hand tools (by weight) to DLA-DS as
       scrap IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 13.
170                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


      5.41.1.7. Powered hand tools may be issued to CTKs, tool cribs or ITKs. Ensure they
      are accurately accounted for due to their high replacement cost.
      5.41.1.8. All tools in ITKs, CTKs and tool cribs are inlaid in foam, plastic, wood, etc.
      when stored in drawers and engraved with a locally assigned kit control number
      designated by Materiel Control. CTKs and tool crib control numbers include the shop
      initials.
      5.41.1.9. Materiel Control establishes and maintains custodial listings for all ITKs, CTKs
      and tool cribs in the Vehicle Management complex. Listings are maintained in folders,
      filed in control (kit or box) number sequence, and include the responsible individual’s
      name, AFSC, work center and kit control number.
      5.41.1.10. Due to the high expense of tools and equipment required for operation of a
      Vehicle Management shop, pilferage concerns and the potential for tools to migrate to the
      flight line and potentially cause FOD, strict accountability is required. Initiate ROS IAW
      AFMAN 23-220 (being replaced by AFI 23-101, Material Management) if items over
      $100 unit cost or $500 total cost are lost or there is evidence of abuse, gross negligence,
      willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use, fraud, theft, or if negligence is
      suspected.
         5.41.1.10.1. Exceptions to initiating ROS must be approved by VFM/VMS and are
         usually based on unique circumstances surrounding the loss, and/or voluntary
         monetary reimbursement or replacement in kind is offered and accepted.
      5.41.1.11. Ensure the procedures in TO 32B14-3-1-101, Operation and Service
      Instructions Torque Indicating Devices, are followed prior to the use of any torque
      device.
  5.41.2. Tool Crib Operations.
      5.41.2.1. A tool crib is a storage and issue point for common and specialized tools shown
      on one or more AS. Tool cribs are established when practical based on physical shop
      layout, Materiel Control manning and other local considerations. VFM/VMS can
      designate other tools to be controlled under these procedures. Materiel Control manages
      tool cribs authorized for the shop complex and outlying tool cribs can be operated by
      work center personnel.
      5.41.2.2. A neat, clean, well-arranged tool crib is necessary to provide tool support and
      ease inventory requirements. Segregate special tools, if possible, by vehicle types and
      display them on shadow boards or store them in bins. Assign each item shown on a
      shadow board an item location designator. Mark this designator on the tool if practical
      and on its storage position on the shadow board. Post item identification and location
      lists near the issue counter. Store common items and those not suitable for the shadow
      board, bins, inlaid in foam, plastic, wood, etc.
      5.41.2.3. Issue tools by AF Form 1297, a chit system, an automated system or other
      locally approved method. Tools are not generally issued for a longer period of time than
      the user’s shift period without approval of the tool crib custodian. Do not issue tools for
      personal use. Set up a tool issue suspense system and check it each duty day to ensure
      tools are returned on time. The shop supervisor is told of individuals who fail to return
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                 171


     tools within the established suspense time as determined locally. Advise the VFM/VMS
     of shops and personnel that continually fail to return tools on time.
     5.41.2.4. Mechanics must clean all tools before returning them to the tool crib. The tool
     crib custodian inspects them on return to make sure they are clean, in good condition and
     free of corrosion.
     5.41.2.5. Materiel Control keeps a complete list of all tools in the tool crib. The list
     contains NSN and/or part numbers, nomenclature, authorized and on-hand quantity and
     other data as needed locally. Perform a complete inventory semi-annually or when the
     tool crib custodian changes.
     5.41.2.6. Materiel Control ensures Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment
     (TMDE) tools are scheduled for calibration and certification according to TO 00-20-14-
     WA-1. Use a visual display board or computer-generated listing to keep the current
     status of all TMDE requiring calibration. Ensure all TMDE is accounted for on the semi-
     annual inventory.
  5.41.3. ITK Procedures.
     5.41.3.1. The tool custodian establishes initial accountability by obtaining the current
     ITK custody receipt listings and folders for all personnel assigned to the unit and issued
     tool kits. Materiel Control sub-receipts ITKs to the technicians using itemized inventory
     listings.
     5.41.3.2. When personnel are transferred or ITKs are no longer needed, the responsible
     technician and Materiel Control conduct a joint inventory. Annually accomplish joint
     inventories for all ITKs.
     5.41.3.3. Unless another technician is to be assigned, the VFM/VMS may choose to keep
     the kit in storage. ITKs in storage are maintained by Materiel Control and have two
     copies of the tool list inside and shortages on order. The ITK is tagged with the kit
     number and the date turned in.
  5.41.4. CTK Procedures.
     5.41.4.1. A CTK is established for common tools not suitable for ITKs. Typically when
     a work center is physically separated from the tool crib, the use of a CTK(s) will save
     time and effort of the mechanics. VFM/VMS may, however, dictate the use of CTKs in
     place of ITKs when deemed most practical. CTKs will be maintained in a neat, clean and
     well-arranged manner to best provide tool support and ease inventory requirements.
     Unless impractical, CTKs are maintained in storage bins, with tools engraved and inlaid
     in foam, plastic, wood, etc.
     5.41.4.2. Materiel Control manages CTKs which are sub-receipted to the section
     supervisors (or their designees) using itemized inventory listings. The tool custodian
     establishes initial accountability by obtaining the current CTK custody receipt listings
     and folders for all CTKs in the unit.
     5.41.4.3. Materiel Control coordinates with applicable supervisors (or their designees) to
     update CTKs and perform inventories when kits are initially issued, semi-annually or
     when the responsible individual is transferred and a new one is assigned. The responsible
     individual and Materiel Control conduct a joint inventory at that time.
 172                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       5.41.4.4. Issue tools from a CTK by AF Form 1297, a chit system, an automated system
       or other locally approved method. Tools are not generally issued for a longer period of
       time than the user’s shift period without approval of the supervisor. Do not issue tools
       for personal use. VFM/VMS sets up a tool issue suspense system and the shop
       supervisor or his designee check the CTK(s) each duty day to ensure tools are returned.
       These checks also include inspection to ensure tools are clean and in good condition.
       5.41.4.5. Materiel Control ensures tools and TMDE assigned to CTKs are scheduled for
       calibration and certification using the same procedures specified for the tool crib TMDE.
   5.41.5. Ensure shop equipment requiring an AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment
   Record, is inspected and serviced monthly at a minimum unless more frequently required by
   manufacturer. Also, ensure compliance with requirements in AFOSHSTD 91-66.
       5.41.5.1. Ensure procurement of special tools, test equipment and training for newly
       received vehicles.
Note: The latest VEMSO evaluations on new tools and equipment can be accessed at the VM
CoP.
5.42. Tire and Battery Procurement/Management.
   5.42.1. All new tires and batteries will be directly charged via the AF Form 1823/-1.
       5.42.1.1. Use work order number H8888 for all vehicle-type batteries ordered for the
       battery shop. Local procedures between Materiel Control and the battery shop supervisor
       assure that when batteries are installed, they are charged properly in OLVIMS, using the
       "QZ" materiel costing transaction.
Note: Batteries must be accounted for on an as-received and issued basis for audit purposes.
   5.42.2. Charge recapped tires purchased through SBSS at the current recap percentage of the
   stock fund price as loaded in OLVIMS. Recapped tires are identified by a -2 suffix in the
   NSN.
       5.42.2.1. Bulk tires recapped using local contract, AF Form 9 or GPC, which are not
       tracked in the supply system, are input in OLVIMS using work order H8888. Use of
       H8888 causes the cost of parts to be charged against a special "holding" account, rather
       than against the entire base fleet. When the tires are issued to a specific AF Form 1823/-
       1, they are charged against a vehicle using a “QZ” transaction.
       5.42.2.2. For each tire issued, make a line item entry or attach a preprinted label to the
       vehicle AF Form 1823/-1.
   5.42.3. Forward supply point tires (see paragraph 5.38.) are issued with Transaction
   Identifier Code (TRIC) “MS” through SBSS creating the OLVIMS transaction to ensure
   proper tire costing and accountability.
   5.42.4. Tires will be procured/consumed in the following order when possible:
       5.42.4.1. Retread Tires. This program takes precedence over the acquisitions of new
       tires from any source. If available, retread tires will be procured from the most
       economical source, provided the tires meet or exceed manufactures’ specifications.
       Refer to paragraph 1.24, additional retread tire procurement instructions.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       173


       5.42.4.2. New Tires. When retread tires cannot be used or economically obtained, new
       tires will be procured from the most economical source, provided the tires meet or exceed
       manufactures’ specifications.
   5.42.5. When determining the most economical source, Vehicle Management must consider
   the “total cost” associated with each tire procurement. For example, the total cost procuring
   from SBSS (e.g., shipping and/or storage charges associated with the Tire Successor
   Initiative (TSI) Integrator fixed-price tire contract) versus the total cost associated with using
   non-SBSS (local) sources.
   5.42.6. Regardless of tire type (retread or new) and procurement source (SBSS or local
   purchase), all tires purchased must be individually annotated on the activity’s GPP Log.
   Refer to paragraph 1.30.2
   5.42.7. Contract Vehicle Maintenance operations are not exempt from the tire procurement
   order listed above, or from the GPP Log requirement. Contracted Vehicle Management
   activities may purchase new tires directly from DLA (if the most economical source) through
   the DOD EMALL at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/emall.asp.
Notes:
1. The current TSI contractor has provided a toll-free 24-hour access number (855-865-7759) to
be used by all tire customers worldwide. The toll free number allows authorized customers to
track both requisitions and shipments status.
2. The DLA Land Supplier Operations Tire and Accessories eCatalog provides the capability to
search, view, print, and export details for (TSI) tires, tire accessories, and wheel assemblies. Go
to: http://www.landandmaritime.dla.mil/Programs/Tirecatalog/Default.aspx, or can be found at
http://tsi.purchaseplace.com.
5.43. Work Order Residue. Items left over from maintenance are placed in "work order
residue" bins, preferably collocated but not commingled with bench stock. Identify work order
residue by NSN or part number and date established as residue. If there is no foreseeable need,
Materiel Control notifies all shop supervisors to take a "last look" to see if there is any need. If
not, the items are processed for disposal. Develop an inventory management system to provide
quick reference for all work order residue items. When a part is removed from residue and
placed on a vehicle, annotate the action on the AF Form 1823/-1 or parts request form by writing
“W/O Residue” in the job description block or parts form respectively. This action will provide
management information concerning the source of the replacement part.
5.44. Vehicle Redistribution and Transfer. When vehicles are redistributed or transferred to
other AF bases or sent to DLA-DS, VM&A advises Materiel Control and applicable work center
supervisors. On notification of a vehicle transfer, Materiel Control will cancel any parts on
order, turn in serviceable parts if no future need is predicted or move them to the work order
residue area. Work center supervisors will have applicable personnel make necessary changes to
bench stocks, working stocks, work order residues and TO libraries.
5.45. Antifreeze Procurement. Vehicle Management activities are required to recycle their
antifreeze or only use reclaimed engine coolant. However, there are exceptions and
documentation requirements. Material Control personnel will refer to paragraph 1.24 for
specific procurement guidance and exceptions.

                                          TRAINING

Section 6A—General Information

6.1. General Information. Successful operation of AF Vehicle Management activities depends
on the knowledge of assigned personnel and how well they accomplish the mission. The CFETP
for Vehicle Management is a comprehensive training program outlining specific training
requirements Vehicle Management personnel should receive as they progress throughout their
career. Career Field Functional Managers at all levels participate in developing the CFETP and
use it to tune their training programs toward achieving the plan’s overall goals.
   6.1.1. The VFM/VMS (or senior base level Vehicle Manager) is the Functional Manager for
   the Vehicle Management specialty at their respective location.
   6.1.2. The VFM/VMS will offer training opportunities to tenant organizations that have 2T3
   personnel assigned when Vehicle Management training resources are not available in the
   2T3’s assigned unit.
   6.1.3. Major Command Functional Managers (MFM) share responsibility in developing the
   CFETP. The AF Career Field Manager (AFCFM) is the single POC responsible for overall
   management of 2T3XX specialties, including policy development, training, skills
   management and career development.
   6.1.4. Training Business Area (TBA). In 2007, AF/A4/7 directed the AF-wide
   implantation of TBA in the A4 community. TBA is an AF Portal, Net-Centric, GCSS-AF IF
   Level 4, web-based application providing AF war fighters with global, real-time visibility
   into the technical qualifications, certifications and training status support professionals AF-
   wide. TBA supports base, wing, and work center level training management activities by
   automating training management business processes previously performed using paper
   records and legacy systems.
       6.1.4.1. Units are not required to perform dual documentation of TBA automated and
       manual (AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder) training records.
       6.1.4.2. Paper copies of the Master Training Plans (MTP) for individual workcenters will
       be maintained IAW AFI 36-2201 until further guidance is provided.
       6.1.4.3. Ancillary training is not a part of TBA. Units will continue to document
       ancillary training IAW the method presently being used.
Note: Additional TBA information may be obtained on the TBA CoP:
https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-LG-ES-04
6.2. MAJCOM Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. Select qualified personnel to perform a detailed functional review of AETC course
   training standards.
   6.2.2. Communicate with AETC or the appropriate school regarding training needs.
   6.2.3. Identify training problems and aid base-level personnel in resolving them.
 176                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   6.2.4. Coordinate Mobile Training Team (MTT) requirements with the technical training
   centers.
6.3. Vehicle Management Training Leader. The VFM/VMS shares overall responsibility for
the Vehicle Management training program with the Unit Training Manager. The VFM/VMS
will assign a qualified 2T3 as the Vehicle Management Training Leader and the appointee should
be a civilian for continuity purposes in all shops with over 40 personnel. The person appointed is
primarily responsible for establishing and monitoring upgrade/qualification training and should
not be assigned additional duties that will prevent full attention to the training program (e.g.,
Environmental Manager, Technical Order Distribution Account Manager, etc.). The Vehicle
Management Training Leader will not reside outside of the physical Vehicle Management shop
due to the need to specifically focus on Vehicle Management training.
   6.3.1. The Vehicle Management Training Leader is also responsible for the following:
       6.3.1.1. Complying with AFI 36-2201 and any MAJCOM/squadron supplements.
       6.3.1.2. Assisting the VFM/VMS in selection of qualified OJT trainers.
       6.3.1.3. Preparing an annual budget to support training requirements (e.g., training
       mock-ups, commercial and unit funded classes and information technology items).
       6.3.1.4. Providing supervisors with assistance in obtaining literature and directives
       pertinent to the OJT program.
       6.3.1.5. Preparing and submitting AETC in-resident training requests in response to the
       Base or MAJCOM 2T3 Training Manager’s annual screening requests. This will be
       prepared during the fourth quarter of the current FY for the next FY.
       6.3.1.6. Assisting supervisors in the development and use of training requirements and
       techniques.
       6.3.1.7. Coordinating with the Unit Training Manager in obtaining any needed training
       from AETC and commercial training sources as outlined in AFI 36-2201 and
       https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
       6.3.1.8. Conducting quarterly reviews of Individual Training Plans (ITP) within TBA for
       personnel in skill-level upgrade training assigned to Vehicle Management.
       6.3.1.9. Conducting quarterly reviews on the training program using the Vehicle
       Management Training Checklist in Attachment 5.
       6.3.1.10. Briefing VFM/VMS on status of all personnel in upgrade training on a regular
       basis.
       6.3.1.11. With the UTM, assist Work Center Supervisors, Trainers and Trainees with
       TBA user training and problem solving.

Section 6B—Types of Training

6.4. Establishing and Managing Vehicle Management Training Program. Vehicle
Management training is more than progressing through the CDCs and completing core tasks.
Various and complex vehicle systems combined with frequent personnel changes demand a
comprehensive, active training program that includes training beyond the initial skill-level
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   177


upgrade process. The program must also include training mechanics on new or improved
troubleshooting techniques, specialized test equipment and advanced vehicle systems. VM&A
personnel receive advanced training on analysis techniques and fleet management processes. An
all-inclusive training program will include the key areas listed below.
   6.4.1. First is the actual skill-level awarding requirements achieved through the CDCs and
   core task completion.
   6.4.2. Second is in-house training to keep mechanics proficient on new technologies and
   expand on the basic principles learned during the initial upgrade training. The in-house
   training will also assist in duty qualifying mechanics.
   6.4.3. Third, and one of the most important areas, is qualification training. As personnel
   rotate from overseas to CONUS bases or into new duty positions, they often need task
   training to be duty position qualified. If not properly task trained, possible injury or death
   could be the result.
   6.4.4. Finally, a training program will also include specific training on unique hazards of
   specific vehicle types and incorporate the use of Operational Risk Management (ORM)
   principles. Safety is paramount to day-to-day operations and it is critical trainers identify
   these hazards prior to the start of any task training.
6.5. OJT. OJT consists of two parts; the first is career knowledge and is achieved by the use of
CDCs or other applicable technical references listed in the CFETP and the second is task
performance and is provided during the actual hands-on training and qualification of core tasks
identified in the CFETP. Refer to AFI 36-2201 Chapter 6, for further guidance for setting up an
OJT program.
   6.5.1. CDC Administration. CDCs contain information on basic principles, techniques and
   procedures common to Vehicle Management. Upgrade trainees should be enrolled in
   electronic-CDCs (e-CDC); however, if conventional CDCs are needed, the UTM can order
   all CDC sets (as applicable) at one time. This reduces overall training upgrade time
   significantly by eliminating the 4-6 week waiting time between sets, but it does not change
   the time requirement to complete CDCs. IAW AFI 36-2201, trainees have 30 days to
   complete each volume of their CDCs from the date the volume is issued to them. A trainee
   will not be issued more than one volume at a time.
       6.5.1.1. Supervisors (with assistance from the Vehicle Management Training Leader)
       will determine volume sequence of study and set the overall course completion schedule.
       6.5.1.2. The Vehicle Management Training Leader will use a local tracking system to
       ensure volumes are completed within 30 days of issue. Members of Air Reserve
       Components (ARC) and Individual Mobilization Augmentee have 60 days to complete
       each CDC Volume.
Note: For more information concerning the Air Force Career Development Academy’s
(AFCDA) e-CDC program go to the AFCDA e-CDC CoP at:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AE-ED-02-37.
       6.5.1.3. Supervisors will determine the reason for slow progress, counsel the trainee,
       document the counseling as a Journal Entry within the trainee’s TBA IPT and place the
       trainee in supervised study.
 178                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       6.5.1.4. Pre-testing. Pre-testing is a very effective tool in determining the current
       knowledge level of the trainee and should minimize Course Exam failures. VFM/VMS
       will develop local guidance for pre-testing trainees prior to taking the Course Exam as
       part of the Master Training Plan or OI.
          6.5.1.4.1. A pre-testing policy will include the following:
              6.5.1.4.1.1. When to administer the pre-test, after each volume or after each set.
              6.5.1.4.1.2. Minimum passing score for each pre-test administered.
              6.5.1.4.1.3. The number of pre-tests given prior to the Course Exam.
              6.5.1.4.1.4. Frequency of re-testing for trainees that fails to achieve the
              established passing score on the pre-test.
          6.5.1.4.2. VFM/VMS will conduct an interview with the trainee, trainee’s supervisor
          and Vehicle Management Training Leader at least 3 days prior to Course Exam day.
          The interview will focus on the confidence level of the trainee to pass the test and
          should provide ample time to postpone the Course Exam if necessary.
   6.5.2. Core Task Completion/Qualification. Most of the 2T3 AFSCs have more than 100
   core tasks that must be completed before a trainee will be upgraded and task completion is
   the most time-consuming portion of the upgrade process. Vehicle Management Training
   Leaders, with assistance from the work center supervisors, will develop projected milestones
   for core task completion that can correspond with CDC completion. A proactive approach to
   core task completion/qualification will ensure the trainee is upgraded in a timely manner.
   The training visibility Léger within TBA will be reviewed monthly for personnel not
   progressing on tasks for more than thirty days. Trainers will document legitimate reasons,
   such as deployment or TDY within the Journal Entry section of TBA.
       6.5.2.1. Review 18-month scheduled maintenance plan when developing timelines.
       Since every vehicle will pass through Vehicle Management at least once every 18 months
       for PM&I, this will provide a good starting point to determine vehicle availability for
       each month.
       6.5.2.2. Identify the number of tasks a trainee should complete per month and meet with
       the trainer and trainee to discuss the upcoming month’s core task completion goals.
       6.5.2.3. Trainers will use lesson plans to ensure all trainees are trained at the same level,
       no matter who is doing the training. Trainers may use or benchmark the Standardized
       Lesson Plans and Core Task Performance Standards that are available for download from
       the VM CoP.
       6.5.2.4. Trainers will provide trainees safety briefings to identify hazards specific to the
       current vehicle or system being trained.
   6.5.3. MTP. A “hard copy” MTP will be developed and maintained by the work center
   supervisor and will reflect duty position requirements to reflect 100 percent task coverage.
   For guidance developing a MTP, refer to AFI 36-2201.
Note: Workcenter Job Qualification Standard can be printed from TBA in place of AF Form
797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  179


   6.5.4. Rotation Plan for 7-Levels. Rotate mechanics in upgrade training to the 7-skill level
   through each section of Vehicle Management. Allow sufficient time for the trainee to gain a
   working knowledge of the section. VM&A personnel will be rotated internally within their
   section to ensure competency in all areas of their specialty. Personnel rotation is deemed an
   essential element of an individual’s upgrade training and deployment preparation.
Note: To ensure 7-level mechanics continue to stay proficient, consider rotating them through
each section of Vehicle Management as workload and mission allows.
       6.5.4.1. If mission requirements and work load allows, VFM/VMS may rotate
       experienced 5-levels through all work centers to increase breadth of experience and help
       prepare them for deployment tasking(s). This should also minimize the impact of high
       deployment tasking(s) on home station operations by increasing the available manpower
       to perform unique tasks.
   6.5.5. Tracking Time-In-Training. It is important the training program includes a
   mechanism to track the amount of time an individual has been in upgrade training. This
   should be a metric used by the VFM/VMS to measure supervisory involvement in upgrade
   training. The goal for the training program is established in the CFETP.
   6.5.6. Graduate Assessment Survey (GAS). As part of its training effectiveness
   evaluation, AETC requests evaluations of recent graduates from field units. The GAS is sent
   to the supervisors of graduates approximately 90 days after formal course graduation.
       6.5.6.1. HQ AETC, in conjunction with 2AF, has converted to a web-based process that
       enables the supervisors of graduates to complete the GAS electronically. Supervisors
       will be notified through e-mail from base education. Paper-based surveys will still be
       sent to those isolated units that do not have access to electronic mail or internet.
       Guidance can be found in AFI 36-2201.
6.6. In-House Training. The ever-increasing cost of maintaining vehicles demands trained
mechanics pass on what they have learned to other mechanics. The rapidly changing technology
used on vehicles requires the AF mechanic to stay proficient on theory of operations, diagnostic
procedures and test equipment. The in-house portion of the program accomplishes this type of
training and will include both classroom instruction and hands-on progress checks.
   6.6.1. The in-house program should include various levels of training on the following main
   vehicle systems:
       6.6.1.1. Automotive electrical and electronics.
       6.6.1.2. Brake systems.
       6.6.1.3. Wheel alignment.
       6.6.1.4. Automatic transmissions and transaxles.
       6.6.1.5. Engine cooling and climate control.
       6.6.1.6. Four wheel drive and differentials.
       6.6.1.7. Engine repair.
       6.6.1.8. Engine performance diagnosis, emission testing and tune-up.
 180                                 AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       6.6.1.9. Oxyacetylene and welding (for contingencies).
   6.6.2. Consider taking a "Phase" approach when developing classes within the nine main
   areas. This will provide the framework for a progressive approach and allow mechanics to
   enhance their skills as they move through each phase of the training.
       6.6.2.1. Phase I should cover the basic vehicle systems and will target the entry-level
       mechanics. Some classes may include:
          6.6.2.1.1. Basic electricity.
          6.6.2.1.2. Brake systems.
          6.6.2.1.3. Steering system.
          6.6.2.1.4. Engine cooling and heating.
          6.6.2.1.5. Automatic transmission.
          6.6.2.1.6. Four wheel drives and differentials.
          6.6.2.1.7. Valve trains.
          6.6.2.1.8. Fuel systems.
       6.6.2.2. Phase II should train mechanics to a higher level of complexity and include
       classes in:
          6.6.2.2.1. Chassis instrumentation.
          6.6.2.2.2. Power brake systems.
          6.6.2.2.3. Power steering systems.
          6.6.2.2.4. TBI and PFI Injections.
       6.6.2.3. Phase III should be used to train the mechanics to the more advanced level and
       can include classes on manufacturer-specific systems:
          6.6.2.3.1. Ford air conditioning systems.
          6.6.2.3.2. Chrysler automatic transaxle.
          6.6.2.3.3. GM automatic overdrive.
          6.6.2.3.4. Transfer cases.
          6.6.2.3.5. Differentials.
          6.6.2.3.6. Engine block rebuilding.
          6.6.2.3.7. Valve refacing.
          6.6.2.3.8. Drum and rotor lathe operation.
          6.6.2.3.9. Antilock brake systems.
          6.6.2.3.10. Wheel alignment.
Note: The automotive systems and areas listed above are not all-inclusive or may not apply to
all 2T3XX mechanical AFSCs. Supervisors and VM Training Leaders will refer to the 2T3XX
Specialty Training Standard when selecting In-House Training program courses for selected
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  181


AFSCs or workcenters.
      6.6.2.4. Phase IV should be used to prepare mechanics specifically for the National
      Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) exams. ASE is the industry standard
      for measuring mechanic competency, and VFM/VMS will encourage this type of
      certification for those mechanics that wish to pursue ways to improve personal technical
      skills.
      6.6.2.5. Phase V should incorporate the use of commercial advanced classes from
      various manufacturers (i.e., GM, Ford, Chrysler, Oshkosh, etc.). These types of classes
      are normally taught at a very advanced level and may seem overwhelming for younger,
      less-experienced mechanics. This is why only the most experienced mechanics will
      attend this type of training.
   6.6.3. Identifying Needs. First, determine local training requirements: There are several
   ways:
      6.6.3.1. Solicit feedback from supervisors and mechanics.
      6.6.3.2. Work with VM&A to perform data analysis on specific system codes or
      recurring maintenance for various vehicles. This should assist in identifying negative
      maintenance trends and pinpoint mechanics’ weak areas that need to be strengthened
      using focused remedial training. This is an ongoing requirement given that mechanics
      are constantly rotating in and out.
   6.6.4. Training Aids/Materials. There are several media types that can be used to assist in
   the classroom instruction.
      6.6.4.1. Commercial Trade Publications. Information technology has overcome the need
      to subscribe to trade publications in many instances. Information relating to management
      and upkeep of vehicles is readily available on the Internet. VFM/VMS will determine
      their needs and sources for obtaining this information or publications.
      6.6.4.2. Web-based Course Material. On-line training courses are available from many
      commercial companies. On-line courses can save the administrative time required to
      keep information updated but are more expensive then videotapes.
      6.6.4.3. Training Aids (Vehicle Components). Vehicle system mock-ups reinforce the
      theory of operation and diagnostics by providing hands-on demonstration. Figure 6.1
      shows some training aids manufactured using vehicle components from salvaged
      vehicles.
      6.6.4.4. Videotapes. Videotapes are the most common training aid used in the classroom
      and are great for supplementing classroom lectures but are not very student interactive.
      6.6.4.5. DVD/CD-ROMs. Interactive training DVDs or CD-ROMS offers a flexibility
      and superiority not found in ordinary linear training videos.
   6.6.5. Selecting In-House Training Instructors. Key to a successful in-house training
   program is supervisory involvement. The supervisors are the most experienced and possess
   an understanding for what it takes to complete the day-to-day tasks. This is why the training
   leaders are encouraged to recruit the supervisors to fill the role as classroom instructors.
182                                AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


      6.6.5.1. The Vehicle Management Training Leader will develop an internal program to
      enhance the classroom instructional skills of the instructors. This will not only build the
      confidence of the instructor but will also improve the quality of the delivery of the
      information.
      6.6.5.2. Classroom instructors can improve personal teaching techniques by completing
      the Air Force Training Course (Mandatory for all personnel identified as trainers and task
      certifiers). Note: See Unit or Base Training Manager for course details.
      6.6.5.3. Instructors will conduct at least one class as often as possible to stay proficient in
      the subject matter.
      6.6.5.4. The Vehicle Management Training Leader will encourage instructors to pursue
      ASE certification in the area they will teach. This can bring increased credibility to them
      as an instructor.
  6.6.6. Scheduling the Training. The Vehicle Management Training Leader will work
  closely with supervisors to ensure trainees are available for training. Consider scheduling
  classes during the first half of the duty day and try not to conduct classes longer than four
  hours per day.
      6.6.6.1. Classes do not need to include all trainees. Classes can be developed for
      multiple days for smaller groups. This will also minimize the impact on work center
      workloads.
  6.6.7. Progress checks and follow up. It is important the training process include some
  type of tool to measure the effectiveness of the training upon completion of the class.
      6.6.7.1. Pre-tests and post-tests are great tools to determine if the instructor was
      successful with the delivery of the course material.
      6.6.7.2. A review of missed questions and open classroom discussions is another
      effective way to determine if the training was successful.
      6.6.7.3. Supervisor and student feedback through the use of critiques and informal
      conversations are good ways to identify areas needing improvement in the curriculum
      and delivery of the material.
      6.6.7.4. A long-term indicator for an effective training program is the decline in
      previously identified negative management trends.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     183

6.7. Qualification Training. Qualification training is a continuous process, starting with the
individual's entry into service. This portion of the program will train personnel on a specific
duty position. An example of a need for qualification training would be a Staff Sergeant
reassigned from an overseas to a CONUS base who is not familiar with certain vehicles in the
local fleet.
    6.7.1. Work Center Orientation and Initial Evaluation. Supervisors must conduct a work
    center orientation and an initial evaluation for all newly assigned personnel within 60 days of
    assignment. Both the orientation and evaluation must be documented in the individual’s ITP
    as a journal entry within TBA.
Exception: Supervisors of ARC personnel have 120 days to complete orientation/evaluation.
Note: Suspense will be automatically generated by TBA upon loading an individual into their
workcenter. It is important to review the TBA suspense system at least monthly.
        6.7.1.1. After identifying training requirements as part of the orientation and evaluation,
        the individual will be enrolled in the local in-house training track to get him or her duty
        position qualified.
    6.7.2. Management Training. The VFM/VMS determines management qualification
    training needs and as personnel progress into supervisory/management positions they will
    attend, at a minimum, the following courses:
        6.7.2.1. Supervisory Safety Training Course. Contact the Unit Safety Representative or
        Unit Training Manager for scheduling training.
 184                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       6.7.2.2. Vehicle Maintenance Superintendent Course (L6ACW2T370 00AA).               Note:
       This is a Computer Based Training course.
   6.7.3. EPA Certification Training. Technicians whose duties include Motor Vehicle Air
   Conditioners (MVAC) maintenance require training and certification. They may also require
   specific certification if the local implementation of the EPA emissions control inspection and
   maintenance program contains provisions for the AF to perform this type of work. The EPA,
   and possibly a state or local authority implementing the program, approves course of
   instruction and certification methods.
6.8. Advanced Training.
   6.8.1. Commercial Training. Commercial sources provide many excellent training courses,
   as do manufacturers of equipment and vehicles at factory and regional locations. Some
   mobile commercial training courses can be scheduled on base. The Vehicle Management
   Training Leader and VFM/VMS will seek local sources for commercial training. MAJCOM
   Vehicle Management Staffs will aid in finding commercial sources. Once a commercial
   training source is located, review AFI 36-2201 for advanced training procedures, and Table
   4.1. for funding requirements.
   6.8.2. Inter-service Training. Special training by other DOD or Federal agencies can be
   arranged by AETC. Review AFI 36-2230_IP, Interservice Training, for details.
   6.8.3. AFS Training. Specialty training and advanced courses available for Vehicle
   Management personnel can be found in the 2T3XX CFETP and are listed at
   https://etca.randolph.af.mil/. This includes basic and advanced courses. Submit requests
   for this type of training through the MAJCOM. These courses are available for all Vehicle
   Management skills including VM&A personnel.
   6.8.4. Advanced AETC and MAJCOM Courses. Advanced and special courses are
   conducted at AETC Technical Training Centers, the European Technical Training Center
   (ETTC) and the Pacific Technical Training Center (PTTC); or via AETC, USAFE and
   PACAF MTT courses at the host base facilities. Personnel selected for this type of training
   are normally at the 5-skill level or higher. Request this training through the MAJCOM 2T3
   training management function.
6.9. ASE. ASE is the automotive industry standard of competency. Since it recognizes an
individual’s accomplishments, ASE certification serves as an impartial, third-party endorsement
of a mechanic’s knowledge and experience on a national, even international, basis.
   6.9.1. ASE certification is a voluntary professional commitment to recognize qualified and
   competent individuals. It is an indicator of a mechanic’s initiative to enhance personal
   technical skills. VFM/VMS will encourage participation.
   6.9.2. Personnel are allowed to test twice yearly in May and November. The Defense
   Activity for Non-Traditional Support (DANTES) covers the cost of three exams per cycle for
   military personnel, but the individual or Vehicle Management must pay a registration fee.
   Certification is valid for 5 years at which time individuals must re-certify to keep ASE
   credentials in specialty areas of certification. Re-certification exams are not funded by
   DANTES so they will need to be funded by the individual or Vehicle Management.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     185


   6.9.3. Contact the base Force Development Flight/Education Office for more information on
   DANTES-funded ASE testing.
6.10. Certified Technician Program. Certified Technician Programs realign process
ownership and responsibility for repair actions with those actually performing the work.
MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs may establish certified technician programs for use at all
subordinate, or specified management activities. If established, MAJCOM guidance will include
eligibility criteria, certification-decertification-recertification processes and details on
administering the program at the execution level as a minimum.
6.11. “Maintenance Purposes Only” Vehicle Operator Certification. The VFM/VMS
appoints “Maintenance Purposes Only” vehicle trainers, in an OI, who will ensure that vehicle
management personnel receive vehicle safety and equipment familiarization training before
authorizing operation of a government vehicle for maintenance purposes.
   6.11.1. Follow procedures in AFI 24-301.
   6.11.2. Personnel will retain a copy of the most current and signed AF Form(s) 171, Request
   for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government Drivers License, when transferring to
   another unit and give to new supervisor.
Note: “Maintenance Purposes Only” vehicle operator certification will not satisfy local law
enforcement licensing requirements if vehicle operators are not properly licensed for off base/site
use. Check with local law enforcement authorities to ensure compliance with local laws if
vehicles are tested off base/site. All personnel who operate AF vehicles (other than for
“Maintenance Purposes Only”) must have a valid AF Form 2293, USAF Motor Vehicle Operator
Identification Card. Contractor employees must follow procedures in AFI 24-301.

                                           Chapter 7

               DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION

Section 7A—Introduction And Documentation Rules

7.1. General Information. This chapter contains the procedures for Vehicle Management
documentation and records administration.
7.2. General Description and Basic Principles of the Vehicle Management Data Collection
System.
   7.2.1. The VFM/VMS ensures all day-to-day business of the Vehicle Management activity is
   properly documented. Collect data by converting maintenance repair work to codes and
   recording those codes in spaces on forms. The codes are computer processed to make
   summary reports, which are sent to VFM/VMS for use in analyzing, planning, scheduling
   and controlling the vehicle management effort. This data is maintained as accurately and
   timely as possible. A comprehensive backup system is used to allow recovery of this data
   should a failure occur in the data system.
Note: OLVIMS data backups will be accomplished at a frequency established by MAJCOM and
stored at an offsite location.
   7.2.2. Labor hours spent on tire and battery build-up (not identifiable to a specific vehicle)
   are direct hours. Labor cost for these hours is prorated by OLVIMS against the entire fleet as
   indirect cost. Indirect productive hours (administrative, supervision, etc.) are automatically
   computed by OLVIMS using the difference between direct productive and indirect
   nonproductive hours and the employee available hours.
   7.2.3. Labor-hour data is entered on forms in hours and 10ths. Minutes are recorded as
   10ths of hours as follows:
01 through 02 minutes - .0 hour.
03 through 08 minutes - .1 hour.
09 through 14 minutes - .2 hours.
15 through 20 minutes - .3 hours.
21 through 26 minutes - .4 hours.
27 through 33 minutes - .5 hours.
34 through 39 minutes - .6 hours.
40 through 45 minutes - .7 hours.
46 through 51 minutes - .8 hours.
52 through 57 minutes - .9 hours.
58 through 60 minutes - whole hour.
7.3. Use of Printed Characters. Print all entries on records except for signatures and stamped
initials of inspectors.
7.4. Legibility. Ensure that maintenance records are legible, complete and correct.
7.5. Transfer and Disposition.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     187


   7.5.1. VM&A ensures all records are complete when a vehicle is transferred to another base
   or to DLA-DS.
       7.5.1.1. Send AF Forms 1823/-1 in the historical file at the time of transfer with the
       records.
       7.5.1.2. VM&A keeps copies of vehicle historical records, Static Data AZ, BZ and CZ
       transactions and the last AFTO Form 91.
Note: Retain only the AFTO Form 91 and the document that directed the disposition action for
vehicles processed to DLA-DS.
   7.5.2. Use USAF management code 4000 in place of the vehicle’s actual management code
   when processing vehicles for disposal once disposition instructions have been received (the
   final preparation for salvage work order only). Use vehicle management’s RC/CC code and
   the using organization code of “0O” (Zero Oscar) for management code 4000 AF Forms
   1823/-1. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs determine the use of management code
   4000 for new vehicles processing in to the base, excess or depot. The use of management
   code 4000 will show the proper NMC hours against the fleet.
   7.5.3. Vehicle static data records for newly received vehicles will be put into OLVIMS when
   the using unit is known by using the proper vehicle management code, organization code and
   RC/CC code. All acceptance inspections are initiated and records loaded within five working
   days after release of the vehicle from the receiving activity.
   7.5.4. Process vehicle disposition packages through all base-level OPRs within 10 working
   days.
   7.5.5. “Closed” vehicle work orders to include accident/abuse, final disposition approval
   documents and LTIs will be maintained IAW Table 24 in the AF RDS in AFRIMS..
7.6. Vehicle and Equipment Records. The practice of physically storing and filing paper
vehicle/equipment maintenance forms and records has been the only option available for many
years. However, the practice of scanning and electronically storing/filing vehicle records (i.e.,
permanent and active vehicle historical records/documents (record jacket contents), processed
AF Form 1827, etc.) to replace or augment a shop’s “paper” filing system is an option base level
vehicle management activities should consider. By converting to electronic files, VM activities
can store maintenance records in an off-site location/server as back-up files, at the same time
making vehicle maintenance/repair historical documentation readily available to repair shop
personnel, including outlying work centers.
   7.6.1. Hard copy vehicle and equipment historical record (jacket) instructions.
       7.6.1.1. VM&A initiates a vehicle jacket file when a vehicle is first received.
       7.6.1.2. Make a historical records file (jacket) for each vehicle maintained by the shop.
       This record file has two sections, historical and active.
       7.6.1.3. File historical records in either vehicle registration number sequence or in
       management code and registration number sequence.
       7.6.1.4. File all material in the active (working record) portion of the jacket file in
       chronological order and file material in the historical portion of the jacket file by record
       type, in chronological order.

   7.6.2. Electronic vehicle and equipment record instructions.
       7.6.2.1. VM&A will establish an electronic file plan. Refer to Figure 7.1, Sample
       Electronic Vehicle Record File Plan.
       7.6.2.2. VM&A will establish a main-folder for each vehicle or equipment item listed on
       the OLVIMS Vehicle Master List. The name of the folder will be the vehicle’s
       Registration Number. The vehicle management code or VMIF nomenclature may also be
       part of this folder’s name.
       7.6.2.3. Contained within each vehicle’s electronic main-folder will be two sub-folders:
       the Historical and the Active sub-folders.
       7.6.2.4. A “Vehicle Histories – Central File” will also be established. This main file will
       store the historical record of vehicles that have been transferred or disposed of.
   7.6.3. See Table 7.2, Vehicle And Equipment Records: Rules 1-13, for filing directions
   for forms, documents, correspondence and other related data for vehicle and equipment
   records.
7.7. Missing Forms. The receiving unit asks the shipping unit to send missing records, or
duplicate copies, when new or used equipment is received without complete records.
7.8. Maintenance of Forms for Vehicles and Equipment in Extended Storage. When
placing vehicles and equipment in storage as stated in TO 36-1-191 or like directives, record
vehicle maintenance inspections the same as if they were in an operational status. Maintain
records in an active file until the vehicle is disposed of.

Notes:
1. Document names in the Active sub-folder should start with the date the form was finalized,
i.e., Work Order Close Date, followed by the W.O. number and AF Form number. This will
allow for sorting documents in chronological order.
2. All associate documents to the AF Form 1823/-1, e.g., AF Forms 4354 and 4355, AFTO 91,
parts request forms, etc. will be scanned into one document, with the AF Form 1823/-1.

7.9. Processing Vehicles to Vehicle Management. VM&A schedules and controls vehicle
management and inspections. Enter all work on an AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827
according to Chapter 4.
7.10. Maintenance of Transient Vehicles.
    7.10.1. Vehicle Management inspects and repairs transient vehicles.
    7.10.2. Document and process transient vehicle AF Forms 1823/-1 as shown in this chapter,
    except that VM&A sends copies of the AF Forms 1823/-1 to the home station to ensure data
    is included in their historical records.
    7.10.3. The base that does the work assigns a management code of 5000 and a work order
    number prefix code to the AF Form 1823/-1.
    7.10.4. It is not necessary to total OLVIMS AF Form 1823/-1 entries, as the system
    automatically produces a transient vehicle listing that shows total cost. VM&A sends the
    listing to the transient vehicle’s home base.
7.11. Vehicles Assigned TDY or Deployed.
    7.11.1. A copy of the Vehicle Historical Record is sent with each vehicle operating on TDY
    for 30 days or longer. (Exception: A copy of the current vehicle historical record
    accompanies each vehicle or equipment item sent TDY for special weapons movement,
    regardless of the duration of the TDY.) At the TDY station, VM&A ensures that each
    service, repair and inspection is updated on the vehicle historical record and that the form is
    returned with the vehicle when the TDY is over. At local option, on return from TDY, the
    home station VM&A will update the original vehicle historical record with new data from the
    TDY copy by initializing an AF Form 1823/-1.

   which are necessary to provide cost, repair and inspection data to the home station.
       7.11.2.1. The home station VM&A attaches a card showing the mailing and e-mail
       address of the home station VM&A and the scheduled data for that particular vehicle
       with the copy of the vehicle historical record. When the vehicle arrives at the TDY
       station, the Vehicle Management activity receiving the copy of the vehicle historical
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   193


      record and the attachments immediately notifies the home station of the address of the
      supporting VM&A activity. The operator or TDY team supervisor is responsible for this
      action if management support is provided by another government agency or commercial
      source.
      7.11.2.2. For vehicles on TDY, VM&A at the TDY station controls the vehicle historical
      record, PM&I and Special Inspection data. It sets up schedules with the TDY personnel
      for turning the vehicle in for PM&I and Special Inspections. The TDY station VM&A
      sends the vehicle return listing (PCN SB004-019) to the home station as they are
      received. Send copies of AF Forms 1823/ 1823-1, Operator’s Inspection Guide and
      Trouble Reports, and other appropriate records to the home station when the TDY station
      no longer needs them for reference.
      7.11.2.3. For TDY vehicles supported by another government agency or commercial
      source, the vehicle operator or TDY team supervisor sends copies of completed agency
      work order, job order, repair order or invoices (AF Form 15, United States Air Force
      Invoice (NOT LRA), or Commercial Fleet Service Card) to the home station and
      transcribes data to the duplicate vehicle historical record.
   7.11.3. For vehicles on TDY for 30 days or less, VM&A at the TDY station or the operator
   sends the vehicle return listing and AF Forms 1823/-1 or invoices, as indicated above, to the
   home station. All records generated during the TDY are generally returned to the home
   station with the vehicle.
   7.11.4. Include the Vehicle Historical Record in the documentation package to accompany
   vehicles deploying in support of contingency operations. See paragraph A2.3 for specific
   guidance on documentation requirements for vehicle deployments.

Section 7B—Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report Forms

7.12. General Information.
   7.12.1. The three Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report forms used by
   vehicle/equipment operators are listed below:
      7.12.1.1. AF Form 1800: for use with all registered vehicles and vehicular equipment
      except refueling vehicles and FSE.
      7.12.1.2. AF Form 1807: for use with all fuel servicing vehicles.
      7.12.1.3. AF Form 4427: for use with all FSE.
7.13. Procedures for Recording Discrepancies and Delaying Maintenance.
   7.13.1. Operators record any discrepancies found during inspections which require
   maintenance in the “Vehicle/Equipment Discrepancy and Maintenance Report” section of the
   appropriate Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form, and report them to
   Vehicle Management. Note: Operators do not make entries in the “Maintenance Report
   Status” section of the forms, except for end-of-month closeout as stated in paragraph 7.17.1
   7.13.2. When an operator reports discrepancies in any of the safety-type systems or devices,
   as described in paragraph 3.19.2.2, that could adversely affect the safety of personnel or the
   operation of equipment, that maintenance is not delayed and the vehicle or equipment item
 194                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   will not be continued in service. The VFM/VMS, or a qualified representative, resolves any
   question about the seriousness of a discrepancy, decides whether the discrepancy can be
   delayed and if it can, initials the maintenance report section on the inspection guide. At
   contract Vehicle Management locations, the Functional Area Chief (FAC) or QAP resolves
   any discrepancy issues.
7.14. Instructions for the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report. The following
instructions apply to all three forms. The forms are described in three sections.
Notes:
1. AF Forms 1800, 1807 and 4427 allow VCO/VCNCOs to electronically enter “Heading”,
“Items to be Checked” information and proper front and rear tire PSIs, as well as “Beginning
and/or Ending of the Month Operating Miles/Hours” information.
2. MAJCOM Vehicle Management activities may approve form entry/completion variations for
contracted vehicle management activities under their command, provided such variations are in
keeping with the spirit and intent (operator maintenance/accountability documentation and
monthly maintenance documentation) of the forms.
7.15. Heading Information. The using organization enters the heading data (top portion of
front, page 1) and issues forms for each vehicle or equipment item on the 1st duty day of the
month. The operator who performs the first inspection of the new month closes out the previous
month’s form by carrying forward the required entries according to the following paragraphs.
The operator will ensure the previous month’s form is returned to the using organization’s
VCO/VCNCO. The new form will be kept with the vehicle while in use.
7.16. Items to Be Checked, Operator’s Signature and Monthly Tire Pressure Check. A
general listing of items to be checked during the Operator’s Inspection are listed on the forms.
Specific areas/items requiring inspection will be identified by using organization by placing an
“X” in the column adjacent to the specific area/item row. The numbered rows that are labeled
“OTHER” can be used for locally added items. This is especially useful when adapting one of
the forms to a peculiar equipment item. Items to be added will be coordinated between the user
and the maintenance shop.
   7.16.1. Each item requiring an Operator’s Inspection is serviced, checked and/or
   operationally tested during each inspection (refer to paragraph 3.19) To keep the form neat,
   operators will not make any entries, check marks or initials, on the rows where items are
   listed other than the “X” mentioned above.
       7.16.1.1. On the AF Form 4427 only, each item requiring a weekly inspection will be
       documented by placing the date the inspection was accomplished in the corresponding
       and applicable weekly block; NOT the operator’s initials.
   7.16.2. Space is provided for an operator's signature corresponding to the numbered day of
   the month (and shift on the AF 1800) on page 1. An operator's legible signature consisting of
   first initial and last name (opposite the appropriate day of the month) shows completion of
   inspection or servicing for each item.
       7.16.2.1. Further, the operator's signature shows the entry of item numbers for which a
       discrepancy is being reported on the discrepancy and maintenance report or, the signature
       could show that the operator is aware that the entry is already being carried in a delayed
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   195


       or waiver status. Leave blank or void entry on the operator signature lines opposite the
       days of the month an inspection was not performed (non-use days) or required.
       7.16.2.2. The operator certifies completion of the inspection even though the
       discrepancies found and reported to Vehicle Management may result in placing the
       vehicle NMC. If the vehicle is returned to service that same day, the operator has only to
       make a brief visual check.
   7.16.3. Vehicle operators will perform monthly tire pressure check (to include spare tire) by
   the 10th calendar day of each month and document completion on page 2 or 3 of the
   appropriate Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form. VCO/VCNCOs may
   electronically enter the vehicle’s manufactures’ recommended tire pressure on the form,
   however operators must still check and adjust pressure as required.
Notes:
1. Monthly tire pressure checks will be completed and documented regardless of organizational
utilization of the vehicle.
2. Documentation of spare tire pressure check on the appropriate Operator’s Inspection Guide
and Trouble Report is not required.
3. For vehicles equipped with electronic Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), vehicle
operators will perform visual inspection of tires to ensure proper operation of TPMS dash
indicator and check for unusual wear or damage. Operators will write “TPMS” in the
appropriate PSI block(s) and sign form.
Exception: The monthly tire pressure check for vehicles that are NMC during the first 10
calendar days of the month will be completed and documented by the operator at the time the
vehicle is released/pick-up from maintenance.
7.17. Discrepancy and Maintenance Report Section (page 2). This section is used by
operators and vehicle management personnel for documenting vehicle discrepancy and reporting
actions, and the disposition (maintenance action/status) of discrepancies listed. However,
Vehicle Management may also use this section to record the completion of scheduled inspections
and/or discrepancies found during service/repairs.
   7.17.1. Before entering a discrepancy, both Vehicle Management personnel and operators
   must check the discrepancy list, and status to avoid duplicate reporting and processing of
   discrepancies. When a new monthly form is initiated, all open discrepancies (when the date
   under “Maintenance Report Status” is blank) are transferred to the new form and “C/F”
   (carried forward) entered in the blank "Date" block of the old form.
   7.17.2. Additional instructions for completing this part of the form are as follows:
       7.17.2.1. Item No. Enter the "item number" of the inspection guide’s "Item to be
       Checked" list against which a discrepancy is being reported. Leave blank when the
       discrepancy is not related to a numbered item.
       7.17.2.2. Discrepancy. Enter a brief description of the discrepancy.
       7.17.2.3. Date Disc (Discovered). Enter the date the discrepancy is found and entered.
       7.17.2.4. Date/Time. Enter the date and 24-hour clock time (four-digit military time;
       e.g., 1730) that the vehicle or equipment was turned in for repair or request for
 196                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       maintenance support (mobile, wrecker, etc.) was received (reflect period that vehicle is
       not operational).
       7.17.2.5. Miles/Hours. Enter the current hour meter or odometer reading next to the
       discrepancy.
Note: Do not include “tenths”.
       7.17.2.6. Name. The individual completing the "Reported To Maintenance" part of this
       form prints their name in this space.
   7.17.3. VM&A personnel, VFM/VMS, a work center representative or shift supervisor, CSC
   personnel or Mobile Maintenance technicians complete Maintenance Report Status entries.
   The VFM/VMS will prescribe permanent waiver forms use and/or a locally developed
   system to track waivered deficiencies.
Note: The work center supervisor or designated personnel identifies items on the AF Form
1823/-1 that are permanently waived. VM&A and/or CSC transcribe these items to the
permanent waiver form or system of record.
       7.17.3.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number (block 2 of AF Form
       1823/-1 or AF Form 1827) on which the discrepancy is annotated for maintenance action.
       Enter "None" if repairs were not required or if the discrepancy was waivered without an
       AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827 entry.
       7.17.3.2. Date. Enter the AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827 close-out/completion date.
       If the maintenance action is delayed, leave the date blank and enter the appropriate status
       code.
       7.17.3.3. Status Code. These codes are listed on the bottom of the form. The codes are
       self-explanatory, except that code "W" (waiver of repair) is intended to identify items that
       do not require repair or replacement, and do not adversely affect safety or performance of
       the equipment. Additional status codes may be adopted locally, according to need, for
       more detailed status information. Items entered in the discrepancy block which could not
       be validated by maintenance are dated, a "N" status code entered, and initialed in the
       maintenance report section of the Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form.
       These entries are made only by Vehicle Management personnel. An optional procedure
       can be used to keep waived items in the permanent section of the vehicle historical record
       jacket as a backup in case the using organization loses or damages the waiver form kept
       in the vehicle. A computer-based software program is also authorized for waiver control
       (preferred method). At a minimum, wavered items will be reviewed and updated when
       vehicles are turned in for scheduled maintenance.
       7.17.3.4. Employee Number. The person who assigns a status code to a discrepancy
       enters their OLVIMS employee number in this block.
   7.17.4. Status code entries will not be made by VM&A or a representative until all
   management processing is performed and the vehicle is being released for use.
       7.17.4.1. For delayed status codes, the date is not entered until the completed AF Form
       1823/-1 is received, at which time the old status code is lined out or over stamped with a
       corrected code.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       197


       7.17.4.2. Each time VM&A or a representative processes an inspection guide form, all
       discrepancies in a delayed or code C-T (temporary fix) status are checked.
   7.17.5. Pumping System Opened Maintenance Notification Section. This section on AF
   Form 1807 and 4427 will be used by maintenance and Fuels Lab personnel to document
   notification of opened fuel dispensing system and subsequent fuel testing. RFM or VM&A
   personnel will notify Fuels Labs or Fuels Servicing Center and complete notification section
   once repairs are complete (Work Order is “Closed”). Fuels Lab personnel will complete the
   “For Lab Use Only” portion before the vehicle/equipment is put back into service.
   7.17.6. Disposition   of   the Operator’s   Inspection  Guide and Trouble
   Report. VCO/VCNCOs will maintain prior month forms IAW Table and Rule T 24 - 03 R
   14.00 in the AF RDS in AFRIMS.

Section 7C—AF Forms 1823/-1, Vehicle and Equipment Work Order

7.18. General Information. The AF Form 1823 is used by Vehicle Management shops that are
not supported by OLVIMS. The AF Form 1823/-1 is a computer-generated form used by
Vehicle Management shops supported by OLVIMS. Instructions and information for completing
this computer-generated form are in AFCSM 24-1. Work order open and close procedures are as
follows: VM&A will print as many copies of the AF Form 1823/-1 as locally required. The
shop uses a legible copy to tell the technician what repairs are needed. One copy may be
retained in VM&A for workload scheduling and monitoring. Close the AF Form 1823/-1 in the
computer when the shop’s copy has been completed.
7.19. Special Recording Procedures. All work performed by Vehicle Management personnel
not recorded on an AF Form 1827 must be entered on an AF Form 1823/-1. Contract
maintenance, accident repair, other government agency repair and final quality assurance
inspections are shown by annotating the AF Form 1823/-1 appropriately.
Notes:
1. The individual performing the final quality check will sign and either enters an "X" in the
block or circles “PASS” or “FAIL” depending on the work order form being used.
2. AF Form 754, Work Order Log and Quality Control Record (NOT LRA),or similar locally
developed product, will be used to track final quality checks and/or to log work order/vehicle
information and should be used in the event OLVIMS cannot be utilized.
   7.19.1. Make two AF Forms 1823/-1 when repairs are performed at the same time by
   Vehicle Management and contract maintenance or when government parts are provided to
   the contractor.
       7.19.1.1. If in-house repair is started and a part is repaired by contract maintenance, open
       and then close the contract maintenance AF Form 1823/-1 (same date and time) to
       prevent duplication of NMC time and to expedite the contract repair work.
       7.19.1.2. The in-house AF Form 1823/-1 must stay open until all repairs (contract and in-
       house) are done.
       7.19.1.3. The contract maintenance AF Form 1823/-1 stays in the work order master file
       until the contract repair work (JZ) transaction is processed.
 198                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   7.19.2. Actual TCTO AF Form 1823/-1 entries are the same as for other types of
   maintenance, except that block 21, “Job Description”, shows the TO data code number. On
   AF Form 1823/-1, enter system code “43CZ” to indicate “user defined.” Enter a work order
   number prefix code "T" in block 2.
Note: Report compliance IAW Chapter 4.
   7.19.3. SB and OTI AF Form 1823/-1 entries are the same as for other types of maintenance,
   except that block 21, “Job Description”, shows the SB number or OTI subject. Enter system
   code 43CZ to indicate “user defined” on the AF Form 1823/-1. Enter a work order number
   prefix code "S" in block 2.
   7.19.4. Accident repair AF Form 1823/-1 contains only the repairs caused by the accident.
   Annotate other repairs on a separate AF Form 1823/-1. Accident repair is identified in the
   upper, right-hand corner of the AF Form 1823/-1. All labor and material charges for accident
   work orders are charged as "M" (maintenance). An AF Form 1823/-1 is made for all
   accident repairs.
   7.19.5. Contract maintenance and other government agency AF Forms 1823/-1 are identified
   as such in the upper, right-hand corner of the AF Form 1823/-1. When the VM&A copy is
   processed, a contract maintenance indicator is displayed to show the contract or other
   government agency status of the Work Order Master File Status Report, PCN SB004-018.
   VM&A checks all completed contract maintenance documents to ensure that appropriate
   maintenance data is entered to OLVIMS. Review PCN SB004-018 prior to monthly
   processing to ensure all required contract costs are entered into OLVIMS.
   7.19.6. Delayed maintenance AF Forms 1823/-1 is identified by putting the appropriate
   maintenance code in block 19. On an AF Form 1823/-1, the delayed code will be put in the
   “ACTION TAKEN” block. When a delayed item appears on the shop’s copy of a completed
   AF Form 1823/-1 (as shown by maintenance code), the VM&A Workload Controller
   immediately makes a new AF Form 1823/-1 for these items only. Closing AF Form 1823/-1
   with delayed jobs, the system will automatically print out a delayed AF Form 1823/-1 for
   those jobs only.
       7.19.6.1. On AF Form 1823/-1 delayed work order, leave the work order number and
       kilometer, miles and hours blocks blank. The work order number from the original AF
       Form 1823/-1 is entered on the top margin of the new AF Form 1823/-1. On the delayed
       AF Form 1823/-1, the delayed work order number is printed in the middle of the AF
       Form 1823/-1. Print all other information as if this was an actual AF Form 1823/-1, with
       the exception that the word “DELAYED” will be printed in the upper, right-hand corner.
       7.19.6.2. The original AF Form 1823/-1 is input in the computer for processing. Update
       delayed maintenance on the AF Form 1824, Motor Vehicle Work Order Status (see
       Section 7D.)
Note: Refer to AFCSM 24-1 for a list of work order number prefix and maintenance delay
codes used for AF Form 1823/-1 entries.
   7.19.7. The AF Form 1823/-1 for accident repairs includes the following costs on separate
   line entries for damaged vehicles.
       7.19.7.1. All direct labor and material costs.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    199


       7.19.7.2. Indirect cost.
           7.19.7.2.1. Shop indirect cost equals direct labor hours expended to repair the vehicle
           times the indirect hourly rate on the Employee Master List, PCN SB004-029 (these
           costs are not to be used for assessing ROS charges).
           7.19.7.2.2. Towing costs equals miles towed times wrecker O&M cost per mile plus
           operator’s hourly rate times the number of hours used or actual cost if contracted.
           7.19.7.2.3. Storage cost, if identified on an off-base invoice.
           7.19.7.2.4. The loss of use cost. This cost is computed by dividing the total service
           life (months) into the acquisition cost. Then multiply the computed use cost per
           month by the number of months out of service. The provisions of this paragraph only
           apply if a replacement vehicle is required to be leased during the repair process.
Note: If any combination of the above was completed by off-base contractors, the invoice will
be used to compute the loss of use cost if a commercial or GSA vehicle is leased to replace the
damaged vehicle in repair. Attach a copy of each invoice used and a copy of the completed AF
Form 20 to the AF Form 1823/-1.
7.20. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1823/-1.
   7.20.1. Block 1, Replacement Code Change. (One-time repair, age or miles). If the repair
   cost exceeds the one-time repair limit and it is decided not to repair the vehicle or equipment
   and it is returned to the user, check the one-time repair block and enter the new replacement
   code. VM&A makes the necessary changes to update the vehicle master list PCN SB004-
   023. The computer will automatically update the code to A, B, C or D, as applicable.
Note: Whenever a vehicle is placed in one of these codes, jobs that were not accomplished will
be delayed using code "G."
   7.20.2. Block 2, Work Order Number. Always five characters. The first character is always
   an alpha character that shows the type of work being done. See AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4,
   for a list of approved prefixes.
   7.20.3. Block 3, Reimbursable Distribution (R/D) Code. A one-position code that shows
   how costs are distributed (reimbursable or refundable) to a tenant organization or transient
   vehicle. VM&A loads the applicable code in OLVIMS for those vehicles assigned to the
   base and makes an entry on the AF Form 1823/-1 for applicable transient vehicles. The
   proper code is obtained from Accounting and Finance. See to paragraph 7.49
   7.20.4. Block 4, Registration Number. Enter the vehicle’s registration number.             The
   registration number is always eight positions.
   7.20.5. Block 5, USAF Management Code. Enter the vehicle’s management code.
   7.20.6. Block 6, Miles/Hours. Enter hours, miles or kilometers as shown on the vehicle’s
   hour meter or odometer. Round the entry to the nearest whole hour, mile or kilometer. For
   vehicles that have both hour meters and odometers installed, determine the proper entry from
   the vehicle master list. For vehicles or equipment managed under utilization code "U”, leave
   this block blank. The incoming inspector validates the odometer or hour meter reading.
200                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


      7.20.6.1. New odometers or hour meters are set to show the accumulated miles, hours or
      kilometers. The cumulative figure may be obtained from the latest quick reference or
      vehicle master listing. If the new odometer or hour meter cannot be preset, then the past
      accumulated miles, hours or kilometers become the "add-on" figure in OLVIMS using
      the "AZ" transaction. Once the "add-on" has been entered into OLVIMS, only the
      present meter reading needs to be entered on the AF Form 1823/-1.
      7.20.6.2. During the period that odometers or hour meters are inoperative, then show
      cumulative miles, hours or kilometers on the quick reference listing, minus any indicated
      "add-on.”
      7.20.6.3. For vehicles with inoperative odometers or hour meters, use the accumulated
      miles, kilometers or hours on the latest maintenance quick reference list for all service
      and maintenance documentation, as the miles, kilometers or hours value is adjusted in the
      OLVIMS by the mileage estimator.
  7.20.7. Block 7, Work Center. Enter the work center code assigned to the maintenance
  activity where the work is done. See AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4.
  7.20.8. Block 8, Work Order Status. Check the initial/incomplete block when the AF Form
  1823/-1 is opened. When the shop’s AF Form 1823/-1 is completed, check the complete
  block.
  7.20.9. Block 9, User Phone Number. Enter the telephone number of the using activity.
  7.20.10. Block 10, Priority. Enter priority for work being performed IAW paragraph 3.32
  7.20.11. Block 11, Manufacturer. Enter the Make of the vehicle or equipment item, such as
  Dodge, Ford, etc.
  7.20.12. Block 12, Model/Type. Enter the model or type of the vehicle or equipment item
  such as F-150 pickup, etc.
  7.20.13. Block 13, Certified By. To indicate completion, the work center supervisor or
  technician signs the AF Form 1823/-1 and certification that entries are complete and factual
  to the best of their knowledge.
  7.20.14. Block 14, Received (Date/Time). Enter the date (MMDDYY) the vehicle was
  turned in to the shop or when the request for Vehicle Management support (mobile, wrecker,
  etc.) was received (example 013111 for 31 January 2011). Enter the clock time the vehicle
  was turned in using a 24-hour clock. The date and time starts when the vehicle or equipment
  item is physically turned in to the Vehicle Management facility or when a request for Vehicle
  Management support (mobile, wrecker, etc.) is received. Date and time must match the date
  and time reported to Vehicle Management on the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble
  Report. Vehicles awaiting accident, abuse and repair decisions/ repairs are not available to
  the user and will draw downtime.
      7.20.14.1. Block 14A, Released (Date/Time). Enter the date and the 24-hour clock time
      the vehicle was released from Vehicle Management or the management support (mobile,
      etc.) was completed and the vehicle returned to the user (reflect period that vehicle is not
      operational).
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      201


   7.20.15. Block 15, Repair Estimates. Use blocks 15A through F for estimating costs of
   accident repairs and repairs that may cause the one-time repair limit to be exceeded. Make
   this estimate before work is started to avoid unauthorized repairs.
       7.20.15.1. If the repair action places the vehicle in replacement codes A, B, C or D for
       maximum one-time repair cost and the decision is made by the VFM/VMS not to repair
       the vehicle, check block 1. The VFM/VMS will provide VM&A with disposition
       instructions.
       7.20.15.2. Indirect costs are entered in block 15D. The indirect hourly rates can be
       obtained from the Employee Master List, PCN SB004-029.
   7.20.16. Block 16, Job Number. This is a preprinted number that shows the work to be done
   in block 21. If more than seven jobs are required to repair a vehicle, continue entries on
   addition (blank) AF Form 1823/-1 can be made using the same work order number and
   changing the job numbers in block 16 to 8 through 14. A new AF Form 1823/-1 work order
   number is required for any vehicle with over 28 jobs.
   7.20.17. Block 17, System Code. The four-digit, alphanumeric code shows the system,
   subsystem and component codes on which work was performed. The OLVIMS ―Help File‖
   lists the approved codes.
   7.20.18. Block 18, Operations. No entry required.
   7.20.19. Block 19, Maintenance Code. Use this code to identify delayed and NMCS
   maintenance conditions. See AFCSM 24-1 for codes and descriptions. VM&A enters these
   codes on the shop's copy of the AF Form 1823/-1.
       7.20.19.1. When a delayed item is shown on the shop's copy of the completed AF Form
       1823/-1, the VM&A Workload Controller makes a new AF Form 1823/-1 (in sufficient
       copies) for the delayed item.
       7.20.19.2. Enter the work order number, date and time from the original AF Form 1823/-
       1 on the top margin of the new AF Form 1823/-1. Input the data from the original AF
       Form 1823/-1 in OLVIMS.
   7.20.20. Block 20, Action Taken. The work center enters or circles the letter-code that best
   shows the actual maintenance action. Refer to AFCSM 24-1 for a list of the 13 action codes.
   7.20.21. Job Description Blocks. Enter a brief description of the job to be performed. For
   TCTO accomplishment, enter the TO and data code number. This entry will be clear and tell
   the technician the exact malfunction and what has to be done.
Example: Replace water pump and repair shift linkage. The shop supervisor ensures the
description identifies the repair or service actually completed. Make a separate entry for each
special test done.
Note: Add separate entries to reflect actual maintenance actions, i.e., remove broken exhaust
manifold stud, free-up rusted brake linkage, etc. Do not take the total repair time against a single
job described as "replaced exhaust gasket" or “replaced brake shoes”.
   7.20.22. Block 22, Estimated Labor Hours. CSC enters the estimated hours to do the job
   described in block 21. Use the estimated hours for workload planning, scheduling
   maintenance and productivity assessments.
 202                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.20.22.1. If the work performed does not agree with the job described on the AF Form
       1823/-1, VM&A enters a revised estimated hour for the job actually performed. For
       example, if the job description called for brake shoe replacement, but an adjustment fixed
       the problem, then an estimated hour rate for the adjustment must be entered on VM&A
       copy of the AF Form 1823/-1 also.
       7.20.22.2. If the work center supervisor enters additional jobs on the AF Form 1823/-1,
       they must also be entered on VM&A copy and the estimated labor hour rate revised.
       Note: For delayed maintenance AF Forms 1823/-1, update the estimated hour rate by
       using AF Form 1824.
   7.20.23. Block 23, Employee ID Number, Labor Hours and Overtime Indicator. Enter in the
   upper portion of the block the employee identification number of the technician who did the
   job. Enter in the lower portion of the appropriate block the actual labor hours used to do the
   job. This entry is in hours and 10ths. Use an overtime or holiday work code when the actual
   labor hours were expended during these periods. (AFCSM 24-1 contains these codes.) If
   actual labor hours are used during both normal duty hours and overtime periods, the
   technician must make separate entries.

Section 7D—AF Form 1824, Motor Vehicle Work Order Status

7.21. General Information. AF Forms 1824 may be used by VM&A to update information on
the Delayed Maintenance Report (PCN SB004-015) via OLVIMS. Vehicles and equipment
items are automatically entered on the delayed maintenance report for delayed maintenance
repairs as a result of the maintenance code in block 19 of the AF Form 1823/-1. The AF Form
1824 is also used to start and stop NMCS hours in OLVIMS, add or change bin locations,
transfer delayed parts costs, and delete or adjust labor hours.
7.22. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1824.
   7.22.1. When the first part is received against a delayed AF Form 1823/-1, Materiel Control
   bins the part and gives VM&A an AF Form 1824 showing the bin location so that the
   delayed maintenance record may be updated. This is accomplished by making the following
   entries:
       7.22.1.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1.
       7.22.1.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
       7.22.1.3. Bin Location. Enter the bin location and place an "X" beside the "Z" under
       Type Transaction. Once the bin location has been established, all subsequent part
       receipts against that delayed AF Form 1823/-1 will also be assigned to that bin. If a new
       bin location is desired for additional parts, a new AF Form 1824 must be submitted
       reflecting the new location. The new bin location will only affect future parts as they are
       received and will not affect parts already on hand. Parts received without a bin location
       established will display a location of “XXX” on the PCN SB004-015; changing the bin
       locations for parts already on hand is accomplished with a "SW" transaction.
   7.22.2. When Materiel Control tells VM&A that a change in the status of parts and material
   has been received for a delayed AF Form 1823/-1, VM&A creates an AF Form 1824 to
   reflect this change by making the following entries:
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     203


     7.22.2.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1.
     7.22.2.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
     7.22.2.3. Parts Status. Enter an "X" in the block beside either the letter "P" or "C" as the
     parts status code. The letter "C" (complete) is entered when all parts and material to
     accomplish delayed repairs on a specific AF Form 1823/-1 have been received. The
     letter "P" (partial) is entered to show only partial receipt of delayed parts or material. The
     letter "P" is programmatically entered by OLVIMS when the first part is received and
     should therefore only be entered when a previously completed delayed action reverts to a
     partial due to cannibalization.
  7.22.3. When all delayed work against a specific maintenance code has been completed,
  VM&A creates an AF Form 1824 to delete that code from the delayed maintenance file by
  making the following entries:
     7.22.3.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1.
     7.22.3.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
     7.22.3.3. Code (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the code to be
     deleted.
     7.22.3.4. Labor Hours (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter a “0”
     (Zero). Note: If the code deleted is the only one for which the vehicle is currently
     delayed, the entire AF Form 1823/-1 will be removed from the file. However,
     individuals cannot zero out all delayed hours on any AF Form 1823/-1 for which parts are
     still being reflected on the Delayed Parts File.
     7.22.3.5. Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the
     last three digits of the work center where the maintenance was delayed.
  7.22.4. When it is necessary to adjust delayed labor hours, VM&A submits an AF Form
  1824 with the following entries:
     7.22.4.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1.
     7.22.4.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
     7.22.4.3. Code (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the code
     needing adjustment.
     7.22.4.4. Labor Hours (block under Current/Original Data section of form).              Enter
     adjusted labor hours (hours and tenths).
     7.22.4.5. Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the
     last three digits of the work center in which the adjustment took place.
  7.22.5. When informed that maintenance delayed for one reason has now changed to another
  or that maintenance delayed in one work center has been transferred to another, VM&A
  initiates an AF Form 1824 to change the maintenance code or work center by making the
  following entries:
     7.22.5.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form 1823/-1.
     7.22.5.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
 204                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.22.5.3. Code (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the original
       code.
       7.22.5.4. Labor Hours (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter “0”
       (Zero).
       7.22.5.5. Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the
       last three digits of the original work center.
       7.22.5.6. Code (block under New Data section of form). Enter the maintenance code
       required to be reflected in the delayed file.
       7.22.5.7. Labor Hours (block under New Data section of form). Enter the adjusted
       backlog hours (hours and tenths).
       7.226.5.8. Work Center (block under New Data section of form). Enter the last three
       digits of the new work center where the work is delayed.
   7.22.6. When told of a NMCS, VM&A initiates an AF Form 1824 to update the AF Form
   1823/-1 record on both the delayed and AF Form 1823/-1 master files, by making the
   following entries:
       7.22.6.1. Placing a vehicle "ON NMCS.”
          7.22.6.1.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form
          1823/-1.
          7.22.6.1.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
          7.22.6.1.3. On VDP Date/Time. Enter the date (YYDDD) and 24-hour clock time
          the vehicle was placed on NMCS from the AF Form 1823/-1. VM&A’s copy of the
          AF Form 1823/-1 will also be annotated with the parts required and NMCS time.
          7.22.6.1.4. Labor Hours (block under VDP Status section of form). Enter the flat
          rate or estimated hours and tenths that will be required to repair the vehicle when the
          parts have been received.
       7.22.6.2. Taking a vehicle "OFF NMCS.”
          7.22.6.2.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form
          1823/-1.
          7.22.6.2.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
          7.22.6.2.3. Off VDP Date/Time. Enter the date (YYDDD) and 24-hour clock time
          that the vehicle was removed from NMCS. The entry must match date/time entered
          on AF Form 1823/-1.

Section 7E—AF Form 1827, Minor Maintenance Work Order

7.23. General Information. The AF Form 1827 is used to record minor maintenance repair
actions for jobs of 2 labor hours or less on vehicles and equipment items (time awaiting parts,
awaiting maintenance and direct labor hours combined must not exceed 2 hours). Document the
vehicle kilometer, miles or hour data to update the specific vehicle master record. The AF Form
1827 is also used to document labor hours: In tire and battery shop stock buildup or repair;
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   205


hazardous/solid waste management, disposal and training; and repair of shop equipment or
spares. Use the AF Form 1827 to collect direct labor hours used for these activities.
Note: The AF Form 1827 will not be used to record multiple jobs on the same vehicle during
the same repair time frame. Each line on the AF Form 1827 is interpreted as a separate work
order in OLVIMS.
7.23. Procedures for Completing an AF Form 1827.
   7.23.1. Minor maintenance documented on an AF Form 1827 is limited to minor
   maintenance repair actions of two labor hours or less on vehicles and equipment items (time
   awaiting parts, awaiting maintenance and direct labor hours combined must not exceed two
   hours) that use only low-cost bench/working stock, work order residue, shop stock and non-
   warranted parts (parts that are not being locally tracked).
   7.23.2. Do not use AF Form 1827 for scheduled services, inspections or transient vehicle
   repair.
   7.23.3. Send AF Form 1827 to VM&A weekly, when the form is filled or as prescribed by
   the VFM/VMS. Use a new AF Form 1827 for each processing cycle, except for the tire and
   battery shop.
Note: Labor hours may be entered on the AF Form 1827 for inspection of vehicles and
equipment prior to deployment or other contingency exercises, applying the same limitations as
in paragraph 7.23.1.
7.24. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1827.
   7.24.1. Block 1, Date. Enter the date on which the vehicle was repaired. For J9998 and
   J9999 entries, this date tells when the labor hours were used.

Section 7H—Labor Hour Reporting, AF Form 1831, Indirect Labor Time Card and AF Form
1831-1, Indirect Labor Time Sheet

7.29. Labor Hour Reporting. The motor vehicle labor hour reporting system is based on
categorizing labor hours into three areas: Direct (0 series), indirect productive (20 series) and
indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series). These hours are categorized to show the efficiency of
the vehicle activity by comparing productive hours with hours used to support that activity, such
as clerical, supervisory, material chasing and so forth. The third category of labor, indirect
nonproductive, shows labor hours that were not used in repairing vehicles. Labor codes and
categories are explained in AFCSM 24-1.
Note: Reporting of indirect nonproductive labor hours is mandatory. The VFM/VMS will
monitor use of 40- and 50-series labor codes to ensure they are properly recorded and entered in
OLVIMS, rather than have these hours default to indirect productive (20 series) labor hours.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   209


Adjust available hours of personnel deployed in support of contingency operations or AEF
rotations to zero.
   7.29.1. Direct labor hours used by maintenance technicians are entered on the AF Form
   1823/-1 or AF Form 1827. Use work codes to show whether hours were used during normal
   duty hours or overtime or holiday periods. Work codes are shown in AFCSM 24-1.
   7.29.2. Indirect productive (20 series) labor hours are computed by OLVIMS, with the
   exception of 20-series labor hours used during periods of overtime or during a holiday.
   Document overtime and holiday indirect productive labor hours on AF Form 1831 or AF
   Form 1831-1.
   7.29.3. Indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series) labor hours are entered on AF Form 1831
   or AF Form 1831-1 by shop personnel.
   7.29.4. Summarize and report work center labor hour utilization data on a monthly basis for
   management. OLVIMS captures productive (0 series) labor hours entered on AF Forms
   1823/-1 and overtime and holiday indirect productive labor hours, as well as indirect
   nonproductive labor hours entered on AF Form 1831 or AF Form 1831-1. These hours are
   then subtracted from the total hours management personnel were assigned to calculate the
   indirect productive labor hours.
   7.29.5. Labor hours are collected for each employee by the employee’s identification
   number from AF Forms 1823/-1 and Indirect Labor Hour Time Cards or Indirect Labor Hour
   Time Sheets. This data is then applied to a name in the Master Personnel File (PCN
   SB004029) and summarized to a particular work center by OLVIMS. There is no attempt to
   reconcile any individual employee’s labor hours. As a consequence, this labor hour reporting
   system is considered ongoing; that is, no closeout of AF Form 1823/-1 labor data is needed
   for labor hour balancing. A sufficient amount of labor hour data within a work center offsets
   month-to-month highs and lows in this data.
   7.29.6. Through this labor hour reporting system, labor hour distribution and utilization data
   are readily available for use by vehicle managers at all levels. AFCSM 24-1 describes labor
   hour reports.
7.30. AF Form 1831/-1. The AF Form 1831, or the OLVIMS-generated AF Form 1831-1 (AF
Form 1831/-1), can be used as a “time sheet” to record an individual’s overtime and holiday
indirect productive or indirect nonproductive labor. It is not necessary that each reportable
employee submit one of these labor cards/sheets each reporting period. In the absence of an
indirect labor card/sheet for any employee, the data system assumes that all the labor for that
employee is divided between direct and indirect productive labor hours. Where no direct labor is
put on AF Forms 1823/-1 for that employee, the system then assumes all assigned hours were
used in the indirect productive (support) category, with no overtime or holiday hours used.
   7.30.1. The same AF Form 1831/-1 for each employee is used for the whole month. At the
   end of the month, a copy is sent to VM&A for input into OLVIMS, unless otherwise directed
   by the VFM/VMS.
   7.30.2. VM&A receives a copy of the AF Forms 1831/1831-1 at the end of the month from
   all work centers for processing. When the labor hour utilization summaries and reports are
   complete, VM&A sends a copy to the appropriate work center.
 210                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       7.30.2.1. VM&A processes the individual time card or sheet into a "GN" transaction as
       outlined in AFCSM 24-1.
   7.30.3. AF Forms 1831 are not preprinted for individual employees. All entries on the cards
   are made manually. Separate cards are used for an individual transferring between work
   centers to show labor hours in each work center.
   7.30.4. AF Form 1831-1 is preprinted with individual employees’ names and man numbers.
   All other entries on these forms are made manually. Separate sheets are used for an
   individual transferring between work centers to show labor hours in each work center.

          labor codes can only be entered when labor was used for overtime or on holidays.
          7.31.1.8.3. Block 8C, Work Code. Enter a work code only when showing use of
          indirect productive (20 series) labor hours during overtime and holiday periods.
          Leave blank when documenting the use of indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series)
          labor codes.
          7.31.1.8.4. Block 8D, Hours. Enter the labor hours and 10ths reported against the
          labor code shown in block 8B. Whole hours are entered in the first part of the block
          and 10ths entered in the last part (separated by a broken line).
   7.31.2. AF Form 1831-1 Entries.
       7.31.2.1. The AF Form 1831-1 is preprinted with the work center and employee’s name
       on it. To complete the form, fill in the indirect labor hours to the right of the respective
       day of the month and under the labor series for each employee (overtime 20 series, 40

       series and return the form to VM&A.

Section 7I—AF Form 1832, Record of Cannibalization

7.32. General Information. With the work center supervisor’s assistance, Materiel Control
initiates an AF Form 1832 when cannibalization action is recommended. Materiel Control
completes the "Action by Materiel Control" section and forwards the document to VM&A. If
cannibalization is not needed, no further action is necessary and the AF Form 1832 may be
destroyed. If cannibalization is needed, workload control makes entries in their part of the form,
and sends it to the VFM/VMS. The completed AF Form 1832 provides the information needed
for Vehicle Management to decide whether approval to cannibalize is justified.
7.33. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1832.
   7.33.1. AF Form 1832 is attached to the AF Form 1823/-1 on file in Materiel Control. Note:
   If the parts are not going to be replaced on the cannibalized vehicle, a copy of the AF Form
   1832 is filed in the cannibalized vehicle’s record jacket.
   7.33.2. Total labor costs of the cannibalization (that is, removing the part from the
   cannibalized vehicle and installing it on the vehicle to be returned to service) are charged to
   the vehicle on which the part is installed. The labor and material costs of installing
   replacement items on the cannibalized vehicle are charged to the cannibalized vehicle.
Exception: If costs for repairs to the cannibalized vehicle are reimbursable, they are not charged
to it; all costs are charged to the vehicle receiving the cannibalized parts.
   7.33.3. Materiel Control ensures that replacement parts are ordered for the cannibalized
   vehicle according to Chapter 5, except as previously stated above.
   7.33.4. The following is entered on an AF Form 1832:

Section 7O—Vehicle Management Activity/Document Codes

7.42. General Information. Codes are used for labor hour accounting, for collecting
maintenance data and for preparing cost reports, which give management information to the base
and MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff. See AFCSM 24-1 for most codes and descriptions.
7.43. Work Center Codes. The first four digits of these work center codes are mandatory and
will not be changed. However, the fifth digit may be shredded out to identify specific functions
within the activity (see codes 17221 through 17239 below).
7.44. Work Codes. Work codes (see AFCSM 24-1) are used for those bases using OLVIMS to
support labor-hour reporting requirements.
7.45. Work Order Number Prefix Code. Work order prefix codes are used to show the type
of work the AF Form 1823/-1 was primarily opened for (see AFCSM 24-1).
7.46. Management Codes. Management codes for registered vehicles and equipment items are
found in the VMIF. Management codes for non-registered vehicles and equipment items are
found in the OLVIMS “Help File”. Management codes which are not pre-loaded in OLVIMS
will be rejected, in which case use the proper “alpha character” and “999” temporarily.
7.47. Orphan Management Codes. The term “orphan management code” is used to describe
management codes that are not supported by OLVIMS. This is due to the hard-coded
management code table in OLVIMS that does not support new assets introduced into the fleet.
   7.47.1. To overcome this problem, an “Updates to OLVIMS Mgt Code Listing” is available
   on the VM CoP. The listing identifies management codes that are not supported by OLVIMS
   and links them to a management code existing in OLVIMS. Once loaded in OLVIMS, and
   the data is passed to LIMS-EV Vehicle View, business rules will cross-reference the asset
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   219


   NSNs with the VMIF and LIMS-EV Vehicle View will display the appropriate management
   code.
   7.47.2. It is imperative that the appropriate asset NSN is loaded in OLVIMS along with all
   other vehicle static data.
7.48. Delayed Maintenance Codes. Delayed maintenance codes are used on AF Form 1823/-1
and the PCN SB004-015 to show the reason a repair action has been delayed. Find these codes
in AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4, or in the OLVIMS “Help File”.
7.49. R&D Codes. R&D codes denote the organization for which charges are refundable or
reimbursable (see AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4). At the beginning of each FY, and when a
change is required, VM&A furnishes a list of tenant organizations supported to Accounting and
Finance (through the Budget Office) for certification. Accounting and Finance identifies which
organizations are reimbursable (Code 3) or refundable (Code 4) (refer to AFI 65-601V1, Budget
Guidance And Procedures, Chapter 7, and AFI 65-601V2, Budget Management For Operations,
Attachment 10. Accounting and Finance returns this certified list to VM&A to be used to enter
the correct codes into OLVIMS.
   7.49.1. All reimbursable and refundable cost data must be reconciled monthly with
   Accounting and Finance. This data must be verified for accuracy, to include validating that
   all reimbursable and refundable units are loaded properly in OLVIMS.
   7.49.2. Vehicle and equipment work orders for vehicles assigned to reimbursable and
   refundable units will be retained for at least one-year after the closeout date if needed for
   reference, inquiries or audits.
   7.49.3. RC/CC codes will be validated at least annually.
7.50. System Codes. Vehicle system codes define the specific repair on a vehicle. They are
used for historical purposes and failure data capture toward improvements in reliability,
maintainability and deploy ability. Find these codes in the OLVIMS “Help File”.
7.51. System and Subsystem Descriptions. Subsystem codes are used to more closely define
the actual work performed during the repair, inspection and service cycle. These subsystem
codes are required entries in block 20 of the Vehicle Historical Record (OLVIMS PCN SB004-
698). When conscientiously applied, they help detect and control repeat maintenance. Sub
codes not assigned a specific description may be developed locally, when required. Find the
codes and their descriptions in the OLVIMS “Help File”.
7.52. High-Cost Bench/Working Stock. High-cost bench/working stock items cost $60 or
more per item unit of use (refer to Chapter 5). Record high-cost bench/working stock
consumption on the AF Form 1823/-1 when installed on the vehicle or equipment using a “QZ”
transaction.
7.53. Low-Cost Bench/Working Stock. Low-cost bench/working stock is those items used
from an authorized bench stock that cost less than $60 per unit of use (refer to Chapter 5). Low-
cost bench/working stock is charged as an overhead indirect expense at the time of
bench/working stock replenishment, using SBSS, COPARS or commercial issue document. In
all cases, Materiel Control annotates the issue documents with work order number L9999 and
sends completed documents to VM&A for processing.
Note: Except for L9999 purchases, items drawn directly from COPARS, base supply or
 220                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


commercial source are charged on the AF Form 1823/-1 authorizing the repair, regardless of the
item cost.

   Vacancies/Overages Panel located in the SBSS tab that is updated daily each time CRIS Tool
   is updated.
   8.23.2. VEMSO maintains the dashboard and all associated tables.
   8.23.3. War plans additive requirements. Incoming MAJCOM VAL data must pass edits
   within AFEMS in order to populate the above database tables. VEMSO emphasis will be
   placed on correcting rejected MAJCOM VAL records since they inhibit base-level reporting.
   8.23.4. VEMSO will research rejects and variances and work with MAJCOMs and/or bases
   to correct.
       8.23.4.1. There are two types of edits; Rejects and Variances. A rejected MAJCOM data
       record is not processed and results in SBSS data rejecting in AFEMS because the
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                231

   by VEMSO.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    233


   8.25.2. Vehicles will not be loaded into SBSS as a suitable (“S”) substitute unless the asset
   NSN cross-references to the prime NSN. When an asset NSN does not cross to a prime
   NSN, but has similar capabilities, load it as an unsuitable (“U”) substitute.
   8.25.3. Vehicles will be loaded with the AF registration number issued by the VEMSO. The
   third character will be an “N.” For the GSA leases, vehicle will be marked in the same
   manner as OSI vehicles or in a manner to ensure no cost is incurred when GSA turn in action
   is accomplished. Do not change the GSA license plate to the AF assigned registration
   number.
   8.25.4. To ensure audit trail and accountability of lease vehicle turn-ins accomplish the
   applicable following transaction.
       8.25.4.1. For lease turn-in of a “like asset” (such as a B102 for a B102) turn the vehicle
       into Base Supply using Status Code “Q” and reissue the replacement with the new
       registration number.
       8.25.4.2. Turn-in of a lease vehicle or “unlike asset” (such as a B102 for a B222). Turn
       the vehicle into DLA-DS. Annotate on 1348-1 returned to GSA.
       8.25.4.3. Loading a new lease vehicle. Use a REC and ISSUE to load a new lease. Will
       produce a 1348-1.
8.26. Vacant Vehicle Authorizations.
   8.26.1. 3080 funded authorizations. Vacant authorizations can be monitored via VDQD. If
   an authorization is vacant for more than two programming cycles and no asset is
   programmed for purchase to fill the authorization it is automatically considered invalid and
   deleted, unless an Exception to Policy has been granted by AF/A4LE.
8.27. Vehicle Shipments. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs normally direct vehicle
shipments. Local Traffic Management Flight will assist with guidance on funding the
transportation costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-203. When a vehicle is
shipped, the computer-generated Vehicle Historical Record, Vehicle Master Transfer Report,
floppy disk (or another type of authorized media storage device) and pertinent technical data will
be sent to the gaining installation. Process “TIN” or “1ET” as directed by team lead when
shipping vehicles from base to base. In either case, the Fleet Manager must sign in block one.
Send vehicle record jacket and either the “A5J” or “SHP” document to TMF. The gaining VM
initiates follow-up action on vehicles not received within the specified time frame.
8.28. SBSS Accountable Record Inventory Discrepancy Management.
   8.28.1. Duplicate Registration number. VEMSO will monitor and identify duplicate
   registration numbers and initiate corrective action with affected bases and inform MAJCOMs
   via email. VEMSO will collect: pictures of each vehicle, a picture of VIN, data plate and
   serial number. Bases provide make, model and any other requested information to VEMSO.
   VEMSO will work with the appropriate IM to identify correct vehicle and issue new
   registration number as needed. VEMSO will notify affected bases with information from
   IM. Base will request registration number change via CRIS Tool.
   8.28.2. False duplicate vehicle registration number in SBSS. Correct by processing an
   inventory adjustment document (IAD; 1GP/SRC). Use of IAD processing will cause M10
   reporting and full explanation on the cause of action and copy of transaction must be

   provided to the responsible LRS office. Also, annotate that a reverse post will not work for
   SBSS details per AFMAN 23-110 Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 7 “I235 MGT Vehicle Issues
   Not Authorized Reverse-Post”.
   8.28.3. Serviceable balance quantity showing in stock (Supply - item record). Research
   transaction which caused serviceable balance and identify end state of vehicle. If duplicate
   “REC” processing is the cause, process “reverse-post” on “REC”. For any other transaction,
   process subsequent transaction applicable to end state of vehicle; “TRM” for DLA-DS,
   “SHP” for base to base transfer, etc. However, if reason for serviceable balance cannot be
   determined, follow Report of Survey procedures.
   8.28.4. NSN discrepancy between Authorized in use Detail (201) and REM-Vehicles only
   Detail (214). Process an IAD to correct this discrepancy. If the IAD processing does not
   resolve the discrepancy submit “FIX” action request. Use of IAD processing will cause M10
   reporting and full explanation on the cause of action and copy of transaction must be
   provided to the responsible LRS office. Also, annotate that a reverse post will not work for
   SBSS vehicle details per AFMAN 23-110 Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 7 “I235 MGT Vehicle
   Issues Not Authorized Reverse-Post”.
8.29. Vehicle Status Codes. Monitor vehicles in status codes “D”, “E”, “I” and “N”. Vehicles

   effective and efficient performance assessment to ensure acceptable service is received. The
   performance plan includes:
       9.4.1.1. Objective(s) in having the service provided, i.e., to provide quality vehicle
       maintenance for AF vehicles, while complying with all environmental, air pollution and
       mandated requirements.

   performance objectives. The multi-functional team ensures that the performance metrics are
   aligning with the performance-based work statement and overall mission support objectives.
9.5. Performance Assessment Methods. The suggested source of performance assessment is
the contractor’s Management Information System. The purpose of having an information system
is to validate the contractor is performing in accordance to the terms and conditions of the
contract. The data system is used to validate contractor response times, schedules, etc.
   9.5.1. Random Inspection/Sampling. Random visits to assess performance provide the
   QAP with a valuable management tool. Random samplings provide good overall
   performance indicators. Each job is evaluated against the PWS or performance standard to
   ensure the contractor is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract. The
   critical element in a random sampling evaluation is the samplings taken are truly random and
   they depict the true average performance.

       9.7.1.1. Developing and sustaining a sound Quality Assurance Evaluation Program.
       9.7.1.2. Implementing the PP and establishing a comprehensive training program.
       9.7.1.3. Overseeing development of the PWS, PP, market research, government cost
       estimates, funding and evaluation assessment guides.
          9.7.1.3.1. The requirements in the PP and assessment guides are "outcome-based" in
          that they only reflect the desired end results--not the process. Each outcome-based
          requirement includes clear, unambiguous and measurable performance thresholds so
          there is no question whether our mission requirement was met. Performance
          assessment methods are consistent with the standards focusing on end results, not the
          processes.
   9.7.2. The Contracting Officer is empowered to award and/or administer contracts. The
   Contracting Officer acts as an agent between the AF and the contractor. The Base
   Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to enter into contracts and is responsible for
   reviewing the contractor’s performance to ensure that it is satisfactory and the AF receives
   the products and/or services requested.
   9.7.3. QAPs may be involved in the modification process in the following areas: Identifying
   the required change(s), preparing documentation on the proposed change(s), preparing
   government cost estimate(s), advising the Contracting Officer on technical aspects of the
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                         243


  change(s), participating in reviews of contractor technical proposals, supporting the

                              VCO/VCNCO INFORMATION

Section 10A—Introduction

10.1. Vehicle Control Program. DOD policy requires that government motor vehicle
resources are organized and managed to ensure optimum responsiveness, efficiency and
economy in support of the DOD mission. To ensure day-to-day management of those motor
vehicles permanently assigned to units and agencies, the AF has adopted the Vehicle Control
Program or VCP. As established in this AFI, each organizational commander with registered
and/or leased vehicles assigned (to include OGMVCs and trailers not classified as a vehicle) to
their organization will appoint a VCO and/or VCNCO (to include alternates as needed), in
writing, and forward that appointment to the base vehicle management activity. The VFM/VMS
will ensure VCO/ VCNCO training is accomplished.
Note: Refer to paragraph 4.53 for additional information concerning the VCP.
10.2. Vehicle Management Policy. Public law directs the DOD and AF to maintain the
minimum number of fuel-efficient motor vehicles to accomplish the mission and limits their use
to official purposes. All management echelons must put emphasis on controlling and conserving
vehicle assets. The vehicle user is responsible for operation, conservation and condition of
vehicles used. This responsibility is enforced through the operator’s supervisor, commander, and
commander appointed VCO/VCNCO.
10.3. Host Logistics Readiness Services. The host logistics readiness activity provides
maintenance support, fleet management, and transportation services not within the using
agencies capability.
   10.3.1. LRS services will be covered during locally developed VCO/VCNCO orientation
   briefings.
   10.3.2. Vehicle Management normally provides the following services:
       10.3.2.1. Provides assistance to VCO/VCNCO with vehicle justifications, leasing
       procedures, vehicle analysis, DOD Fleet Fuel Cards, briefing/training VCO/VCNCO,
       conducting vehicle assessment inspections/providing results and staff assistance visits.
       10.3.2.2. Scheduled maintenance, to include PM&I and Special Inspections. These
       inspections are maintenance actions normally scheduled in advance, based on a vehicle’s
       actual or projected mileage, hours of operation, or by calendar time. VM&A will
       coordinate scheduled maintenance with unit VCOs.
       10.3.2.3. Unscheduled Maintenance. VCOs will ensure that any motor vehicle
       malfunction is reported to the vehicle management customer service section (or
       equivalent element) in a timely manner.
       10.3.2.4. Minor Maintenance Road Side Assistance. During normal duty hours, roadside
       service for most disabled vehicles can be provided. This service can also be available
       after normal duty hours for urgent or emergency situations. Follow the installation
       prescribed procedures for requesting this assistance.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     245


10.4. Vehicle Control Duties. Locally developed VCO/VCNCO orientation briefings will
cover all aspects of VCO/VCNCO duties. As a minimum unit VCO/VCNCO’s are responsible
for:
   10.4.1. Acting as a liaison between their unit and the host logistics readiness squadron for all
   unit government motor vehicle matters.
   10.4.2. Controlling unit vehicles and obtaining transportation services required to support
   unit mission requirements.
       10.4.2.1. VCO/VCNCOs are required to receipt for permanently assigned unit vehicles
       from the base VFM/VMS or VM&A using the LIMS-EV Vehicle View or CRIS Tool
       Master Listing hand Receipt. VCO/VCNCOs then assign the vehicles to their respective
       authorized functions.
   10.4.3. Defending vehicle requirements, justifying requests for additional vehicle
   authorizations; complying with the base vehicle rotation and priority recall plans; and
   notifying the VFM/VMS when assigned vehicles are no longer required.
       10.4.3.1. New vehicle authorization requests and requirements must comply with the AF
       Vehicle Fleet Growth Policy IAW paragraph 4.73
       10.4.3.2. VCOs provide vehicle management with mission impact statements to
       substantiate annual base vehicle buy submissions when requested by vehicle
       management.
       10.4.3.3. Continued retention of vehicle authorizations is predicated on the continuing
       need and asset utilization.
   10.4.4. Properly routing purchase requests for OGMVCs and trailers not classified as a
   vehicle. Purchase request must be reviewed by the VFM/VMS to ensure the desired asset is
   an OGMVC or equipment item and not a vehicle. Purchase requests for other non-registered
   equipment (i.e., ATVs, mowers, etc.) will also be coordinated with the VFM/VMS. Refer to
   paragraph 3.17 for additional details.
Note: Organizations will first work to establish or purchase a maintenance agreement or
contract to support the maintenance requirements of the OGMVC and/or non-registered
equipment prior to purchase.
       10.4.4.1. LSVs will not be purchased by using organizations. Refer to paragraph 4.78
       for further clarification.
   10.4.5. Providing justification data to support unit MEL. An MEL indicates the number of
   vehicles, by type, that can be in the vehicle maintenance shop at one time and not seriously
   affect the user’s mission.
   10.4.6. All authorization requests for organizational add-on equipment will be submitted, in
   writing, to the VM&A. Requests must address the extent of the proposed work, impact if
   denied and availability of funds for contracting the equipment installation. The vehicle will
   be placed into original configuration at unit cost if vehicle is rotated/shipped. All requests
   will be reviewed by the VFM/VMS for final approval.
   10.4.7. Ensuring supplies, tools, and equipment for unit vehicles, such as highway warning
   kits, first aid kits (when required by local authorities), tire chains, polish, wax, chamois,

Vehicular Support Equipment (VSE). VSE includes items of a particular nature used in support
of the maintenance or launch of weapon systems and support/training aerospace vehicle. It does
not include OGMVCs or trailers not classified as a vehicle.
   10.4.10. Take appropriate measures to prevent misuse, abuse and damage to AF motor
   vehicles. Motor vehicle accident and abuse prevention programs at all levels will include:
       10.4.10.1. Conducting and documenting monthly vehicle safety orientation and
       education briefings.
       10.4.10.2. Conducting and documenting monthly inspections to ensure assigned vehicles
       are serviceable and clean. VCO/VCNCOs will use the appropriate “Operator’s
       Inspection Guide and Trouble Report” and AF Form 4431 as guides when performing
       these inspections. VCO/VCNCOs will establish a schedule to ensure all assigned
       vehicles are inspected at least twice a year.
       10.4.10.3. Ensuring unit provides flight line training and testing to assigned personnel
       when required.
       10.4.10.4. Ensuring unit vehicles are washed IAW intervals prescribed in TO 36-1-191,
       Table 6-3, and waxed when required IAW paragraph 3.19 and local directives.
          10.4.10.4.1. Operators will not steam clean or high-pressure wash engines or engine
          compartments.
          10.4.10.4.2. Vehicle operators/using organizations will wax vehicles often enough
          with a manual application type wax to preserve the painted finish (prevent oxidation),
          but do not wax vehicles with flat or Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC)
          finishes.
          10.4.10.4.3. Vehicle operators/organizations operating a "vehicle wash rack" or
          automated car-wash facility will review manufacture or industry standard
          requirements when acquiring and using commercial-off-the-shelve vehicle-cleaning
          products for use on modern paint finishes, e.g., “base-coat, clear-coat”. Additionally,
          operators/organizations will procure EPA Environmentally Preferable (Green) vehicle
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   247


           cleaning products that are biodegradable when available and economically
           advantages.

Note: Whenever the vehicle is in operation, SF 91 and DD Form 518 will be with the vehicle.
           10.4.10.5.1. The using organization commander designates an official to investigate
           each accident and provides results to Host base safety office.
           10.4.10.5.2. The Chief of Safety investigates and analyzes to determine the causes or
           possible corrective actions; accident trends involving government owned or rented
           motor vehicles are analyzed or investigated by the Chief of Safety.
           10.4.10.5.3. An operator surrenders the AF Form 2293 with the SF 91 to the
           VCO/VCNCO after the accident. Unit commanders may reinstate the license at their
           discretion.
           10.4.10.5.4. Accident reporting for commercial rental/lease and GSA vehicles is the
           same as reporting an accident involving a government owned vehicle.
           10.4.10.5.5. When payment for damage (either voluntary or on a DD Form 200,
           Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss) is involved, the unit
           VCO/VCNCO requests an AF Form 20 from VM&A for the actual repair cost.
   10.4.11. Review assigned “like” vehicle type mileages and rotate low-usage or low mileage
   vehicles with high-usage or high mileage vehicles within the organization when possible.
   10.4.12. Ensure all unit vehicle-leasing actions are coordinated through Vehicle
   Management. Associate units are required to have vehicle rental/lease requests coordinated
   through the host logistics readiness squadron’s Vehicle Management.                  Vehicle
   renting/leasing may possibly affect vehicle buy submissions, vehicle rotations, MEL, etc.
   10.4.13. Manage fuel VIL keys IAW DLA Energy policy, to include periodic VIL key
   inventories and control measures. DLA Energy policy can be found at the DLA Energy
   Defense Knowledge Online website or by contacting the Fuels Management Flight.
   10.4.14. Ensure all vehicle operators are brief on the installation vehicle idling policy when
   first assigned or when there are approved policy changes.
10.5. Permissible Operating Distance (POD). Since it is usually more economical to use
services of commercial carriers for the transportation of personnel and cargo to destinations
outside the immediate areas of the installation, each base has an established POD for assigned
motor vehicles. POD applies to all government-owned and rental/leased vehicles. Be aware of
approved POD and seek approval from Vehicle Operations before traveling outside the POD.

Section 11B—AFV

11.3. AFV Acquisition. EPAct specifically applies to general purpose “Light Duty Vehicles”
(less than or equal to 8,500 pounds GVW) based in an MSA (cities, counties, or consolidated
areas with a 1980 population of more than 250,000). AFV requirements for each MSA
installation in a given FY are calculated by multiplying the number of LDVs procured (new
acquisitions and long-term rentals/leases) times the EPAct percentage required for that FY.
Seventy-five percent of all MSA-based LDVs acquired each year must be AFVs.
Note: The Energy Conservation and Reauthorization Act of 1998 amended EPAct 1992 to allow
one AFV acquisition credit for every 450 gallons of pure biodiesel (B100) and one credit for
every 2,250 gallons of blended biodiesel that consists of 20 percent biodiesel (B20) fuel
consumed in vehicles over 8,500 pounds GVW rating. “Biodiesel credits” may fulfill up to 50
percent of our agency’s vehicle acquisition EPAct requirements.
   11.3.1. Description of different types of AFVs and Electric Vehicles (EV). The AF's AFVs,
   whether purchased or rented/leased, are bi-fuel, flex-fuel or a dedicated alternative fueled
   vehicle, e.g., CNG, propane, E85, etc. EVs can either be dedicated or hybrid technology.
       11.3.1.1. Bi-fuel AFVs have two mutually exclusive fuel systems and are designed to
       operate on either gasoline or an alternative fuel such as CNG or Liquefied Petroleum
       Gas, also known as propane, using one fuel at a time.
 252                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


       11.3.1.2. Flex-fuel AFVs are capable of using gasoline and an alternative fuel such as
       E85 (85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline), or a mixture of gasoline and alternative
       fuel through the same tank/system.
       11.3.1.3. Dedicated AFVs are vehicles that operate solely on an alternative fuel.
       11.3.1.4. EVs operate solely from power stored in a system of batteries.
       11.3.1.5. HEVs combine the benefits of gasoline or diesel engines and electric motors.
       HEVs can be configured to obtain different objectives, such as improved fuel economy,
       increased power or additional auxiliary power for electronic devices and power tools.
       PHEVs can be recharged via the electrical grid while the vehicle is not running.
   11.3.2. When purchasing new vehicles, all units must first consider AFVs, LSVs, Hybrid
   Electric Vehicles (HEV) and low Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emitting vehicles (refer to
   paragraph 11.3.7 for additional low GHG emitting vehicle procurement information).
   Before requesting new AFVs, all units must first consider the ability to meet mission
   requirements, availability of alternative fuel infrastructure (either on base or in the local
   area), the incremental cost of HEVs, PHEVs and whether a low GHG emitting vehicle is
   available to meet the requirement.
   11.3.3. If AFVs or the infrastructure to support them are not available, the vehicles listed
   below must be considered for purchase (in the following order) after AFVs:
1) HEV or PHEV.
2) LSV.
3) Conventional vehicles (diesel engine propelled is preferable over gasoline if biodiesel (B20)
is available locally). When purchasing diesel vehicles, B20 capable vehicles must be purchased
when available.
Note: When acquiring diesel engine propelled vehicles that will utilize B20, be sure the Special
Equipment Options, or “SEO”, for engines capable of using B20 is noted.
   11.3.4. MAJCOM and installation Vehicle Management Staffs are responsible for requesting
   and prioritizing, through the vehicle buy program, the appropriate number of new OEM AFV
   purchases to meet acquisition goals in AFI 90-1701.
       11.3.4.1. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs will acquire law enforcement and
       emergency-use AFVs, if such vehicles are capable of meeting mission requirements.
   11.3.5. When renting/leasing vehicles, MAJCOM and installation Vehicle Management
   Staffs are also responsible for ensuring that long-term rental/lease requests (see Chapter 4)
   meet EPAct and EO 13423 requirements for each requesting base. All AFV rental/lease
   incremental cost will be surcharged across the entire fleet IAW EPAct 2005, Title VII,
   Subtitle A, Sec. 702. Note: For information on GSA AFV rental/leases contact GSA Fleet
   Services at: gsafleet@gsa.gov.
   11.3.6. Once procured, AFVs count as credits toward EPAct requirements. MAJCOM
   Vehicle Management Staffs are encouraged to assign AFVs where infrastructure is available
   or the AFVs can be used to leverage potential infrastructure.
   11.3.7. AFV acquisitions in MSAs and for vehicle acquisitions in Non-MSAs. Ensure the
   vehicle with highest GHG score is obtained that meets mission requirements. Refer to the
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      253


   following EPA website for specific vehicle GHG/Air Pollution Score and complete GHG
   Guide: http://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/Index.do
Note: AFI 90-1701 states all new vehicle purchases shall be low greenhouse gas emitting light
duty and medium duty passenger vehicles. If no such vehicle is available to meet the functional
need, the acquiring organization must obtain a waiver from AF/A4/7.
11.4. Exemptions. EPAct 1992 Section 303(b) (3) exempts most law enforcement vehicles,
emergency vehicles and vehicles used for military purposes (exempt for national security
reasons) from AFV acquisition requirements. VEMSO will serve as the clearinghouse for
exemption requests, exemption data collection and exemption reporting.
   11.4.1. A law enforcement vehicle may be:
       11.4.1.1. Any vehicle which is (1) specifically approved in an agency’s appropriation act
       for use in apprehension, pursuit, patrol or protection, or is routinely used for other law
       enforcement activities such as surveillance, or (2) covered by the current version of Item
       17 or Item 17A, Federal Standard Number 122, published by GSA.
       11.4.1.2. A rental/leased vehicle equipped with at least the following components (1) for
       passenger automobiles, heavy-duty electrical, cooling and suspension systems and at least
       the next more powerful engine than is standard for the automobile concerned, or (2) for
       light trucks, emergency warning lights or identification or markings such as “police”.
       11.4.1.3. An unmarked vehicle which is certified by the SECAF as essential for the safe
       and efficient performance of intelligence, counterintelligence, protective or other law
       enforcement duties.
   11.4.2. An emergency vehicle is any vehicle that is legally authorized by a government
   authority to exceed the speed limit to transport people and/or equipment to and from a
   situation in which speed is required to save lives or property, such as a rescue vehicle, fire
   truck or ambulance.
   11.4.3. Vehicles used for military purposes (exempt for national security reasons):
       11.4.3.1. Vehicles defined as “tactical vehicles” are automatically exempt from EPAct
       AFV requirements and a national security exemption need not be claimed for them.
       LDVs similar to those driven by the general public are also automatically exempt as
       tactical vehicles if the vehicles have been modified (such as the addition of a 24-volt
       electrical system) to meet military specifications, unless the vehicle is normally used as
       an administrative vehicle.
       11.4.3.2. Administrative vehicles that may have to be deployed as part of a military
       operation will not automatically receive a national security exemption. Many vehicles
       can operate on alternative fuel when performing their administrative missions at home
       station and operate on a petroleum-based fuel when deployed as part of a military
       operation. A national security exemption must be claimed for such a vehicle only when
       there is substantial possibility that the vehicle will be deployed, and the vehicle could not
       be deployed if it was an AFV or the AFV attributes of the vehicle would negatively affect
       performance of its mission when deployed.

Section 11C—Infrastructure
 254                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


11.5. Funding. Funding for development of on-base alternative fuel infrastructure is limited.
EPAct 2005 mandates that agencies arrange for fueling of AFVs at commercial, federally and/ or
publicly accessible facilities to the maximum extent practical. If such a station exists or is
planned, AFVs are required to use a station if it is located within 5 miles or 15 minutes from the
vehicle’s garaged location on the installation IAW DOD 4500.36-R. Locating alternative fuels
for any location can be done using the DOE Alternative Fuel Site Locator:
http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/fuels/stations.html or to access from a smart phone or PDA
use http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/locator/m/stations/.
   11.5.1. If a commercial station proves impractical in terms of fuel costs, vehicle wear and
   manpower, a very advantageous means of acquiring fueling capability is through:
       11.5.1.1. DLA funded infrastructure.
           11.5.1.1.1. DLA Energy is responsible to fund for new fuels infrastructure holding
           fuel capitalized by the Defense Working Capital Fund IAW DODD 4140.25, DoD
           Management Policy for Energy Commodities and Related Services, 12 April 2004.
           11.5.1.1.2. Vehicle Management will identify fuel requirements to Fuels
           Management by grade, expected annual consumption and total vehicle fuel tank
           capacity.
           11.5.1.1.3. Fuels Management will analyze the base infrastructure and submit an AF
           Form 332 to CES establishing the requirement for additional infrastructure based on
           the requirement for the total storage required by grade and type of fuel IAW Unified
           Facilities Criteria (UFC).
           11.5.1.1.4. CES will assess parking, traffic, tankage and dispensing equipment
           identified by Fuels Management IAW UFC 3-460-01, Design: Petroleum Fuel
           Facilities, and CES guidance. The CES will prepare cost estimates and programming
           documentation for submission through the MAJCOM Fuel Office to the Air Force
           Petroleum Agency (AFPA) and the DLA Energy office IAW DLA Energy
           programming guidance.
   11.5.2. Contractor-owned/maintained equipment agreement. Negotiating agreements with
   commercial fuel providers for alternative fuel stations can be complicated. Installations are
   encouraged to obtain access to commercial alternative fuel infrastructure through their own
   efforts if possible, but are advised to seek expert help from MAJCOM, WR-ALC and
   AFCESA. Pitfalls that may be avoided through seeking expert help include disadvantageous
   agreements that require DOD to pay exorbitant fuel prices for long periods or agreements
   that provide for exorbitant penalties in the event that DOD installations fail to reach specified
   alternative fuel usage levels.

Section 11D—Alternative Fuel

11.6. Alternative Fuel Usage. Section 701 of the EPAct 2005 requires Federal agencies to use
only alternative fuel in all of its dual fueled vehicles—such as ethanol flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs)
or bi-fuel gasoline/gaseous fuel vehicles—except where the vehicles have received a waiver
from the U.S. Department of Energy. The Section 701 requirement applies to all AFVs in the
U.S. and Puerto Rico in Federal fleets covered by EPAct 1992. Waivers will be submitted by
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                         255


June 30th each year to the Department of Energy via the Federal Automotive Statistical Tool
web based program.
   11.6.1. If alternative fuel is available for an AF owned or rented/leased AFV (can be
   obtained within a 15-minute drive or within five miles one way from the vehicle’s garaged
   location) from a commercial off base alternative fuel station or another agency, then
   alternative fuel will be used 100 percent of the time.
   11.6.2. If an installation has a nearby public or private alternative fuel station but no formal
   agreement has been established for its use, the installation will establish an economically
   advantageous use agreement, as described in paragraph 11.5.2
   11.6.3. If an AFV is frequently driven off base for substantial distances, it must be refueled
   at alternative fuel stations to the greatest extent practical. Such vehicles must always be
   equipped with a regional map or directory of appropriate alternative fuel stations.
   11.6.4. If the only available alternative fuel is on the commercial market, a DOD Fleet Fuel
   Card will be used to refuel AF owned vehicles. If this scenario becomes necessary, establish
   procedures to ensure the fuel is uploaded into OLVIMS as an off-base fuels transaction. If
   the appropriate alternative fuel is available on base, the VIL key shall be coded so only the
   alternative fuel can be utilized.
       11.6.4.1. Some vehicles, for example bi-fuel Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), require a
       minimum amount of gasoline to be used periodically. In this case, VIL keys for those
       types of vehicles may be encoded with all fuel types utilized by that particular vehicle,
       provided fuel requirement documentation is maintained in the vehicle’s Vehicle
       Historical File.
   11.6.5. VFM/VMS will clearly and conspicuously identify all flexible fuel vehicles to
   vehicle operators.
       11.6.5.1. This must be accomplished using a sticker affixed near the fuel gauge or fuel
       tank filler neck combined with a yellow fuel cap or other noticeable methods of
       indicating that the vehicle should be fueled with the appropriate alternative fuel whenever
       practical.
   11.6.6. Vehicles that have not submitted for waiver under the EPAct 2005, Section 701 shall
   also have a map in the vehicle that indicates the location of all available alternative fueling
   infrastructure within five miles or 15 minutes of their normal operating location. There are
   several            sources           for           such            maps,             including:
   http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/stations/find_station.php.
   11.6.7. The fleet manager’s implementation plan shall also include training to all operators
   to ensure they understand the requirement to use the appropriate alternative fuel and shall
   clearly indicate that the price of the alternative fuel is not a factor in deciding to use it. Fleet
   managers will periodically check the data available to them to ensure this policy is being
   followed and conduct at least a semiannual assessment for sources of alternative fuels on the
   economy. For suggestions on how to track alternative fuel consumption, contact the
   VEMSO.
11.7. Biodiesel (B20).
 256                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   11.7.1. B20 is not an alternative fuel, but is classified by the DLA Energy as a special fuel
   which aids DOD agencies by automatically reducing dependency on foreign oil by 20
   percent. B20 is a fuel blend consisting of 20-volume percent biodiesel and 80-volume
   percent diesel fuel (grades DL1/DL2 or LS1/LS2) that can be used in lieu of diesel fuel in
   compression ignition engines. The use of B20 not only provides an automatic 20 percent
   fossil fuel reduction, it also reduces air emissions and gives us credit towards the EPAct 75
   percent AFV acquisition mandate. One energy credit can be obtained by the use of 2,250
   gallons of B20 in diesel engine driven vehicles weighing more than 8,500 pounds.
   11.7.2. The use of B20 is essential in the AF's efforts to reduce its dependency on foreign
   oil. Regardless of the warranty implications, the AF mandates that B20 be used to the
   maximum extent possible. If a warranty condition develops due to the use of B20, then
   report the failure via the VM CoP so failures can be tracked and trends analyzed. Be sure to
   coordinate failure reports with the local fuels management activity to ensure that no problems
   exist with the quality of B20 at the refueling station. Warranty repair costs that are not
   covered by the dealer will be absorbed by the local vehicle management activity.
   11.7.3. Additional information on B20 can be found in TO 42B1-1-1, Fuels for USAF Piston
   and Turbine Support Equipment and Administrative Vehicles and AFPA Fuels Technical
   Letter (FTL) 11-03, Handling of Alternative Ground Fuels- Biodiesel Blends and Ethanol
   Fuel Blends for Flexible-Fuel Vehicles.

Section 11E—Environmental Programs

11.8. Environmental Quality Program. AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, provides
overall policy guidance associated with the AF’s Environmental Quality Program. As stated in
this policy directive, “The Air Force is committed to: Cleaning up environmental damage
resulting from its past activities; meeting all environmental standards applicable to its present
operations; planning its future activities to minimize environmental impacts; managing
responsibly the irreplaceable natural and cultural resources it holds in public trust; and
eliminating pollution from its activities wherever possible.” All AF functions are required to
comply with the AF environmental quality program, and as such, Vehicle Management activities
incur certain environmental responsibilities, to include, but not limited to:
   11.8.1. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and CAA Amendments of 1990. These acts deal with
   atmospheric pollution and are implemented at the federal, state and local level. The major
   areas of concern for Vehicle Management under this legislation are vehicle exhaust
   emissions and ozone depleting chemicals such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)-12 air
   conditioning refrigerants.
       11.8.1.1. CAA Section 118(c), 42 U.S.C. § 7418, requires federal fleet vehicles,
       excluding tactical vehicles (refer to paragraph 1.1.1.2), to comply with valid state and
       local principality inspection and maintenance programs for Ozone and Carbon Monoxide.
       For more details, refer to AFI 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance And Resource
       Management.
           11.8.1.1.1. The VFM/VMS should cooperate with the state to test Federal fleet
           vehicles and submit applicable reports. Exclude military tactical vehicles and any
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   257


          other vehicles exempted under state law. These may include, for example,
          emergency vehicles, AFVs and certain newer model years.
       11.8.1.2. Vehicle emission control devices are maintained and inspected according to
       technical directives, manufacturer’s recommendations, and federal, state, local or host
       nation laws. All Vehicle Management activities use a program of regularly scheduled
       diagnostic tests to make sure that all engines comply with manufacturer’s specifications.
       These test are usually done as part of the PM&I or when a major tune-up is
       accomplished. Inspect emission control devices when a vehicle is in for PM&I and see
       that the necessary work is done to ensure proper operation.
   11.8.2. 40 CFR Part 82, Subpart B, Servicing of Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, current
   edition. This law establishes standards and requirements for servicing MVAC. This rule
   requires that only certified technicians, using certified equipment which has been registered
   with the EPA, services or maintains MVAC systems. Obtain technician certification through
   one of several EPA approved mechanics-testing and/or certifying programs. Proof of
   certification must be available on site at all times. CFC-134A is the only authorized
   refrigerant when servicing vehicles unless in-house recovered CFC-12 is available. If
   contract repairs are needed for a CFC-12 system they MUST be converted to CFC-134A. If
   MVAC repairs require purchasing CFC-12 it MUST be converted to CFC-134A.
   11.8.3. Green Procurement Program. Green procurement is a program established under
   various laws and EOs directing federal agencies to procure and use recyclable and biobased
   products to the maximum extent practical. Refer to paragraph 1.23 for more information
   concerning the AF Vehicle Management GPP policy.
   11.8.4. Oil Analysis. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs have the authority to
   implement oil analysis programs for all or specific segments of their assigned vehicle fleets
   at their discretion. Oil analysis is considered a waste stream reduction tool. It may increase
   the Vehicle Management activity’s workload.
   11.8.5. HAZMART. Use base HAZMART, IAW AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material
   Management, and in consultation with the base HAZMAT Management Process Team, to the
   maximum extent practical as a means to reduce waste of bulk HAZMAT when their shelf life
   expires. Within the framework of the pharmacy program, ensure vehicle management
   processes are authorized by the HMMP Team IAW AFI 32-7086, to enable establishment of
   a set amount of HAZMAT needed to perform their operation and receive measured amounts
   of this material on an as-required basis; as well as to ensure Environmental Safety and
   Occupational Health (ESOH) controls are established.
Note: Vehicle specific HAZMAT not managed by the HAZMART will be controlled IAW
pharmacy practices.
       11.8.5.1. Follow local directives and laws when hazardous waste disposal is required.
       The VFM/VMS establish a CES-coordinated OI on pollution prevention and on
       hazardous waste management.
   11.8.6. Lead-Free Wheel Weight Use. Only lead-free wheel weights are authorized for
   procurement. Refer to paragraph 5.46 procurement information.
11.9. Vehicle Idling Policy.
258                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


  11.9.1. Installations will adhere to state, local or host nation air quality regulations which
  govern vehicle operations while the government vehicle is idling.
  11.9.2. In areas without such regulations, a “5 minute” idling policy will be in effect.
  11.9.3. Cold weather bases, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, may allow
  vehicles to remain idling (while being monitored) during extreme cold weather, as approved
  by the installation commander and policy must be included in wing instructions.
  11.9.4. Consistent with applicable laws and regulations, installation commanders may also
  allow vehicles to remain idling (while being monitored) during hot weather for air
  conditioner use. Approved policy must be included in wing instructions.
  11.9.5. Where applicable state, local or host nation laws and regulation in regards to air
  quality/vehicle idling during extreme temperatures do not exist, installation commanders may
  allow vehicles to remain idling when extreme temperatures ranges exist; such as those
  associated with Wind Chill Index and flag colors “yellow” and “red”, or Heat Category flag
  colors “red” or “black”, IAW AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury, when temperature controlled.
  11.9.6. Both cold and hot weather idling policy procedures must be coordinated and
  approved by the installation environmental, safety and legal officials.
  11.9.7. Operators will be familiar with these applicable state, local or host nation laws and
  regulations and/or installation procedures prior to leaving a vehicle idling.
  11.9.8. Emergency and law enforcement vehicles, military tactical vehicles and snow
  removal vehicles and equipment may either be generally exempt from state, local or host
  nation idling control regulations or exempt for specific emergencies, military training
  requirements or disaster relief/humanitarian operations, or winter storm response
  activities/snow removal.
  11.9.9. Installations should consult with their servicing Regional Environmental Office (HQ
  AFCEE-ER/CR/WR) for further information on the locally applicable idling rules for their
  installation.
  11.9.10. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Vehicle operators will comply with vehicle idling
  guidance outlined in paragraphs 11.9.2. through 11.9.5 and paragraphs 11.9.7 through 11.9.8.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    259

 262                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


configuration control, TCTOs, SOUMs, MAMs, TCIs, OTIs, SIs, modifications, add-on
enhancements and retrofit kit installation management. The unit VCO, along with Vehicle
Management, or equivalent, must ensure completion and correct documentation of configuration
changes, TCTOs, SOUMs, MAMs, TCIs, OTIs, SIs, modifications, add-on enhancements and
retrofit kit installation events using IMDS on-line capabilities.
   12.4.1. The unit VCO/VCNCO will coordinate semi-annually with Vehicle Management, or
   equivalent, to reconcile the resolution of configuration management notices utilizing
   applicable IMDS screens. Discrepancies must be forwarded to the appropriate maintenance
   section for resolution.
12.5. MSE Accountability. MRAP MSE is a critical component of the system-of-systems and
must be carefully managed. While management responsibility spans multiple organizations, the
operational users have day-to-day accountability of their assigned MRAPs and associated MSE.
REMIS/IMDS is the system of record to account for MRAPs; however, certain approved items
may be maintained on an AFEMS account.
   12.5.1. Certain designated/approved MSE items with an ERRC code of ND/NF will be
   maintained on an R-14/15 or CA/CRL by the operating unit and loaded in REMIS/IMDS to
   track maintenance data. Certain crypto equipment may be in this category.
12.6. Modification Management. MRAPs WILL NOT be modified without proper approval.
A modification proposal is a recommendation to change the form, fit, function or interface (F3I)
of an in-service, configuration-managed Air Force asset. Modifications are identified as
capability modifications or sustainment modifications and can be either temporary or permanent.
All modifications must be coordinated through a formal configuration review/control process
and implemented in accordance with AF publications. MRAP modifications must be routed
through the applicable MAJCOM staff and directed to the ACC/A4RE MRAP Weapon System
Team for coordination/approval. Additional information, terms and guidance governing AF
modification management is contained in AFI 63-131, Modification Program Management, AFI
63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, and AFI 10-601, Capabilities-
Based Requirements Development.
12.7. Daily Operations and Maintenance Philosophy. The AF will utilize a combination of
contract logistics support (CLS) and organic maintenance capabilities. In many cases FSRs will
be contracted to perform maintenance and documentation functions. IMDS will be used to
record maintenance discrepancies and activities associated with MRAPs.
   12.7.1. Units operating MRAPs will utilize the Vehicle Control Program and VCO/VCNCO
   concept to report and coordinate maintenance and management of MRAPs (refer to Chapter
   10).
   12.7.2. Vehicle Management, or equivalent, will be the focal point for overall MRAP
   maintenance management.
   12.7.3. The MRAP operator is responsible for accomplishing pre-use inspections to ensure
   the MRAP is configured properly, all systems are operational and the weapon system is
   suitable for the mission. The operator will annotate an MRAP AF Form 1800 identifying any
   issues with the BVP or MSE. AF Form 1800 will be provided to Vehicle Management, or
   equivalent, who in-turn documents discrepancies in IMDS for maintenance coordination and
   action. IMDS can generate needed MRAP AFTO Form 781 series forms.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                              263


   12.7.4. LRS Vehicle Management, or equivalent, will be the primary focal point for MRAP
   repair and will initiate and clear maintenance work orders in IMDS, assign priorities and
   coordinate repair requirements with approved sources of repair. Vehicle Management will
   coordinate with approved FSR/contractor for repairs not supported by organic maintenance
   capabilities.
   12.7.5. If a maintenance activity requires a request for maintenance assistance (RFA) for
   evaluation and/or repair beyond unit capability, the request will be made IAW TO 00-25-
   107-WA-1 and TO 36-1-191.
12.8. MRAP FoV Forms. MRAP maintainers/operators will utilize an AF Form 1800 and the
AFTO Form781-series forms which include: AFTO Forms 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy
and Work Document, 781B, Communication Security Equipment Record and 781K, Aerospace
Vehicle Inspection, Engine Data, Calendar Inspection And Delayed Discrepancy Document.
Information on AFTO Form 781 series documentation can be found in TO 00-20-1 and AFI 21-
103.
   12.8.1. AFTO Form 781A, used for creating and clearing work orders.
   12.8.2. AFTO Form 781B, used to track MSE that’s installed or removed.
   12.8.3. AFTO Form 781K, used to track inspections and deferred discrepancies.
   12.8.4. Forms can be down loaded from the AF portal and can be generated from IMDS.
   Samples can be seen in TO 00-20-1.
   12.8.5. Vehicle Management, or equivalent, inputs discrepancy and updates MC status in
   IMDS and creates an AFTO Form 781 series form for the discrepancy. Vehicle Management
   disseminates jobs to the appropriate work centers for action. Vehicle Management, or
   equivalent, will maintain these vehicle AFTO Form 781 series forms and keep completed
   forms in MRAP Jacket File.
   12.8.6. The appropriate work centers will complete jobs, sign off the work order in the
   AFTO Form 781 series forms, return the MRAP and signed AFTO Form 781 series forms to
   Vehicle Management, or equivalent.
   12.8.7. Vehicle Management, or equivalent, will clear work order in IMDS and update MC
   status. Vehicle Management, or equivalent, will notify VCO of completion. The VCO is
   responsible for ensuring pickup of MRAP from Vehicle Management or equivalent.
12.9. GSU. Management of MRAP weapons systems located at GSUs pose unique challenges;
however, it is imperative that all standard weapons systems management functions, to include
daily mission capability status updates, take place.
   12.9.1. All AF MRAPs located at a GSU are possessed as a matter-of-record by an AF
   organization. The managing group commander, or equivalent, is responsible to ensure all
   maintenance management actions and reporting procedures are accomplished.

     A2.2. MAJCOM CAT Procedures. This attachment provides general guidance to personnel
     staffing CATs or equivalent, at the MAJCOM-level.
         A2.2.1. Personnel filling these positions are considered FAMs. They are responsible for
         identifying, sourcing and tracking resources used to support crisis or contingency operations.
         The FAM also ensures the sourced base is not over-tasked (more than what is postured in that
         AEF). To perform these duties, the FAM needs to understand the mobility process, TPFDD,
         ART and Air Force-Wide Unit Type Code Availability and Tasking Summary. The
         following training courses are highly recommended:
             A2.2.1.1. JOPES Course. JOPES supports crisis action planning and management of
             deployment operations.
             A2.2.1.2. DCAPES Course. DCAPES is a classified part of the Global Command and
             Control System (GCCS) and links AF planners to Joint war planners.
     LIMS-EV Vehicle View training.
             A2.2.1.3. MAJCOM-specific functional training.
             A2.2.1.4. Contingency Wartime Planning Course (CWPC). CWPC educates FAMs in
             the art and science of contingency war planning.
         A2.2.2. TPFDD Actions. The FAM will need to determine what tasking(s) are in the
         TPFDD and who they are for. This section is designed to enable the FAM to extract that
         information. After accessing the TPFDD, complete data retrieval by using the following
         steps:
             A2.2.2.1. The first step is to sort the Service Reserve Code column. (See Figure A2.9,
             Typical MAJCOM Codes.)
             A2.2.2.2. The second step is to sort the OPLAN column. The deployment Plan
             Identification Designators (PID) has a "D" on the end. Redeployment PIDs have an "R"
             (e.g., PID 111AD = deployment and 111AR = return). The PID identifies a specific
             OPLAN that has been implemented.
             A2.2.2.3. The third Step is to sort the UTC column:

           A2.2.2.3.2. The LRS/Supply 2SXXX AFSC UTCs begin with JF.
           A2.2.2.3.3. The LRS/Fuels 2FXXX AFSC UTCs begin with JF.
Note: Use "*" on end of code to see Guard and Reserve requirements (e.g., 1C* for ACC).
           A2.2.2.3.4. The LRS/Logistics Plans 2GXXX UTCs begin with XF.
           A2.2.2.3.5. LRS officer 21RX (21T/21S/21G) UTCs begin with 9LR.
        A2.2.2.4. The fourth step involves sorting the PCD column. Sorting on blanks (in
        column) identifies all the requirements (ULNs) that need FAM immediate action.
           A2.2.2.4.1. FAM should perform the following:
               A2.2.2.4.1.1. Ensure base is only tasked for what is postured and reported as
               available in ART. Note: A unit may be tasked with a UTC that is not postured in
               ART as long as they have a UTC with the same capability imbedded, for example
               same AFSCs are available in other UTCs.
               A2.2.2.4.1.2. Ensure base is not over tasked. Compare TPFDD tasking to UTCs
               postured in the tasked deployment band. Tasking cannot exceed postured
               capability. The FAM should also look at other units within the same deployment
               band.
               A2.2.2.4.1.3. Notify UDM of tasking(s).
               A2.2.2.4.1.4. Coordinate with AFPC/DPW on any changes required.
        A2.2.2.5. The fifth step requires inserting the appropriate PCD validation codes.
           A2.2.2.5.1. Different plans require different validation codes depending on
           timeframe. The tasking MAJCOM (owner of PID) will provide guidance as
           necessary. Submit codes for each ULN to JOPES element or equivalent for DCAPES
           update.

operations and/or environmental impact mitigation effects, prior to initiating an evaluation.
   A7.1.1. All vendors participating in the product evaluation program must be made to
   understand, and acknowledge in writing prior to any evaluation starting (see note 1 below),
   that this is a “no cost” program to the US Government, DOD or AF. Furthermore, that a
   positive (or negative) product procurement recommendation stated in any evaluation report is
   written in a way that does not constitute a legal and binding agreement on the AF to
   procure/purchase the evaluated product. Extreme care must be taken by all levels of Vehicle
   Management activities when corresponding with vendors as to not obligate (intentionally or
   unintentionally) the AF for evaluated product procurement without proper authority.
A7.2. AF-level Evaluations. AF-level evaluations will be conducted on products that have
potentially significant positive impact on Vehicle Management activities across the AF
enterprise.
   A7.2.1. VEMSO is the AF focal point and managing activity for AF-level product
   evaluations.
   A7.2.2. AF/A4LE will:
       A7.2.2.1. Approve all AF-level vendor product evaluation requests.
       A7.2.2.2. Intercede on behalf of VEMSO to obtain MAJCOM support for
       demonstrations, including required evaluation reports.
   A7.2.2. VEMSO will:
       A7.2.2.1. Research areas for improvement related to vehicles, tools, equipment and
       materials, vehicle facilities, management procedures and environmentally friendly
       alternatives to current processes, to include equipment and products.
       A7.2.2.2. Review product evaluation request and/or recommend vehicle products for
       evaluation.
       A7.2.2.3. Coordinate with applicable MAJCOM vehicle management functions to
       determine evaluation locations and on-site support requirements.
       A7.2.2.4. Provide project administrative support and guidance to vendors and evaluating
       units, to include: Bailment Agreement, Program Directive, evaluation time-lines and
       reporting requirements.
Notes:
1. A “Bailment Agreement” is an agreement between the vendor (bailor) and AF (bailee) which
outlines the temporary placement of control over, or possession of, the product to be evaluated
by the bailor, into the hands of the bailee, for the designated purpose of evaluation upon which
 320                               AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


the parties have agreed and at “no cost” to the bailee. Bailment agreements must be signed by
the vendor’s representative and the host base Contracting Officer prior to product transfer. Three
(each) signed and original Bailment Agreements must be completed. One each will be
distributed to the Contracting Officer and one to the vendor. The evaluating unit will maintain
the third copy.
2. A “Project Directive” outlines vendor/product information, testing/evaluation parameters and
pertinent contact information.
       A7.2.2.5. Maintain official records of all AF-level evaluations. Retain Bailment
       Agreement (to include associate documentation) IAW Table and Rule T 64 – 06 R 03.00
       in the AF RDS in AFRIMS.
       A7.2.2.6. When necessary, send a VEMSO Project Manager to the evaluation site to
       start, evaluate and/or close projects.
       A7.2.2.7. Prepare disposition recommendations to AF/A4LE based on evaluating unit’s
       final report findings, including criteria for AS placement or replacement as required.
       A7.2.2.8. Post AF/A4LE endorsed final report/findings on the VM CoP.
       A7.2.2.9. Provide product vendor with a bailer’s report IAW established agreements.
AF/A4LE
A7.3. Base/Unit-level Evaluations. Base/unit-level evaluations will be conducted on, but not
limited to, products (tools & equipment) that would normally replace accountable equipment
items of lesser quality and/or obsolete automotive repair/service technologies; while still having
potentially tangible and intangible benefits to the AF. Normally length evaluations are between
four and six months.
   A7.3.1. Base/unit-level vehicle management activities manage their own product
   evaluations, with support and guidance from their MAJCOM.
   A7.3.2. VEMSO will:
       A7.3.2.1. Provide program and administrative guidance to MAJCOMs and evaluating
       units. Note: VEMSO will provide Program Directive, Bailment Agreement, and final
       report templates upon request.
       A7.3.2.2. VEMSO will post MAJCOM coordinated final reports on VM CoP.
   A7.3.3. MAJCOM Vehicle Management functions will:
       A7.3.3.1. Review and approve evaluation request from subordinate units.
       A7.3.3.2. Review and approve Project Directives.
       A7.3.3.3. Review and coordinate on final report/findings.
   A7.3.4. The Evaluating Unit will:
       A7.3.4.1. Coordinate with MAJCOM and servicing Base Contracting Officer prior to
       starting vendor product evaluations.
           A7.3.4.1.1. Provide justification for evaluation, to include product and manufacture’s
           details; i.e., brochures, pictures, websites, manufacture contact information.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  321


     A7.3.4.2. Assign primary and alternate project monitors. Provide MAJCOM with
     contact information (this information will be included on Project Directive).
     A7.3.4.3. Complete valid Bailment Agreement (refer to paragraph A7.1.1).
     A7.3.4.4. Complete Project Directive and comply with MAJCOM approved Project
     Directive and report suspense(s).
     A7.3.4.5. Provide liaison to vendor concerning delivery or shipping arrangements of
     product to be evaluated.
     A7.3.4.6. Complete project status report (as direct by MAJCOM).
     A7.3.4.7. Complete final report/findings. Staff report through MAJCOM prior to
     submission to VEMSO for posting on the VM CoP. At a minimum, the report will
     include:
         A7.3.4.7.1. Calculated costs savings and avoidance that resulted from project
         evaluation.
         A7.3.4.7.2. Intangible benefits.
         A7.3.4.7.3. Advantages and disadvantages, to include any safety concerns.
         A7.3.4.7.4. Comparison to current item or process used.
         A7.3.4.7.5. Work accomplished (how was product evaluated) and discussion.
         A7.3.4.7.6. Recommendations.
     A7.3.4.8. Review test data before the end of the test to determine if purchase of test
     equipment (in place) is warranted. If the purchase of the tested equipment is desired, test
     activities will prepare an AF Form 9 along with a sole source justification and process it
     through their contracting activity or use a GPC for purchase.
  A7.3.5. Other areas of program concern:
     A7.3.5.1. VEMSO provides program management guidance to non-vehicle management
     organizations or activities (i.e., AFCESA or AFPA). When a product affects the
     specifications, and/or characteristics of a specific registered vehicle, VEMSO will be
     coordinated with prior to product evaluation start.
     A7.3.5.2. VEMSO will participate in environmental and pollution prevention workshops
     and conferences to learn about new products and current automotive industry practices
     and work to embed them in Vehicle Management processes. Coordinate proposed
     environmental projects with the AF Center for Engineering and the Environmental
     (AFCEE/EQP/EQT). An Environmental Impact Analysis Process, categorical exclusion,
     environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement might have to be
     developed for projects having environmental impact.

7) COST PER VEHICLE: Total of all costs divided by fleet total of the filter result set.
       A8.4.2.5. “Utilization” depicts a combination of two group sets to provide a capability to
       measure vehicle utilization of a filtered result set to the “AF Average”. Calculations
       limited to vehicles with an M/H/U/K code of “M” or “K.” Data Computations are as
       follows.
           A8.4.2.5.1. “Mean” is the average total miles driven per vehicle for the entire period
           of historical data period selected (not more than 24 months).
           A8.4.2.5.2. “Two Standard Deviations”, use of two standard deviations from the
           mean to establish upper and lower control limits for the AF average.
              A8.4.2.5.2.1. “Over Utilized” = more than two standard deviations above the
              mean.
              A8.4.2.5.2.2. “Under Utilized” = more than two standard deviations under the
              mean.
       A8.4.2.6. “Requirements” depicts the number of vehicles required to be replaced over
       the next 20 years. Initial view will also depict the vehicles scheduled for purchase (due
       in). The view can be switched between “Assets” and “Cost”.
           A8.4.2.6.1. The computations used to establish current life expectancy are as
           follows:
1) Life expectancy in years is computed by taking the depreciated value of each vehicle over a
20-year life span and plotting it against O&M costs, which are increased yearly by three percent
(for inflation).
2) Establish the life in years at the point where projected O&M costs exceed the depreciated
value or at 20 years.
       A8.4.2.7. Due-Ins. This view will show due-in information by vehicle quantity, actual
       dollars and by fund type. Due-in data is from CARS.
   A8.4.3. TCTO. This view depicts four separate but linked TCTO requirements by vehicle
   counts. The available data views are by vehicle numbers and percent completed. By
   toggling between the views, the viewer can get an informed look at an individual TCTO or
   the status of a larger TCTO program completion level within a filter set.  TCTO
   numbers are generated on a reference table and TCTO number in OLVIMS must match
   TCTO number listed in LIMS-EV VEHICLE VIEW. OLVIMS data is crossed in monthly
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   327


  file uploaded to VEMSO (VYHK0D2T.ZIP). If TCTO data in OLVIMS is incorrect,
  VM&A must edit “C record” in OLVIMS to match (CZ, CV, ZH transactions). The
  following are data points and definitions are used to build this view:
     A8.4.3.1. Total required: depicts the sum vehicles required to have a TCTO completed
     on them within the filter set. Source of the vehicle count is a sum of the registration
     numbers listed in the TCTO table that matches the filter set.
     A8.4.3.2. Complete: depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers listed within the
     filter set that have a TCTO COMPLETED DATE listed.
     A8.4.3.3. Due/On-Time: depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result set
     that require a TCTO be completed that have not passed the “MUST BE DONE DATE”.
     Will be reflected when within 60 days of due date. Individuals can toggle between
     numerical values or percentages in the chart.
     A8.4.3.4. Overdue: depicts the sum of vehicle registration numbers in the result set that
     require a TCTO be completed that has passed the “MUST BE DONE DATE”.
  A8.4.4. Force Module. This module depicts total vehicles available to sustain the vehicle
  force modules of “Open,” “Establish”, “Operate” or “Robust a base”. This module mirrors
  the Leadership View display, but shows actual assets and bases. Filter options allow
  selection of organization level and type of mission to support. Select chart option to fill the
  data grid with vehicle requirements, drill down vehicle requirements to view asset
  information.
     A8.4.4.1. Data Source. Package requirements are defined in the Force Module table and
     fill rate/capability data is extracted from the “WRK.CMD” file.

       CAPABILITY BASED FUNDING AND VEHICLE PRIORITIZATION MODEL

A9.1. Capability Based Funding. A process used to capture logistics requirements.
Quantifying vehicle/vehicular equipment requirements is key to raising the pursuit of funding
from a gray area to a meaningful discussion of capability.
     A9.1.1. Programming is establishing a plan of action to do something. In the vehicle world
     this is planning our vehicle requirements in future years.
     A9.1.2. Execution is when we carry out those plans with the funding available.
A9.2. Funding Source.
     A9.2.1. Funding is appropriated by Congress for vehicle procurement through appropriation
     bills. Appropriated funds categories are:
        A9.2.1.1. 3010 Aircraft Procurement, Air Force.
        A9.2.1.2. 3080 Procurement – Other (munitions, vehicles, electronics, base maintenance
        and support equipment). This is three-year money.
        A9.2.1.3. 3400 Operations and Maintenance, Air Force. This is one-year money.
     A9.2.2. In the past, 3400 and 3080 money was used for vehicle procurement, now only 3080
     money is used for vehicle procurement.
        A9.2.2.1. 3400 is discretionary money and is not designated for a specific purpose. This
        funding is easy to target for funding cuts when Air Staff or MAJCOM has higher
        priorities; hard to defend requirements.
        A9.2.2.2. 3080 money is allocated for specific requirements. This type of funding is
        harder to target for cuts or divert elsewhere, unless mission is higher priority.
     A9.2.3. The “Color of Money”.
        A9.2.3.1. Appropriated money is further defined by Budget Program Activity Codes
        (BPAC). BPAC classifications “below the appropriation level” are used to identify major
        budget programs, or in relation to vehicles, the type of vehicle the funding supports. The
        following are vehicle BPACs:
1)   1800 – General Purpose Vehicles.
2)   2230 – Medium Tactical Vehicles (All M-Series vehicles).
3)   2990 – Cargo and Utility Vehicles.
4)   3230 – HMMWV.
5)   4010 – Fire Fighting Vehicles.
6)   5990 – Material Handling.
7)   6210 – Runway Snow Removal.
8)   6990 – Base Maintenance and Construction.
     A9.3.2. AF Vehicle Fleet Major/Minor Program Codes (refer to paragraph 4.75) are used to
     link authorization (and vehicles) to the specific mission they are used to support. They also
     allow for analysis to determine what missions are being supported by the money. For a
     listing of vehicle program/mission codes refer to Tables 4.5 and 4.6
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   329


A9.4. Vehicle Prioritization Model.
     A9.4.1. Overview. A given vehicle type is only in one BPAC, but can be at any base within
     a MAJCOM or AF fleet. Funds allocated to each vehicle NSN are split among all vehicles
     and vacancies within that NSN. The model calculates End of Life (EOL) year based on
     depreciation of the vehicle and cumulative sustainment (O&M) costs. Depreciation is based
     on a default life expectancy of 20 years. EOL is adjusted, or set, when O&M cost exceeds
     depreciation value. Vehicles with same Management code will have different life
     expectancies for programming purposes. The Vehicle Prioritization Model provides better
     justification for appropriations and is a proven business model that identifies vehicle
     requirements while connecting them with the mission they support.
Note: Vehicle One-time Repair Limits and Replacement Codes should only be used for
maintenance decisions.
     A9.4.2. Model Logic.
        A9.4.2.1. Vehicles and vacancies are prioritized within BPACs and NSNs.
            A9.4.2.1.1. Prioritizes all assets assigned from 1 – many, whether replacement
            required or not.
            A9.4.2.1.2. Does not attempt to prioritize one vehicle type over another or one BPAC
            over another.
            A9.4.2.1.3. Does not attempt to prioritize vehicles and vacancies together.
            A9.4.2.1.4. Apply the funding:
1)   Applies funding across NSNs in a BPAC.
2)   Determines NSN earned share based on health rate.
3)   Determines vehicle/vacancy split (2:1).
4)   Apply funds to prioritized lists.
        A9.4.2.2. Prioritization Rules for Vehicle Replacement.
            A9.4.2.2.1. Use Code: non-WRM (A/J, B/K, C/L) first, WRM last (D/M).
            A9.4.2.2.2. Year: Ascending – oldest first.
            A9.4.2.2.3. Use Code: A/J first, B/K and C/L second, D/M last.
            A9.4.2.2.4. End of Life: Ascending – projected end of life year. Vehicles exceeding
            or nearing their end of life year are replaced first.
            A9.4.2.2.5. Miles or Hours: Descending – cumulative miles or hours.
            A9.4.2.2.6. Sustainment Cost: Descending – higher maintenance cost before low.
            A9.4.2.2.7. Item Code: Unsuitable substitutes first, all others second.
            A9.4.2.2.8. Base Fleet Age: Descending – the average age of the fleet for all NSNs at
            each base (prioritizes assets that are equal in every other way between bases).
            A9.4.2.2.9. Last 6 digits of registration number: Ascending – a random number will
            be used for tiebreak.
        A9.4.2.3. Prioritization Rules for Vacancies.
 330                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


           A9.4.2.3.1. Use Code: A/J (mobility) first, B/K and C/L second, D/M (WRM) last.
           A9.4.2.3.2. Vacancy Rate: Descending – percentage of vacancies to authorizations at
           a location. More vacancies – higher priority.
           A9.4.2.3.3. Replaced eligible rate: Descending – percentage of replacement eligible
           vehicles to authorizations. Higher percentage of replacement eligible vehicles –
           higher priority.
           A9.4.2.3.4. Fleet Age: Descending – average age of the fleet for each NSN at each
           base.
           A9.4.2.3.5. Base Fleet Age: Descending – the average age of the fleet for all NSNs at
           each base (prioritizes assets that are equal in every other way between bases).
           A9.4.2.3.6. Authorization Number: Descending – positions 7-18 of authorization
           number (doc number + SRAN). A random number will be used for tiebreak.
       A9.4.2.4. Funding Rules.
           A9.4.2.4.1. Can select how many out-years to include in the plan.
           A9.4.2.4.2. A percentage of funds can be withheld. Needed to accommodate a flex
           line between listed Standard Price and actual price with options.
           A9.4.2.4.3. No Buy list can be created for any combination of NSN, BPAC,
           MAJCOM, Base and/or FY.
           A9.4.2.4.4. Must Buy list can be created by NSN, MAJCOM and FY.
           A9.4.2.4.5. Replacement Required Carryover Percentage (RRCP).
1) Accepted historical replacement eligible percentage by NSN.
2) VPM will prioritize up to that percentage for a NSN and then stop until all NSNs reach their
RRCP.
3) VPM then continues to prioritize equally for all NSNs.
           A9.4.2.5.5. MAJCOMs use the VPM to adjust programming for BPACs in out years.
           This allows them to see if there is too much/little money within a BPAC. Money
           cannot be moved in execution year. Programming lists are not saved in the system.
           A9.4.2.5.6. MAJCOMs run (What if scenarios) throughout the year to identify and
           adjust buy requirements
           A9.4.2.5.7. The system is locked on predetermined date to generate prioritization list
           for execution. Execution list are saved in the system and generate metrics for
           analysis. MAJCOMs and base level VM activities can run the model with “what if”
           scenarios.

                              DOD FLEET CARD PROGRAM

A10.1. Overview. DOD Fleet Cards are used to obtain fuel and services from off-base
commercial service stations when the vehicle is operating outside of the using organization’s
Permissible Operating Distance (POD). The cards are not credit cards, e.g., VISA® or
MasterCard®, and are only accepted at participating businesses. Dependent on individual unit
account policy, purchases other items or services other than fuel may be authorized and will be
limited to those which are needed in order keep a USAF vehicle in (or return to) serviceable
condition.
   A10.1.1. AF controlled vehicles authorized for off-base use may be assigned a DOD Fleet
   Card if the vehicle is normally operated outside of the base’s POD or if an authorized DOD
   or AF base refueling facility (that utilizes the Vehicle Identification Link Key) is not
   available.
   A10.1.2. To facilitate multi-vehicle fuel purchases, each vehicle management, or account
   activity, is authorized to obtain generic cards.
A10.2. General Policy.
   A10.2.1. Card users will be briefed to make every effort to purchase fuel from pumps with
   card reader (“swiping”) capability.
   A10.2.2. Card users will not purchase premium fuels (e.g., premium or super unleaded,
   premium diesel) unless required in writing buy the vehicle manufacture. However, if the
   octane rating for E-85 is higher than regular unleaded, the purchase of E-85 is authorized for
   flex-fuel vehicles.
   A10.2.3. All fuel cards should reflect account name, i.e., 96th Vehicle Management.
   A10.2.4. Vehicle management or account holder activities should maintain as few fuel cards
   as possible to ensure mission accomplishment.
   A10.2.5. The APC, base-level vehicle management or account holder activities may set
   policy restricting Fleet card purchases to ”FUEL ONLY”.
       A10.2.5.1. Car wash purchase amount limits may also be set by APCs or base-level
       Vehicle Management activities, i.e., $15 per car wash.
   A10.2.6. Fuel cards will not to be used in place of an organization’s GPC program, the use
   of an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase or other purchasing instrument when purchasing
   items or services required in support of field operations or fleet maintenance.
Exception: AFOSI and Unified Command accounts with indigenous assets assigned are
exempt. However, these organizations should investigate using other procurement/purchasing
avenues (like those mentioned above) before using the fuel card program.
   A10.2.7. Fuel cards will not be used to support “wet” leased vehicles at any time. Contact
   GSA for guidance concerning on GSA leased vehicle cards.
   A10.2.8. Fuel cards can be used to obtain fuel for small boats, tugs or barges as authorized
   by the AFCPM and not to exceed the $3,000 micro-purchase threshold.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     333


   A10.2.9. Fuel cards are not authorized to obtain aviation fuel.
   A10.2.10. LRS Commanders or equivalents have the option of establishing alternative off-
   base refueling programs using the DOD Fleet Card Program when alternative fuel
   requirements cannot be met by local fuels management agencies and/or supported by other
   federal agencies (refer to paragraph 11.6).
       A10.2.10.1. If cards are required to support commercially available alternative fuel,
       these cards will be restricted to “FUEL ONLY” purchases.
       A10.2.10.2. If individual cards are obtained to support specific vehicle(s), these card will
       have the vehicle registration number and alternative fuel optionally embossed on the card
       (e.g., 11B12345 E-85). Additionally, these cards will be programmed with the fuel
       funding line-of-accounting (LOA) belonging to the vehicle’s assigned organization.
Note: Fuel funding LOAs are established by Accounting and Finance and contain Department
of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC), Signal Code, Fund Code and Supply Account
Codes which are used to charge organizational O&M funding lines for fuel purchases. These
codes are also found on individual vehicle VIL keys.
   A10.2.11. VM&A must establish procedures with Accountable Officials (AO) (if not from
   an LRS Vehicle Management account) and card users to ensure the information required for
   OLVIMS off-base fuel transaction are provided in a timely fashion.
   A10.2.12. When fuel cards are assigned/hand-receipted to support non-UDI or account
   assigned vehicles, the AO will ensure that funds for fuel purchases are reimbursed to the fuel
   card account’s fuel funding LOA. Additionally, AOs will restrict purchases to ”FUEL
   ONLY”.
   A10.2.13. When not in use, cards will be stored in a suitable locked container.
   A10.2.14. AOs will establish policy and procedure for card users to follow for obtaining
   approval from the account AO or Certifying Official (CO) before using a card to obtain
   commercial maintenance or towing services.
   A10.2.15. APCs, AO, CO and alternates must establish and maintain on-line account
   management access with the credit card vendor. On-line account management (WEX
   Online®) will allow APCs transaction oversight and AOs/COs the ability to retrieve monthly
   invoices, set-up purchase “alerts”, quickly view status of account(s), card(s) used and to
   verify transactions against their account(s). APCs will only be able to view account under
   their MAJCOM hierarchy.
A10.3. Above the Unit Level Program Management Positions. DLA Energy is the DOD
Program Manager for the DOD Fleet Card Program; establishing policy, providing oversight and
managing account fuel transactions., however units will develop, and ensure execution of, local
programs and procedures IAW with the DLA Energy sponsored fuel charge card guidelines and
this AFI.
   A10.3.1. AFCPM. On behalf of AF/A4LE, VEMSO acts as the AFCPM. As such,
   VEMSO is responsible for supporting DOD Fleet Card Program policy, establishing and
   enforcing AF policy and providing a bridge between unit-level accounts and outside
   agencies; such as DLA Energy, the fuel card vendor and the Defense Finance and
   Accounting System. Additionally, VEMSO provides account oversight, operational and
 334                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   program management support for non-fuel purchases. VEMSO also is responsible to
   maintain a master listing of all accounts, to include (with the assistance of APCs) up-to-date
   unit-level account AO/POC information.
   A10.3.2. APC. Like the AFCPM, APCs can also act as a bridge between accounts and
   outside agencies. They are also responsible for the oversight and enforcement of AF Fleet
   Card Program policy. This is usually accomplished via Staff Assistance and as program
   management checklist items on the HAF Core CI checklist. MAJCOM APCs may also
   augment AF policy with supplemental instructions to this AFI, IAW paragraph 1.2
   Additionally, APCs will maintain a list of accounts and AO (POC) information for accounts
   under their command.
A10.4. Unit Level Program Management Positions. Normally, the Vehicle Management
activity is responsible for administration of the DOD Fleet Card Program/account. Appropriate
personnel within the account’s controlling activity/flight will be appointed (via DD Form 577,
Appointment/Termination Record – Authorized Signature, Sections I thru III, refer to paragraph
A10.4.3) to the following positions:
   A10.4.1. AO. This person is responsible for overall account management, to include, but
   not limit to:
       A10.4.1.1. Supporting the certification of payment invoices and documents for vendor
       non-fuel payment.       Supporting the respective CO with timely and accurate
       data/information to ensure prompt and proper payments, i.e., payments that are
       supportable, legal and computed correctly.
       A10.4.1.2. Ensuring fuel cards are distributed for use only to authorized vehicles.
       A10.4.1.3. Ensuring that a system of internal procedures and controls for the portion of
       the entitlement and/or payment-related process under their cognizance is in place to
       minimize opportunities for erroneous or delinquent payments. Additionally, ensure that
       all procedural safeguards affecting proposed payments are observed.
       A10.4.1.4. Complying with OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B and all applicable DOD
       regulations and AF policy and procedures.
   A10.4.2. CO. The CO position would normally be held by the flight OIC, VFM, VMS or
   Section NCOIC. However, small units/functions with limited supervisory personnel
   authorizations may designate the resource advisor, unit commander or contracting officer (for
   contracted vehicle management activities) as the CO. The CO serves as a “check-and-
   balance” to ensure all purchases made with DOD Fleet Cards are legitimate and for official
   use only.
Note: Additional responsibilities for the positions above can be found in DOD 4140.25-M,
DOD Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas, and Coal, Vol II, Chapter 16,
Government Fuel Card Program Management Office, 26 February 2009.
   A10.4.3. All unit level program management position appointments should be made by the
   unit commander or appointing authority utilizing a DD Form 577.
Note: The use of a memorandum to appoint personnel into program management positions is at
the discretion of unit-level management. However, this does not negate completion and
disposition of DD Form 577.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                       335


       A10.4.3.1. AOs also require completion of the Fleet DOD/DLA Energy AO Nomination
       Form.
       A10.4.3.2. AOs and COs must complete DLA Energy AO Training (refer to paragraph
       A10.12.).
   A10.4.4. Alternates will also be appointed for each position and have the same appointment
   form requirements as stated above.
   A10.4.5. The signed DD Form 577, AO Nomination Form and AO training Certificate must
   be forwarded to the DLA Energy AF Account Manager and/or AFCPM and maintained in
   the account program management binder/file.
Notes:
1. DLA Energy and the AFCPM maintains a DD Form 577 with program responsibilities (block
14) and program management directives (block 15) prefilled, this is the only form that will be
accepted. Go to the VM CoP or the DLA Energy website
(https://www.us.army.mil/suite/page/655720 (Defense Knowledge Online (DKO) site)) to attain
a write-capable electronic version.
2. Upon termination of program management position responsibilities, DD Form 577, Section
IV, must be completed and forwarded the DLA Energy AF Account Manager and/or AFCPM
and maintained in the account program management binder/file.
3. COs and AOs perform inherently governmental functions such as activities that require making
value judgments regarding monetary transactions and entitlement involving the collection, control, or
disbursement of appropriated and other Federal funds. Therefore, these functions must be performed
by U.S. Federal government employees, not contractors.
A10.5. Establishing DOD Fleet Card Account. Units should contact the AFCPM and/or visit
the DLA Energy website for details.
   A10.5.1. DLA Energy will not establish new accounts without the AFCPM approval.
A10.6. DOD Fleet Card Split Billing Process:
   A10.6.1. Split billing is a means of centrally billing the “fuel” portion of the invoice. Split
   Billing functionality is the process whereby fuel purchases are separated from non-fuel
   purchases. The fuel card processor (Wright Express© (WEX), the DOD Fleet Fuel Card
   contractor) is responsible for separating fuel purchases from non-fuel purchases (splitting the
   invoice).
   A10.6.2. For the fuel portion, DLA Energy-RRF (San Antonio) acts as the certifying office
   and Defense Finance & Accounting Service (DFAS) Columbus is the paying office.
   A10.6.3. For the non-fuel portion, each incurring unit (account) is the certifying office, and
   the appropriate DFAS office for the unit is the paying office. Individual accounts should
   continue processing the non-fuel portion of their invoice from the fleet card contractor
   through their established channels. (Refer to paragraph A10.8)
A10.7. The FMD and the FES:
   A10.7.1. The FMD, a component of Business Systems Modernization ----Energy, is a
   vertically integrated automated information system consisting of base-level components and
 336                              AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   enterprise-level systems providing visibility of bulk fuel assets and fuel transactions to the
   Services and DLA Energy.
   A10.7.2. The FES is a web-based environment that collects, routes, and reports fuel
   transactions among bases, contractors, DLA Energy, DFAS and other entities. It acts as the
   DLA Energy data warehouse that stores fuel transactions purchased by the DOD Fleet Card.
   A10.7.3. These systems facilitate standard unit pricing, requirement analysis, and inter-fund
   billing. DOD Fleet Card fuel purchases are passed to FES by the fleet card contractor.
   Transactions are rolled up by DODAAC /sub-account, a document number is assigned and
   standard price applied for inter-fund billing. This information is passed to DFAS.
   A10.7.4. What units are being charged for fuel: When the DOD Fuel Card is used, the
   Standard Price per gallon is charged to the unit. The unit is NOT charged the ”pump
   price”. This is because DLA Energy pays for the actual (pump) price through the Defense
   Working Capital Fund.
       A10.7.4.1. The Office of Management and Budget sets the Standard Price not DLA
       Energy.
A10.8. Non-Fuel Purchase Funding and Payment Procedures. All non-fuel purchases will
be paid directly to the card vendor before or by the invoice due date (normally 30 days after
invoice date).
   A10.8.1. In order to assure continuity, locality specific payment procedures must be
   established with the servicing Accounting & Finance Budget Office when accounts are
   established.
   A10.8.2. Account activities should provide the unit Resource Advisor, or servicing
   Accounting & Finance Budget Office, an estimate of non-fuel purchases each fiscal quarter
   or year as needed. This can be accomplished by preparing the appropriate funding document,
   i.e., AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/ Reimbursement Document, and forwarding the
   original and one copy to servicing Accounting & Finance Budget Office for approval at the
   beginning of each year and/or quarter. The approved copy is authority to cite funds for
   purchases.
Note: The AO and/or CO must take into account the lead time required by DFAS to process
Miscellaneous Pay transactions when working to meet payment due dates.
A10.9. Account Documentation and Continuity Requirement. Various documentation will
be maintained for account management, program management and for continuity purposes. This
information can be maintain electronically and/or via hard copy file(s) or in a continuity
book(s)/binder(s). The information will be divided into two parts, files or sections: 1) Funding
and Transactions 2) Card Administration and Management Control.
   A10.9.1. Funding and Transactions. Documentation within this section will include, but is
   not limited to:
       A10.9.1.1. Copies FY funding documents (i.e., AF Form 406 and/or SF 1048), Fund cite
       authorization and requests for additional or supplemental funds.
Note: These documents are not required for “FUEL ONLY” accounts or if no non-fuel
purchases have been made during the current fiscal year.
AFI24-302_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   337


       A10.9.1.2. Billing cycle (monthly) transaction documents (grouped by billing cycle).
       These documents include:
           A10.9.1.2.1. Vendor Invoices. WEX produces monthly invoices for download using
           the WEX Online® Account Management System only if non-fuel purchases were
           made during the billing cycle (first calendar day to last calendar day each month)
           and/or there is a non-fuel purchase balance due. The “balance due” amount on the
           monthly invoice will only reflect the amount due to non-fuel purchases.
           A10.9.1.2.2. Monthly Purchase Transaction Reports. Also available on WEX
           Online® regardless of invoice availability. These reports will be downloaded and
           used to reconcile/validate (against receipts) ALL purchases.
           A10.9.1.2.3. All purchase and other transactions receipts. All purchase receipts must
           have the following associated information documented:
              A10.9.1.2.3.1. The full name, grade, unit and duty phone number of purchaser.
              A10.9.1.2.3.2. Description of purchase. If fuel, type of fuel and gallons. If
              service, part or repair, provide full description.
              A10.9.1.2.3.3. Vehicle registration/tag number and odometer/hour meter at the
              time of purchase.
       A10.9.1.3. ALL billing cycle transactions documents (vendor invoices, transaction
       reports and transaction receipts, etc.) must be maintained for three years, regardless of
       account status.
Note: If a transaction receipts is lost, the AO will document (e.g., Memo for Record) the
occurrence; to include the purchaser’s POC information and information relevant to the
transaction.
   A10.9.2. Card Administration and Management Controls. Documentation within this
   section will include, but is not limited to:
       A10.9.2.1. Local program policies/procedures.
       A10.9.2.2. Account position appointment forms, letters (AO Nomination and DD Form
       577) and AO training certificates.
       A10.9.2.3. Card listing, to include: card number, profile, fuel LOA, etc.
       A10.9.2.4. Location of card Personal Identification Number(s) (PIN), or Driver’s ID
       number(s) Listing.
