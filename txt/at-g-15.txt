2. INTRODUCTION

       The purpose of this publication is to provide air traffic controllers with the knowledge necessary
to operate the Flight Information Processing System (FLIPS) in accordance with AFI 13-203,
paragraph 2.27. This is the authoritative source for operation of this system and is directive in nature.
The National Air Traffic Training Program manual “Flight Data Input and Output” (FDIO) published by
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Academy provides an excellent reference for message
composition not covered by this document.

         FLIPS uses a 486 personal computer, a color monitor, and a dot matrix printer to perform flight
plan entry, editing, strip printing, and mass flight plan storage functions. FLIPS performs functions
similar to FDIO for USAF air traffic control facilities, for example: adding full flight plans and strip
printing capabilities.

          FLIPS is not an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) clearance issuing system like the National
Airspace System (NAS) or Japanese Air Traffic Control Center (Japanese ACC) flight data systems
are. FLIPS may only be used to record IFR clearances that have been obtained by other means from
the appropriate IFR clearance issuing facility. The requirements for obtaining and coordinating flight
data entered into FLIPS are the same as for non-automated flight plans. Use of FLIPS for initial entry
of local IFR/VFR flight data (data not required to be obtained from or coordinated with any other
facilities) must be described in a facility directive.

      Although the system contains on-screen assistance and prompts, the operator must be familiar
with the standard format of all types of flight progress strips as specified in FAAO 7110.65. FLIPS
does not support the FDIO-style weather symbols.

        FLIPS will be interfaced with the Programmable Indicator Data Processor (PIDP) computer for
transmitting flight plans and airport data between the two systems.


2.1. Operational Program Description

       FLIPS operational software is an application program and, as such, runs under control of the
Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS). MS-DOS uses special keyboard entries that perform
specific functions, such as returning control to MS-DOS. The next section, System Warnings, contains
information on some special MS-DOS keyboard entries that should not be used.


2.2. System Warnings

      The following key codes produce special MS-DOS commands and should NOT be pressed
simultaneously. If these keys are depressed simultaneously, the operational program will terminate. If
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                              11


this happens, the system must be reinitialized. Once again, DO NOT simultaneously press the following
key combinations:

<Ctrl> <C>                <Ctrl> <Break>             <Ctrl> <2>                <Ctrl> <Alt> <Del>
<Ctrl> <Alt> <Ins>        <Ctrl> <Alt> <F>           <Ctrl> <PrtSc>

Additionally, the following keys have special meanings:
<Shift><PrtSc> will cause whatever is displayed on the monitor to print on the printer. If this special
                      MS-DOS command is entered from the keyboard, the printer form alignment will
                      probably need to be readjusted.
<Alt>                 should never be depressed.
<Ctrl>                should only be depressed in conjunction with another key when this option is
                      available from a specific function.
<NumLock>             alternates the function of the numeric keypad between numeric entry and cursor
                      control. This can change the function of the <Left> and <Right> arrow keys, the
                      <Up> and <Down> arrow keys, and the <Home> and <End> keys, and the
                      <Ins> and <Del> keys.


2.3. System Capacity

       FLIPS will store a maximum of 500 flight plans. If the flight plan database is full (500 flight
plans), the flight plan count will be displayed in red (FP = 500). Function key <F1> <A>, <B>, <C>,
and <D> are not available when the flight plan database is full.

       FLIPS will store a maximum of 100 training strips. If the training database is full (100 training
strips), the message "<<== THE TRAINING DATABASE IS FULL - HIT ANY KEY TO
CONTINUE ==>>" will be displayed. No more training strips can be entered.

     If the training database is empty, only the menu items <A> and <E> are available in the Training
Menu. Selecting any other options from the menu will display the message "<<== THIS OPTION IS
NOT AVAILABLE - HIT ANY KEY TO CONTINUE ==>>".

      The position time option will allow a maximum of 99 controllers to be entered. Each controller
can have up to 25 positions to receive time in.

     If the position time database is full (99 controllers), the message "<<== THIS DATABASE IS
FULL - HIT ANY KEY TO CONTINUE ==>>" will be displayed in the middle of the monitor. No
more controllers can be entered.

      If the position time database is empty, only the menu items <A>, <F>, and <H> are available on
the Position Time Menu. Selecting any other options from the menu will display the message "<<==
THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE - HIT ANY KEY TO CONTINUE ==>>".
12                                                                           AT-G-15, 1 August 2000



      The airport data option will allow a maximum of 45 airports to be entered. Each airport can
receive information on up to 10 runways.

     If the airport database is full (45 airports), a message "<<== THIS DATABASE IS FULL -
HIT ANY KEY TO CONTINUE ==>>" will be displayed. No more airports can be entered.

      If the airport database is empty, only the menu items <A>, <E>, and <F> are available on the
Airport Data Menu. Selecting any other options from the menu will display the message "<<== THIS
OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE - HIT ANY KEY TO CONTINUE ==>>".


2.4. Power Failure Recovery

      FLIPS is designed to reinitialize upon recovery from a power failure. At worst, data entered or
received during the last 30 seconds prior to power failure could be lost. The operational program will
automatically reload any critical data. The configuration data will also be reloaded once the system
power is restored. Any flight plan(s) in the database that are within the flight plan output time will be
printed if they were not already printed prior to power loss. Any flight plans that are outside the delete
time parameter will be deleted. Currently signed-in Automatic Position Time entries will remain
signed-in upon power restoration.

4. FACILITY RESPONSIBILITIES


4.1. FLIPS Program Disks

      Each FLIPS equipped facility will receive two identical 3.5” floppy diskettes containing the
FLIPS operational program. The files from either of the diskettes must be copied onto the hard disk
and then the program initialized (follow the instructions included with each release of the software).
Remember the general rules for storing software:

      Never touch the diskette's magnetic media.
      Store between 50 and 125 degrees Fahrenheit
      Never allow software near a magnetic source, including telephone ringers.


4.2. Implementation

     The documentation sent with each release of the operational program will contain instructions on
how and when to implement the new release.

4.2.1. Program Changes and Corrections

      Any suggested changes or corrections should be forwarded to ESC OL-DE via letter, e-mail or
telephone. The address and phone numbers are:

       ESC OL-DE/GA
       3580 D AVENUE
       BUILDING 201WEST
       TINKER AFB, OK 73145-9155

       DSN : 884-7004
       COMM : (405) 734-7004

       E-Mail: atcals@tinker.af.mil

4.2.2. Replacements

       It is suggested that the Owner/User Manuals for the personal computer, the color monitor, and
the printer be stored near FLIPS for operator use.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                              17


4.4. Facility Management

        As a suggestion to ensure facility standardization some items should be considered for control by
facility management. The items to be controlled should be locked from the <F3> MANAGE option.

The following items should be considered:

      1. Stereo Templates

            A. Naming conventions
            B. Location in stereo list
            C. Required Information

      2. Beacon Code Blocks

      3. Delete Time

      4. Print Time

      5. Airport Data

      Items 1-4 are located in the <F10> CONFIG option and item 5 is located in the <F2>
SAT_DATA option. If they are locked, they can only be accessed through the <F3> MANAGE
option.

5. EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION


5.1. Computer

     A 486 personal computer, one 3-½ inch 1.44MB Floppy Drive, one hard drive, and the
Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS version 3.2 or greater) are required.


5.2. Monitor

       A color monitor is required. The monitor will display a Flight Strip Working Area at the top of
the screen that resembles a flight progress strip. The lower half of the screen contains prompts and
assistance. The left side of the screen displays the system time and the right side displays the number of
flight plans in the database. The bottom line of the screen displays abbreviated descriptions of what
each available function key performs.


5.3. Printer

        An ALPS P2000G, or an Epson-compatible printer that can effectively print on flight progress
strips, is required. It is strongly recommended that the printer have "push" style tractor feeds.


5.4. Interface Connection

       FLIPS will be connected to the PIDP processor with an RS-232 synchronous serial interface.
FLIPS and PIDP will exchange Local and Japanese ACC formatted flight plan data messages as
required to keep the PIDP flight plan database updated. FLIPS will not be interfaced with the NAS or
the Japanese ACC. For Automated Position Time to function properly PIDP and FLIPS need to be
interfaced.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                          19



6. NORMAL OPERATIONS


6.1. Initialization

       The program is loaded from the hard disk after being copied from a floppy diskette. Specific
system installation instructions are included in Chapter 9 - INSTALLATION. After the program is
loaded, the monitor will display the FLIPS Main Menu. The menu contains the current time, the number
of flight plans in storage, and the following function keys (see Figure 6-1, “FLIPS Main Menu”):

6.2. FLIPS/PIDP Interface

       FLIPS and PIDP are connected by an interface designed to pass flight plans and related
messages between the systems. All messages concerning the movement of aircraft in the local area and
not serviced by the PIDP/NAS or PIDP/Japanese ACC interface will be handled by FLIPS. Certain
functions in the FLIPS program will be changed whenever the interface is up.

        When the interface is down, a flag will be displayed. A red box will appear below the flight plan
counter with the letters PF (see Figure 6-2, Systems Messages”). This indicates that the interface is
down and will only be deleted when a message comes in from PIDP. FLIPS will operate normally if
this flag is displayed, with no restrictions

       When the interface is up, flight plans will be sent to PIDP when the current time is within 15
minutes of the flight plan activation time. PIDP will respond with an appropriate message to tell FLIPS
of the flight plans status in the system. FLIPS ability to amend or cancel flight plans will be determined
by the status assigned to the flight plan by PIDP. Also while the interface is up Position Time sign-ins
and sign-outs can be sent from PIDP to FLIPS. Any restrictions to these functions will be discussed in
the appropriate sections of this manual.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                                 21



       When a flight plan is sent to PIDP over the interface, a return message is sent. Flight plans will be
assigned a status based on this message. A status of (FL) indicates that the flight plan has not been sent
to PIDP. Data Accept (DA) means the flight plan was sent to PIDP and it is in the system. Data
Reject (DR) indicates that the flight plan was rejected by PIDP and it should be checked for duplicates
or errors. A DR message may also be sent if the PIDP database is full. If a DR is received, the flight
plan will not be retransmitted. Data Retransmit (DX) also shows that the flight plan was rejected by
PIDP. However, FLIPS will attempt to send it over the interface once more. If it is not accepted the
second time, it will not be sent again. A Departure Message (DM) is sent by PIDP when a flight plan in
the system is activated and a tracked target is assigned to it.

       All messages from PIDP contain the current PIDP system time. FLIPS will automatically update
its system time to match the time in the message. If a wrong time is entered, the first test message that
FLIPS receives will reset the FLIPS time to the incorrect time. This could cause flight plans that are not
ready for transmission to PIDP to be dumped into the system. It can also cause FLIPS to delete flight
plans in the database and move some to yesterday or tomorrow. Care should be taken when updating
the PIDP system time.

       Japanese flight plans will be assigned a computer identification number called the JCID. The
JCID is located on the strip next to the CID. The JCID is on the strip for coordination purposes only.
It can not be used for a flight plan search.

6.3. Duplicate ACID and Discrete Beacon Codes

       FLIPS permits the entry of a flight plan having a callsign or a discrete beacon code that duplicates
this data in an existing flight plan, but only under certain specific conditions. Two aircraft may have the
same beacon code only if one flight plan is an arrival and the other is a departure and one of the aircraft
is being tracked by PIDP with a DM message having been sent from PIDP to FLIPS. Three aircraft
may have the same callsign if one aircraft is an arrival, the other two are departures (the two departures
must also have different departure airports) and any one of the three aircraft is being tracked by PIDP
with a DM message having been sent from PIDP to FLIPS. Other than the above noted exceptions, a
flight plan having duplicate data will only be accepted if its total active time period does not overlap the
total active time period of an existing flight plan. The active time period for a single leg flight plan is from
the flight plan's activation time minus the system Flight Plan Delete Time to the flight plan's activation
time plus the system Flight Plan Delete Time. The active time period for a stereo flight plan composed
of two legs (actually two separate flight plans) extends from the activation time of the first leg minus the
system Flight Plan Delete Time to the activation time of the second leg plus the system Flight Plan Delete
Time. For example, if an existing flight plan is not composed of two legs and has an activation time of
1330 and the system Flight Plan Delete Time parameter is set for 90 minutes, then this flight plan's active
time period is from 1200 to 1500. A new flight plan having a duplicate callsign or discrete beacon code
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                               23


will not be accepted if any part of its active time period falls between 1200 and 1500 (unless it falls
under the exceptions noted at the beginning of this section.)

      An attempted entry of a new flight plan containing an illegal duplicate callsign or discrete beacon
code (that does not meet the specific conditions in the paragraph above) will result in a system error
message identifying the existing flight plan by CID. The illegal duplicate condition must be resolved
before the system will accept the new flight plan.

      If a duplicate flight plan is received from the PIDP interface, and it falls within the same time
period as a flight plan within FLIPS, then FLIPS will delete the duplicate in the database and insert the
PIDP flight plan (unless it is one of the exceptions for beacon code and callsign noted in the first
paragraph of this section).


6.4. FDS Functionality

6.4.1. Description

       The FDS functionality allows the use of FDS type keyboard inputs to be used in FLIPS. It is an
alternative to using the function keys and menus method of FLIPS. This option is selected by entering
the same keystrokes as the message format for FDS. When the first alphanumeric key is typed, FLIPS
enters the FDS mode. A space is used as a field separator when entering an FDS type message. A
window of four blank lines is opened up in the menu window of the display (see Figure 6-3, “FDS
Functionality”). Japanese flight plans can not be entered or amended from FLIPS.

6.4.2. Message Formats

The available message formats for this function are as follows:

            FP - Flight Plan
            AM - Amendment
            RS - Remove Strip
            SR - Strip Request
            RF - Forces a flight plan into the PIDP database
            RB - Retransmit database to PIDP

6.4.2.1. Flight Plan (FP) Messages

      A Flight Plan (FP) message is used to enter and store the initial flight plan data in the computer.
The FP must include the following information: ACID, type, coordination fix, time, altitude, and the
route data. Beacon code and remarks are optional.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                                  25


The time field requires a “P” for proposed flight plans, an “A” for arrivals, or an “E” for en route. These
characters tell FLIPS what type of flight plan is being entered and must proceed the time. If the time
field consists of only a letter then the current time will be used. Since a space is required between fields,
the flight plan is validated first and then entered into the database. The new flight plan will then be
displayed in the strip window. A beacon code block may be used in place of a beacon code.

Example and format of FP message:

*NOTE: Only one space allowed between each field. Above shows more spaces for readability.

6.4.2.2. Amendment (AM) Messages

      An Amendment Message (AM) is used to modify previously entered flight plan data. It must
contain a message type designator; ACID, CID, or beacon code; field reference (number or
abbreviation), and the data to be entered. Flight plans that have been flagged as Departure Messages
(DM) from PIDP cannot be amended. NOTE: Japanese flight plans cannot be amended.

     Flight Plan amendments result in a one-for-one field substitution. The flight plan is then validated
and entered in the database with the revision number being incremented. A space must be entered
between the message type, field references and revised data.

      Field reference numbers:

      When amending stereo flight plans with multiple first or second legs, the opportunity will be given
to make amendments to these additional legs.

6.4.2.3. Remove Strip (RS) Messages

      The Remove Strip (RS) message is used to delete flight plan data for the flight specified. The
message consists of the message type designator and identification of the specified stored flight plan to
be canceled. A flight plan that has been flagged as a Departure Message (DM) by PIDP cannot be
deleted.

6.4.2.4. Strip Request (SR) Messages

       The Strip Request (SR) message is used to request the printing (or reprinting) of a flight progress
strip. The message consists of the message type designator and the ACID, CID number, or beacon
code.

6.4.2.5. Request Transfer (RF) Messages

       The Request Transfer (RF) message causes the transmission or retransmission of flight plan data
to the PIDP computer system regardless of the scheduled time for transmission. This message is also
used to force a flight plan back into the PIDP system if it has been dropped out. The message contains
the message type designator and ACID, CID, or beacon code.

6.4.2.6. Retransmit Database (RB) Messages

      The Retransmit Database (RB) message is used to retransmit the complete current flight plan
database to PIDP, usually after a PIDP failure. The RB message contains a message type designator.


6.5. Add Flight Plan

<F1> FLT_PLAN

6.5.1. General Instructions for Departures, Arrivals, and Overflights

       The Add Flight Plan Menu is displayed after selecting <F1> from the FLIPS Main Menu. This
menu allows the controller to enter the desired flight plan type. The controller can enter <A>
Departure, <B> Arrival, <C> Overflight, <D> Stereo, or <E> Training Flight Plans. The menu to add
a flight plan is displayed after selecting the letter for the appropriate type flight plan from the Add Flight
Plan Menu. The flight strip working area is unique to the type of flight plan selected. As data is entered,
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                                    27


it will be displayed in the appropriate field of the flight strip work area (see Figure 6-4, “Add Departure
Training Main Menu”). Each field will be highlighted on the menu while data is being entered. A
flashing cursor indicates the current character position. Corrections may be performed before the
completed flight plan is entered. The special keys used for editing can be found in Section 7.1., Editing
Commands. Spaces are permitted for data separation in the remarks and route of flight fields by using
the right arrow key. Each data field will be checked, as appropriate, for validity. The ACID and

6.5.1.1. Aircraft ID (ACID)

      Entries must be 2 - 7 alphanumeric characters with the first character being alphabetic. Spaces
are not permitted and all data entered beyond 7 characters will be ignored. Duplicate ACIDs are not
allowed unless their active times do not overlap. If no ACID is entered or there is an invalid entry, an
error message will be displayed. A valid ACID must be entered before the system will allow the
controller to move to any other data field. Pressing the <Enter> key saves the flight plan.

6.5.1.2. Aircraft Type

      Up to 11 characters may be entered to identify the number of aircraft in a flight, the class, the
type, and the equipment suffix. This data will be in 'free-form' format and will not be checked for
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                                    29


validity. However, flight plans sent to PIDP are validated and will be rejected if errors are found. The
equipment suffix and the number of aircraft will only be stored in FLIPS. Dashes are NOT allowed in
the AIRCRAFT TYPE.

6.5.1.3. Beacon Code

     The controller has the option to manually enter a beacon code, allow the system to auto assign a
beacon code, or leave the beacon code field blank.

       During flight plan entry, the controller may select A through H for auto beacon code assignment.
The beacon code will be auto assigned immediately before the strip is printed (either manual or auto
print). If all beacon codes have been allocated from the code block selected during flight plan entry, the
system will set the beacon code field to blanks. Additionally, a system message will be output to the
printer when all beacon codes from a predefined block are in use. If the controller selects a letter (A -
H) that has not been predefined an error message will be displayed on the monitor.

      Beacon codes are manually assigned by entering the four numbers (0000 - 7777). An error
message is displayed on the monitor when an invalid or duplicate beacon code is entered. Beacon
codes 1236, 7500, 7600, and 7700 are restricted from use.

      The controller may space through the beacon code field during flight plan entry. This will result in
the beacon code field being blank when the strip is printed.

6.5.1.4. Time

        Time consists of four numeric characters, whether the time field is a Proposed Departure Time or
an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at the Coordination Fix. The system automatically generates a "P"
for departure flight plans, an "A" for arrival flight plans, or an "E" for overflight flight plans in the first
character position of the time field. Spacing past the field or entering the flight plan before reaching the
time field (no time input) will result in the current system time being entered as the activation time when
the flight plan is saved.

      If the time entered is one minute less than the current time, the flight plan will be considered
tomorrow's flight plan. If the flight plan is sent from PIDP, the activation time can be up to 59 minutes
before current time and still be considered today's flight plan.

6.5.1.5. Airport/Fix

       The Departure Airport field on a departure flight plan and the Destination Airport on an arrival
flight plan may contain a maximum of 5 alphanumeric characters. Spaces are not permitted.
30                                                                          AT-G-15, 1 August 2000


       Arrivals and overflights may contain a maximum of 12 characters in the Previous Fix, the
Coordination Fix, and the Coordination Indicator fields. This data will be in 'free-form' format and will
not be checked for validity. Spaces are permitted. Only the first three characters of the Airport/Fix
fields will be sent to PIDP.

6.5.1.6. Altitude

      A maximum of 7 characters may be entered in the Altitude field. The first 3 characters must be
alphanumeric and the last 4 may contain spaces and special characters.

6.5.1.7. Route of Flight

Departure

       A maximum of 52 characters (2 lines of 26 characters each) may be entered for a departure flight
plan. This data will be entered 'free-form' and will not be checked for format or correctness (fix
identifier validation, logical routings, etc.). Spaces may be inserted between data items by using the
<Right Arrow> key. As characters are entered, FLIPS automatically moves the cursor to the second
line when the end of the first line is reached.

Overflight

       A maximum of 40 characters (one line of 14 characters and a second line of 26 characters) may
be entered for overflight flight plans. This data will be entered 'free-form' and will not be checked for
format or correctness (fix identifier validation, logical routings, etc.). Spaces may be inserted between
data items by using the <Right Arrow> key. As characters are entered, FLIPS automatically moves
the cursor to the second line when the end of the first line is reached.

6.5.1.8. Remarks

Departure and Overflights

     A maximum of 26 characters (1 line) may be entered in 'free-form'. Spaces may be inserted
between data items by using the <Right Arrow> key.

Arrival

      A maximum of 54 characters on 3 lines may be entered in 'free-form' (first line holds 14
characters, second line holds 26, and the third line holds 14). Spaces may be inserted between data
items by using the <Right Arrow> key. As characters are entered, FLIPS automatically moves the
cursor to a new line when the end of the current line is reached.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                                 31


6.5.1.9. Blocks 10 - 18

        A maximum of 36 characters (three lines of 12 characters) may be entered in ‘free-form’ in
blocks 10 through 18 of the arrival, the departure and the overflight flight strips. Spaces may be
inserted between data items by using the <Right Arrow> key. When the controller reaches the end of
a line, the <Down Arrow> key will be used to move to the next available line.

6.5.2. Stereo Flight Plans

<F1> <D> STEREO

      The controller selects the stereo flight plan mode by pressing <F1> from the FLIPS Main Menu
and then <D> from the Flight Plan Menu. If no stereo routes were entered from the configuration
mode, a blank Stereo Menu will be displayed. Press <Esc> to return to the FLIPS Main Menu.
Stereo flight plan templates must be entered through <F3> MANAGE, if the stereo flight plan options is
locked, or <F10> CONFIG.

6.5.2.1. Single Leg Routes

       After selecting <F1> from the FLIPS Main Menu and <D> Stereo from the Flight Plan Menu,
the controller is prompted to select the stereo alpha character <A - T>. <Space> will display another
set of 20 stereo templates, if any are defined, and <Esc> will return the controller to the Flight Plan
Menu. If the stereo route selected has one leg, it will be displayed in the flight strip work area. Enter
additional information as needed, then press <Enter> to save the flight plan or <Esc> to exit. After the
flight plan is saved, the selected stereo flight plan template will be redisplayed in the flight strip work
area. The controller may now create additional strips as needed by following the prompts. The flight
plans are checked for duplicate ACID and Beacon Code entries. If an activation time is not entered,
the current time will be used as the activation time. Pressing <Esc> abandons an entry and returns to
the Create Strip(s) Menu.

6.5.2.2. Two Legged Routes

       If the stereo template selected has two legs, the Create Strip(S) Menu will be displayed (see
Figure 6-5, “Create Strip(s) Menu”). The controller has the option of creating multiple strips for the first
leg, the second leg, or both legs of the stereo flight plan.

<A> First Leg

       When choice <A> Create Strip(s) for 1st leg is selected, the controller can create one or more
strips for the first leg of the stereo route.

      The flight plan template for the first leg is displayed in the flight strip work area. The controller
can then edit the template using the standard editing procedures explained in section 7.1., Editing
Commands.

     If an activation time is not entered, the current system time will be used as the activation time.
None of the data will be transferred to the second leg. Only the first leg will be added to the database.

       Pressing the <Enter> key saves the flight plan. After the flight plan is saved, the first leg of the
selected stereo flight plan template will be redisplayed in the flight strip work area. The controller can
create additional strips as needed by following the prompts. The flight plans are checked for duplicate
ACID and Beacon Code entries. Pressing <Esc> abandons an entry and returns to the Create Strip(s)
Menu.

<B> Second Leg

       When choice <B> Create Strip(s) for 2nd leg is selected, the controller can create one or more
strips for the second leg of the stereo route.

      The stereo flight plan template for the second leg is displayed in the flight strip work area. The
controller can then edit the template using the standard editing procedures explained in section 7.1.,
Editing Commands.

       Only the second leg will be inserted in the database when <Enter> is pressed. After the flight
plan is saved the selected stereo flight plan template will be redisplayed in the flight strip work area. The
controller can create additional strips as needed by following the prompts. The flight plans are checked
for duplicate ACID and Beacon Code entries. Pressing <Esc> abandons an entry and returns to the
Create Strip(s) Menu.

<C> Both Legs

       When choice <C> Create strip(s) for both legs is selected, the controller can create one or more
strips for both legs of the stereo route. Option <C> is not available if the second leg of the template has
an undefined Beacon Code Block in the beacon field.

      The stereo flight plan template for the first leg is displayed in the flight strip work area. The
controller can then edit the template using the standard editing procedures explained in section 7.1,
Editing Commands.

        The ACID will automatically be transferred to the second segment of the stereo flight plan. The
second leg activation time is automatically assigned based on the offset time selected when the template
was created. Each leg of the flight will be assigned a separate CID number. Additionally, the flight plan
counter will be incremented by two when a stereo flight plan with two legs is entered. The beacon code
will be carried over to the second leg if a “#” sign was entered into the beacon code field of the second
leg flight plan when the stereo flight plan was created in <F10>.

      When <Enter> is pressed, the 2nd Leg Aircraft Type Menu is displayed. If the first leg Aircraft
Type was amended, the second leg will contain the new Aircraft Type. Enter any change to the second
leg Aircraft Type and then press <Enter>. The first leg template will be redisplayed. The first leg
template will also be redisplayed if <Esc> was pressed.

      Press <Esc> when done creating strips for both legs. After the <Esc> key is pressed, the
Additional Strips Menu is displayed prompting the controller to create additional strips for the first or
second leg (see Figure 6-6, “Additional Strip(s) Menu” ). If the first leg is chosen, the controller can
enter as many first leg strips as needed. If the second leg is chosen, the controller can enter as many

strips from the selected file will be put into the training database. If a file is not compatible with the
FLIPS version then an attempt will be made to convert the file. If the file can be converted, it will be
loaded. After a successful load, the Training Menu is displayed.

6.5.3.2. <B> Scroll File

       Upon selecting this option, the flight strip work area is displayed along with the first training strip
in the scenario. The first and last strips are identified by a message in the scroll menu. <Space>
advances to the next strip and <Backspace> moves back to the previous strip. The displayed strip
can be amended, printed or deleted while in the scroll mode. <F9> can be pressed to advance strips
on the printer. Pressing <A> allows the controller to create a new strip and insert it in the training
database after the strip that is being displayed. Pressing <B> inserts the new strip before the strip that
is being displayed. Press <Esc> to exit to the Training Main Menu.

6.5.3.3. <C> Save File

       The controller has the option to save the current training scenario to the current drive for later use.
Ensure the diskette is formatted (MS DOS version 3.2 or later) and not write protected before an
attempt is made to write to the diskette. Upon selecting choice <C> Save File from the Training Main
Menu, a menu will be displayed allowing the controller to change the drive to save to. When the
controller has selected a drive, <Esc> should be pressed to continue (if C drive was selected, a menu
will be displayed to enter or change the password or continue with the save. The password feature is
included here to prevent accidentally deleting the training strips on C drive). After selecting a drive and
entering the password, if required, a directory will be displayed with only the files that contain training
strips (filenames with a .TNG extension). The first file will be highlighted and the <Up Arrow> and
<Down Arrow> keys will move the highlighted box from one filename to another. If more than one
page of filenames exist, the <Space> and <Backspace> keys will move the directory forward and
backward. Positioning the highlighted box over a filename and pressing the <Enter> key will select that
filename. A filename can be entered manually by typing the filename from the keyboard. The first key
entered will cause the directory to disappear. The filename must be 1-8 alphanumeric characters
(extensions will automatically be added to the filename). After a successful save, the Training Main
Menu is displayed.

      Upon selecting this option, the controller is given the opportunity to delete the current training
scenario from memory. If <Y> is pressed, the scenario is deleted. After a successful deletion, the
Training Main Menu displayed.

6.5.3.5. <E> Create File

       Upon selecting this option, the controller will be allowed to enter training strips. If a training
database is currently loaded, it will be deleted before the controller can input new training strips. Each
strip can be entered in 'free form' format on 3 lines by 68 characters within the limits of the acceptable
FLIPS character set. A <Space> advances to the next line and<Backspace> backs up to the previous
line. Pressing <Enter> will save the strip and allow you to enter another strip, if needed. Press <Esc>
to exit to the Training Main Menu without saving the current strip.

6.5.3.6. <F> Append Current File

       Upon selecting this option, the controller will be allowed to enter additional strips into the current
training database. The training strips will be appended to the end of the training database. Each strip
can be entered in 'free form' format on 3 lines by 68 characters within the limits of the acceptable FLIPS
character set. A <Space> advances to the next line and<Backspace> backs up to the previous line.
Pressing <Enter> will save the strip and allow you to enter another strip, if needed. Press <Esc> to
exit to the Training Main Menu without saving the current strip.

6.5.3.7. <G> Print Options

       Upon selecting this option, a menu will appear prompting the controller to enter <A> to print the
entire training scenario, <B> to print a randomly generated scenario, or <C> to print and transmit a
random scenario. When either of the random scenario options are selected, the controller is asked how
many strips are wanted for the scenario. Any number from one to the number of training strips in the
current training database may be entered. The controller will be prompted for the number of copies of
the scenario to be printed. The number of strips chosen will be printed for each copy. The print feature
of the training scroll function may be used to print individual strips. Press <Esc> to exit to the Training
Main Menu.

6.6. Airport Data

<F2> SAT_DATA

6.6.1. General Information

      Pressing <F2> from the FLIPS Main Menu will put the controller in the airport and fix data
option. The controller will then be able to choose airport or fix editing. This option can also be locked
through <F3> MANAGE. If it is locked, you still have the option to view the data. Until this option is
unlocked, changes can only be made through <F3> MANAGE - <C> Change Configuration Options.

        The controller may enter information on primary and surrounding airports and fixes. Each airport
will contain information about the airport and on all of its runways. Each airport, runway, and fix may
be edited to change the information previously stored. The airport and fix data information may be
saved by choosing the save or build option. You can use A, B, or C drive and read it back in at a later
date. All the airport and fix data information may be printed in a report form. The controller may delete
all fixes, a single fix, all the airports, a single airport, or a single runway from an airport. There will be an
airport counter (APT) located below the FLIPS flight plan counter (FP).

      Airport and fix data information can be sent to the PIDP computer when requested. This
information will be contained in PIDP_LINE1 and PIDP_LINE2. Each line can hold up to 20
characters. FLIPS can respond to satellite airport data messages and satellite fix data messages from
PIDP. The airport identifier can be used for a specific airport or the bearing and distance can be used
to find the closest airport. Indicating the minimum acceptable runway length can also modify this
request, if required. The fix identifier can be used for a specific fix.

6.6.2. <A> Load File

       The controller has the option to load a previously saved airport database from the selected drive
into the active airport database. Upon selecting choice <A>, a menu will be displayed to allow the
controller to change the drive to load from. When the controller is ready to continue, the <Esc> key
should be pressed. A directory of the current drive will be displayed with only the files that airport data
can use (filenames with a .APD extension). The first file will be highlighted and the <Up Arrow> and
<Down Arrow> keys will move the highlighted box from one filename to another. If more than one
page of filenames exist, the <Space> and <Backspace> keys will move the directory forward and
backward. Positioning the highlighted box over a filename and pressing the <Enter> key will select that
filename. A filename can be entered manually by typing the filename from the keyboard. The first key
entered will cause the directory to disappear. The filename must be 1 - 8 alphanumeric characters
(extensions will automatically be added to the filename). If a good file is loaded, any airport data
previously in the system will be deleted and the airport data from the file will be put into the airport
database. If a file is not compatible with the current FLIPS version then an attempt will be made to

convert the file. If the file can be converted it will be loaded. After a successful load is completed, the
Airport Data Menu will be displayed again.

6.6.3. <B> Edit File

     Upon entering <B> Edit File option, the controller will be asked to enter <A> edit airport or
<B> edit fix.

6.6.3.1. <A> Edit Airport

       The controller will be asked for the airport ID to edit. The controller will then be prompted to
enter <A> for airport or <R> for runway. The appropriate information will be displayed to edit. If
airport information is chosen, the selected airport information will be displayed. The controller can then
edit the airport (see Figure 6-8, “Airport Data - Edit Airport”). If runway information is chosen, the
runway names will be displayed. The controller will need to enter a runway name so they can edit it.
<Space> advances to the next field and <Backspace> backs up to the previous field. Press <Enter>
to save the information or press <Esc> to exit this option without saving.

6.8. Position Time

<F4> TIME

       The controller may maintain proficiency/training times on all the controllers in the facility. Each
controller will have the positions that they are proficient in and/or training in typed in FLIPS so they can
be edited. Position times can be loaded from the current drive or saved to the current drive and read
back in again at a later date. The controller can sign in and sign out at the PIDP Indicator Position (See
PIDP operators manual) that will allow FLIPS to keep an automated position time. Controllers and
positions must already be entered into FLIPS for the automated position time to function. A number of
reports can be generated on position times. The controller may delete all the controllers in a facility, all
the controllers on a specific crew, a certain controller, or a position from a certain controller. Pressing
<F4> from the FLIPS Main Menu will enter the position time option. There will be a person counter
(PER), located below the FLIPS flight plan counter (FP), that displays the number of controllers loaded
into FLIPS.

6.8.1. <A> Load File

        The controller has the option to load a previously saved position time database from the selected
drive into the active position time database. Upon selecting choice <A>, a menu will be displayed to
allow the controller to change the drive to load from. When the controller is ready to continue, the
<Esc> key should be pressed. A directory of the current drive will be displayed with only the files that
position time can use (filenames with a .PTD extension). The first file will be highlighted and the <Up
Arrow> and <Down Arrow> keys will move the highlighted box from one filename to another. If more
than one page of filenames exist, the <Space> and <Backspace> keys will move the directory forward
and backward. Positioning the highlighted box over a filename and pressing the <Enter> key will select
that filename. A filename can be entered manually by typing the filename from the keyboard. The first
key entered will cause the directory to disappear. The filename must be 1 - 8 alphanumeric characters
(extensions will automatically be added to the filename). If a good file is loaded, any position times
previously in the system will be deleted and the position times from the file will be put in the position time
database. If a file is not compatible with the FLIPS version, an attempt will be made to convert the file.
If the file can be converted, it will be loaded. After a successful load is completed, the Position Time
Menu will be displayed.

6.8.2. <B> Enter Position Time

       The controller has the option of entering proficiency/training times from the position logs. To have
proficiency/training times updated, the controller is asked to enter the position and then the start time,
the initials, and the stop time. The program will calculate the amount of time accumulated and add it to
the position time for that controller. If a controller is receiving training time, the first set of initials is the
trainees and the second set is the trainers. If the total amount of time a controller has in position is
known, the total can be entered in the start/min time. The range is 1 to 999 and only one set of initials
are entered. The time entered will then be added to the position time for that controller. This process
can be done for all positions (see Figure 6-13, “Edit Position Time Log”). Also the log file is updated
every time position time is edited or when a controller signs in at a position using the Automated Position
Time Function.

The controller is asked to enter a crew name. Once done, the controller is asked if they are sure they
want to reset all of the crew information. If <Y> is pressed, positions containing proficiency times will
reset to zero. Training times will not be reset. Upon completion of the reset, the Position Time Menu
will be displayed.


6.9. Amend Flight Plan

<F5> AMEND

       The Amend Flight Plan Mode is selected by pressing <F5>. The controller is prompted for the
ACID, discrete beacon code, or Computer ID (CID) of the flight plan to be amended. The selected
flight plan is then displayed in the flight strip work area. The controller can not amend a flight plan if it is
flagged as a Departure Message (DM), if the second leg is selected and the first leg is a (DM), or if it is
a Japanese flight plan. The edit procedures used to amend flight plans are the same as those listed in the
Section 7.1., Editing Commands. Error messages are provided for no match or invalid entries. If more
than one flight plan exists with the same identifier, the duplicate flight plan information will be displayed
below the flight strip work area, sorted by the activation time. The controller may select the specific
flight plan desired by the CID number. If a CID is entered that is not in the list of duplicate flight plans,
an error message will be displayed. When a valid CID is entered, the appropriate flight plan will be
displayed in the flight strip work area for modification.

      If the first leg aircraft type is amended and <Enter> is pressed, a menu is displayed prompting
the controller to change the second leg aircraft type. If the second leg aircraft type was amended, the
menu will prompt for a change to the first leg aircraft type.

       If the Interface is up, flight plans can be amended in both systems if the flight plan does not have a
status message of DM or is a Japanese flight plan. When the flight plan to be amended is a Data
Accept (DA) or the second leg is amended and the first leg is a (DA), an amendment message is
generated and sent to PIDP. Even though all the amended fields will be displayed in FLIPS, only
certain fields can be sent across the interface. All flight plans will send amendments for the ACID, the
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                              55


aircraft type, the beacon code, and the time. Additionally, Departure flight plans can send an amended
departure airport, Arrival flight plans can send amendments for coordination fixes and arrival airports,
and En Route flight plans can send amendments for coordination fixes and coordination indicators.

NOTE: The beacon code must be changed in both legs of a stereo flight plan, if it needs to be changed.
The beacon code is only carried over to the second leg by the program the first time the flight plan is
entered. If the beacon code must be changed after the flight plan has been entered, it must be manually
changed in both legs.

       The <Enter> key is used to save amended flight plans. The revision number is automatically
updated. The <Esc> key is used to abort the change. Amended flight strips will be printed immediately
if they were printed previously.


       If a flight plan with additional legs is amended, a menu will be displayed showing the additional
strips. Amendments can then be done to the additional strips (see Figure 6-16 “Amend Additional
Strips”).

      Note: The system will compute revision numbers and print them on flight progress strips, up to
the ninth revision. After revision number nine, the flight plan can be amended but the strip revision
number will not be incremented.


6.10. Print Flight Plan

<F6> PRINT

       The Print Flight Plan mode is selected by pressing <F6> from the FLIPS Main Menu. Individual
strips can be selected for printing from this menu by entering the CID, the ACID, or the beacon code.
Additional options available are: print the entire active flight plan database, quit a print, form feed, or
print a canned strip to align the printer.

6.10.1. Manual Print Request

       Individual flight plans can be printed at the controller’s request by selecting the <F6> function
key. Bulk printing of all flight plans in the database is also available. The controller may request a
specific flight plan by using the ACID, the beacon code, or the CID of the flight plan. If the flight plan is
not found, an error message will be displayed and the controller given the opportunity to select and print
another flight plan or exit the print mode. If more than one flight plan exists with the same identifier, the
duplicate flight plan information will be displayed below the strip template, sorted by activation time.
After the controller selects the specific flight plan desired, it will be printed and displayed in the flight
strip work area. Additional flight plans may be identified and printed until the <Esc> key is pressed
exiting the print mode.

Other options included are:

<Ctrl A>     - Prints all the flight plans in the system

<Ctrl B>     - Prints a block of flight plans within a range of time defined by the controller

<Ctrl Q> - Stops the printing of flight plans not yet in the print buffer

<F9>         - Form Feed advances two flight progress strips and reinitializes the printer to large
               print and short forms

<F10>        - Prints a TEST flight plan to check the alignment of the printer. If the printer is not
        aligned, the TEST strip will be used as a guide to manually align the printer

<Esc>        - Exits to FLIPS Main Menu

6.10.2. Automatic Strip Printing

      Flight plans will automatically print at a selected time parameter prior to the flight plan activation
time. The Flight Plan Printing Time parameter is the length of time prior to the flight plan activation time.
The default value is 20 minutes but can be reset from <F10> CONFIG. When the interface is up, the
output time parameter will be 15 minutes prior to activation time.

       Note: If the printer is not working, an error message will be displayed. For example, if the
printer is placed OFF-LINE for any reason and an attempt is made to print a strip (either automatically
or manually), an error message "THE PRINTER IS OFF-LINE" will be displayed. The error
message will remain displayed until the printer is placed back ON-LINE and the printer is used again
(see Figure 6-2, System Messages).


6.11. Delete Flight Plan

<F7> DELETE

       Individual flight plans are deleted automatically or by controller request. Additionally, all or some
of the flight plans in the system can be deleted by controller request.

6.11.1. Manual Flight Plan Delete

       To manually delete an individual flight plan, the controller enters the ACID, the beacon code, or
the CID of the flight plan to be deleted (see Figure 6-17, “Delete Menu”). If more than one flight plan
exists with the same identifier, the duplicate flight plan information will be displayed below the flight strip
work area, sorted by activation time. The controller may then select the specific flight plan to delete
based on the CID number. The selected flight plan is displayed in the flight strip work area and
automatically deleted with no other prompts. A Cancel message (CX) will be sent to PIDP and the
flight plan will be deleted from both systems. When the PIDP interface is up, flight plans flagged with a
Departure Message (DM) can not be deleted. An error message will be displayed if the requested flight
plan cannot be found.

      Whenever a flight plan is deleted manually or by the system, a message will be sent to the printer
displaying the ACID, the strip revision number, and the CID of the flight plan that was deleted from the
database. This message will not be printed if the print messages option has been turned off.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                                    59

      If a Stereo flight plan having two legs is manually deleted, the other leg of the stereo route will also
be deleted by this entry. If the second leg of a two-leg flight plan is selected for deletion and the first leg
has a departure message (DM), neither leg will be deleted.

        To delete all flight plans in the database, including departure messages (DM), enter <Ctrl A>
while in the <F7> Flight Plan Delete Mode. A system warning will be given requiring verification prior
to all flight plans being purged. No CX messages will be sent to PIDP. A message will be sent to the
printer that reads:

      ALL FLIGHT PLANS WERE
      DELETED FROM DATABASE
      AT => HH:MM:SS

      This message will not be printed if the print messages option has been turned off.

      The controller may delete a block of flight plans by entering <Ctrl B>. FLIPS will prompt the
controller for the starting and ending beacon codes. When entered, FLIPS will delete all flight plans
60                                                                                 AT-G-15, 1 August 2000


with beacon codes that are within the start and stop values, including all flight plans containing letters for
beacon code blocks if part of the beacon code block is within the delete block.

        If a two-leg stereo flight plan is deleted, all additional strips are also deleted. If an additional strip
is deleted, the controller will be asked to delete the single additional strip or the entire flight. If the first
leg of a two-leg stereo has been auto-deleted, the second leg becomes a single parent with additional
strips attached. If the parent is deleted, the controller will be asked to delete the single strip or the entire
flight.

6.11.2. Automatic Flight Plan Delete

       Flight plans will automatically be deleted after the Flight Plan Delete Time. The Flight Plan Delete
Time is the designated length of time after the flight plan activation time that the flight plan will be
deleted. The default time is 120 minutes but can be reset from <F10> CONFIG. If the PIDP interface
is up, the Flight Plan Delete Time is defaulted to 125 minutes. This default time can not be altered from
configuration. Only flight plans flagged as (DR) or (DX) will automatically be deleted when the interface
is up. Flight plans with the status of DM or DA will only be deleted when a delete message is sent from
PIDP. NOTE: Japanese flight plans are not automatically deleted.


       Note: Whenever a flight plan is deleted manually or by the system, a message will be sent to the
printer displaying the ACID, the strip revision number, and the CID of the flight plan that was deleted
from the database.

EXAMPLE:          REMOVE STRIPS
                  ABLE21 01 027
             * FLIGHT PLAN DELETED *

      This message will not be printed if the printer messages have been turned off. If the printer has
been OFF-LINE during the time flight plans were removed by the system, only the most recent 50 flight
plans deleted from the flight plan database will receive the "REMOVE STRIPS" message.

When a flight strip that has additional strips linked to it is deleted, a new parent is formed and all the
additional strips are re-linked. This allows the strips to be linked until they are all deleted.


6.12. Scroll

<F8> SCROLL

       Upon entering the Scroll mode, the flight strip work area is displayed along with the first flight plan
in the database. The first and last flight plans in the database are identified by a message in the Scroll
Menu. If there are no flight plans in the database, a message will be displayed in the scroll menu. The
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                                 61


controller must press <Esc> to exit. The <Space> and <Backspace> keys are used to scroll forward
and backward through the flight plan database. The flight plan database is sequenced by time. The
controller may edit, delete, or print the flight plan being viewed by pressing the appropriate function
key(s) (see Figure 6-18, “Scroll Menu”). If an additional strip is being displayed, the CID of the parent
is displayed in the right bottom corner of the strip.

<Esc>     - Exits out of Scroll to the FLIPS Main Menu.


6.13. Form Feed

<F9> FMFEED

     The controller may execute a printer "form feed" command by pressing <F9> FMFEED. Form
Feed will advance two (2) flight progress strips. The <F9> FMFEED command is constantly operative
and may be selected at any time from within the FLIPS program.

       The form feed will reinitialize the printer to large print and small forms. This is useful should the
printer be turned off and back on while FLIPS has been idle.


6.14. Configuration

<F10> CONFIG

      Selecting <F10> CONFIG allows the controller to do the following: add, view or delete beacon
code blocks; enter, delete, or edit stereo flight plan templates; rearrange the stereo template list, change
the system time and date, configure flight plan output and delete limits, load/save files from or to the
current drive, delete files from the current drive, and configure the printer. Options in Configuration can
be locked through <F3> MANAGE. If an option is locked, the "L=>" symbol will appear before the
option. If an option is locked, it may only be accessed through <F3> MANAGE - <C> Change
Configuration Options.

     Note: To save any changes or additions made in configuration, you must return to the FLIPS
Main Menu.

      The controller may add, view or delete the beacon code blocks from <F10> CONFIG or <F3>
MANAGE. The beacon code blocks are saved to the hard drive any time one of them has been
modified. If this option is locked, selecting <A> will display the current status of the beacon code
blocks A - H. No changes are allowed in the view mode.

6.14.1.1. <A> Add Beacon Code Block

       The controller may define up to 8 separate beacon code blocks in <F10> CONFIG. The
beacon code blocks will be identified as A - H. Each of the eight predefined beacon codes is initialized
to a start and stop value of 0000. The <Space> and <Backspace> keys are used to scroll through the
code blocks. Beacon code blocks cannot overlap. The beacon code stop value must be greater than
the beacon code start value. A beacon code block stop value cannot exceed 7777. Beacon codes
1236, 7500, 7600, and 7700 are restricted and cannot be used as a start or a stop value. Error
messages are displayed for invalid entries.

6.14.1.2. <B> View Beacon Code Block

       View Beacon Code Block displays the current status of the beacon code blocks. No changes
are allowed in the view mode.

6.14.1.3. <C> Delete Beacon Code Block

      Select a letter A - H to delete a previously defined beacon code block. By pressing a valid letter,
the corresponding block start and stop values are reset to 0000. If a current flight plan in the system
has a beacon code block assigned and that beacon code block is later deleted, the system will assign
blanks at print time and an error message will be sent to the printer.

6.14.2. <B> Stereo Flight Plan Routes

      The controller may add, delete, edit and rearrange stereo templates from <F3> MANAGE if the
option is locked or <F10> CONFIG if the option is unlocked.

       The controller may enter up to forty unique stereo flight plans, each of which may be composed
of one or two segments of different flight plan types (i.e., departure/arrival legs). Each stereo flight plan
is identified by a unique stereo flight plan name consisting of 1 - 7 characters. If the stereo route has
two segments, the delay or offset time between the first and second legs of the flight plan may also be
entered. The ACID and aircraft type are automatically transferred to the second segment of a two-leg
stereo flight plan when the flight plan is entered from the <F4> Stereo mode. The beacon code will be
carried over to the second segment when the first segment beacon code field is left blank and a “#” is
entered in the second segment beacon code field. There are NO required entries for a stereo template.
The controller may also delete templates, edit templates, and rearrange the stereo template list.

6.14.2.1. Add Stereo <A>, <B>, <C>

       Options Add Arrival, Add Departure and Add Overflight allow the controller to create new
stereo templates. Once selected, the controller is prompted to enter a letter <A - T> with which to
identify the stereo route, the letter must not already contain a stereo route. <Space> will display
another list of 20 stereo templates and <Esc> will return the controller to the Stereo FP Menu. After
the letter is selected, the controller is prompted to enter a unique stereo route name (see Figure 6-19,
“Stereo Route Name Menu”). After entering the stereo route name, the first leg of the stereo template
is displayed. The controller may now configure the stereo route as needed. After completing the first
leg, the controller is prompted to enter the second leg time in route. If there is a time, enter it in the
format shown. If no time is entered, the first and second leg will become active at the same time. If the
controller wants the beacon code to carry over from the first leg to the second leg of a stereo flight plan,
leave the first leg beacon code field blank and put a “#” sign in the second beacon code field. This will
cause the beacon code entered in the first leg to be transferred (“carry over”) to the second leg when a
flight plan is created using this stereo flight template. Press <Esc> for no second leg. After entering an
offset time the Add 2nd Leg Stereo Menu will be displayed. The controller is asked to choose the type
flight plan for the second leg and configure the route as needed.

       After editing of the first leg is complete on a single leg stereo template, the controller will be asked
if the one leg needs to be changed into a two leg. If a second leg is desired, the controller will edit the
new second leg template. If a second leg is not desired, the controller can hit <N> or <Esc> to return
to the Stereo FP Menu.

       After editing on the first leg of a two leg stereo template is complete, the current offset time will be
displayed with an option to change it. If <Esc> is pressed, the controller will be asked if the second leg
should be deleted. If <Y>, the stereo template second leg will be deleted. If <N> is pressed, the
Stereo FP Menu will be displayed. If the offset is changed or <N> is hit for no change, the second leg
of the stereo template will be displayed for editing. If <Enter> is pressed, the stereo template is saved.
If <Esc> is pressed, the controller will be asked if the second leg should be deleted. If <Y>, the
second leg stereo template leg is deleted. If <N> or <Esc> is pressed, the Stereo FP Menu is
displayed. When <Enter> is pressed, changes are saved. When <Esc> is pressed, previously saved
information is retained and all changes are ignored. The Stereo FP Menu is then redisplayed.

      RESTRICTIONS: The ACID, AIRCRAFT TYPE, and TIME fields of the second leg cannot
be accessed. The controller may edit other fields of the template as required.

6.14.2.4. <F> Rearrange List

       This option allows the controller to rearrange the stereo template list. When option <F> is
selected, the Stereo Rearrange Menu is displayed prompting the controller to enter the letter of the
stereo route to be moved (see Figure 6-21, “Stereo Rearrange Menu”). The first position of a move
must contain a defined stereo route. Error messages are provided as needed and invalid keys are
ignored.

       Stereo routes may be moved to any location and can also be moved between lists. <Space> will
display another list of stereo templates. If a route is moved to a location that contains another route, the
two routes swap places and the Stereo Rearrange Menu is reset for another move. Otherwise, the
route is moved to the new location and the menu is reset to accept the first letter.

       If the controller selects the first letter and presses <Esc> before pressing <Enter>, the Stereo
Rearrange Menu will be reset to accept the first letter. If the controller selects the first two letters of the
move and presses <Esc> before pressing <Enter>, the Stereo Rearrange Menu will be reset to accept
the first letter and no stereos are moved. The Stereo Rearrange Menu is also reset after the <Enter>
key is pressed. Press <Esc> before selecting the first letter to exit to the Stereo Menu.

6.14.3. <C> System Time/Date

      The system time and date are displayed with the option to change the time, the date, or both the
time and date. The time is displayed in the HHMMSS format. If the time is changed, the hours and
minutes are required entries. The "seconds" entry is optional and will default to "00" if no value is
entered. Pressing <Enter> with no changes does not change the clock. The date is displayed in the
MMDDYY format. If the date is changed, the month and day are required entries. The year entry is

optional and will not change if it isn’t entered. The <Space> and <Backspace> keys toggle between
the time and date. The time and date are changed by overwriting the old time and date. Before a time
change is accepted that might delete some or all flight plans, this message is displayed:

This time change may result in some FLIGHT PLAN DELETIONS. Enter <Y> to PROCEED
or any other key to ABORT changes.

      If <Y> is selected or there is no chance of more deletions, the new time and date will be
displayed and the clock set. The Configuration Menu will then be displayed. If <Y> was not chosen,
the change is aborted and the display returns to the Configuration Menu.

NOTE: If the PIDP Interface is up, the system time will be sent from PIDP to FLIPS every 32
seconds. The FLIPS time will use the PIDP time to refresh the clock. The clock cannot be changed
from FLIPS when the interface is up.

6.14.4. <D> Flight Plan Delete Time

       The system will automatically delete flight plans at a specified period of time after the Flight Plan
Activation Time. This time period will be entered in increments of 30 minutes with the valid range being
30 - 150 minutes. A system default value of 120 minutes will be used if no changes are made. If the
PIDP Interface is up, the delete time will default to 125 minutes. If this option is locked, selecting <D>
will display the current delete time. No changes are allowed in the view mode.

6.14.5. <E> Flight Plan Output Time

       The Flight Plan Printing Time period is the time in advance of the flight plan activation time that a
flight progress strip will be printed. This time period will be entered in increments of 10 minutes with the
valid range being 10 - 60 minutes. A system default value of 20 minutes will be used if no changes are
made. If this option is locked, selecting <E> will display the current status of the output time. No
changes are allowed in the view mode. When the interface is up, the output time is 15 minutes.

6.14.6. <F> Save Database

        The controller can save the current FLIPS database to the selected drive for later use. Ensure the
diskette is formatted (MS-DOS version 3.2 or later) and not write protected before an attempt is made
to write to the diskette. Upon selecting choice <F>, a menu will be displayed to allow the controller to
change the drive to save to. When the controller is ready to continue, the <Esc> key should be pressed
(see Figure 6-22, “Save Disk Menu”). A directory of the current drive will be displayed with only the
files that contain flight plans (filenames will be displayed with a .FLP extension). The first file will be
highlighted and the <Up Arrow> and <Down Arrow> keys will move the highlighted box from one
filename to another. If more than one page of filenames exist, the <Space> and <Backspace> keys
will move the directory forward and backward. Positioning the highlighted box over a filename and

automatically be added to the filename). Any flight plans loaded from the selected drive which duplicate
any flight plans currently in FLIPS will be rejected. If this occurs, a message will be sent to the printer
that reads "REJECT FLIGHT PLAN (ACID, BEACON, TIME)". When additional legs for a
stereo are loaded, they are relinked to the parent. If any strips time falls over 24 hours in the future, the
entire stereo flight plan with all additional strips will not be loaded. If a file is not compatible with the
FLIPS version, an attempt will be made to convert the file. If the file can be converted, it will be
loaded. Upon completion of the save, the Configuration Menu will be displayed.

6.14.8. <H> Printer Configuration

      This option allows the user to configure the printer to output only the strips or messages desired.

7. Special Operations


7.1. Editing Commands

       All editing is done using the same special keys. The following is a list of the keys and their
functions used when editing:

      Key Command              Description of Function

      <Space> or <SP>        moves forward from field to field during flight plan entry and from
                     flight plan to flight plan in <F8> SCROLL. It also will toggle
                between Stereo template lists when prompted to select a location

      <Backspace>             moves backward from field to field during flight plan entry and
                        from flight plan to flight plan in <F8> SCROLL

      <End>                    moves the cursor to the right limit of the field

      <Home>                   moves the cursor to the left limit of the field

      <Enter>                  saves changes or additions

      <Esc>                    aborts changes not "Entered" and then resets for other options or
                               continues a function

      <Up Arrow>              moves the cursor from the lower field to the right limit of the next
                        upper field in the ROUTE and REMARKS fields

      <Down Arrow>             moves the cursor from the upper field to the left limit of the next

      Note: Insert toggles OFF when the <Space> or <Backspace> key is pressed. A space may
be inserted with the <Left Arrow> and <Right Arrow> keys.

       Note: After any field is edited, all characters in the edited field are displayed in a different color
after the <Space> or <Backspace> key is pressed. If the controller spaces into the next field and
does not edit the line, the characters will be displayed in white because no editing was done.

      The following keys will not be used in the editing of "free-form" fields:

      {    }        |       ~    `


7.2. Critical Data Recording

        The FLIPS utilizes a hard drive to store critical data such as the flight plan database, stereo flight
plan routes, beacon code table, flight plan input/output parameters, and position time information. If
FLIPS loses power, all critical data that has been saved to the hard drive will be returned to the system
once power is restored. The flight plan database is saved to the hard drive twice a minute on the 15-
second and 45-second update, if it has changed. Any changes to stereo flight plan routes or to flight
plan input/output parameters are saved to the hard drive upon exit from the particular menu. Changes
to critical data that hasn’t been saved to the hard drive will not be returned to the system upon recovery
from a power failure.


7.3. Printer Set-Up

      Install the printer following the instructions in the ALPS Printer Users Manual.

7.3.1. DIP Switch Settings

printer.


8. System Messages


8.1. Content

       There are two types of system messages: error and status. Error messages are displayed in
response to an invalid keyboard entry or a warning condition and are shown in red below the strip
template. Error messages require controller action to resolve the error or warning. Status messages are
displayed to provide the controller with pertinent system information and are shown on the bottom of
the screen above the menu line or output to the printer.

8.5. Screen Windows

       The FLIPS utilizes ten primary menus and other sub-menus to display data on the monitor to
assist the controller. The FLIPS Main Menu is displayed when the system is initialized and after a
specific mode <F1> - <F10> or the FDS mode is exited.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                              93



9. INSTALLATION

      This chapter contains instructions for initial equipment configuration, installing the FLIPS
operational program, re-installing original distribution disks and testing FLIPS without installing.

       The FLIPS program will be installed in a sub-directory on C drive called FLIPS. All the data
and report files created in FLIPS that are to be saved on C drive will be sent to the FLIPS sub-
directory. <Ctrl O> will exit the FLIPS program and allow you to use another program. To re-enter
the FLIPS program type: FLIPSXXX <Enter> (XXX is the current version number). The FLIPS
program will automatically start running when the power is turned on to the computer.


9.1. Initial Equipment Configuration for FLIPS

      Equipment should be installed following the manufacturer's instructions and configured as follows:

                  The hard drive should NOT be partitioned. All MS-DOS software should be
            copied from the floppy disks to the hard drive into a sub directory called DOS.

                  During initial equipment SETUP, the system should be configured to boot from the
            hard disk drive only. The system date and time should be set to the current Zulu time, and
            the Daylight Savings Time feature should be disabled. All other options in the SETUP
            program should be defined as required by the hardware in use.

                    The Alps P2000G printer tractor feed mechanism should be setup to push the
             flight plan strips through the printer. This will reduce the number of wasted strips
      when only one or two are printed. It may prove useful to place the "tractor/friction"
      lever of the printer into the "friction" position after the strips are positioned in the
      printer. This will help prevent the strips from bunching up and clogging the printer.


9.2. Initial Installation

      This section contains instructions for implementing new versions of the FLIPS operational
program and for re-installing from the original distribution disks.

      The FLIPS operational program is distributed on a single 3½-inch floppy disk. All program
information is contained on the disk. A second duplicate disk is provided as a backup.

        Upon receiving a new operational FLIPS program, install the program to ensure your disks will
install the program correctly. If the implementation date shown in the Version Description Document is
other than "Upon Receipt" or today's date is before the implementation date, re-load the current
94                                                                                 AT-G-15, 1 August 2000


operational version by performing the operations in 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the current operational program
disk.

      Notify HQ ESC OL-D/E/TG/3S by message when the current version is implemented.

INITIAL INSTALLATION

1. Insert one of the new operational disks into A Drive of the 486 personal computer.

2. If the FLIPS program is currently running, interrupt its operation by simultaneously pressing the
   <Ctrl> and <O> keys.

3. Type the following command from the keyboard:

      A:INSTALL<Enter>

During the operation of the INSTALL function, all previous versions of the FLIPS operational program
are erased from the hard disk and the new version is placed on the hard disk. Existing data files will not
be erased unless specifically stated in the Version Description Document. When install is completed,
FLIPS should automatically begin running. All the previous databases that FLIPS was using will
automatically be converted to the new format if the convert is possible.

4. Remove the floppy disk from the computer and store it in a safe place.

5. Repeat the operations in 1, 2, 3 and 4 above for the second operational disk to ensure that it will
   load the program correctly.


9.3. Re-Installation

      If the program becomes suspect and it is necessary to re-install from the original program disks,
follow the instructions for the initial installation (See section 9.2. Initial Installation). This will re-install
the current flips program without damaging the database files.


9.4. Testing FLIPS

       When the FLIPS system is installed, it takes control of the computer. The autoexec.bat file is
changed to start running FLIPS when the system is turned on. The FLIPS software can run on a
machine without having total control of it. To test FLIPS software without installing the software, use
the following instructions. FLIPS requires the use of a virtual disk to execute the program.

      1. Insert a FLIPS disk into A Drive.
AT-G-15, 1 August 2000                                                                    95



     2. From C Drive, enter the following commands:

           MD FLIPS <Enter>

           CD FLIPS <Enter>
