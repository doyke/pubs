                                             Chapter 1

      SOON EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION AND OBSERVING CONSIDERATIONS

1.1. Telescope System.
     1.1.1. The AN/FMQ-7 Solar Observing Optical Network (SOON) telescope system provides
     the capability to observe, analyze, and report visible solar phenomena such as solar flares,
     sunspots, magnetic fields, and disk and limb activity. The system is divided into four
     functional areas: automatic data processing, tracking and light acquisition, automatic flare
     detection, and spectral analysis. However, the AN/FMQ-7 equipment nomenclature includes
     all equipment subsystems (the overall facility, telescope, birefringent filter, spectrograph,
     television, computer, etc). The telescope has two modes of operation: automatic (computer
     performs flare detection) and semiautomatic/manual (analyst performs flare detection using
     either television monitors or the SOON Rehost client software components). A general
     description of the telescope is presented below. For a complete description, see TO 31M1-
     2FMQ7-1.
     1.1.2. Telescope Tube Assembly and Optical Bench. The telescope tube assembly has a 10-
     inch objective lens mounted at the forward end, a 210-inch focal length, and operates in a
     partial vacuum to minimize image distortion and damage to the internal optics. A field lens
     with a focal length of 36 inches is at the optical bench end of the tube, providing a 2-inch
     diameter solar image. Translational image motion caused by the apparent motion of the sun
     across the sky is offset by an image rotator, which moves with the telescope tube, but at half
     the speed. The beam splitters and scanner mirrors receive the image from the collimator lens
     and direct it to upper and lower light paths in the lens interchange box. The birefringent filter
     in the upper light path supports both the Hydrogen alpha (Hα) and Magnesium b2 (Mg-b2)
     subsystems. The lower light path supports the spectrograph subsystem. About one-third of
     the light goes to the upper light path, and about two-thirds goes to the lower light path. The
     exact division of light between the upper and lower light paths depends on the beam splitter
     position and wavelength. For example, in beam splitter position 2, 70% of the Hα
     wavelength and 95% of the Mg-b2 wavelength is sent to the upper light path; the remainder
     goes to the lower light path.
        1.1.2.1. A series of lenses in the upper light path lens interchange box define image
        viewing size. In “large scale”, a single lens passes the full 2-inch diameter image to the
        birefringent filter. At this scale, which is used for automatic flare analysis, an image of
        only about one-fifteenth of the solar disk displays on the monitor. In “full disk”, the
        image size is reduced by a factor of 6 to a 0.33-inch diameter image, which allows full
        disk display on the monitor.
        1.1.2.2. Visual observations are available through the Hα and spectrograph eyepieces,
        including a sunspot projection board. Real-time video is available on various monitors. A
        SOON Rehost Solar Image Movie Console allows continuous Hα or Mg-b2 observations,
        including review of stored data.
        1.1.2.3. The telescope optics cause large scale and full disk images to have different
        display orientations. Standard solar cardinal directions are in clockwise direction:
        North/West/South/East.    The     mirror    image    is    in   clockwise   direction:
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     7


     North/East/South/West. The following indicates orientation for each display type. Only
     the SOON Rehost provides P-angle correction.
         1.1.2.3.1. Television Monitors.
             1.1.2.3.1.1. Hα, Mg-b2, and Spectrograph white light display standard solar
             cardinal directions:
                 1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Large scale: North up; East left.
                 1.1.2.3.1.1.2. Full disk: North down; East right.
             1.1.2.3.1.2. Spectrograph spectra and Spectrohelioscope display standard solar
             cardinal directions:

         1.1.2.3.4. White Light Sunspot Projection Board display mirror image of standard
         solar cardinal directions: North right; East down.
  1.1.3. Hα Subsystem. This upper light path subsystem produces a solar image at the Hα
  wavelength (6562.8 Angstroms). The Hα line reveals chromospheric features such as plage
  (see 5.1.3.), flares, prominences, and filaments. Since the Hα birefringent filter assembly is
  very temperature sensitive, it has its own temperature control unit.
  1.1.4. Mg-b2 Subsystem. This upper light path subsystem uses the same birefringent filter as
  the Hα subsystem, but employs different prefilters and polaroids to produce a solar image at
  the Mg-b2 wavelength (5172.3 Angstroms). It reveals photospheric features such as sunspots
  and faculae.
  1.1.5. White Light and Guider/Tracking Subsystems. The white light beam-splitter divides
  incoming light into separate light paths. The front and rear surfaces reflect 8% of the light
  upward to an optical wedge, which in turn sends 4% to a white light (or sunspot) projection
  board and 4% to a guider assembly. The guider assembly measures light intensity using
  photoelectric cells and, if sufficient light is received, commands the telescope drive modules
  to track the sun automatically. At low light intensity, the modules track at a fixed rate.
  1.1.6. Spectrograph (SG) Subsystem. The SOON spectrograph provides adjustable
  wavelength analysis from 3,700 to 10,830 Angstroms. This subsystem employs the lower
  light path within the lens interchange box. It can be operated concurrently with Hα patrol,
  since at beam splitter position 2, it continuously receives about two-thirds of the total light.
8                                                        AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


    The exact percentage varies with wavelength: about 30% for Hα, 10% for Mg-b2, and nearly
    100% for Iron 8468 and Helium 10,830. The imaging optics is similar to the Hα subsystem
    (large scale and full disk), except the spectrograph’s full disk image is 0.66 inches versus
    0.33 inches for Hα. The spectrograph consists of a slit carriage assembly, Littrow lens, and
    dispersing element (diffraction grating), and has three major subsystems:
       1.1.6.1. Basic Spectrograph Components.
           1.1.6.1.1. Slit Carriage Assembly. The spectrograph slit is a narrow opening through
           which light passes on its way to the dispersing element. A micrometer can manually
           adjust the width of the slit opening. Although it is the diffracted angle of the light in
           the dispersing element that isolates a specific spectral line, the slit width determines
           the fraction of the spectrum passed at the central wavelength. The slit carriage
           assembly has three positions: spectra/white light (S-WL), spectrohelioscope (SHS),
           and photoelectric (PE).
           1.1.6.1.2. Littrow Lens. This lens is located on a worm gear track inside the grating
           assembly box between the Doppler cube and the dispersing element. It serves two
           purposes: it collimates (makes parallel) the light and focuses the returning dispersed
           light at the exit slit plane. Since focal length is wavelength dependent, the analyst can
           manually adjust the location of the Littrow lens to focus the desired wavelength.
           1.1.6.1.3. Dispersing Element. This element is a diffraction grating and produces
           several duplicate images of the solar spectrum (known as “orders”) through
           diffraction and interference of light waves. The spectrograph has two diffraction
           gratings located back-to-back on a common pivot, each having a different groove
           spacing and groove angle (“blaze angle”). These different grating parameters favor
           different wavelengths and order intensities depending on the angle the light strikes the
           grating (“angle of incidence”).
       1.1.6.2. Major Spectrograph Subsystems.
           1.1.6.2.1. Spectra/White Light Subsystem. Setting the function control knob on the
           front of the slit carriage assembly to “WL” while the carriage is in the “S-WL”
           position can facilitate white light observations. In this position, a series of prisms
           reduce light intensity and prevents it from going to the grating. Also, a 200 Angstrom
           band-pass filter in front of the prisms further reduces light intensity and sharpens the
           image. This white light imagery can be used to supplement the white light projection
           board and Mg-b2 subsystem for sunspot and photospheric observations.
       1.1.6.3. Magnetograph (or Photoelectric) Subsystem.
           1.1.6.3.1. This subsystem includes the photodiodes; the power supply and chopping
           circuitry; the KD*P crystal and phase plate circuitry; the calibration Polaroid; the
           objective focusing (or calibration) lens; and a Doppler cube. It is selected by moving
           the slit carriage to the PE position and provides maps of magnetic field information
           called magnetograms. . This capability is one of the SOON system’s greatest assets,
           since solar flare occurrence is closely linked to magnetic field strengths, gradients,
           complexity, and structural changes.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                       9


          1.1.6.3.2. The magnetograph uses the Zeeman effect, the splitting of selected solar
          spectral lines on the basis of magnetic field strength in the material emitting the light.
          The SOON magnetograph uses the iron spectral line at 8468 Angstroms, which splits
          into three lines when observed in the presence of active region or sunspot. Two lines
          are displaced on either side of the central line and are analyzed to determine the
          longitudinal (line-of-sight) component of magnetic field strength. The separation of
          these two lines determines total magnetic field strength. Emission polarization gives
          magnetic polarity (north or south).
          1.1.6.3.3. The two displaced spectral lines are respectively right and left circularly
          polarized, which means the electric field portion of the light wave precedes or follows
          the magnetic field portion by one quarter of a wavelength. To analyze these lines, the
          circular polarization must be phased to plane polarization, which is when the light
          wave’s electric and magnetic field components match. Polarization introduced by the
          telescope must also be eliminated. The KD*P crystals accomplish this by adding or
          subtracting (depending on whether the spectral line is right or left polarized) one
          quarter wavelength to phase the line emission to plane polarization. Since electric
          charge in the KD*P crystals affects the phase change of light waves passing through,
          two charges corresponding to phase corrections of right and left polarized light is
          alternately applied to the crystal.. Results are imaged onto two photodiodes in the
          spectrograph carriage. The output signal is amplified and sent to the computer for
          analysis. Each measurement is compared to the quiet sun reference. Deviations from
          this reference yield magnetic field strength and direction.
1.2. Computer System.
   1.2.1. The AN/FMQ-7 SOON telescope’s computer system includes many peripheral
   devices. Further information on the SOON computer system and its operational use is found
   in the SOONSUM and TO 31M1-2FMQ7-1. Major components of the computer system are
   presented below.
   1.2.2. SOON Rehost Client subsystem is a standalone desktop PC based computer that
   provides the Graphical User Interface (GUI) functionality for the analyst. It allows the
   analyst the ability to view solar images and perform flare, DALAS, and magnetogram
   analyses. It provides screens to aid solar activity analyses, and telescope control, which
   allows the analyst to accomplish required solar patrol. Other screens facilitate system
   maintenance, diagnostics, and calibration.
   1.2.3. SOON Rehost Server subsystem is a rack-mounted server that provides archival and
   storage capability for solar images and histograms. It provides communication to and from
   the SOON Rehost Client and Embedded Controller. It passes messages, images, and other
   products to the SEON Operations Secure Server (SOSS) for distribution, using Secure File
   Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
   1.2.4. Embedded Controller interfaces with the telescope system, providing control logic to
   position the telescope. It receives live video to capture images from the telescope cameras. It
   creates histograms and accomplishes flare analysis on the histogram data.
   1.2.5. SOSS application provides the user the ability to send, receive, forward, print, and
   store weather messages and images.

   1.2.6. SEON WINDS provides a graphic user interface to transmit and receive alphanumeric
   solar weather data.
1.3. Solar Coordinate Systems.
   1.3.1. Earth-Sun Orbital Relationships.
      1.3.1.1. The earth’s orbit around the sun is a slightly eccentric ellipse with a mean
      distance to the sun of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles), which is also defined as
      one astronomical unit (1 AU). Perihelion, when the earth is closest to the sun, occurs in
      early January at a distance of 0.984 AU (147 million km, 91.4 million miles). Aphelion,
      when the earth is farthest from the sun, occurs in early July at a distance of 1.016 AU
      (152 million km, 94.6 million miles). The ecliptic plane is defined as the plane the earth
      orbits the sun.
      1.3.1.2. The earth’s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5° from a line perpendicular to the
      ecliptic plane (Figure 1.1). This tilt defines the limits of solar declination, namely ±
      23.5°.
      1.3.1.3. The sun rotates about its own axis in the same sense as the earth rotates around
      the sun (i.e., counterclockwise as viewed from the north side of the ecliptic plane). The
      solar axis of rotation axis is tilted 7.23° from a line perpendicular to the ecliptic plane
      (Figure 1.1). The sun rotates faster at its equator than it does at its poles. On average, the
      sun takes 25.35 days to rotate (at 26° solar latitude); however, because the earth orbits the
      sun in the same direction as the solar rotation, the sun averages 27. 2753 days to rotate
      with respect to an observer on the earth.

Figure 1.1. Earth-Sun Orbital and Axial Rotation Relationships.




   1.3.2. Geocentric Coordinates. This coordinate system is based on the perspective of an
   observer standing on the surface of the earth. It is used to determine solar position and
   orientation in the earth’s sky as well as establish the location of features on the solar disk.
      1.3.2.1. In the northern hemisphere, the north-south (N-S) reference line is perpendicular
      to the earth’s horizon with north toward the zenith when looking due south at local noon
      (Figure 1.2). In this case, the east horizon is to the left and the west horizon is to the right.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     11


       This orientation defines the “east” (left) and “west” (right) limbs (or edges) of the sun as
       viewed from the northern hemisphere. Conversely, in the southern hemisphere, the sun
       appears “upside down”—that is, the south end of the N-S reference line is toward zenith
       when looking due north at local noon. In this case, the east horizon is to the right and the
       west horizon is to the left. Regardless of which hemisphere one observes the sun, at
       sunrise the west limb always appears first, and at sunset it sets first (Figure 1.3). The
       sun’s 27-day rotation period causes persistent solar features to appear on its east limb and
       disappear around its west limb about two weeks later.
       1.3.2.2. Geocentric coordinates consist of Position Angle (PA) and Radius Vector (Rv)
       (Figure 1.4).
           1.3.2.2.1. PA is the angle formed between the N-S reference line and a ray from the
           center of the observed solar disk to the desired point. PA ranges counterclockwise
           from 0º to 360º, with north at 0º, east at 90º, south at 180º, and west at 270°.
           1.3.2.2.2. The magnitude of Rv measures the distance from the center of the
           observed solar disk to the desired point in fractions of one solar radius. Features
           observed on the disk range from Rv = 0.0 (sun’s center) to Rv = 1.0 (solar limb),
           while features observed beyond the disk have an Rv value greater than 1.0.
       1.3.2.3. The magnitude of the Rv is particularly useful in computing geometric
       foreshortening corrections. The spherical sun is observed as a projected disk on a flat
       image plane. The further a feature is from the center of the solar disk, the more distorted
       the projected image appears. This distortion foreshortens the image along a radial line.
       This effect makes features close to the solar limb appear compressed and parallel to the
       limb.
           1.3.2.3.1. This foreshortening effect causes the observed (i.e., apparent or measured)
           area of a solar feature to be smaller than its true area by an amount related to the
           magnitude of the feature’s Rv. Application of a foreshortening correction permits
           conversion of measured areas (Am) to true—or Corrected—areas (Ac).
For sunspots:



For flares (allowing for the height of flares above solar surface):

          1.3.2.3.2. In the equations above, both Ac and Am are in units of “millionths of the
          solar disk”. To convert Ac to “millionths of the solar hemisphere”, use the
          relationship:



          1.3.2.3.3. All area measurements reported by United States Air Force (USAF)
          observatories are expressed in millionths of the solar hemisphere. The scientific
14                                                      AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


         community also uses square heliographic degrees to express corrected areas, which is
         calculated as follows:




  1.3.3. Heliographic Coordinates. This coordinate system is based on the sun’s axis of
  rotation, rather than the N-S reference line in the earth’s sky (Figure 1.5). . It is used to
  measure and report the size and location of solar features. Charts using heliographic
  coordinates are published in one degree increments for B angle (see 1.3.3.2.) and are also
  called Stonyhurst Disks.
     1.3.3.1. The P-angle (P) is the angle formed between the sun’s North Pole rotation axis
     and the N-S reference line in the earth’s sky. P-angle ranges from P = +26.31º (westward
     tilt, clockwise) in October to P = –26.31º (eastward tilt, counterclockwise) in April, with
     P = 0º occurring in July and January.
     1.3.3.2. “Heliographic Latitude (B)” is measured from the solar equator (B = 0º) to +90º
     at the solar North Pole and -90º at the solar South Pole. The heliographic latitude that
     coincides with the center of the sun’s visible disk is defined as “Bo”, also called the “B-
     angle”. Since the sun’s axis is inclined 7.23° to a perpendicular line through the ecliptic
     plane, at times the sun’s north pole may be visible, and at other times not visible (beyond
     the north solar limb). During the present epoch, Bo ranges from Bo = +7.23º in
     September to Bo = -7.23º in March, with B = 0º occurring in June and December. If B is
     positive, the solar North Pole is tilted toward the earth and is visible; if Bo is negative, the
     South Pole is tilted toward the earth and is visible.
     1.3.3.3. Heliographic Longitude may be expressed as either “Central Meridian Distance
     (CMD)” or “Carrington Longitude (L)”.
         1.3.3.3.1. CMD is only applicable to the visible disk of the sun. It fixed with respect
         to an observer on earth. The line through the solar North and South Poles (not
         through the N-S reference line in the earth’s sky) is defined as the central meridian
         and is assigned a CMD value of 0º. CMD from 0º to 90ºE corresponds to locations
         on the sun’s eastern hemisphere. CMD from 0º to 90ºW corresponds to locations on
         the sun’s western hemisphere.
         1.3.3.3.2. Carrington longitude (L) rotates with the sun according to its 27.2753-day
         rotation period (as originally measured using sunspots). Longitude is measured from
         0º to 360º in the direction of rotation (i.e., westward, counterclockwise as viewed
         from solar North Pole). As time passes, successively lower Carrington longitudes
         will occupy the central meridian. The Carrington longitude that occupies the center
         of the sun’s visible disk (i.e., central meridian) is defined as Lo, which is published
         (along with P angle and Bo) daily at 0000 UT in the Astronomical Almanac and is
         calculated by the SOON computer system. Lo decreases by 360º every 27.2753 days
         at a rate of 13.2º per day or 0.55º per hour.
         1.3.3.3.3. Carrington Rotation Number. The Carrington longitude reference system
         allows positional continuity of solar features over periods of many solar rotations.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      15


           Each time Lo = 0º passes the central meridian, the Carrington Rotation Number
           increases by one. This occurs every 27.2753 days. Carrington Rotation #1 started at
           0000 UT, 9 November 1853, when Lo = 0º was defined as being at the central
           meridian.
           1.3.3.3.4. The CMD of a solar feature can easily be converted to Carrington
           longitude.
EXAMPLE: A sunspot is located at 15ºN, 40ºE (CMD) at 1000 UT on 14 May 1991. What is
the spot’s Carrington longitude? The almanac lists Lo = 238.94º at 0000 UT on that date. Ten
hours later Lo = 238.9° – 10hrs (0.55° per hr) = 233.4º. Since the spot is 40º east of the central
meridian, the Carrington longitude L = 233.4 – 40 = 193.4º.

1.4. Quality of Observation.
   1.4.1. Seeing quality is the degree to which the observed solar image resembles the actual
   solar disk. The “quality of observation”—as reported in a Plain Language code (PLAIN),
   FLARE, Solar Disk and Limb Activity Summary code (DALAS), Sunspot code (SPOTS), or
   other data messages—combines the impact of atmospheric effects, observing continuity, and
   telescope condition. The analyst subjectively assesses overall quality and reliability of data
   being transmitted based on observing conditions. Quality of observation is scaled from 1
   (very poor) to 5 (excellent) for both white light and Hα observations.
   1.4.2. Poor atmospheric observing conditions decrease image resolution and stability. Most
   image degradation is caused by variations in the refractive properties of the earth’s
   atmosphere between the telescope and the sun. Refractive index variations result from
   density irregularities, which cause convective currents, primarily in the lowest 1,000 feet in
 16                                                    AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


   the earth’s atmosphere. Such turbulence tends to exaggerate solar area measurements, while
   decreasing peak brightness measurements. Seeing conditions are generally best during the
   first two hours after sunrise, over water, or under a temperature inversion. Once atmospheric
   mixing in the boundary layer has begun, the shortest path through the turbulent layer
   produces the best seeing conditions (i.e., near local noon). Also, the presence of thin clouds
   can drastically influence both area and brightness measurements.
      1.4.3. Equipment condition affects image quality. Problems that can degrade image
      quality include a poor vacuum in the telescope tube, poorly focused lenses, or smudges
      on the white light projection mirror.
   1.4.4. Qualities of observation categories are listed in paragraph 4.2 for white light
   observations and in paragraph 5.2 for Hα observations.
1.5. Semiautomatic Operations.
   1.5.1. When in semiautomatic operations, there are several common physiological and
   psychological factors that affect an analyst’s ability to visually conduct patrol using the Hα
   video.
      1.5.1.1. Analyst attention decreases after just a couple minutes of continuous viewing.
      Therefore, frequent short breaks from viewing help to relieve the monotony of
      continuous observing or detailed disk analysis.
      1.5.1.2. When scanning the solar image, analysts tend to bias their scan toward the center
      of the image or toward a specific feature. Eyes focus on sharply contrasted regions,
      follow contours, or jump from one feature to another in a chain. This results in uneven
      scanning and missed information. To offset these tendencies, analysts must be aware of
      these natural inclinations and discipline themselves to perform a systematic and thorough
      scanning sequence.
   1.5.2. During extended periods of low solar activity, certified SOON analysts must work at
   least one shift per quarter in semiautomatic operation mode. Frequent short periods of
   semiautomatic operations necessitated by poor observing conditions may satisfy this training
   requirement.
1.6. Observing and Analysis Aids. Each SOON site shall maintain the following:
   1.6.1. A current copy of an ephemeris or Astronomical Almanac or internet source.
   1.6.2. A complete set of 18cm clear plastic Stonyhurst overlays. A complete set consists of
   eight overlays constructed for Bo = – 7° to +7°, in one degree increments.

      2.1.1.2. Complete Power-Up and Complete Shutdown during the observing day (e.g.,
      during severe weather, such as lightning within 5 nautical miles; or when room
      environmental limits exceed safe/proper thresholds for computer or telescope equipment)

      when hazardous conditions exist or are imminent such as severe weather, flood, fire,
      electrocution, etc.)
2.2. Normal Power-Up Procedures.
   2.2.1. Follow local procedures to preset all hardware and software to operate in either Semi-
   Automatic or Automatic patrol, depending on available light conditions during power-up.
   The following settings assume Normal Start-up occurs during light conditions suitable for
   Semi-Automatic patrol.
      2.2.1.1. Ensure the vacuum pump is operational, the valve handle on the telescope tube is
      open (parallel to the vacuum line), and vacuum levels are within the normal range (check
      with maintenance for values). Do not open the telescope if the vacuum is not within the
      specified range.
      2.2.1.2. Turn off the objective lens heater (if applicable).
      2.2.1.3. Turn on the SOSS/SOON/WINDS server, if applicable.
      2.2.1.4. Ensure the servo modules are set to the following positions.
          2.2.1.4.1. RA and DEC: Manual (values should be set to normal stow position per
          local procedures).
          2.2.1.4.2. Beam Selector: Position 1.
          2.2.1.4.3. Flare Alarm: Computer.
          2.2.1.4.4. Hα and SG: Full Disk
          2.2.1.4.5. Hα B: B

      2.2.1.7. Turn on the SOON Rehost client monitors.
      2.2.1.8. Open the guider lens cover (if necessary).
      2.2.1.9. Ensure the guider threshold is set to “ENABLE” and is not set below an
      acceptable value (2.0 volts minimum).
      2.2.1.10. Ensure the Scanner Box beam splitter is in Position “2”.
      2.2.1.11. Turn on any small computers (e.g., PCs) as needed.
   2.2.2. Launch SOON/WINDS/SOSS consoles on the Rehost client.
   2.2.3. Manually acquire the sun using the “RA” and “DEC” servo modules. (CAUTION:
   Avoid looking down the light path.).
2.3. Normal Shutdown Procedures - Tailor these listed actions as needed to meet local
requirements:
   2.3.1. Complete daily SACCT totals.
   2.3.2. With the Polaroid removed, stow the telescope using the “RA” and “DEC” servo
   modules (set the “RA” potentiometer to approximately 900 and “DEC” potentiometer to
   approximately 100; these values may be slightly different at each SOON observatory due to
   variations in “DEC” and “RA” drive calibrations). Visually ensure the lens is seated in its
   cover.
   2.3.3. Set Servo modules to the following positions. The following settings are for setting
   up for Semi-Automatic patrol. Adjust as necessary for local conditions.
      2.3.3.1. RA and DEC: Manual (values should be set to normal stow position per local
      procedures).
      2.3.3.2. Beam Selector: Position 1
      2.3.3.3. Flare Alarm: Computer
      2.3.3.4. Hα and SG: Full Disk
      2.3.3.5. Hα B: B
      2.3.3.6. All other Potentiometers: Manual and set to 500
      2.3.3.7. SHS: Down position
   2.3.4. Ensure Scanner Box Beam splitter in Position “2”.
   2.3.5. Close the guider lens cover.
   2.3.6. Important: Prior to shutting down the Rehost client computer, analyst must perform a
   SOON data archival by clicking File>Archive Settings. Additional details are located in the
   SOONSUM and/or local SOPs. Power off Rack monitors, H camera, SPEC camera, SOON
   Telescope and Television power switches, and all computer monitors.
   2.3.7. Turn off any small computers (e.g., PCs) as appropriate.
2.4. Develop and Publish Complete Power-Up and Power Down Procedures. Due to site
and configuration differences, procedures will vary at each observatory. Develop these
procedures to safeguard equipment from severe weather events (lightning within 5 nautical
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    19


miles, tropical cyclones, departure from normal room environmental limits, etc.). Observatories
will coordinate with maintenance personnel when developing these procedures to maintain safety
and accomplish proper equipment configuration. Procedures will include step-by-step directions
on how to restore power and re-establish patrol after complete shutdown is achieved.
   2.4.1. Issue patrol status (STATS) messages to “down” and “up” the equipment as
   applicable (analysts will issue the “down” message prior to shutdown) and call the
   SPACEWOC (2WS/WXZ) to inform them of equipment status.
2.5. Emergency Shutdown/Emergency Power-Up Procedures. Due to site and configuration
differences, emergency procedures will vary at each observatory. Regardless, local procedures
will specify actions in case of severe weather, flooding, fire, electrocution, etc. The procedures
will highlight which buildings, power sources (e.g., 110V/60 Hz or 250V/50 Hz), and circuit
panels will be affected by each shutdown action. The procedures will also include step-by-step
directions on how to restore power and re-establish patrol after the emergency is over.

                              SOLAR OPTICAL OBSERVING

3.1. Opening Procedures.
   3.1.1. Arrival on Site.
      3.1.1.1. Arrive early enough to accomplish all opening procedures before sunrise. For
      SOON operations, local optical sunrise is defined as the first full minute the entire disk is
      above the apparent horizon, which is based on a smooth oblate spheroid earth adjusted to
      reflect permanent local obstructions such as ridge lines or buildings.
      3.1.1.2. Review notes from the previous shift, latest Daily Operational Summary
      (NWXX60) message, overnight WINDS traffic from other sites (e.g., region additions or
      changes and solar activity messages), and equipment outage logs.
      3.1.1.3. Perform an environmental check. Observe the hygrothermograph or its
      equivalent. When either the room temperature or relative humidity exceed environmental
      limits (listed below) for more than 30 minutes, perform a "Complete Shutdown" of the
      computer and/or telescope equipment (as appropriate). Use local "Complete Shutdown"
      procedures developed with the aid of guidance in AFWAMAN 15-1, TO 31M1-2FMQ7-
      1, and the SOONSUM. Periodically perform an environmental check throughout the
      observing day.
          3.1.1.3.1. Telescope room: 60° to 80° F and 30% to 60% relative humidity.
          3.1.1.3.2. SOON/SOSS Server room: 50° to 90° F with a max graduation of 10° F
          per hour and 20% to 80% relative humidity with a max graduation of 10% per hour.
   3.1.2. Power Up. Power up equipment and boot the computer using local "Normal Power-
   Up" procedures developed with guidance from chapter 2 and TO 31M1- 2FMQ7-1.
   3.1.3. If FLARE or DALAS activity is in progress when patrol is acquired (at sunrise or after
   a break in patrol), perform the following:
      3.1.3.1. If possible, prepare a FLARE or DALAS code message IAW AFMAN 15-124.
      Use the start time of patrol as the FLARE or DALAS start time, using appropriate time
      and data qualifiers.
      3.1.3.2. If enough reliable data could not be collected for a meaningful FLARE or
      DALAS coded message, send a PLAIN message instead. This PLAIN will advise the
      2WS SPACEWOC (2WS/WXZ) that some activity occurred, but not enough to initiate a
      FLARE or DALAS report.
      3.1.3.3. If the activity is event-level, the analyst has two options:
          3.1.3.3.1. If it is known that the activity has been reported by another observatory
          more than 15 minutes earlier, do not send an EVENT code message. Instead, use
          routine (AXXX61) Manual of Operations (MANOP) headers for the FLARE or
          DALAS code message. A common example is a long duration Loop Prominence
          System (LPS).
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  21


          3.1.3.3.2. If it is not known whether the activity has been reported by another
          observatory more than 15 minutes earlier, respond as if it were a new event. Send an
          event (SXXX61) MANOP header for the FLARE or DALAS code message. Also,
          append a PLAIN indicating you just acquired the sun and that the event may or may
          not be new activity.
3.2. Patrol Procedures.
   3.2.1. Region Definitions and Analyses Boxes.
      3.2.1.1. Maintain updated region definitions and region acquisitioning using Region
      Definition tables, Region Display Console, Sequence Table Editor, and the lead site’s
      latest analyses boxes (BXOUT) message. The lead site is the SOON site that is “on the
      sun” when an observatory first comes up. The lead site may transfer lead status to another
      site because of weather, equipment problems, etc.
          3.2.1.1.1. Video sequences must contain the "regions of special interest" from the
          Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) Data Acquisition Request bulletin
          (AXXX05 KWNP), the active regions listed in the SWPC Region Summary bulletin
          (AXXX02 KWNP), newly spotted regions, and other active regions considered to
          have flare potential. NOTE: The SWPC invites inputs and suggested changes from
          SOON analysts concerning the regions of special interest.
          3.2.1.1.2. At a minimum, sample each region of special interest every 30 seconds and
          other active regions every minute.
          3.2.1.1.3. Set up sequences to minimize scanner mirror movements. Place significant
          regions last in each sequence, so they will be visible for a longer period of time.
          3.2.1.1.4. Ensure automated hourly histogram history (HSTRY) reports are
          transmitted for the regions of special interest.
      3.2.1.2. Intersite analysis box procedures.
          3.2.1.2.1. All SOON sites will use identical Magnetic Reference Region (MAGR)
          analysis boxes.
          3.2.1.2.2. All SOON sites will use similar analysis boxes for any given active region.
          Region center coordinates will be within ±10 arc seconds in box height and width,
          and ±5° in box center location.
          3.2.1.2.3. During operating hours, whether you are actually on patrol or not, review
          and, as appropriate, load all box changes or additions received from other sites Check
          overnight WINDS traffic for any added SN/DL (serial numbered/disk or limb)
          regions after auto-BXOUTs are transmitted. The latest auto-BXOUT may not be the
          most current BXOUT. Updating boxes as required ensures automatically generated
          BXOUT messages will pass the most current information to the next site. Use the
          Region Display Console to display how the boxes look on the disk, and to check for
          duplications.
          3.2.1.2.4. Coordinate locally assigned box numbers with other operating
          observatories to prevent more than one number being used for the same region, or the
          same number being used for different regions.
22                                                    AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


     3.2.1.3. Periodically check analysis boxes (including MAGR) to ensure they are
     producing good data. Modify boxes only when necessary. When boxes are changed or
     added, or when a region is updated or added, transmit a BXOUT message. Ensure
     automated BXOUT reports are transmitted every three hours.
  3.2.2. Patrol Status (STATS) Reports. Transmit an initial STATS message as soon as
  feasible after optical sunrise, whether or not patrol is acquired. During the day, report each
  interruption in observation that exceeds 5 minutes as a break in patrol. Conversely, report
  periods of observation exceeding 2 minutes as patrol. Report all transitions between
  automatic and semiautomatic patrol. Transmit a final STATS message as soon as feasible
  after the end of the observing day.
     3.2.2.1. Patrol is possible when the telescope displays an image that will permit
     collection and analysis of flare data in either semiautomatic or automatic mode. Maintain
     patrol as long as flare data can be collected even if the data must be qualified "Very
     Poor”.
     3.2.2.2. If unable to acquire the sun at sunrise (e.g., power outage, clouds, severe
     weather, etc), do not delay transmitting an initial STATS message showing which solar
     sensors are "inoperative at sunrise". If unable to transmit messages, telephone the
     SPACEWOC, and inform them of the problem and when patrol is expected to begin. If
     appropriate, ask the 2WS SPACEWOC to inform SWPC and other SOON observatories.
     3.2.2.3. All patrol times reported represent actual times patrol was lost or regained. This
     may not be the current time, transmission time, or the time equipment is logged out for
     maintenance.
     3.2.2.4. If the reported expected outage time is later changed or exceeded, transmit as
     soon as practical a new STATS message to extend downtime.
  3.2.3. Observing Routine.
     3.2.3.1. Initiate semiautomatic patrol, IAW paragraph 3.4 below, whenever automatic
     patrol cannot be established or maintained (e.g., computer or equipment outage, clouds,
     or light levels too low for automatic flare detection).
     3.2.3.2. At least daily, run optical calibration checks and perform alignment checks to
     ensure the optical system is properly calibrated.
     3.2.3.3. Check daily and adjust, if needed, the image rotator value by performing an
     image drift in full disk using an Hα feature displayed on a monitor. Incorporate guidance
     from applicable TOs to create local procedures for this adjustment. At least once a week,
     check the drift of a sunspot on the white light projection board. Weekly white light
     checks ensure greater consistency between observatories.
     3.2.3.4. At least hourly, scan the sunspot image board, including the Hα disk and limb
     (whether in automatic or semiautomatic mode) to detect changes in active regions,
     filaments, prominences, or other features. During event-level flares, check more
     frequently to detect flare-induced changes or white light flares. Use Movie Console
     images to detect filament changes or disappearances. In semiautomatic mode, make TV
     monitor Hα observations at least every 3 minutes for flare patrol.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      23


     3.2.3.5. Make a magnetic field analysis (using Spectrograph Analysis or manual
     method), whether in automatic or semiautomatic operations, for at least:
         3.2.3.5.1. All regions of special interest listed in the SWPC Data Acquisition Request
         bulletin (AXXX05)
         3.2.3.5.2. All spotted regions with a suspected magnetic class of Beta-Gamma or
         greater.
  3.2.4. Forms and Data Reporting.
     3.2.4.1. Use AFWA IMT 17, Solar Optical Worksheet, Attachment 2, to record flare,
     DALAS, and patrol data, whether in automatic or semiautomatic operations. Use AFWA
     Form 21, Sunspot Analysis Worksheet, Attachment 3, to draw and analyze sunspots.
     3.2.4.2. Transmit data reports as soon as possible, not to exceed time limits stated in this
     chapter and summarized in Attachment 4.
  3.2.5. PLAIN Reports.
     3.2.5.1. Transmit scheduled (AXXX60 MANOP header) PLAIN messages by the
     prescribed file times. Include a detailed description of each SWPC numbered region, or
     interesting locally numbered region, at least once each observing day for regions with a
     magnetic complexity of Beta or greater. Include Beta-Gamma or more complex regions
     in each report. Concentrate on changes or information not previously reported in a
     PLAIN or coded message. Avoid using program names or other terms in a PLAIN that
     may not be known or clear to all recipients. Use the format and content described in
     Attachment 5. NOTE: If no patrol was possible during the period due to weather or
     maintenance, send an abbreviated PLAIN that covers the requirements of the first section.
     As applicable, include any scheduled maintenance in the abbreviated PLAIN.
     3.2.5.2. Transmit unscheduled PLAIN messages as needed to clarify information in
     coded data reports or to report information not reported in any other message. These
     PLAIN messages may be appended to coded data messages, or sent separately using an
     AXXX61 MANOP header.
  3.2.6. FLARE Reports.
     3.2.6.1. Report sampled activity as a flare when it meets the following criteria:
         3.2.6.1.1. In automatic mode: The sampled activity increases in brightness, in two
         minutes or less, to an intensity at least 50% above the surrounding background, and
         the area at or above this intensity level has a corrected area of at least 10 millionths of
         the solar hemisphere. NOTE: Normally the histogram flare threshold is set at 160%,
         which represents a brightness level of about 60% above the surrounding background
         intensity. Variations in background plage intensity (see 5.1.3.) or observing
         conditions may require an analyst to set the threshold as low as 140% or as high as
         220%.
         3.2.6.1.2. In semiautomatic mode: The sampled activity increases in brightness, in
         two minutes or less, to an intensity that produces brightening over a total Hα line
         width (red shift plus blue shift) of at least 0.8 Angstroms, and the corrected area
         which displays this brightening is at least 10 millionths of the solar hemisphere.
24                                                      AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


        Examples: a 0.4 red shift and a 0.4 blue shift, a 0.8 red shift alone, or a 0.8 blue shift
        alone.
     3.2.6.2. For event-level flares, transmit preliminary report within 2 minutes of flare
     meeting event threshold in automatic mode (15 minutes if in semi-automatic) using the
     SXXX61 MANOP header. Transmit final event-level flare reports within 10 minutes
     after flare ends in automatic mode (20 minutes if in semiautomatic) using the AXXX61
     MANOP header. For non-event flares, preliminary reports are optional, but are
     encouraged if time permits; transmit final reports within 15 minutes after flare end in
     automatic mode (30 minutes if in semiautomatic) using an AXXX61 MANOP header..
     3.2.6.3. If a computer-generated FLARE message appears to be incorrect, evaluate the
     data and correct the message if necessary. If data collected by the SOON computer is
     used to produce a new data report, the method/type of observation should still be coded
     (using T in the TIBcc group) as "electronic" (i.e., automatic). If the SOON computer was
     not used to produce the new data report and any of the following parameters are changed,
     the method/type of observation should be coded as "visual" (i.e., semiautomatic):
        3.2.6.3.1. Time groups (start, peak, or end).
        3.2.6.3.2. Flare importance, location, or corrected area.
        3.2.6.3.3. Flare brightness. NOTE: Encode FBBbb as "/////".
  3.2.7. DALAS Reports.
     3.2.7.1. Use AWS TR 75-252 and this guidance to identify and analyze DALAS activity.
     DALAS phenomena are not limited to the disk or limb, but may extend beyond the limb,
     such as a surges or prominences.
     3.2.7.2. Report Disappearing Solar Filaments (DSFs) equal to or greater than 5 square
     heliographic degrees as soon as detected. It is optional, but encouraged, to report DSFs
     less than 5 square heliographic degrees. Reporting DSFs are second in importance to flare
     reporting. The DALAS code 22222 data continuation line is mandatory for a DSF report.
        3.2.7.2.1. If the exact DSF start time is not observed, use the last time the filament
        was observed as the start time and use the time qualifier s = 3, "Activity started after
        GGgg". If the exact end time is not observed, use the time the filament was first
        observed to be absent as the DSF end time and use the time qualifier e = 2, "Activity
        ended before GGgg". Report the location of the DSF at the time the filament was last
        visible. In all cases, ensure the date in the “YMMDD” group in line three of the code
        relates to the start time of the activity.
        3.2.7.2.2. Overnight DSFs. Report DSFs that occur between the end of patrol on the
        previous day and the start of patrol on the current day. Use the DALAS code if the
        period between "start time" (i.e., the last time the filament was observed) and the "end
        time" (i.e., the time the filament was first observed to be absent) does not exceed 24
        hours. If the period exceeds 24 hours, the DALAS code cannot be used. In this case,
        report relevant information about the DSF in the next scheduled PLAIN or in an
        unscheduled PLAIN. Analysts should coordinate with other observatories to narrow
        the period between "start time" and "end time" for overnight DSFs (i.e., the analyst
        need not base the DSF report on only what was observed at the local observatory).
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     25


     3.2.7.3. Transmit non-event final reports no later than in the final (AXXX62) patrol
     message at the end of the observing day. Use an AXXX61 MANOP header for all
     nonevent DALAS reports.
  3.2.8. Interrupted Patrol. If patrol is lost (due to clouds, power outages, etc.) and flare or
  DALAS activity was in progress at that time:
     3.2.8.1. Keep the flare (or DALAS activity) in progress if it can be seen intermittently
     through breaks in the clouds, even though official patrol cannot be maintained.
     3.2.8.2. If no observations are possible after 45 minutes for a flare, or 2 hours for a
     DALAS phenomenon, issue a final message using the time the activity was last seen as
     the end time, with the appropriate qualifiers. NOTE: Use good judgment when applying
     the 45 minute or 2 hour criteria. Flare and DALAS duration is roughly correlated with
     flare size or DALAS type, but consider other data sources such as bulletins from other
     observatories, radio burst information, etc.
     3.2.8.3. Issue the final message immediately if there is no reason to expect patrol to be
     reacquired. However, if patrol is later reacquired and the activity is still in progress,
     transmit a correction to the final (use report status S = 3) and replace the end time group
     with /////. Append a PLAIN to indicate what you did and why you did it. Append the
     “AMD” modifier to the end of the message DTG. When the activity does end, the final
     message must be sent as a correction (S = 3) or it will fail to be accepted in the
     SPACEWOC database, since only a correction or deletion can replace an existing
     correction.
  3.2.9. SPOTS reports.
     3.2.9.1. Perform sunspot analysis daily during the best viewing available, normally
     within two hours after sunrise.
     3.2.9.2. Transmit one sunspot data report each GMT day. Sites (excluding Learmonth)
     that change GMT dates during their observing day will transmit their SPOTS message
     before the end of the initial GMT day. If no sunspots were seen, or no observations were
     possible, by the end of a GMT day, transmit a truncated SPOTS report IAW AFMAN 15-
     124, Meteorological Codes. NOTE: The SWPC forecaster must receive a SPOTS report
     by 2300Z in order to include the data in their Solar Region Summary.
     3.2.9.3. Before transmission, review the SPOTS report for consistency by checking it
     against reports from other observatories and SWPC. CAUTION: The SWPC
     classification of a region, listed in the Solar Region Summary, is a weighted average
     based on reports from several observatories and should be used only as a guide. The
     analyst should not change observations to match these other reports.
  3.2.10. Adverse Weather.
     3.2.10.1. Protect the telescope objective lens from blowing dust, sand, other potentially
     abrasive materials, and precipitation by stowing it in right ascension and declination.
     Ensure the lens is sealed within its protective cover. For brief periods, it may be sufficient
     to lower the lens in declination into its lens cover, while the telescope continues to track
     the sun in right ascension.
 26                                                   AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


      3.2.10.2. If thunderstorms or lightning occur within 5 nautical miles of the site, perform
      a computer and telescope "Complete Shutdown" using local procedures developed with
      guidance outlined in Chapter 2, TO 31M1-2FMQ7-1, and the SOONSUM.
      3.2.10.3. If winds greater than or equal to 50 knots (sustained or gusts) are imminent or
      forecast to impact the observatory, perform a computer and telescope "Complete
      Shutdown" using local procedures developed with guidance outlined in Chapter 2, TO
      31M1-2FMQ7-1, and the SOONSUM.
   3.2.11. Emergency Shutdown. When severe weather, fire, flooding, electrocution, or other
   hazard immediately threatens the facility, equipment, or personnel, use local "Emergency
   Shutdown" procedures developed with guidance outlined in Chapter 2, TO 31M1-2FMQ7-1,
   and the SOONSUM.
   3.2.12. Complete Power Up Procedures. After a "Complete Shutdown" of the computer
   and/or telescope systems (e.g., due to thunderstorms or exceeding room environmental
   limits), or an "Emergency Shutdown", perform a computer and telescope “Complete Power
   Up” using local procedures developed with guidance outlined in Chapter 2, TO 31M1-
   2FMQ7-1, and the SOONSUM.
   3.2.13. Shift-Change Briefings. As a minimum, include:
      3.2.13.1. Recent or current activity (both optical and radio), observed locally or at
      another site using information gleaned from the latest SWPC bulletins, include active
      regions due to return within the next several days.
      3.2.13.2. Equipment, power, communications, or computer outages/problems. Include
      anticipated PMI and other problems or outages.
      3.2.13.3. Status of other sites.
      3.2.13.4. Any special support requirements.
      3.2.13.5. Any shift duties not accomplished.
3.3. Closing Procedures.
   3.3.1. Termination of Patrol.
      3.3.1.1. Maintain automatic patrol as long as light levels allow accurate flare detection
      and analysis. Each site will establish a minimum threshold for analysts, and redefine that
      value when equipment adjustments are made. Never adjust the guider threshold below 2.0
      volts in an attempt to maintain automatic patrol.
      3.3.1.2. Continue semiautomatic patrol as long as conditions allow reasonably accurate
      flare detection and analysis, even if the data must be qualified "Very Poor".
      3.3.1.3. Transmit a final patrol (STATS) message (using an AXXX62 MANOP header),
      and the End of Day Summary (NWXX60) message, using the appropriate file time. A
      combined summary message with STATS, FLARE, and DALAS (DALAS ended earlier
      and/or in progress at sunset) may be sent.
   3.3.2. Flare or DALAS Activity in Progress at Optical Sunset.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     27


      3.3.2.1. Prepare a final FLARE or DALAS code message IAW AFMAN 15-124. Use the
      end time of patrol as the FLARE or DALAS end time, using appropriate time and data
      qualifiers.
      3.3.2.2. If enough reliable data could not be collected before sunset for a meaningful
      FLARE or DALAS coded message, send a PLAIN message that informs the 2WS
      SPACEWOC that some activity occurred.
      3.3.2.3. Send any FLARE, DALAS, and/or PLAIN messages generated by the Rehost
      client, if applicable, after ending patrol.
   3.3.3. Data Archival. Prior to shutting down the Rehost client computer, perform a SOON
   data archival by clicking File>Archive Settings. Additional details are located in the
   SOONSUM and/or local SOPs.
   3.3.4. Final Closing Actions.
      3.3.4.1. After terminating patrol, enter solar patrol data using guidance in Chapter 2.
      3.3.4.2. Turn off equipment using locally developed "Normal Shutdown" procedures. If
      thunderstorms are forecast overnight or observed nearby at sunset, follow computer and
      telescope "Complete Shutdown" procedures instead.
      3.3.4.3. As necessary, leave notes for the next day's early shift addressing topics
      normally covered in a shift briefing. EXAMPLE: If a "Complete Shutdown" was
      performed at sunset, inform the morning analyst that extra power up steps will be
      necessary.
3.4. Semiautomatic Operations.
   3.4.1. Attempt semiautomatic operations whenever automatic operations cannot be
   established or maintained (e.g., computer or equipment outage, clouds, or low light levels).
   Follow observing routines, analysis techniques, and reporting requirements specified
   elsewhere in this chapter.
   3.4.2. Initiation. Notify the field (SPACEWOC, SWPC, and other SOON observatories) via
   a patrol (STATS) message whenever semiautomatic patrol is initiated or terminated. If
   unable to transmit messages, telephone the 2WS SPACEWOC. If applicable, ask the
   SPACEWOC to inform SWPC or other observatories.
   3.4.3. Flare Analysis.
      3.4.3.1. Use the Monitor Overlay method or SOON Rehost for making flare area
      measurements.
          3.4.3.1.1. Check and recalculate, if required, the Monitor Overlay site correction
          factor anytime an adjustment is done which could affect the TV image (e.g., Hα light
          path or vidicon alignment). Check and recalculate, if required, the monitor overlay
          site correction anytime an Hα light path alignment is performed (except for minor
          focus adjustments).
          3.4.3.1.2. Do not adjust the height or width controls, since this will affect the
          accuracy of the site correction factor.
 28                                                      AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


       3.4.3.2. As an aid to making brightness (intensity) measurements, each site will develop
       local Doppler shift tables, which list the correct Automatic Gain Control (AGC), 1-
       Angstrom, and 1/2-Angstrom settings for each off-band measurement. Use these tables to
       determine a flare's intensity category as described in Chapter 6. You can also use the
       DALAS off-band measurement capabilities located in the Analysis Console Window.
       3.4.3.3. In automatic mode, a flare must attain a corrected area of at least 10 millionths
       of the solar hemisphere above intensity thresholds before it can be categorized as an F, N,
       or B flare. In semiautomatic mode, this requirement is waived for the N and B thresholds,
       when off-band measurements are sufficient. However, the sampled activity must still
       meet the criteria of total corrected area (equal to or greater than 10 millionths of the solar
       hemisphere) to be declared a flare.
3.5. Event-level Activity.
   3.5.1. Optical Event Thresholds.
       3.5.1.1. All 2B, 3F, 3N, 3B, 4F, 4N, 4B flares.
       3.5.1.2. Impulsive limb activity (spray, surge, eruptive prominence, etc) which attains a
       radial extent of 0.15 solar radius or greater above the limb (or from the point of origin for
       combined disk/limb activity).
       3.5.1.3. Disk or limb Loop Prominence System (normally a post-flare phenomenon),
       whether or not the causative flare was observed.
   3.5.2. Reports. Send required data reports as soon as possible, not to exceed time limits
   specified below and summarized in Attachment 4.
   3.5.3. Event-level Flares.
       3.5.3.1. Transmit a preliminary event-level FLARE message within 2 minutes after event
       threshold start if in automatic mode (15 minutes if in semiautomatic). Note: A new
       preliminary message must be sent anytime an in-progress, event-level FLARE increases
       in either area or brightness to a higher threshold. This will enable SPACEWOC to
       maintain situational awareness throughout the FLARE life-cycle and issue warnings
       accordingly.
       3.5.3.2. Transmit a final FLARE message within 10 minutes of flare end if in automatic
       mode (20 minutes if in semiautomatic).
   3.5.4. Event-level DALAS Activity.
       3.5.4.1. Transmit a preliminary event-level DALAS message within 10 minutes after
       event identification, whether in automatic or semiautomatic mode. NOTE: Extra
       preliminary DALAS code messages may be appropriate.
       3.5.4.2. Transmit a final DALAS code message within 20 minutes of activity end,
       whether in automatic or semiautomatic mode.
   3.5.5. Hard Copies. After an event-level flare, analysts must run Flare Analysis tools and
   make hard copies for post-analysis, quality assurance, and training purposes. Contractor-
   operated sites shall forward these hard copies monthly to the AFWA Contract Office
   Representative (COR).
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  29


3.6. Common Event Procedures.
   3.6.1. MANOP Headers. Select the appropriate event (SXXX60 EVENT or SXXX61
   prelim) or routine (AXXX61 optical) MANOP header IAW guidance provided in this
   manual, AFMAN 15-124, and AFWAI 15-2. For event-level activity in progress when patrol
   is acquired (either at sunrise or after a break in patrol), consult paragraph 3.1.3.
   3.6.2. Event-Level Messages. Between sunrise and sunset, transmit an event-level
   preliminary message within timeliness criteria when:
      3.6.2.1. Any event threshold is reached at the observatory.
      3.6.2.2. Another observatory sends an initial (SXXX61) event-level FLARE, DALAS,
      BURST or SWEEP message and you have criteria meeting event thresholds. If no
      thresholds are met or observation is not possible due to clouds etc. respond with the
      appropriate EVENT code message.
      3.6.2.3. An event is in progress and another event threshold is reached at the observatory
      or at another site.
   3.6.3. Event Message Acknowledgment. The SPACEWOC decodes all BURST, SWEEP,
   DALAS, FLARE, EVENT SXXX60, and SXXX61 prelim MANOP header messages in real-
   time.
      3.6.3.1. If the solar event exceeds supported operator established criteria (optical flare
      2B, 3B, 4B, 3F, 4F, 3N and 4N), the SPACEWOC issues a warning.
         3.6.3.1.1. The SPACWOC issues a WOXX51 KGWC bulletin for optical flares equal
         to or greater than 3B.
         3.6.3.1.2. The SPACEWOC issues a WOXX50 KGWC bulletin when solar x-ray
         flux (as measured by GOES spacecraft) equals or exceeds M1. When x-ray data is
         unavailable, the SPACEWOC issues a WOXX50 KGWC if an optical flare equal to
         or greater than 2B occurs.
      3.6.3.2. If the observatory does not receive a warning within 3 minutes of event
      transmission, call the SPACEWOC and retransmit the event message.
      3.6.3.3. If transmission of an event-level message is precluded for any reason, phone the
      SPACEWOC immediately.
      3.6.3.4. Continue attempts to make rapid event notifications until the warning is
      received, a phone call is completed, or 15 minutes have elapsed from the time when event
      criteria or maximum was reached.
      3.6.3.5. Retransmit any activity messages issued but not included in the summary
      reports. Include a PLAIN remark stating the reason for the retransmission.
      3.6.3.6. Review summary bulletins throughout the day, at least once per observing shift.
   3.6.4. REQST Message. When responding to a REQST message (TXXX50) from the
   SPACEWOC, observatories will respond with observed data within 2 minutes using the
   appropriate EVENT code IAW guidance in AFMAN 15-124, Chapter 6.

                           SUNSPOT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

4.1. Sunspot Properties.
   4.1.1. Sunspots. Sunspots are relatively dark patches on the solar photosphere. This is
   because strong vertical magnetic fields cool photospheric gases (from about 5800 K to 3800
   K) and decreases radiation output. This darker area is called umbra (Latin for “shadow”).
   Sunspots are not black; they would still be bright to human eyes; however, when
   photospheric brightness is filtered, sunspot umbrae appear very dark. Larger sunspots are
   often surrounded by a less dark striated fringes called penumbra (“next to shadow”), where
   the vertical magnetic fields in the umbra branch out more horizontally near the edges of the
   sunspot. Sunspot diameters vary in size up to 100,000 kilometers (about 2500 millionths of
   the solar hemisphere).
   4.1.2. Sunspot Groups. A sunspot exhibits a magnetic polarity: north or south. Sunspots tend
   to form in what are called sunspot groups, which contains spots of both polarities, connected
   by magnetic fields looping upward into the solar atmosphere. Spot groups rotate with the sun
   from east to west (left to right on the solar disk, north being up). In a group, there are
   normally two dominant sunspots, one of each magnetic polarity, roughly oriented on an east-
   west line. Of these, the leading spot (also called the leader, preceding, or western spot)
   usually is the first to form, is the first to develop penumbra, becomes the largest, has the
   strongest magnetic field, and is the last to dissipate in the group. The leader is normally
   situated closer to the equator than the trailing spot (also called the trailer, following, or
   eastern spot). This “tilt” in the group’s major axis is evident in both solar hemispheres. When
   there exists a sunspot group with only one magnetic polarity (“unipolar”), its magnetic field
   that loops back into the surrounding photosphere is too weak to cause visible spots of the
   opposite polarity.
   4.1.3. Sunspot Motion. Sunspot groups rotate with the sun; however, individual spots also
   move with respect to each other. Such relative motion is measured with respect to the
   rotating Carrington coordinate system (see 1.3.3.3.2.) and is called "proper motion". The
   proper motion of sunspots is caused by magnetic flux emerging from the photosphere and by
   differential solar rotation. The sun does not rotate as a solid body like the earth. Instead, it
   rotates as a fluid: slowest at the solar poles and fastest at the solar equator, with a gradual
   change in speed in between described as differential rotation. . Because the leader sunspot in
   a group usually lies at lower solar latitude than the trailer spot, differential rotation slowly
   widens the longitudinal separation between these spots (Figure 4.1). Once a sunspot group
   reaches its maximum longitudinal width, its proper motion usually stabilizes, or the group
   decays as its magnetic fields weaken. Sunspots within a region will occasionally converge or
   revolve around each other), or a major individual spot may rotate about its own axis. These
   relative motions tend intensify magnetic fields, gradients, or shear, which increases the
   potential for flare activity (sudden releases of magnetic tension).
   4.1.4. Spot Growth and Decay. Individual spots may last a few hours to a few weeks, while a
   sunspot group may persist several months. Sunspot formation begins as short-lived tiny spots
   called “pores”. Excellent or good seeing conditions are required to see such small features. If
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  31


   the magnetic fields strengthen and continue to emerge, pores become more persistent and
   mature into sunspots.

Figure 4.1. Proper Motion of Sunspots




      4.1.4.1. The growth and decay rate of individual spots in a group varies. Growth (or
      decay) is identified by an increase (or decrease) in umbral darkness, in umbral/penumbral
      area, or in the number of intermediate spots. Growth rate is generally more significant in
      portending flare activity than an equivalent decay rate. The more rapid the growth or
      decay, the more significant its reflection of flare activity. Growth in one segment of a
      group accompanied by decay in another segment is equally significant.

      4.1.4.2. "Light bridges" appear as bright material extending across an umbra. They
      usually form slowly and may last up to several days. Rapid formation of light bridges
      often precedes rapid spot fragmentation and increased flare activity.
4.2. White Light Seeing Categories.
   4.2.1. Seeing = 1 (Very poor).
      4.2.1.1. Extreme limb movement observed. Faculae (see 5.1.1.) are not visible.
      4.2.1.2. Sunspots on the disk appear blurry with no definite shape. Separation between
      umbral areas in large spots is not detectable. Penumbrae are ill-defined.
      4.2.1.3. No pores, granulation (cellular brightness pattern in the photosphere), or small
      sunspots are visible.
   4.2.2. Seeing = 2 (Poor).
      4.2.2.1. Moderate limb movement observed. Faculae and spots near the limb lack
      definite outlines.
      4.2.2.2. Spots on the disk are badly blurred. Small spots are visible, but those closely
      spaced seem to merge. No details are detectable in penumbral areas, and umbrae lack
      definite outlines.
      4.2.2.3. No pores or granulation are visible.
   4.2.3. Seeing = 3 (Fair).
      4.2.3.1. Image movement is observed on the limb and disk. Faculae near the limb have
      definite outline but are slightly blurred.
      4.2.3.2. Small spots are blurred, large spots are only slightly blurred. Umbrae and
      penumbrae are well separated, but with very little fine structure visible.
      4.2.3.3. Pores and granulation are occasionally visible.
   4.2.4. Seeing = 4 (Good).
      4.2.4.1. Only slight limb movement is noticeable. Faculae near the limb are sharply
      defined. Small umbrae near the limb are detectable.
      4.2.4.2. Small details are visible within the large penumbral areas on the disk.
      Boundaries of penumbral and umbral areas are well-defined. Light bridges, if any, are
      detectable.
      4.2.4.3. Spots, pores, and granulation are visible, but show slight movement.
   4.2.5. Seeing = 5 (Excellent).
      4.2.5.1. Limbs are extremely stable (show no movement). Faculae and small spots near
      the limb are clearly defined and stable.
      4.2.5.2. Boundaries of penumbrae and umbrae are sharply defined and show no motion.
      Very fine detail is observable within penumbral areas on the disk.
      4.2.5.3. Small spots, pores, and granulation are sharply defined.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                              33


Figure 4.2. Modified-Zurich Sunspot Classification System.




4.3. Modified-Zurich Sunspot Classification System. This classification system, developed
by Patrick McIntosh while he was at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Space Environment Laboratory, is based on a sunspot group's appearance in white light. There
are three components to the system: sunspot class, penumbral class, and sunspot distribution
(Figure 4.2 previous page).
   4.3.1. Unipolar and Bipolar Groups.
34                                                     AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


     4.3.1.1. A unipolar group matches only one magnetic field polarity. It is defined as a
     single spot (Class H) or a compact cluster of spots (Class A) with the greatest separation
     between spots less than 3º. In the case of a group with a single encompassing penumbra
     greatest separation is defined as the distance between the center of the largest umbra and
     the nearest edge of its penumbra. Due to the width of the principal spot, such a group
     may have an overall length (along its major axis) of up to 5º. NOTE: degree distances
     are assumed to be heliographic degrees.
     4.3.1.2. A bipolar group contained both magnetic polarities. It is defined as two or more
     spots forming a group with a major axis length of 3º or greater. Often there is a space
     near the middle of the group that defines the separation of opposite magnetic polarities.
     4.3.1.3. The definitions above are based on traditional white light observations.
     Magnetograph inversion line analysis may indicate that a group is unipolar even though
     its length is 3º or greater, or bipolar even though its length is less than 3º. In such cases,
     report the sunspot class based on the magnetograph or inversion line analysis and flag the
     unusual situation with a PLAIN language remark appended to the coded SPOTS report.
  4.3.2. Sunspot Class. There are seven classes in this component of the system. Each class
  represents an evolutionary stage a sunspot group may exhibit during the course of its
  development and decay. When determining sunspot class, use the length of a sunspot group
  between the outermost extremities of the group's leading and trailing ends. Measure this
  length along the group's major axis (Figure 4.3). NOTE: The overall length of a spot group
  is often called “longitudinal extent”; however, this term is misleading because it implies a
  strictly east-west measurement, since the group’s major axis may not be parallel to latitude
  lines.
     4.3.2.1. A - Unipolar group with no penumbra; length is normally less than 3°.
     Exceptions are supported by magnetographic analyses.
     4.3.2.2. B - Bipolar group with no penumbra; length is normally 3° or greater.
     Exceptions are supported by magnetographic analyses.
     4.3.2.3. C - Bipolar group with penumbra on spots of one polarity only, usually the spots
     at one end of an elongated group.
     4.3.2.4. D - Bipolar group with penumbra on spots of both polarities. The group's length
     is less than or equal to 10°.
     4.3.2.5. E - Bipolar group with penumbra on spots of both polarities. The group's length
     is greater than 10°, but less than or equal to 15°.
     4.3.2.6. F - Bipolar group with penumbra on spots of both polarities. The group's length
     exceeds 15°.
     4.3.2.7. H - Unipolar group with penumbra. The principal spot is usually the leader spot
     remaining from an old bipolar group.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  35


Figure 4.3. Sunspot Group Length and Penumbral Diameter.




   4.3.3. Penumbral Class. Penumbra appears as the gray area surrounding the umbra. If an
   apparent gray area is too indistinct to be drawn, do not report it. To determine penumbral
   class, use symmetry and size of the largest penumbra of a sunspot in the group. When using
   the penumbral diameter criteria below, measure the N-S axis of the spot. NOTE: A N-S
   measurement standardizes the effect of geometric foreshortening, which increases the closer
   a spot is to the solar limb in any radial direction from the sun's center. Since most sunspot
   groups are located less than 40º latitude, N-S spot diameter ensures foreshortening effects
   remain constant as the group rotates across the solar disk
      4.3.3.1. x - No penumbra.
      4.3.3.2. r - Rudimentary penumbra. Incomplete, irregular penumbra. It is brighter than
      mature penumbra. Its fine structure is mottled or granular instead of filamentary.
      4.3.3.3. s - Small symmetric penumbra. Mature, dark, circular or elliptical penumbra
      with filamentary fine structure. The N-S diameter of the penumbra is 2.5° or less. This
      class includes penumbrae that appear elliptical due to the effect of geometric
      foreshortening. Symmetric penumbrae usually contain either a single umbra or a compact
      cluster of umbrae near the center.
      4.3.3.4. a - Small asymmetric penumbra. Mature, dark, irregular (clearly not circular or
      elliptical) penumbra with filamentary fine structure. The N-S diameter of the penumbra is
      2.5° or less. The asymmetry is "real", not just due to foreshortening effects. Asymmetric
      penumbrae usually contain two or more umbrae scattered within it.
      4.3.3.5. h - Large symmetric penumbra. Has the same characteristics as a small
      symmetric (s) penumbra, but with a N-S diameter greater than 2.5° (normally
      corresponding to an area greater than about 250 millionths of the solar hemisphere).

      4.3.3.6. k - Large asymmetric penumbra. Has the same characteristic as a small
      asymmetric (a) penumbra, but with an N-S diameter greater than 2.5° (normally
      corresponding to an area greater than about 250 millionths of the solar hemisphere).
   4.3.4. Sunspot Distribution. This component of the Modified-Zurich Sunspot Classification
   System indicates the density of a group's internal spot population. The "o", "i", and "c"
   distribution classes are limited to bipolar groups (Classes B through F). The “x” distribution
   class is reserved for unipolar groups (Classes A and H). Such logical restrictions on
   combining sunspot class, penumbral class, and sunspot distribution limit the number of
   possible classifications in the Modified-Zurich Sunspot Classification System to a total of 60
   combinations. Table 4.1 summarizes allowed combinations.
      4.3.4.1. x - Undefined distribution; used to classify a single spot or unipolar spot group.
      4.3.4.2. o - Open. Few, if any, spots exist between the leader and trailer spots. Any
      interior spots are very small umbral spots or pores.
      4.3.4.3. i - Intermediate. Many spots lie between the leading and trailing portions of the
      group, but none of them possesses a mature, well-defined penumbra.
      4.3.4.4. c - Compact. The area between the leading and trailing ends of the spot group is
      populated with many strong spots, with at least one interior spot possessing mature
      penumbra. An extreme case has the entire spot group enveloped in one continuous
      penumbral area.

4.4. Mount Wilson Magnetic Classification System.
   4.4.1. Information to help determine a Mount Wilson magnetic class is obtained from
   computer generated magnetic maps, manual inversion line analyses, or other approved
   observing techniques. The magnetic polarities of individual sunspots in a group and the
   distribution of surrounding plage (see 5.1.3.) form the basis for this system. The three major
   classes are Alpha (unipolar), Beta (bipolar), and Gamma (complex). A special magnetic sub-
   classification, Delta , exists when an inversion line separates umbrae of opposite polarity
   within the same penumbral area. An example of each class is shown in Figure 4.4.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    37


Figure 4.4. Mount Wilson Magnetic Classification System.




   4.4.2. Alpha (α). A single spot or unipolar spot group, around which the distribution of
   plage (see 5.1.3.) is fairly symmetrical. Magnetic field measurements show that unipolar
   groups are often accompanied by an area of opposite polarity where sunspots are not visible.
   This class is reported by USAF observatories.
      4.4.2.1. Alpha (αp) . The magnetic field polarity in and around the spot(s) corresponds
      to the expected polarity for leader spots in the hemisphere for the current solar cycle. The
      spot(s) and adjacent plage are followed by an elongated area of plage or faculae of the
      opposite polarity. This subclass is not reported by USAF observatories.

      4.4.2.2. Alpha (αf). The magnetic field polarity in and around the spot(s) corresponds to
      the expected polarity for trailer spots in the hemisphere for that cycle. The spot(s) and
      adjacent plage are preceded by an elongated area of plage or faculae of the opposite
      polarity. This subclass is not reported by USAF observatories.
   4.4.3. Beta (β). A bipolar group where magnetic field strengths and spot areas indicate a
   balance between the leader and trailer spots. The polarities show a clear separation. This
   class is reported by USAF observatories.
      4.4.3.1. Beta p (βp). A bipolar group in which the magnetic field strengths and spot
      areas indicate that the leader spots are dominant. This subclass is not reported by USAF
      observatories.
      4.4.3.2. Beta (βf). A bipolar group in which the magnetic field strengths and spot areas
      indicate that the trailer spots are dominant. This subclass is not reported by USAF
      observatories.
   4.4.4. Beta-gamma (βγ). A spot group that has Beta (bipolar) characteristics, but is lacking a
   well defined dividing line between regions of opposite polarity. This class includes cases in
   which spots of the opposite or “wrong” polarity accompany the leader or trailer regions. This
   subclass is reported by USAF observatories.
   4.4.5. Gamma (γ). A spot group in which the polarities are completely intermixed. This
   class is reported by USAF observatories.
   4.4.6. Beta-delta (βδ). A spot group, which has Beta characteristics, but has umbrae of
   opposite polarity inside the same penumbra. This subclass is reported by USAF
   observatories.
   4.4.7. Beta-gamma-delta (βγδ). A spot group, which has Beta-gamma characteristics, but
   has umbrae of opposite polarity inside the same penumbra. This subclass is reported by
   USAF observatories.
   4.4.8. Gamma-delta (γδ). A spot group, which has Gamma characteristics, but has umbrae
   of opposite polarity inside the same penumbra. This subclass is reported by USAF
   observatories.
4.5. Sunspot Drawing Procedures.
   4.5.1. Complete the legend block of the AFWA Form 21 and align the worksheet on the
   white light projection board for the correct P-angle.
   4.5.2. Check the focus and size of the projected solar image prior to starting the drawing.
   NOTE: If necessary, adjust the white light focusing knob and projection board position to
   ensure an 18 cm diameter image is in focus on the board. There is a seasonal variation in
   image size due to changes in the earth-sun distance. These adjustments may be required as
   often as daily around solar perihelion (early January) and as infrequently as 2-3 weeks
   around aphelion (early July). Movement of the white light focusing knob may also affect
   image dimension at the guider assembly. To ensure accurate tracking and positioning, run the
   Optical Calibration program.
   4.5.3. Use a short, finely pointed, hard lead pencil. Ensure the pencil has a good eraser.
   Avoid hitting the surface of the mirror with the pencil since the eraser will leave a mark.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     39


   4.5.4. Annotate drawing start time on the form. Carefully outline each umbra and penumbra
   with a fine line. Precisely blacken in the umbrae.
   4.5.5. Move a white card back and forth over the worksheet to help define sunspots and
   eliminate effect of tiny imperfections in the worksheet. This also allows comparison between
   the actual and drawn images. Place an “X” over imperfections that could be mistaken for
   sunspots.
   4.5.6. Annotate drawing finish time on the form. The time of the observation is the midpoint
   of the drawing process.
4.6. Data Reduction Procedures.
   4.6.1. Assign local and SWPC sunspot numbers.
      4.6.1.1. Start the local number sequence with 001 for the first new sunspot group
      observed after the beginning of a new calendar year.
      4.6.1.2. Carefully maintain numbering continuity from day-to-day. However, use a new
      local number when a previously numbered spot group disappears, then later reforms.
      4.6.1.3. Include SWPC assigned region numbers, when available. NOTE: Check other
      spot reports and all SWPC messages for information on newly-assigned SWPC regions.
   4.6.2. Assign a seeing quality of the observation. Refer to the white light seeing categories in
   paragraph 4.2.
   4.6.3. Determine each sunspot group's location and length using the appropriate Stonyhurst
   overlay. When selecting a Stonyhurst overlay, round the B-angle (Bo) up if it is x.5º or
   greater, and round it down if it is x.4º or less.
      4.6.3.1. The sunspot group's location is defined as the geometric center of the group
      (latitude and longitude). Label the coordinates for each sunspot group on the sunspot
      analysis worksheet.
      4.6.3.2. Measure the length of a group (often called "longitudinal extent") between the
      outermost extremities of the group's leading and trailing ends. Express the results in
      heliographic degrees. Make the measurement along the group's major axis (Figure 4.3).
      NOTE: The overall length of a spot group is often called “longitudinal extent”; however,
      this term is misleading because it implies a strictly east-west measurement, since the
      group’s major axis may not be parallel to latitude lines.
          4.6.3.2.1. If the major axis of a spot group is inclined more than about 45º to latitude
          lines: Visualize a right triangle formed by the major axis, the latitude lines, and the
          longitude lines. Measure the change in latitude in degrees, and the change in
          longitude in degrees. Compute the group's length in degrees:


          4.6.3.2.2. If the major axis of a spot group is inclined less than about 45º to latitude
          lines: Lay a ruler or the straight edge of a piece of paper along the major axis and note
          its length or mark the length on the paper. Rotate the ruler (or paper edge) around the
          center of the group, so the ruler (or paper edge) is parallel to the latitude lines. Read

         the group's (approximate) length directly off the Stonyhurst overlay in heliographic
         degrees.
  4.6.4. Determine the total (penumbral and umbral) uncorrected area of each sunspot group
  using the sunspot area overlay.
     4.6.4.1. Place the sunspot area overlay on top of a drawn spot. Select the overlay circle
     or ellipse whose outline best matches the outline drawn for penumbral areas or encloses
     individual umbra without penumbra. For very irregular penumbra, it may be necessary to
     break it down into imaginary circles or ellipses to make the measurement. If the area is
     less than 10 millionths, determine the area by estimating the fraction of the 10 millionths
     circle it fills.
     4.6.4.2. Repeat the step above for each spot in a group. Add the areas of all the spots in
     the group to get the total uncorrected group area.
  4.6.5. Determine the total corrected area of each sunspot group using the limb foreshortening
  overlay.
     4.6.5.1. Center the limb foreshortening overlay on the sunspot drawing and rotate it so
     that the N/S line of the overlay corresponds with the N/S line of the form and runs from
     the sun center through the geometric center of the group. The "hash mark" across the
     group's center represents a limb foreshortening correction factor.
         4.6.5.1.1. If the group's center is between two hash marks use the smaller correction
         factor (i.e. the hash mark closer to the disk center) no matter which hash mark is
         closest to the group’s center.
         4.6.5.1.2. If the group's center lies below the 1.1 hash mark, give it a correction
         factor of 1.
         4.6.5.1.3. If the group's center lies beyond the 3.0 hash mark, give it a correction
         factor of 3.
     4.6.5.2. To calculate a group's corrected spot area (in millionths of the solar hemisphere)
     multiply the total uncorrected spot area by the foreshortening correction factor. Report
     each group's area in whole increments of 10 millionths of the solar hemisphere rounded
     up or down as appropriate.
     4.6.5.2.1. Round corrected spot areas whose last digit is 5 or higher up to the nearest 10
     millionth of the solar hemisphere. (i.e. a corrected sunspot area of 66 millionths would
     be rounded up to 70 millionths and encoded as 007).
     4.6.5.2.2. Round corrected spot areas whose last digit is 4 or lower down to the nearest
     10 millionth of the solar hemisphere. (i.e. a corrected sunspot area of 123 millionths
     would be rounded down to 120 millionths and encoded as 012).
     4.6.5.2.3. Spot groups who’s corrected spot area is 4 millionths of the solar hemisphere
     or less will be encoded as 000.
  4.6.6. The number of spots in a sunspot group is the number of distinct umbrae (or dark
  cores) visible, for example, two umbrae surrounded by the same penumbral area count as two
  spots.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  41


  4.6.7. Determine the Modified-Zurich Classification (spot class, penumbra type, and
  distribution) from the spot drawing. Use the length of the sunspot group (measured as
  specified in this chapter) in determining spot class.
  4.6.8. Determine the magnetic classification using any means of magnetic field analyses
  available. Particularly useful is the technique of overlapping a magnetic map on an Mg-b2
  image.
  4.6.9. As a final check before transmitting an encoded Sunspot Code (SPOTS) report IAW
  AFMAN 15-124, compare the sunspot locations against data from other observatories and
  the AXXX02 KWNP Joint United States Air Force / National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration (USAF/NOAA) Solar Region Summary bulletin. If a significant deviation
  exists, recheck the location with the white light projection board and Stonyhurst overlay
  (correct P-angle and Bo used). Serious errors can result if Hα and white light imaging
  systems are not colinear. To detect lack of colinearity, perform two image rotator checks: one
  at the white light board, and the other on the Hα monitor. Lack of colinearity can be detected
  by comparing the sunspot analysis worksheet coordinates for a particular spot with the
  coordinates obtained by the DALAS Analysis Console.

            ACTIVE REGION AND MAGNETIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

5.1. Active Region Analysis.
   5.1.1. A solar active region is an area where strengthening of magnetic fields has
   concentrated atmospheric plasma to make it denser, hotter, and brighter than the surrounding
   atmosphere. These regions are observed in the upper photosphere as white light faculae, in
   the chromosphere as plage, and often in the corona as coronal condensations (see 5.8). The
   enhanced magnetic fields in active regions often become complex and are responsible for
   nearly all flare activity and most disk and limb activity.
   5.1.2. Faculae. Faculae (plural of facula, Latin for “little torch”) are bright patches (also
   known as "white light plage") in the upper photosphere, located in areas of enhanced
   magnetic fields, and are associated with existing sunspots or possible sunspot development.
   They are normally visible only near the limb, where limb darkening provides favorable
   contrast. Since magnetic fields associated with active regions diverge with height, facular
   structure has finer detail than chromospheric plage.
   5.1.3. Plage. Plage (“beach” in French) is chromospheric indication of an active region and
   is visible in Hα imagery. Tables 5.1 and 5.2 list criteria to determine plage compactness and
   intensity. NOTE: Plage normally takes no plural (sort of like the word “turf”).
      5.1.3.1. Each class of plage compactness roughly corresponds to a stage in the
      development and decay of an active region. New, young regions tend to be compact. As
      the region ages, magnetic fields and associated plage tend to spread over a wider area.
      5.1.3.2. Since weaker magnetic fields can produce plage and faculae than can form a
      sunspot, plage and faculae generally develop before and dissipate after any associated
      sunspots. In fact, not all plage or faculae develop sunspots. In Hα observations, plage can
      obscure underlying sunspots.

                   Scattered             ≥ 20 to < 40

                   Scattered to Broken ≥ 40 to < 60

Table 5.2. Plage Intensity Descriptions.
 Intensity Description

              Faint Plage. Barely visible with diffuse edges; i.e., just above the contrast
 1
              sensitivity detection threshold.

              Moderate Faint. Clearly visible and moderately distinct with good seeing and light
 2
              level. Visible to about ± 0.2 Angstrom off-band.

 3            Normal. Visible to about ± 0.35 Angstrom off-band.

              Bright. Visible to about ± 0.5 Angstrom off-band. Generally associated with new
 4            emerging regions with strong magnetic gradients along complex neutral lines. May
              reach intensities equal to faint flares in strong or rapidly emerging regions.

              Flare Bright. Generally visible to ± 0.5 Angstrom off-band. Distinguished from
 5            flares by slow rise time and long duration. Normally confined to only points or
              segments within a region.

        5.1.3.3. Point Brightenings. Very localized point enhancements in plage intensity that
        collectively, at any one moment, do not reach the minimal area needed to declare a flare
        (i.e., their total corrected area is less than 10 millionths of the solar hemisphere). Point
        brightenings may be of faint, normal, or brilliant intensity. They generally rise in
        intensity and return to their pre-enhanced level in a short period of time, typically 10
        minutes or less. They may occur as single points, or as a series of continuously rising and
        falling points. At times, they may brighten rapidly and remain at, or near, flare intensity
        for up to several hours. NOTE: "Point brightenings" are a plage—not flare—
        characteristic. As such, they are reported in a PLAIN—not FLARE—code report. Do not
        confuse point brightenings with the flare characteristics "brilliant points", "bright points",
        or "several eruptive centers". These flare characteristics are defined in chapter 6.
        5.1.3.4. Plage Fluctuations. Plage fluctuations exhibit lower intensities than flares
        (seldom greater than 50% above background), have slower rates of intensity change (no
        flash phase), are usually less defined than flares, and are not identifiable beyond about
        +0.5 Angstrom off-band in Hα. Occasionally they slowly rise to flare intensity and may
        remain near that level for several hours. Portions of these fluctuations can exhibit flash
        phase characteristics and should be classified as flares. The most enhanced, extensive,
        and long-lived plage fluctuations occur in magnetically intense, complex areas, and their
        effects (x-ray and radio emissions, etc.) can be similar to those of a flare.
5.2. Hα Seeing Categories.
     5.2.1. Seeing = 1 (Very Poor).
        5.2.1.1. Image movement is usually obvious with rippling waves sweeping across the
        disk.

      5.2.1.2. Only sizeable features such as plage and large filaments are visible. Plage
      brightness appears as homogeneous blob. Only major changes may be detected in large
      prominences.
      5.2.1.3. Small (around 10 millionths of the solar hemisphere) faint and normal subflares
      (importance of 0) are usually not discernible.
      5.2.1.4. When viewing off-band, the observer cannot distinguish between umbrae and
      penumbrae, even in large spots.
   5.2.2. Seeing = 2 (Poor).
      5.2.2.1. Image movement is observed.
      5.2.2.2. Brightness variations between plage areas may be seen. Point brightenings may
      be observed, but appear as small, ill-defined patches of fluctuating plage.
      5.2.2.3. Filament channels begin to appear. Minor limb activity, such as small Active
      Surge Regions (ASRs), may not be observed.
      5.2.2.4. Small, faint subflares may not be observed.
   5.2.3. Seeing = 3 (Fair).
      5.2.3.1. Some image movement may be observed on both the disk and limb.
      5.2.3.2. Arch Filament Systems (AFS) are plainly visible. Narrow active region
      filaments may be seen.
      5.2.3.3. Filament channels are generally well-defined. Minor limb activity is visible.
      5.2.3.4. Fibril structure is moderately distinct around strong spots. When viewing off-
      band, umbrae and penumbrae can be distinguished.
   5.2.4. Seeing = 4 (Good).
      5.2.4.1. AFSs are well defined. Narrow active region filaments are sharply defined.
      Plage point brightenings appear as sharp, well-defined points.
      5.2.4.2. Individual spikes in small ASRs are clearly separated from each other.
      5.2.4.3. Chromospheric fine structure is moderately distinct at Hα line center and off-
      band.
   5.2.5. Seeing = 5 (Excellent).
      5.2.5.1. No limb movement is observed.
      5.2.5.2. Fine hairline filaments are sharply visible.
      5.2.5.3. Active region fibril structure and chromospheric fine structure are sharply
      defined.
      5.2.5.4. When viewing off-band, both umbrae and penumbrae are sharply defined.
5.3. Computer Generated Magnetic Maps.
   5.3.1. Use the SOON telescope's magnetograph subsystem to generate magnetic maps
   (called magnetograms) for use in analyzing the magnetic complexity of active regions (i.e.,
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      45


  inversion line locations; field polarities, intensities, gradients, and Mount Wilson sunspot
  classifications). Use the Spectrograph program to acquire magnetograms.
  5.3.2. The magnetograph exploits the Zeeman Effect (see 1.1.6.3.2.). Since magnetograms
  display only the line-of-sight portion of the magnetic field, geometric foreshortening
  decreases resolution and accuracy nearer the limbs. Thus, even if a region's magnetic field
  strength remains constant throughout its disk transit, it would seem to strengthen as it crosses
  the central meridian and then weaken as it moves toward the west limb.
  5.3.3. Preliminary steps required before running the Spectrograph.
     5.3.3.1. Ensure a good magnetic reference region (MAGR) analysis box exists. Locate
     MAGR as near as possible to disk center with a minimum 150 x 150 arc seconds in size
     and is as devoid of features (e.g., plage, filaments, etc) as possible. The Spectrograph
     uses this region for magnetic calibrations, initial Doppler cube centering, and phase plate
     optimization.
     5.3.3.2. Determine those regions on which to perform magnetic analysis using the
     Spectrograph program.
     5.3.3.3. Place the calibration polaroid over the objective lens.
     5.3.3.4. Ensure the following are properly adjusted:
         5.3.3.4.1. The right hand edge of the large scale SG lens is at its proper setting.
         Note: Analysts should not adjust the SG lens setting. The correct setting is
         determined by local maintenance personnel. If setting is suspect, contact local
         maintenance personnel for assistance.
         5.3.3.4.2. The slit-jaw micrometer is set at 1.25 mm (125 microns).
         5.3.3.4.3. The slit carriage assembly is in the PE position, and "NORM" is selected
         on the slit function knob.
         5.3.3.4.4. The Grating, Focus, and Shift dial is set to locally established values.
         NOTE: The final rotation of the Grating dial should be a counterclockwise move to
         compensate for any play in the linkage.
         5.3.3.4.5. Spectrograph filter wheel is set at filter 11.
         5.3.3.4.6. Magnetograph slide assembly beam-splitter lever is in the "up" position,
         and the 10830 Angstrom beam-splitter is pulled out.
         5.3.3.4.7. Magnetograph slide assembly is in the full "in" position (toward the optical
         bench).
     5.3.3.5. Ensure all servo modules are in the "AUTO" position, and the SG lens control is
     in the "COMP" position. Set the DZA gain to the locally determined value in order to
     achieve a proper photodiode plot.
  5.3.4. Run the Spectrograph program IAW guidance contained in the SOONSUM.
     5.3.4.1. Initiate centering so that the calibration polaroid lies over the junction of the slit
     and the photodiodes, as seen on the monitor.

      5.3.4.2. Execute the Diode Plot profile. If there is not a dip in the profile on each side of
      the vertical line, do the following:
          5.3.4.2.1. Move the slit carriage assembly to the Spectral/White Light (S-WL)
          position. Place the trinocular TV/Eyepiece switch to the TV position. Route the SG
          output to monitor 4 by selecting "SG" on the "Master" switcher. A split image of the
          spectral line, with lateral horizontal displacement, should be visible. NOTE: If it is
          not visible, adjust the scanner mirrors to send light to the SG, check the function knob
          on the slit carriage, check the filter wheel in front of the SG TV camera, and check
          the prism in the SG front end.
          5.3.4.2.2. Move the slit carriage until one side of the slit jaw opening is visible. Use
          the SG zoom optics to bring the slit image into sharp focus. Then use the Focus dial
          to focus the spectral line in relation to the slit.
          5.3.4.2.3. Set the Doppler "CUBE" servo module to "MANUAL" and its
          potentiometer to "500".
          5.3.4.2.4. Adjust the 8468 Angstrom spectral line position with the grating dial so the
          spectral line in the top half of the split image lies on one side of the slit and the line in
          the bottom half lies on the other side of the slit. It will be necessary to move the slit
          carriage so that one edge of the slit jaw opening is first seen, and then the other is
          seen. The spectral line segments should be positioned as equally as possible on each
          side of the slit.
          5.3.4.2.5. Return the "CUBE" servo module to the "AUTO" position, and the slit
          carriage to the "PE" position.
          5.3.4.2.6. Run the Spectrograph program again.
          5.3.4.2.7. If the dips in the profile plot now appear on each side of the vertical line,
          proceed to the next paragraph. If not, repeat the above steps for executing the diode
          plot profile.
      5.3.4.3. Select regions for Automatic Magmap analysis.
   5.3.5. After all magnetograms are acquired remove the calibration polaroid from the
   objective lens.
5.4. Magnetic Inversion Line Analysis.
   5.4.1. A magnetic inversion line (also called a transition, dividing, zero, or neutral line)
   indicates the division between areas of opposite line-of-sight magnetic polarity vertical to the
   solar surface. The terms zero or neutral line are misleading since they imply an absence of
   magnetic field, when in fact there exists a "transverse" field (horizontal or parallel to the
   sun's surface), often a strong one. Use inversion lines to determine magnetic complexity of
   active regions (and thus flare potential), or to locate boundaries between large solar areas
   with predominately positive or negative polarity (i.e., footings of solar sector boundaries
   (SSBs)).
   5.4.2. Use manual analysis of magnetic inversion lines, based on inference techniques to
   supplement computer magnetograph analysis when: the magnetograph is inoperative, in areas
   where the magnetic field strength is below the detection threshold of the magnetograph, or
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     47


  when features are smaller in scale than can be resolved by the magnetograph. For example,
  magnetograph accuracy declines with increasing radial distance from the sun's center because
  the vertical magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere become less line-of-sight. In addition,
  magnetograph analysis is often ineffective for full disk analyses. Excellent background
  material can be found in AWS-TR-76-262, Development and Decay Potential of Active Solar
  Regions from a Full-Disk Neutral-Line Analysis.
  5.4.3. Inference Techniques. In the absence of magnetograms, use Hα features such as
  filaments, fibril structure, AFSs, and plage corridors to infer the location of magnetic
  inversion lines. These features, and their relationship to inversion lines, are discussed below.
     5.4.3.1. Filaments and Prominences. Filaments are long, relatively dark, cloud-like
     structures that are suspended by magnetic fields (usually forming shallow saddle
     configuration) in the sun's atmosphere. They can develop where magnetic field lines are
     transverse (i.e., horizontal or parallel to the sun's surface) and can support relatively high
     density plasma. These transverse fields are normally found over magnetic inversion lines
     (Figure 5.1). Filaments may develop between large scale areas (solar sectors) of opposite
     polarity ("quiescent filaments") or between areas of opposite polarity within an active
     region ("plage filaments"). Plage filaments are much shorter, narrower, and lower in the
     sun's atmosphere than quiescent filaments. Since magnetic field structure in an active
     region changes relatively quickly, plage filaments vary in size, shape, and darkness (i.e.,
     density) more rapidly than quiescent filaments. Against the bright solar disk, filaments
     appear as dark absorption features; however, filaments seen above the limb appear bright
     against the black background of space and are called "prominences". Because of their
     relatively large size and ready identification, filaments can be a most useful feature to
     locate magnetic inversion lines
         5.4.3.1.1. Filaments located some distance from the center of the disk are actually
         viewed at an angle from the side. Because of this perspective, filaments often display
         “legs” or “feet”, which connect the filament to the sun's surface. Current flows along
         the feet, interacts with the magnetic field, and provides the buoyancy needed to
         suspend the filament material. The inversion line, therefore, is located at the base of
         these feet, not at the smooth, unscalloped side of the filament (Figure 5.2).
 48                                                     AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


Figure 5.1. Magnetic Field Support for a Prominence (Filament).




          5.4.3.1.2. Near a large, well-developed sunspot a filament may curve toward and
          point directly toward the spot. In this case, the inversion line departs from the path of
          the filament near the ends of the radial fibril structure and extends around the spot at
          right angles to the fibrils (Figure 5.3).
      5.4.3.2. Fibril Structure and Filament Channels. Fibrils are narrow, linear absorption
      features visible in Hα. Near filaments and sunspots with strong magnetic fields they align
      with the horizontal magnetic field lines near the sun's surface (much like iron filings near
      a magnet). Overall fibril patterns show little change over a period of hours, although the
      lifetime of an individual fibril is only 10 to 20 minutes.
          5.4.3.2.1. Patterns of parallel, curving fibrils typically connect closely-spaced regions
          of opposite polarity, giving the impression that the regions are "stitched" together.
          Fibrils may also extend radially from large sunspots with strong magnetic fields,
          forming extensions of the radial pattern seen in the penumbra. In this situation, the
          magnetic inversion line often lies perpendicular to the outer edge of the radial fibril
          pattern (Figure 5.3).
          5.4.3.2.2. Fibrils are often aligned at an angle to the filament, forming a feather-like
          pattern, with the magnetic inversion line along its rib (Figure 5.3). A "filament
          channel" is an extension of this feather-like pattern into an area where a filament
          could be supported, but no filament is observed. A filament channel normally
          develops before the filament appears and often persists long after the filament
          disappears.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  49

      5.4.3.3. Arch Filament Systems (AFS). These are dark, linear absorption features usually
      observed only in young, developing bipolar plage regions, or in Emerging Flux Regions
      (EFR). An AFS appears as a series of dark, parallel arches connecting plage of opposite
      polarity (Figure 5.4). The legs of individual arch filaments are inclined less than 30º to
      the sun's surface and the tops of the arches lie at a relatively low altitude, rarely more
      than 10,000 km. Since arch filaments, like fibrils, align with horizontal magnetic fields
      near the sun's surface, an AFS is parallel to the underlying fibril pattern, but
 50                                                    AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


      perpendicular to filament channels and plage filaments. Arch filaments are not "true"
      filaments, since they lie across (rather than along) magnetic inversion lines, and are lower
      in the chromosphere than plage filaments (Figure 5.5). The inversion line therefore
      bisects the AFS at right angles.
      5.4.3.4. Plage Corridors. Polarity changes normally do not occur within an area of bright
      plage. Usually there is a distinct division (a dark lane) between plage segments of
      opposite polarity. The division is called a "plage corridor", and an magnetic inversion
      line often lies along this corridor (Figure 5.6). Plage filaments and filament channels may
      lie along a plage corridor, while arch filaments would lie across it. The width of a plage
      filament, filament channel, or plage corridor increases as the magnetic field gradient
      across the inversion line decreases. Thus, in young active regions (with abrupt polarity
      changes) plage corridors are narrow and often difficult to observe. They are noticeably
      wider in old active regions, where magnetic fields have weakened.

5.5. Magnetic Polarities in Active Regions.
   5.5.1. Active regions are magnetically bipolar, just like associated sunspot groups that may
   form (although individual sunspots exhibit only one magnetic polarity). The positive and
   negative magnetic field strengths within an active region or spot group are usually not equal
52                                                     AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


  in intensity or area. This explains why EFRs and old regions appear unipolar: the opposite
  polarity in an EFR has not yet achieved a detectable intensity, while the opposite polarity in
  an old region has declined below detectability. As stated above in Chapter 4, the leader spot
  is usually larger and has a stronger magnetic field.
  5.5.2. The overall solar magnetic field is fairly weak: about 1.0 Gauss (compared to the
  surface of the earth’s average magnetic field of about 0.5 Gauss). This solar magnetic field is
  rather consistent and stable around the solar Polar Regions. Unlike the earth’s magnetic field,
  which is generated by electric currents in the molten iron portion of the Earth’s core, the
  sun’s overall magnetic field is thought to be the net result of turbulent motion of plasma
  beneath the photosphere, complicated by convoluted electric current systems associated with
  active regions, sunspots, and other phenomena.
     5.5.2.1. Also, unlike the earth, the sun rotates as a fluid (i.e., low latitudes rotate faster
     than high latitudes). The effect of this differential rotation on the overall solar magnetic
     field imbedded in its surface causes active regions and sunspot groups to erupt with a
     frequency that follows a cycle lasting an average of 11 years (as short as 9, as long as 14).
     This cycle is called the Solar Cycle (or the Sunspot Cycle because the number of
     sunspots corresponds with solar activity). Solar “minimum” is marked by little or no
     development of active regions and associated sunspots. Solar “maximum” is marked by
     the almost continuous development of active regions and sunspots. Solar activity from
     minimum to maximum takes about 4 years, while the decline back to minimum takes
     about 7 years.
     5.5.2.2. Another curious aspect of the solar magnetic field is that it reverses its global
     magnetic polarities sometime during high solar activity, so that a return to the original
     magnetic polarity takes two complete cycles. This longer cycle is called the “Hale” 22-
     year cycle. The leader spots in a sunspot group will almost always match the polarity that
     the nearer pole had at the start of the 11-year Solar Cycle.
     5.5.2.3. Solar cycles have been numbered since the mid 1700s. The current Solar Cycle
     (#24) began its minimum in January 2008, is expected to peak sometime in 2013, and
     will likely end sometime between 2018 and 2022. At the start of this Cycle (#24), the
     solar North Pole was magnetically negative (the South Pole was positive). Cycle 25
     would then have a positive North and a negative South leader.
     5.5.2.4. Another consequence of differential rotation and that the sun's emerging
     magnetic field is imbedded in the photosphere is that sunspot formation prefers certain
     latitudes. At the start of a cycle (solar minimum), active regions and their associated
     sunspots tend to form near 40º north and south latitude. As the cycle progresses, active
     regions and sunspots form progressively closer to the solar equator, about 15° north and
     south latitude around solar maximum. As the solar cycle winds down towards minimum,
     active regions and sunspots form within 5° of the equator. Graphing the latitude of
     sunspots over many cycles produces the famous Maunder Butterfly Diagram (Figure 5.7).
     It is common during solar minimum years that old cycle spots near the equator will
     coexist with new cycle spots at higher latitudes. New versus old sunspot groups are also
     identified by their leader spot polarity.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    53


Figure 5.7. Maunder's Butterfly Diagram. (Latitudinal variation in distribution of
sunspots with time).




   5.5.3. Computer generated magnetograms indicate the polarity of the various portions of an
   active region. To substantiate computer accuracy, an analyst can compare the computer-
   assigned polarities to what is expected based on the Cycle. For example, Cycle 24 active
   regions in the northern hemisphere should lead with negative polarity plage or spots and trail
   with positive polarity plage or spots. The opposite is true for the southern hemisphere.
   5.5.4. If a leader spot is observed to have a magnetic polarity opposite to what is expected,
   recheck the magnetic field analysis. True leader spot polarity reversals rarely occur; however,
   when they do occur, they often involve complex or unusual region configurations. Their
   occurrence is significant and should be brought to the attention of the forecast centers.
5.6. Solar Sector Boundaries.
   5.6.1. In general, opposing magnetic polarities at the solar Poles are consistent and stable;
   however, during solar maximum years, these polarities weaken, become disorganized, and
   re-strengthen with the opposite polarity through the next solar minimum. These magnetic
   polarities extend from the solar poles toward, and even cross, the equator in expansive areas
   that are punctuated by the magnetic complexities of active regions and sunspots. The
   magnetic field strength of these large areas is relatively weak (1 to 2 Gauss). Because of
   differential rotation, these broad areas stretch longitudinally to an average width of about
   100°. The northern and southern sector polarities commonly dovetail into a rough arrowhead
   pattern, which points westward (Figure 5.8). The solar sector boundary (SSB) represents the
   magnetic inversion line that separates these expansive areas of opposite magnetic polarity.
   NOTE: SSBs are currently not reported by USAF Solar Observatories.
 54                                                     AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


Figure 5.8. Solar Sectors.




Large and medium scale photospheric magnetic fields are evident in these magnetic synoptic
charts provided by Wilcox Solar Observatory. Top chart shows Solar Cycle 24 solar minimum
conditions (February 2008); bottom chart shows Cycle 24 solar maximum conditions (September
2012). Blue lines and light shading indicate positive magnetic fields; red dashed lines and darker
shading indicate negative magnetic polarities. The thick black line shows where the magnetic
inversion line indicates the SSB. During solar minimum (top), note that magnetic polarity of
solar North Pole is completely negative (connected to the red dashed area near the solar equator).
During solar maximum (bottom), note that the magnetic polarity of the Poles are mixed. Red
dashed is negative; blue is positive; black line in SSB
   5.6.2. Position of solar sectors on the sun and associated SSBs translate large-scale magnetic
   structure directly into the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The solar wind—a constant
   flow of thin plasma escaping the sun—drags a portion the solar magnetic field outward
   through the solar system and stretches it so that the field is oriented either toward or away
   from the sun (corresponding to the positive and negative sectors on the sun). The SSB can be
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      55


   traced outward from the solar surface and represents the thin boundary where the IMF
   reverses direction. Because the sun rotates, the IMF exhibits a spiral shape, and the SSB
   takes on a similar spiral shape whose ripples and waves correspond to the shape of the SSB
   at the sun’s surface (Figure 5.9). In general, an IMF sector boundary passage at the earth
   tends to follow the solar central meridian passage (CMP) of a SSB observed on the sun by
   about four to six days.

   5.6.3. The IMF and the associated SSB that separates the magnetic field directions is all but
   invisible as it sweeps past the earth; however, forecasters can infer its ever-changing shape
   by following activity and features on the sun. The shape of the IMF and the location of the
   SSB is important because it interacts with solar particle output much like a waving flag
   interacts with the wind. Also, the orientation of the IMF as it sweeps past the earth’s
   magnetic field has important implications for geomagnetic activity.
   5.6.4. Knowing the shape of the IMF and the position of the moving SSB helps forecasters
   determine whether solar events will strike the earth or entirely miss it. For example, if the sun
   discharges a stream particles or a batch of plasma that differs substantially from the speed,
   density, or magnetic orientation of the solar wind, the IMF shape and position of the SSB can
   direct the motion of such discharges.

   5.6.5. Quiescent filaments are the most useful solar feature for identifying portions of an
   inversion line associated with a SSB observed at the solar surface. The disappearance of a
   filament that previously defined a SSB may indicate changes in the strength, position, or size
   of adjacent sectors. It does not necessarily indicate the SSB has also disappeared. In fact, the
   filament may reform in or near the original location since the underlying magnetic field
   structure may not have changed.
5.7. Coronal Holes.
   5.7.1. Coronal Holes. Coronal holes are regions of low density and low temperature, where
   the solar magnetic field lines open and diverge directly into space. This allows the ready
   escape of hot solar particles, adding high-speed, low-density particle streams to the solar
   wind. The SOON telescope can observe coronal holes using the infrared Helium emission
   line at 10830 Angstroms. Hot helium emits at 10830 Angstroms, so a lack of emission—a
   “hole”—indicates cooler or less helium. If this feature appears in the vicinity of a SSB, it
   might be a quiescent filament, which would consist of cooler helium (and other imagery
   would confirm this). However, if this 10830 feature appears well within a solar sector (where
   magnetic polarity is constant), it is likely a coronal hole.
   5.7.2. Coronal holes are related to expansive photospheric areas (solar sectors) of
   predominately single magnetic polarity. A coronal hole may form inside a solar sector when
   the sector has grown to at least 30º in longitude, and it generally disappears when the
   longitudinal extent of the sector decreases to less than about 30º. Only those sectors
   possessing the same polarity as the nearer pole are possible source regions for coronal holes
   (Figure5.8).
   5.7.3. Coronal holes are perhaps the most persistent solar feature. They are semi-permanent
   features of the sun's polar caps. At lower latitudes they persist for months.
   5.7.4. Near solar cycle maximum, coronal holes tend to be more numerous, at lower solar
   latitudes, and are also much smaller and shorter-lived. Near solar minimum, coronal holes are
   fewer and dominate high solar latitudes for years. During the years of solar minimum, high
   speed streams emanating from solar coronal holes are the dominant cause of recurrent
   geomagnetic storms (disruptions of the earth’s magnetic field).
   5.7.5. It is important to understand that the solar wind and high-speed streams associated
   with coronal holes move radially from the solar surface nearly in a straight line; however, the
   magnetic field it pulls with it is warped into a spiral, due to the sun’s rotation. Also, a
   snapshot of a high speed stream is also spiral-shaped due to solar rotation; however, at each
   point in the stream, particles are moving radially away from the sun. Think of a spinning
   lawn sprinkler; each water drop moves in a straight line from the hose (as viewed from
   above), yet the succession of water droplets exiting the rotating hose gives a spiral pattern.
   When a coronal hole passes the central meridian as viewed from the earth, high-speed
   particles are being shot directly toward the earth. During the next several days (while the
   particles are traveling to the earth), the coronal hole rotates past the central meridian into the
   solar western hemisphere, at which point the stream strikes the earth. This gives the false
   impression that the stream is following a spiral from the current location of the coronal hole
   to the earth. The SOON telescope is not presently used to report coronal holes.

5.8. Coronal Condensations. The corona above solar active regions often exhibit large-scale
closed magnetic field loops that tend to concentrate hot plasma in streaks (at the top of the field
loops) called coronal condensation. These features are bright enough to be seen in visible,
ultraviolet, and x-ray imagery, especially on the solar limb. Coronal condensations are long-lived
features, and can persist for a month or more after underlying photospheric sunspots and
chromospheric plage have dissipated. The SOON telescope is not presently used to report
coronal condensations.
5.9. Corona Mass Ejections (CMEs). Sometimes a sudden rearrangement of magnetic fields
in the solar corona can eject a large cloud of plasma into space. Such an event is called a coronal
mass ejection (CME). The plasma cloud is denser than the solar wind it plows into and has a
stronger magnetic field than the IMF, which is distorted as the CME progresses forward (Figure
5.11.). If a CME strikes the earth, it generates a geomagnetic storm. Disappearing filaments,
eruptive prominences, and flares are strong indicators that a CME has occurred (but not always).

                             FLARE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

6.1. Solar Flares.
   6.1.1. A solar flare is a sudden, intense, transient brightening in a localized area of the
   chromosphere. A flare is an explosive release of energy previously stored in the strong,
   complex magnetic fields found in an active region. Flares tend to occur along magnetic
   inversion lines in an active region. The more bends or kinks exhibited by an active region's
   inversion line (a strong indicator of magnetic complexity), the greater the flare potential.
   6.1.2. A flare's initial energy release is called the "flash phase", since there is typically a
   rapid rise to maximum flare brightness. The flash phase is followed by a gradual intensity
   leveling off and declines to pre-flare brightness within tens of minutes to many hours. In
   larger flares, the flash phase may occur in different segments of the flare at different times,
   resulting in multiple intensity maxima. A typical flare's energy output across the full
   electromagnetic spectrum is only about 1/100,000th of the total solar output. However, flares
   are important because their output at certain wavelengths where solar output is normally low
   (ultraviolet, x-ray, and radio) may exceed normal solar emissions by a factor of 100 or more.
   6.1.3. Sampled activity is declared to be a flare if it meets the following brightness and area
   criteria:
       6.1.3.1. In Automatic Mode. The sampled activity increases in brightness, in two
       minutes or less, to an intensity at least 50 percent above the surrounding background. The
       area at or above this intensity level has a corrected area of at least 10 millionths of the
       solar hemisphere. NOTE: Normally, the histogram flare threshold is set at a bin value of
       16, which represents a brightness level of about 60 percent above the surrounding
       background intensity. Variations in background plage intensity or observing conditions
       may require an analyst to set the threshold as low as about bin 14 (40 percent above
       background) or as high as about bin 22 (120 percent above background).
       6.1.3.2. In Semiautomatic Mode. The sampled activity increases in brightness, in two
       minutes or less, to an intensity that produces brightening over a total Hα line width of at
       least 0.8 Angstroms, and the corrected area which displays brightening over a line width
       of 0.8 Angstroms or greater is at least 10 millionths of the solar hemisphere.
   6.1.4. A flare's Hα emission does not necessarily reflect its emission at other wavelengths or
   its ability to produce energetic charged particles. However, statistically, the size and
   brightness in Hα is a good indicator of a flare's x-ray, radio, and particle emissions. In
   general, the larger and/or brighter a flare is in Hα, the more energetic it is, the less frequently
   it will occur, and the longer is its duration.
   6.1.5. Chromospheric brightenings may be categorized as "flares", "point brightenings", or
   "plage fluctuations". Point brightenings and plage fluctuations (defined in Chapter 5) are
   plage characteristics. They should not be confused with "brilliant (or bright) points" and
   "several eruptive centers", which are flare characteristics defined later in this chapter.
6.2. Flare Location.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      59


   6.2.1. A flare's location is the geometric center of the flaring area at the time of maximum
   flare brightness, expressed as central meridian distance and heliographic latitude. The
   geometric center is often not the same location as the brightest portion of the flare or where
   the flaring segments are concentrated. NOTE: If the maximum brightness is not observed
   (due to clouds, power outage, etc), report the location at the time of the brightest intensity
   actually observed.
   6.2.2. In Automatic Mode. The computer warns the analyst of a flare by turning on the flare
   alarm as a three second steady tone for routine flares and a series of three interrupted tones
   for event level flares. Use the Flare Location tool to locate the flare's geometric center. This
   process allows the analyst to visually confirm or reject the automated analysis. If accepted,
   the geomagnetic center location is input into the flare message (QXXYY) group. If Flare
   Location is not run, the region center is input as the flare location. As needed, rerun this
   program to refine the flare's location as the activity progresses (up to the time of maximum
   flare brightness). NOTE: The DALAS Analysis Console may be used to obtain a location;
   however, it will not update the location in the flare analysis program.
   6.2.3. In Semiautomatic Mode.
      6.2.3.1. SOON Rehost may be used to determine the location of a flare if there is a
      recently acquired large scale image of the flaring region available within the image
      database of images acquired during automatic patrol. It also may be possible to acquire a
      new image using the DALAS program within the SOON analysis console. SOON Rehost
      can be used to locate the flare’s geometric center by roaming the cursor over a full disk
      image using the Region definition function.
      6.2.3.2. If unable to use SOON Rehost, one can estimate the location of a flare by its
      relation to a nearby solar feature (e.g., 2º south of a leader spot).
          6.2.3.2.1. Determine the location of the reference feature (e.g., the spot) using the
          appropriate Stonyhurst overlay (adjusted for P-angle) and as many of the following
          tools as is required: the white light projection board, a sunspot drawing, recent
          Region Definition table printout, and current BXOUT message from your site or
          another site. The analyst must select the best sources suited for the current situation
          to determine the most accurate flare location.
          6.2.3.2.2. Determine the flare's latitude and longitude from the reference feature's
          location.
          6.2.3.2.3. Unless the reference image used is real-time, the flare's current position is
          actually west of the location due to solar rotation. To compute a correction factor for
          the flare's longitude: multiply the rotation rate of 0.55º per hour to the time difference
          (in hours and tenths of hours) between when the flare occurred and when the
          reference image was made (Use a rate of 0.50º per hour for flares at high latitudes.)
6.3. Flare Area and Importance.
   6.3.1. Flare area is measured at the time of maximum flare brightness. If the maximum
   brightness is not observed (due to clouds, power outage, etc), report the area measured at the
   time of the brightest intensity actually observed, and qualify the overall report and the time of
   observed maximum brightness appropriately. Flare area tend to spread after maximum
 60                                                      AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


   brightness is reached, so the reported area may not necessarily be the largest area obtained by
   a flare. Flare Importance is defined in terms of corrected flare area at time of maximum
   brightness. Corrected area is the area a flare would have if viewed from directly above the
   flare (Table 6.1).

Table 6.1. Flare Importance.
                                    Corrected Flare Area (millionths of the
                         Importance solar hemisphere)
                 0 (subflare)           ≥ 10 to < 100

                 1                      ≥ 100 to < 250

                 2                      ≥ 250 to < 600

                 3                      ≥ 600 to < 1200

                 4                      ≥ 1200

   6.3.2. To obtain corrected flare area, the apparent area measured on a projected image of the
   solar disk must be corrected for both geometric foreshortening and the vertical height of the
   flare (which may be as much as 10,000 km) above the photosphere. The magnitude of both
   effects increases with Rv (distance from the disk's center). The foreshortening correction
   formula used for sunspot areas is modified by adding a 0.2 Rv term to statistically account
   for the vertical height of flares. The formula below (from Smith and Smith, Solar Flares, The
   MacMillian Co, NY, 1963) is based on a statistical study of 4,700 flare observations at
   Sacramento Peak Observatory. This formula can only approximate the true vertical
   correction required for any given flare, and its results become increasingly less accurate the
   further a flare is from the disk center. Near the limb, the formula tends to give corrected areas
   that are too large for small flares, and too small for large flares. The foreshortening
   correction is embedded in the automatic flare analysis software, and in the area correction
   table(s) used during semiautomatic operations.
For flares:




Where: Ac is the Corrected Area, Am is the Measured (or apparent) Area, Rv is the Radius
Vector (see 1.3.2.3.2.)
   6.3.3. In Automatic Mode. The computer will calculate corrected flare areas automatically.
   CAUTION: Automatic measurements may include flare-bright plage and any bright surges
   accompanying a flare.
   6.3.4. Semiautomatic Mode.
       6.3.4.1. Using SOON Rehost.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     61


           6.3.4.1.1. Use the Flare Analysis Console to determine the area of a flare if there is a
           recently acquired large scale image of the flaring region available within the image
           database.
      6.3.4.2. If unable to use a SOON Rehost image, use the TV Monitor Overlay method for
      measuring flare areas.
           6.3.4.2.1. Measure the flare area, observed on a large scale Hα image, in grid squares
           to the nearest 0.1 square (for the overlay method). SOON Rehost console enables
           rapid conversion of grid squares to corrected flare area using the Monitor Overlay
           Correction tool. Given the number of grid squares and the Rv, the program provides
           a corrected flare area and flare importance. Alternatively, use a locally completed
           version of Table 6.2 to convert the measured (apparent) area to corrected area in
           millionths of the solar hemisphere.
           6.3.4.2.2. To use a local version of Table 6.2, the Rv to the current location of the
           flare's geometric center is needed.

              6.3.4.2.2.1. To determine the Rv, use any of the following tools (if available):
              SOON Rehost; the white light projection board; a sunspot drawing; 18 cm Rv
              overlay; a recent Region Definition table printout; and current BXOUT message
              from your site or another site. NOTE: When given the number of grid squares,
              the Monitor Overlay Correction tool provides the corrected radial extent (for limb
              activity).
              6.3.4.2.2.2. For a Stonyhurst overlay, use a ruler to measure the distance in
              millimeters from the disk center to the flare's center. The Rv value (in hundredths
 62                                                    AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


              of the solar radius) equals the number of millimeters divided by 90 for an 18 cm
              disk (or see Table 6.2). NOTE: If the image is not a real-time image, the flare's
              current position is actually west of its measured location due to solar rotation. To
              correct the flare's longitude, see 6.2.3.2.3.
6.4. Flare Brightness.
   6.4.1. Flare brightness is a measure of a flare's enhancement over the quiet sun's (or
   background) intensity. The three categories of flare brightness (Faint, Normal, and Brilliant)
   combine with flare Importance (correlated to flare area) to create fifteen Hα flare
   classifications (0F through 4B).
   6.4.2. In Automatic Mode.
       6.4.2.1. The computer determines flare brightness by electronically scanning the area
       within a analysis box. Peak and current flare intensities, including flare areas, are
       continuously updated on the system console display. The analyst must graphically display
       data for flaring regions using the flare Histogram display tools (Figure 6.1).
       6.4.2.2. To report a flare as faint (F), normal (N), or brilliant (B), it must reach the
       brightness level corresponding to that category. The corrected area at or above that
       intensity level must be at least 10 millionths of the solar hemisphere.

Figure 6.1. Flare Analysis Histogram Plot.




   6.4.3. In Semiautomatic Mode.
       6.4.3.1. The analyst must estimate brightness based on the total Hα line width over
       which the flare enhancement is distinctly visible. When off-band capability is not
       available, a subjective evaluation must be made using low intensity TV Hα observations.
          6.4.3.1.1. Faint (F). Plage definitely enhanced, but flaring area edges are diffuse.
          Distinctly visible as an enhanced area over a line width of 0.8 Angstroms or greater,
          but less than 1.2 Angstroms. Example: a 0.4 red shift plus a 0.4 blue shift, or solely
          0.8 red or 0.8 blue shift.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      63


          6.4.3.1.2. Normal (N). Flaring area distinctly visible as an enhanced area over a line
          width of 1.2 Angstroms or greater, but less than 1.0 Angstroms in either wing.
          Example: 0.6 red shift plus a 0.6 blue shift.
          6.4.3.1.3. Brilliant (B). Flaring area distinct at 1.0 Angstroms off line center in
          either the red or blue wing.
       6.4.3.2. In automatic mode, each flare brightness level (F, N, or B) must attain at least 10
       millionths of the solar hemisphere before it is reported. To expedite reporting in
       semiautomatic mode this requirement is waived for N and B thresholds and the off-band
       measurement is sufficient. NOTE: The overall flare area must still meet the 10 millionths
       of the solar hemisphere criteria to be declared a flare and reported.
       6.4.3.3. Each site shall develop local Doppler shift tables, which list the correct AGC, 1-
       Angstrom, and 1/2-Angstrom settings for each off-band measurement. To determine a
       flare's brightness: Adjust the AGC, 1-Angstrom, and 1/2-Angstrom Polaroids to the
       values in the tables. Step through the off-band settings, in both the red and blue wings,
       until the flare is no longer distinctly visible, i.e., a significant decrease in intensity is
       observed. These are the off-band values, and their sum is the Hα line width. NOTE:
       Determining "distinctly visible" is subjective. During automatic patrol, analysts should
       occasionally analyze flares with off-band techniques to develop reliable accuracy.
       6.4.3.4. If in semiautomatic mode, but the computer is operating (e.g., low light levels),
       use the DALAS Analysis Console to perform off-band measurements.
6.5. Flare Characteristics.
   6.5.1. Flares show considerable variability in structure and associated activity. The FLARE
   code permits reporting of up to two out of ten flare characteristics. Appended PLAIN
   language comments can be used to expand on reported flare characteristics or to discuss
   phenomena not covered by the code.
   6.5.2. White Light Flare (c = 0). During the flash phase of an extremely energetic flare, it
   may be visible in white light for a short time (normally 10 minutes or less). A white light
   flare can be significantly brighter than the white light background. It may have a red or blue
   cast due to chromatic aberration caused by the fact that refracting telescopes tend to focus
   different colors at different distances from a lens. On the average, white light flares may
   occur perhaps once or twice per year during years of solar maximum.
   6.5.3. Umbral Coverage of 20% or more (c = 1). In order for flaring material to intrude over
   a sunspot's umbra it must have sufficient energy to penetrate the strong vertical magnetic
   fields over the spot. Thus coverage of major umbra (e) is indicative of a very energetic flare.
   6.5.4. Parallel (c = 2) and Y-shaped (c = 4) Ribbons. Both these characteristics usually
   indicate complex magnetic field structures and energetic events. In particular, a parallel
   ribbon flare suggests that material from a plage filament may have slid down magnetic field
   lines on either side of an inversion line, impacted the sun's surface, and released additional
   energy. NOTE: Hyder flares, as described later, also appear as parallel ribbon flares, but are
   not energetic events. Even so, the characteristic c = 2 should still be reported for a Hyder
   flare.
 64                                                       AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


   6.5.5. Associated Loop Prominence System (c = 3). Loops are post-flare coronal
   phenomena, which may start to form while the flare is still in progress, but will persist well
   after the flare ends. A Loop Prominence System is caused by material thrown into the corona
   by the flare. This material condenses into knots, and then rains down curved magnetic field
   lines to the surface. Loops are another indicator of an energetic (usually 2B or greater) flare.
   Loop Prominences are best seen at the limb.
   6.5.6. Several Eruptive Centers (c = 5). During a flare, several separate areas may rise to
   faint, normal, or brilliant intensity. These areas tend to grow as the flare develops and may
   merge. Eruptive centers differ from "brilliant points" in that eruptive centers need not be of
   brilliant intensity, are larger in area, and tend to expand as the flare progresses.
   6.5.7. Brilliant Points (c = 6). One or more points of brilliant intensity (exceeding 360% of
   the quiet sun) are occurring during a faint, normal, or brilliant flare. Brilliant points (also
   called "bright points") are generally small and do not increase in size as the flare progresses.
   The collective area of the brilliant points must be considered when determining a flare's
   overall brightness classification. For example, if the total corrected area of the entire brilliant
   points equals or exceeds 10 millionths of the solar hemisphere, a brilliant flare must be
   reported. However, it would still be appropriate to carry a code c = 6 characteristic.
   6.5.8. Associated Dark or Bright Surge on the Disk (c = 7). These are additional indicators
   of a possibly energetic flare. Surges are described in Chapter 7.
   6.5.9. Flare followed a Disappearing Filament (c = 8). Flares represent a rapid release of
   energy stored in the complex magnetic fields within an active region. These same fields may
   support plage filaments above the active region. Consequently, in response to the disruption
   of the supporting field, a flare may be preceded by, or accompanied by, a disappearing plage
   filament (filament material being thrown off the sun). NOTE: Hyder flares, which occur
   outside active regions, are associated with disappearing quiescent filaments.
   6.5.10. Hα emission greater in the blue than red wing (c = 9). A Doppler shift toward the
   blue end of the spectrum indicates material is moving toward the observer may have
   sufficient outward speed to impact the solar corona.
6.6. Special Flare Types.
   6.6.1. Some flares are “special” in the sense that they appear to follow a pattern, or may be
   triggered by relatively observable mechanisms.
   6.6.2. Homologous Flares. Occasionally, an active region will produce a series of flares with
   similar location, size, shape, and pattern of development. Such “homologous” flares reflect
   the tendency for chromospheric magnetic fields to return to pre-flare configuration under the
   influence of stronger magnetic fields imbedded in the photosphere below. NOTE: For the
   same reason, filaments disrupted during a flare may reform with the same orientation and
   density within a few tens of minutes to several hours (for plage filaments) or a few hours to
   several days (for quiescent filaments).
   6.6.3. Sympathetic Flares. Sometimes a flare, especially if large and energetic, appears to
   trigger a flare in another part of the active region, or in a neighboring region. The mechanism
   for causing the second, “sympathetic” flare is a shock wave (called a “Moreton” wave)
   generated by the first flare. As the shock wave propagates horizontally away from the flare, it
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      65


   disturbs the magnetic field structure in active regions in its path, possibly inducing a flare in
   a region whose magnetic complexity already indicates flare potential. The shock wave can
   also cause oscillatory motions in distant plage or quiescent filaments. These filaments may
   tend to wink in and out of Hα visibility as they are Doppler shifted in and out of the Hα line
   center. The shock wave may also propagate vertically, causing a Type II swept frequency
   radio event.
   6.6.4. Impact Flares.
      6.6.4.1. “Impact, infall, or Hyder” flares are relatively rare, and often occur in spotless—
      even plageless—areas. A large quiescent filament, triggered by some change in its
      supporting magnetic field structure, can be lifted upward into the corona. As this occurs,
      the filament will disappear in Hα because its motion causes a Doppler shift away from
      Hα line center. (A prominence would appear to erupt). Most of the filament's material
      will then spill back along magnetic field lines and impact the chromosphere in two
      parallel bands on either side of the original filament's location. The result is
      chromospheric heating and a parallel ribbon flare. The separation between the ribbons
      tends to widen with time because as the magnetic field loops supporting the original
      filament continue to rise, their "feet" diverge.
      6.6.4.2. Impact flares typically show a slow rise time to maximum brightness (about 30 -
      60 minutes), exhibit faint to normal brightness, cover large areas (importance 3 or 4), and
      last for hours. Impact flares are not particularly energetic phenomena, and are rarely
      associated with X-ray events or significant high-energy particle emissions. However,
      escaping material from the erupting, disappearing filament itself can produce a
      geomagnetic disturbance. Impact flares should not be confused with the parallel ribbon
      flares that occur in active regions, often in association with disappearing plage filaments.
      Such active region parallel ribbon flares are associated with energetic particle (proton)
      events.
6.7. Preparation for Automatic Flare Analysis. Accurate flare analysis is sensitive to SOON
system alignments and calibrations. To prepare for flare patrol and to resolve intersite
differences, analysts should:
   6.7.1. Check and, if needed, correct the image rotator alignment.
   6.7.2. Verify image calibrations and area conversion factors using the system Calibration
   and Maintenance programs.
   6.7.3. Verify proper birefringent filter transmission using the transmission calibration SOON
   Rehost Calibration and Maintenance programs.
   6.7.4. Occasionally check alignments using the SOON Rehost Calibration and Maintenance
   programs.
   6.7.5. Check the overall data collection system e.g., AGC, video, and computer by
   examining a Histogram plot of MAGR.
   6.7.6. Minimize scanner mirror movements to reduce equipment wear and allow more time
   for images to stabilize for sampling. Putting regions in close proximity within the same
   sequence can minimize mirror movements. In addition, mirror movements between
   sequences should not exceed one solar radius, unless it is unavoidable. NOTE: It is also
 66                                                      AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


   useful to place significant regions last in each sequence, so they will be visible for a longer
   time.
6.8. Analysis Boxes.
   6.8.1. Analysts establish areas in the solar image to be sampled for flare detection by
   constructing analysis boxes. The computer controlled SOON telescope can automatically
   scan and analyze the area in a box to determine 64 brightness levels. When a pre-set
   threshold is exceeded for three successive reads in any box, the computer will declare a flare
   to be in progress.
   6.8.2. General rules for ensuring a "good" MAGR box.
      6.8.2.1. Locate the box as close as possible to the disk center.
      6.8.2.2. Make the box at least 150 x 150 arc-seconds in size.
      6.8.2.3. Ensure the box is as completely devoid of features (plage, filaments, etc) as
      possible.
   6.8.3. General rules for “good” flare detection boxes.
      6.8.3.1. Ensure at least two-thirds of the box is quiet sun (i.e., not plage, filaments, etc).
      6.8.3.2. When practical, center a region in its box.
      6.8.3.3. Minimize “sky” area in boxes near the limb by making tall, narrow boxes. Offset
      the region in the box if necessary, and periodically check the box's location relative to the
      limb. Do not move region center when adjusting boxes near limb; only move the box
      center. This will ensure regions rotate off the limb as expected. NOTE: Wide boxes near
      the limb can cause inaccuracy in flare analysis when the limb darkening correction is
      applied.
      6.8.3.4. Quiet sun boxes may overlap.
      6.8.3.5. Avoid overlap with adjacent active regions (i.e., have plage from only one
      region in each box).
      6.8.3.6. Coordinate locally assigned box numbers with other operating observatories, to
      prevent more than one number being used for the same region, or the same number being
      used for different regions.
6.9. Data Analysis.
   6.9.1. The stored data for any analysis box can be graphically displayed as a histogram plot
   (Figure 6.1). Histogram programs are particularly valuable as tools for evaluating flare
   thresholds, brightness and area measurements, and for reconstructing entire flare events.
      6.9.1.1. Use Histograms to verify start, peak, or end times, as well as secondary maxima.
      Also use Histograms to identify suspect samples (spikes, dropouts, or data gaps) in order
      to qualify flare reports.
      6.9.1.2. As an analytical tool, use Histograms to cross-check measurements and to assist
      in trouble-shooting where bad samples are involved (e.g., too much "sky" in an analysis
      box, video malfunction, etc.).
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     67


   6.9.2. The position of the faint flare threshold in relation to the quiet sun level is a major
   determinant in flare start time, end time, and area measurement.
      6.9.2.1. The Flare Threshold program automatically reads the last 10 to 20 minutes worth
      of histograms for each region being sampled. It then computes a best-fit line for the
      histogram peak intensities. If the slope of that line is close to zero and no peak varies
      from the line by more than 20%, the faint flare threshold is automatically adjusted. Flare
      Threshold, however, becomes ineffective during intermittent observations or when
      fluctuating plage or point brightenings are present. During periods when Flare Threshold
      has difficulty assigning a valid flare threshold setting, use Histograms to verify a region's
      peak brightness and current flare threshold setting. If the stable peak intensity (or average
      peak for fluctuating plage/point brightenings) is above or below the current setting, the
      analyst may manually adjust the faint flare threshold using the Flare Threshold program.
      If possible, avoid adjusting it below the 160% level (bin 16). NOTE: Do not adjust the
      faint flare threshold during a flare, unless: it is a "false" flare caused by the threshold
      being set too low, or the flare will not end because the plage remains enhanced at a level
      above the threshold.
      6.9.2.2. During fluctuating background conditions, any faint flare threshold setting may
      be a compromise between many "false" flares (when the threshold is set too low) and
      under-measuring flare area (when the threshold is set too high). During these times, post
      analysis is the only way to ensure accuracy and inter-site consistency. To perform a post
      analysis:
          6.9.2.2.1. Examine the Histogram plot for a correct faint flare threshold. The
          threshold is set correctly when the average pre-flare peak intensity readings are
          representative of the faint flare threshold value (Figure 6.1).
          6.9.2.2.2. If the Histogram plot indicates that an incorrect threshold was set prior to
          automated flare analysis, reset the faint flare threshold. Use the new values and times
          obtained from this new Histogram plot to correct the final FLARE message. The
          Histogram program will plot single histograms and should be used to confirm data at
          flare maximum for correct classification. Remember, in order to classify a flare's
          brightness, three consecutive brightness readings must have a corrected area of at
          least 10 millionths of the hemisphere. NOTE: In the FLARE message, leave the
          “method or type of observation” T = 4 (Electronic) in the TIBcc group, since the
          computer is still your data source.
          6.9.2.2.3. Occasionally, the plage field may remain enhanced above the pre-flare
          threshold value for an extended period (up to two hours) after the flare ends. During
          this period, the computer may incorrectly continue the flare. The analyst must again
          use post analysis to correctly end the flare. Once it is determined from the Histogram
          plot that the flare has ended but the plage field has remained enhanced, raise the flare
          threshold to force an end to the flare. Assign a flare end time that is no later than ten
          minutes after the plage brightness became stable. Transmit a final FLARE message,
          or a correction, with the correct end time taken from the Histogram.
6.10. Equipment Setup for Semiautomatic Operations. The following suggested setups
might be varied to meet local needs:

   6.10.1. Beam Selector in position “1” for TV monitor observations.
   6.10.2. Hα/B2 switch in “Hα” position.
   6.10.3. Hα Lens Interchange in “FULL DISK”.
   6.10.4. Guider Module switch in “ENABLE”.
   6.10.5. All Servo Module switches (except for RA and DEC) in “Manual”, with all
   potentiometers (except AGC) set to “500”. Adjust AGC to a suitable light level.
   6.10.6. Master monitor switcher in either “Hα HIGH” or “Hα LOW”.
   6.10.7. Analysis Monitor switcher in “Hα LOW”; monitor overlay secured in place. Do not
   change monitor adjustments in any way that would alter image dimensions.
6.11. Preparing Flare Area Correction Tables.
   6.11.1. In Semiautomatic Mode.
           6.11.1.1. Update tables using the SOON Rehost Monitor Overlay Correction tool.
           Optionally provide a hard copy of the conversion table for use when Rehost is not
           available.
           6.11.1.2. Flare areas, observed on a large scale Hα image, are measured in grid squares
           to the nearest 0.1 square (for the monitor overlay method). Then a locally completed
           version of Table 6.3 is used to convert this measured (apparent) area to corrected area in
           millionths of the solar hemisphere.
   6.11.2. The Site Correction (Sc) factor is the number of millionths of the solar disk
   contained in a square grid (for the overlay method). Sc is independent of Rv, but will differ
   depending on which TV monitor is used, or whether an eyepiece is used. As a result, at each
   observatory a separate table is required for each display device that might be used during
   semiautomatic operations.

   6.11.3. The Sc factor is computed by dividing the area of the solar disk expressed in units of
   millionths of the solar disk by the area of the solar disk expressed in square grids for the
   overlay method.
       6.11.3.1. For the Overlay Method: Move a large scale image of the sun across the TV
       monitor under the overlay grid. Count the number of grids from limb to limb, i.e., across
       the solar diameter. Divide the result by two to get the solar radius (r) in units of grid
       width. Then use the following equation:



   6.11.4. Each time an observatory changes a Sc factor, a new table listing the Total
   Correction (TC) factors must be prepared. Check and (if necessary) recalculate the Monitor
   Overlay Sc factor anytime an adjustment is done which could affect the TV image (e.g., Hα
   light path or vidicon alignment). Avoid unnecessary adjustments to the TV monitor used for
   measurements. In particular, changes in the height or width controls will affect the accuracy
   of a previously computed Sc factor. Check and (if necessary) recalculate the Eyepiece Sc
   factor anytime an Hα light path alignment is performed (except for minor focus adjustments).
   NOTE: It is recommended that the flare area correction tables be maintained in a spreadsheet
   to facilitate easy re-computation. Where:
Rv = Radius Vector (Rv = 0.0 at disk center, and Rv = 1.0 at limb)

Sc = Site Correction Factor; the number of millionths of the disk contained in a square grid (for
the overlay method) or in a square millimeter (for the eyepiece method). Sc is the same for all Rv
values.

CF = Conversion Factor:




NOTE: CF accounts for foreshortening, vertical height of flares, and the Sc.

TC = Total Correction Factor; the final number desired from the table above for use in the
equation:

                            DALAS ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

7.1. Disk and Limb Activity Summary (DALAS) Analysis.
   7.1.1. Since the SOON telescope's primary function is flare detection; it is not configured to
   automatically detect other forms of solar activity. Furthermore, much of the reportable non-
   flare activity occurs outside areas being monitored for flares.
   7.1.2. For these reasons, identifying and reporting non-flare DALAS information is up to the
   analyst’s discretion. Use AWS TR 75-252 (A Solar Optical Observer's Guide, R. Agee,
   September 1975), and this chapter to identify and analyze DALAS activity.
7.2. Filaments and Prominences (Active Dark Filament (ADF), Active Prominence Region
(APR), Disappearance of Solar Filament (DSF), Eruptive Prominence on Limb (EPL)).
   7.2.1. The terms filament and prominence refer to the same phenomena: a long, narrow,
   cloud-like structure in the chromosphere or corona where the solar plasma is cooler and
   denser than its surroundings, and is supported by the interaction of horizontal magnetic fields
   and electric currents within the filament/prominence. Against the relatively intense Hα
   emitting disk they appear as dark absorption features (filaments). At the limb, they appear as
   relatively bright features (prominences), since their weaker Hα emission is evident when
   compared to the black background of space. The coronal gas surrounding these features is so
   hot that all its hydrogen is ionized and does not produce any Hα emission. On the other hand,
   the material in filaments and prominences is partially ionized, so solar magnetic fields shape
   the material and control its flow. There are two general classes of filaments/prominences:
   quiescent and plage (associated with active regions).
   7.2.2. Quiescent Filaments and Prominences.
      7.2.2.1. Development: These structures are supported by horizontal magnetic fields
      (about 3 to 8 Gauss) lying between large photospheric magnetic sectors. Since their
      supporting magnetic structure changes slowly, quiescent filaments/prominences are
      stable features with lifetimes that often last several months. These filaments/prominences
      may disappear in three ways: Material may diffuse into the surrounding corona, material
      may flow down into the chromosphere and not be replaced, or material may erupt as
      supporting magnetic fields are suddenly altered by an external disturbance such as a
      major flare.
      7.2.2.2. Active Phases: Quiescent filaments/prominences may experience periods of
      activity as changes occur in there supporting magnetic fields. When a
      filament/prominence varies in darkness/brightness (corresponding to a change in density),
      size, and/or shape, it is called an ADF (active dark filament) or APR (active prominence
      region). The activity may also involve a violent eruption. On the disk, such an eruption is
      observed as a sudden DSF (disappearing solar filament) as its material is Doppler-shifted
      out of Hα line center. On the limb, the motion is mostly across the line-of-sight, so the
      Doppler Effect is small and an EPL (eruptive prominence on limb) is seen to lift away
      from the sun. During an EPL, the lifting action generally starts slowly, and then rapidly
      accelerates; an EPL often achieves escape velocity and reaches "event" criteria (radial
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   71


     extent of 0.15 solar radius or greater). A day or so after a DSF or EPL occurs, the
     filament/prominence may reform in roughly the same shape and location. This tendency
     indicates that the underlying magnetic field configuration (anchored below the sun's
     surface) is basically unchanged by the disturbance.
     7.2.2.3. Relation to Flare Activity. When a quiescent filament/prominence becomes a
     DSF or EPL, it may cause a flare to occur. Conversely, a flare may cause
     filament/prominence activity or trigger a DSF or EPL.
         7.2.2.3.1. During a DSF or EPL, some of the material may escape the sun, more
         material dissipates into the corona, but most of the material returns to the
         chromosphere along magnetic field lines down either side of the ascending
         filament/prominence. The returning material may induce a parallel ribbon flare. For a
         quiescent filament/prominence, this parallel ribbon flare is called a “Hyder (infall-
         impact)” flare, which is a low-energy flare that typically shows a slow rise time, faint
         to normal brightness, and a large area. Although the flare itself is not an energetic
         particle producer, the escaping filament/prominence material may lead to a
         geomagnetic disturbance.
         7.2.2.3.2. A major flare may precede, rather than follow, the disappearance or
         eruption of a quiescent filament/prominence (DSF or EPL). However, flares more
         often cause activation, rather than actual disappearance/eruption of a
         filament/prominence. A filament may wink in and out of visibility (Hα line center) in
         response to Doppler shifts caused by oscillatory motions induced by the passage of a
         Moreton shock wave from the flare. A prominence can display changes in brightness,
         size, and/or shape during such oscillatory motions.
  7.2.3. Plage (or Active Region) Filaments and Prominences.
     7.2.3.1. Development. These structures are supported by stronger horizontal magnetic
     fields (up to about 100 Gauss) lying above magnetic inversion lines in, or at the border
     of, active regions. Since plage filaments/prominences are associated with active region
     magnetic fields, compared to quiescent filaments/prominences they are: smaller, shorter
     and narrower, lower in the solar atmosphere, shorter-lived (days vice months), and
     subject to more frequent periods of activation. Plage filaments/prominences may
     disappear through any of the same three mechanisms as quiescent filaments/prominences
     (see 7.2.2.1).
     7.2.3.2. Active Phases. The terms ADF, APR, DSF, and EPL apply equally well to plage
     and quiescent filaments/prominences. In fact, since the supporting magnetic structure in
     an active region involves higher field strengths and can change over a short time scale,
     plage filaments/prominences tend to vary in darkness/brightness (density), size, and
     shape more rapidly and frequently than do quiescent filaments/prominences. Like
     quiescent filaments /prominences, disappearing or erupting plage filaments/prominences
     tend to reform in roughly the same shape and location since the underlying magnetic field
     configuration (anchored below the sun's surface) is basically unchanged by the
     disturbance. However, plage filaments/prominences tend to reform quicker, in a matter of
     hours, vice a day or more.
72                                                     AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


     7.2.3.3. Relation to Flare Activity. Active region filament activity is traditionally
     considered a flare precursor, even a prerequisite; however, observations do not always
     support this. Plage filament/prominence activity (especially a DSF or EPL) indicates
     significant magnetic restructuring in an active region that may lead to a flare. Conversely,
     a flare is very likely to cause plage filament/prominence activation (possibly even a DSF
     or EPL).
        7.2.3.3.1. Preflare activation of a plage filament/prominence (ADF or APR) indicates
        changes in the surrounding magnetic field, which may increase the potential energy
        of an upcoming flare. In the extreme case of a DSF or EPL, most of the material falls
        back to the surface along magnetic field lines on either side of the ascending
        filament/prominence. The returning material may induce a parallel ribbon flare
        (Hyder flare). For a plage filament/prominence, an associated parallel ribbon flare is
        typically a fast-rise, high-energy flare often associated with significant x-ray, radio,
        and energetic particle (proton) emissions.
        7.2.3.3.2. The rapid restructuring of a region's magnetic field structure during a flare
        will temporarily influence the stability of an associated filament or prominence. In
        addition, the flare may generate a Moreton shock wave, which would likely activate
        plage filament/prominence, possibly resulting in a DSF or EPL, within the region. In
        fact, the shock wave from a flare may even induce changes in plage
        filaments/prominences in neighboring regions or quiescent filaments/prominences.
  7.2.4. Active Dark Filaments (ADF).
     7.2.4.1. An ADF generally exhibits one or more of the following characteristics: change
     in absorption (darkness, brightness, dissipation), change in shape (moves, displacement),
     and/or increased internal motions (Doppler shifts of 0.6 Angstroms or greater in either
     wing).
     7.2.4.2. All three characteristics involve some temporal change. When used alone, off-
     band measurements do not necessarily indicate a change. So, off-band measurements
     should be used conservatively as a sole criterion for ADF identification. If a filament
     fades from sight within ±0.5 Angstroms and does not exhibit other characteristics, it is
     quiescent, not active. However, if the filament is definitely visible to a full 1.0 Angstroms
     off-band it may be considered a legitimate ADF regardless of other characteristics.
  7.2.5. DSFs and EPLs.
     7.2.5.1. As mentioned earlier, filaments/prominences may disappear in three ways.
     Material may diffuse into the surrounding corona, material may flow down into the
     chromosphere and not be replaced, or material may erupt as supporting magnetic fields
     are suddenly altered by an external disturbance such as a major flare. Diffusion into the
     corona represents a generally slow fade or breakup in about 3 to 10 hours and is not
     normally accompanied by any motion. Eruption generally represents a sudden
     disappearance of a filament or prominence within a few minutes to a couple hours. Only
     a filament or prominence that erupts is likely to cause a geomagnetic disturbance at the
     earth. The difference between the dissolution and eruptive process is sufficiently
     important to justify appending a PLAIN language remark to the coded DALAS report if
     the analyst can clearly distinguish which process occurred.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  73


      7.2.5.2. A filament/prominence eruption does not guarantee a geomagnetic disturbance.
      Three factors must be considered: The filament/prominence must be sufficiently large. It
      is generally accepted that filaments of at least 10 to 20 square heliographic degrees are
      likely to have enough material to cause a geomagnetic disturbance. However, since we
      are unable to view filaments in three dimensions, it is difficult to assess their volume,
      density, and therefore total mass. This is why it is not possible to set a minimum size
      threshold for a geo-effective DSF. For USAF observatories, reporting “very small” DSFs
      (loosely defined as less than about 5 square heliographic degrees) is optional. An analyst
      must evaluate the circumstances on a case-by-case basis to determine if such a DSF
      should be reported using the DALAS code. Analysts may find it helpful to crosscheck
      with other sites. NOTE: The loosely defined threshold between reportable and non-
      reportable DSFs is similar to the more sharply defined threshold between bright points
      and a zero-faint flare.
          7.2.5.2.1. Second, the ejected material may not have entirely escaped the sun. If the
          supporting magnetic fields do not support continued travel away from the sun, most
          of the plasma will fall back. To determine the velocity of material being ejected from
          the sun perpendicular to the line-of-sight, use Figure 7.1.

Figure 7.1. Solar Velocity Estimation Graph (km/sec as displayed on right/top edge).
 74                                                      AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


          7.2.5.2.2. Finally, the ejected material may miss the earth. The earth is a tiny target at
          93 million miles from the sun; most solar mass ejections will simply pass above,
          below, ahead, or behind the earth.
      7.2.5.3. If portions of an ADF disappear, report those sections as DSF activity, and
      reevaluate the remaining filament structure to determine if the ADF should be terminated
      or continued.
7.3. Active Surge Regions (ASR): Bright Surge on Limb (BSL), Bright Surge on Disk
(BSD), Dark Surge on Disk (DSD).
   7.3.1. A surge is an outward ejection of material, often from the vicinity of an active region.
   The material follows magnetic field lines outward, but does not have the continued magnetic
   support to escape the sun. The material either fades into the corona falls back along the same
   path, or follows a magnetic loop that returns to the solar surface. Most surges are not flare
   related and achieve speeds of 50 to 200 km/sec. Although individual surges may last tens of
   minutes, a region may continue to produce surging for up to several days.
   7.3.2. Surges that are flare related tend to have the highest speeds (up to several hundred
   km/sec) and reach the greatest heights. Seen on the limb, such a flare related surge is
   classified as a BSL if it reaches or exceeds a radial height of 0.15 solar radius. Surging that
   reaches less than 0.15 solar radius is classified as an ASR. On the disk, most surges appear
   dark, a DSD, but some surges may appear bright, a BSD, especially in the initial phase of
   surging. If a surge exhibits both BSD and DSD characteristics, report which aspect was most
   representative during the lifetime of the surge. Disk surges usually show blue Doppler shifts
   in their early phase (indicating rising material), and red shifts in their later phase (falling
   material). When not flare associated, a DSD area may last for hours up to a day or more and
   represents the disk counterpart of an ASR.
7.4. Other DALAS Types: Spray (SPY), Loop Prominence System (LPS), Coronal Rain
(CRN), Arch Filament System (AFS).
   7.4.1. Spray (SPY). A spray is a rare, very energetic, flare-related ejection of material off the
   solar limb. Sprays appear as outward moving clumps of material, moving with speeds of
   about 400 km/sec or greater. Some of the material falls back to the surface, but much of it
   dissipates into the corona or entirely escapes the sun. Sprays often reach event criteria (0.15
   solar radius or greater). Sprays favor no particular direction and are frequently not directed
   radially outward from the limb. NOTE: For comparison, a BSL is a continuous stream of
   material, has a lower speed, and is usually directed radially outward. Sprays are almost never
   observed on the disk because they last for a short time and their high speed causes a large
   Doppler shift (well out of Hα line center).
   7.4.2. Loop Prominence System (LPS). Loop-shaped prominences occasionally develop
   during the post-maximum phase of energetic, non-Hyder parallel ribbon flares, and may
   persist for several hours after the flare subsides. Since such loops indicate that the flare is
   associated with extreme particle (proton) acceleration in the corona, these features are always
   considered event-level activity. LPS features are observed on the limb, with the responsible
   flare sometimes partly or completely hidden by the limb. The loops initially form in the
   corona as small, suspended condensations (knots, beads, or arcs). For the solar analyst, these
   “top knots” can be an important identifying feature of an LPS. As material high in the corona
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                      75


   flows down magnetic field lines, arched legs form below the top knots, another feature that
   distinguishes true loop prominences from a loop-shaped surge. Loop-shaped surges have
   upward motion in one leg and downward motion in the other leg, generally lie lower in the
   atmosphere, and do not persist as long as an LPS. Loop prominences tend to form in striated
   patterns, either a fan of loops whose feet converge at two points within or near the active
   region that has just flared, or a tunnel of loops whose feet connect to the regions that had just
   supported a parallel ribbon flare. Disk loops usually appear as thin dark absorption features
   and are not easily observed; they may be better seen in the red wing of Hα, as loop material
   is draining down, away from the observer.
   7.4.3. Coronal Rain (CRN). While this feature is not reported by USAF observatories, it is
   important analysts recognize coronal rain so they will not mistake it for another type of
   reportable activity (such as an LPS). Coronal rain is magnetically unsupported material that
   condenses in the corona and flows downward along magnetic field lines as luminous
   streamers. It often appears as a faint fan or funnel-like structure in which material falls with
   noticeable speed. CRN can be distinguished from a dissipating prominence by the high speed
   of its material and its luminosity. CRN may last a few hours and can recur in the same
   location over several days. It is usually associated with mature or decaying active regions, or
   it may herald the approach of an energetic active region by up to several days. CAUTION:
   Observed in profile, CRN may resemble weak, half loops, but are distinguished from a LPS
   by no curvature at the top.
   7.4.4. Arch Filament System (AFS). These are dark, linear absorption features usually
   observed only in young, developing bipolar plage regions, or in emerging flux regions (EFR).
   An AFS appears as one or more short, dark, parallel arches connecting plage of opposite
   polarity (Figures 5.4 and 5.5). A single arch filament element lasts only 20 to 30 minutes,
   although an arch filament system may persist for several days. The legs of individual arch
   filaments are inclined less than 30° to the sun's surface and the tops of the arches lie at a low
   altitude, rarely more than 10,000 km. Since AFS normally occur in young, maturing active
   regions, they are usually associated with subflares (importance of 0). The disappearance of
   AFSs at spot group maturity is one indicator that stronger flares may soon follow. While
   significant flare activity is typically inhibited in the immediate vicinity of AFS, the presence
   of AFS near an existing mature region indicates increased magnetic field complexity, which
   may lead to greater flare activity in the mature region later on.
      7.4.4.1. Due to their low altitude, arch filaments, like fibrils, represent only the
      horizontal component of the magnetic field near the sun's surface. As a result, an AFS is
      aligned parallel to the fibril pattern between the plage of opposite polarity. Arch filaments
      are not "true" filaments, since they lie across (rather than along) magnetic inversion lines,
      and are lower in the chromosphere than plage filaments (Figure 5.5).
      7.4.4.2. Material flows downward in both legs of an arch filament, as is the case with
      flare loops. However, arch filaments are distinguished from loop prominences by being
      much lower in the atmosphere, being about ten times smaller in size, and having a lack of
      flare history. In fact, AFSs lie so low in the atmosphere that they are usually not visible
      on the limb.
7.5. DALAS Locations.
76                                                     AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


  7.5.1. The location of DALAS features, expressed by their CMD and heliographic latitude,
  are determined using the same general methods described in Chapter 6 for flare locations.
  The CMD of a limb feature is defined as 90º, unless a portion of the feature clearly originates
  from a point on the disk (i.e., a combined disk/limb feature).
  7.5.2. In Automatic Mode. Use SOON Rehost tools to locate specific points on the sun's
  disk. As needed, rerun tools to refine the location as the activity progresses.
  7.5.3. In Semiautomatic Mode.
     7.5.3.1. Using SOON Rehost. SOON Rehost may be used to determine the location of
     DALAS activity if there is a recently acquired large scale image of the region available
     within the image database or it is possible to acquire a current image.
     7.5.3.2. If unable to use SOON Rehost, estimate location of the feature by its relation to
     a nearby solar feature (e.g., 2° south of a leader spot).
         7.5.3.2.1. Determine the location of the reference feature (e.g., the spot) using the
         appropriate Stonyhurst overlay (adjusted for P-angle), and as many of the following
         tools as is required: the white light projection board, a sunspot drawing, Region
         Definition table printout, or current BXOUT message from your site or another site.
         7.5.3.2.2. Determine the DALAS feature's latitude and longitude from the reference
         feature's location.
         7.5.3.2.3. Unless the reference image used is real-time, the DALAS feature's current
         position is actually west of the location due to solar rotation. To compute a correction
         factor for the longitude: multiply the rotation rate (0.55° per hour) to the time
         difference (in hours and tenths of hours) between when the DALAS feature occurred
         and when the reference image was made. (A rate of 0.50º per hour is more accurate
         for features at high latitudes.)
  7.5.4. The procedure for reporting DALAS activity varies with the type of feature.
     7.5.4.1. SPY, BSL, DSD, or BSD: The location is the base, or point of origin, of the
     spray or surge.
     7.5.4.2. ASR, APR, EPL, AFS, ADF, CRN, or DSF: The location of a feature of 5º or
     less in length may be reported by its center or midpoint. For a feature greater than 5º in
     length, use the feature's endpoints. For unusually shaped features, the analyst may report
     additional intermediate points. However, if more than a total of three points are needed,
     the analyst must either report the additional points in an appended PLAIN language
     message, or divide the feature into sections and report them as part of the same feature in
     separate DALAS messages.
     7.5.4.3. LPS. The location of limb loops is the point on the limb midway between the
     legs. For disk loops, the location is the apparent center of mass on a line midway between
     the legs. Normally there are two distinct legs or set of legs; however, a complex array
     may be present. This can indicate that several sets of loops exist. Use judgment in coding
     location, and report several sets of loops only if they are well apart from each another.
     7.5.4.4. Further guidance on reporting locations for combined disk/limb activity is
     provided later in this chapter.
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    77


7.6. Off-Band Measurements.
   7.6.1. Use SOON Rehost to make off-band measurements when in automatic mode. The
   DALAS program can also be used while in semiautomatic mode (e.g., during low light
   levels).
   7.6.2. In semiautomatic mode, make DALAS off-band measurements in much the same way
   as for semiautomatic flare brightness measurements. Use locally developed Doppler shift
   tables, which list the correct AGC, 1-Angstrom, and 1/2-Angstrom settings for each off-band
   measurement. Adjust the AGC, 1-Angstrom, and 1/2-Angstrom Polaroids to the values listed
   in the tables. Step through the off-band settings, in both the red and blue wings, to determine
   the amount of Doppler shift in each wing.
7.7. Heliographic Extent and Radial Extent.
   7.7.1. The RR group in the DALAS code reports the "heliographic extent" (i.e., length) for
   disk activity, and the "radial extent" for limb or combined disk/limb activity.
   7.7.2. Disk Activity. Report the "heliographic extent" of a feature in whole degrees. This
   measurement represents a total length from one endpoint of the feature to its other endpoint,
   following every kink or bend in the feature (Figure 7.2).
      7.7.2.1. Determine the heliographic extent using the SOON Rehost Analysis Console to
      find the endpoint locations. Use Pythagorean Theorem (c2 = a2 + b2) to compute lengths,
      where "a" and "b" correspond to increments in latitude and longitude, expressed in
      degrees:


      7.7.2.2. If computer-derived coordinates are unavailable, the length can be estimated by
      comparing the feature with other nearby features of known length, such as sunspot
      groups. When comparing with other features at different Rv values, remember to allow
      (at least qualitatively) for the effect of geometric foreshortening.
   7.7.3. Limb, or Combined Disk/Limb, Activity.
      7.7.3.1. Report the "radial extent" of a feature in hundredths of the solar radius. For
      activity only on or above the limb, radial extent is the difference between the Rv of the
      limb (Rv = 1.0) and the Rv of the outermost extent of the phenomena (Figure 7.2). For
      combined disk/limb activity, radial extent is the difference between the Rv of the point of
      origin (Rv < 1.0) and the Rv of the outermost extent of the phenomena. Take
      measurements periodically until the maximum radial extent is reached.
 78                                                    AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013


Figure 7.2. Heliographic Extent and Radial Extent (RR Group).




      7.7.3.2. To determine the Rv of a particular point, use any of the following tools (if
      available): SOON Rehost; the white light projection board; a sunspot drawing; an 18 cm
      Rv overlay; recent Region Definition table printout; or current BXOUT message from
      your site or another site. Alternatively, use a TV monitor overlay.
          7.7.3.2.1. If using an image, apply the appropriate Stonyhurst overlay, and use a ruler
          to measure the distance in millimeters from the disk center to the point of interest.
          The Rv value (in hundredths of the solar radius) equals the number of millimeters
          divided by 90 for an 18 cm disk (or see Table 6.2). NOTE: If the image is not a real-
          time image, the point's current position is actually west of its measured location due
          to solar rotation. To correct the point's longitude: multiply the time difference (in
          hours and tenths of hours) between when the DALAS occurred and the time of the
          image by a rotation rate of 0.55º per hour (A rate of 0.50º is more accurate for
          features at high latitudes).
          7.7.3.2.2. If using a TV monitor overlay, align the grids so they are perpendicular to
          a line connecting the disk center and the point whose Rv is desired. Count the number
          of grid squares to the nearest tenth grid. Then multiply the number of grids by the
AFWAMAN15-1 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                     79


          applicable (normally large scale image) local conversion factor (see section 6.11.3.
          for details).
      7.7.3.3. Since features are frequently not exactly aligned along a line connecting the
      center of the disk with the endpoint of the feature, radial extent is not a measure of the
      true length of the feature. Furthermore, due to the effect of projecting a feature onto the
      image plane perpendicular to the observer's line-of-sight, radial extent is a poor measure
      of the height that a feature has reached into the corona. This projection inaccuracy is
      especially relevant for DALAS features, which originated either on the disk or from
      behind the limb. However, reporting radial extent, as defined above, is an accepted
      approximation.
7.8. Combined Disk/Limb Activity.
   7.8.1. Some DALAS phenomena are not limited exclusively to the disk or limb. If a
   combined disk/limb feature has a radial extent (from its point of origin) of 0.15 solar radius
   or greater, it meets the requirement for a limb "event" (e.g., Limb East (LIMBE) or Limb
   West (LIMBW)). The projection inaccuracy mentioned above (7.7.3.3.) suggests that this
   event definition is not accurate for all features; however, it is an accepted approximation.
   7.8.2. To avoid over-reporting limb events, consider this rule-of-thumb: Hesitate to report a
   combined disk/limb feature as a limb event if more than about a third of its radial extent from
   its point of origin lies on the disk. The reason for this is that in order for a combined
   disk/limb feature whose point of origin is well inside the limb to achieve such a large radial
   extent, the feature's true spatial orientation must be mostly perpendicular to the observer's
   line-of-sight. In other words, its motion was likely more parallel to the sun's surface (not as
   significant) than upward into the corona (more significant). If an analyst believes a particular
   phenomenon is an event, despite this guidance, it should be reported as an event.
   7.8.3. Surge Combinations.
      7.8.3.1. Types.
          7.8.3.1.1. DSD (or BSD)/ASR. A dark (or bright) gaseous stream of material
          originating from a point on the disk which, due to its proximity to the limb extends
          beyond the limb. The radial extent (from the point of origin) is less than 0.15 solar
          radius.
          7.8.3.1.2. DSD (or BSD)/BSL. A dark (or bright) gaseous stream of material with
          characteristics similar to a DSD (or BSD)/ASR combination; however, in this case
          the surge is more impulsive and achieves a radial extent (from the point of origin) of
          at least 0.15 solar radius.
      7.8.3.2. Reporting.
          7.8.3.2.1. Encode the name of the limb feature (ASR = 01 or BSL = 04), and the
          location of the point of origin of the surge. Encode the radial extent (RR) as the
          difference between the Rv of the point of origin and the Rv of the outermost extent of
          the phenomena (Figure 7.2). If the radial extent is at least 0.15 solar radius, it is a
          limb "event" (e.g., 456123 or LIMBW).
          7.8.3.2.2. Use of a PLAIN language message appended to the coded DALAS report
          is highly encouraged to clarify the situation or provide additional information.

POINT OF ORIGIN OF 0.17 SOLAR RADIUS.

EXAMPLE #2: COMBINATION DSD/ASR HAS BECOME A DSD/BSL, SINCE RADIAL
EXTENT FROM POINT OF ORIGIN HAS INCREASED TO 0.16 SOLAR RADIUS.
  7.8.4. Filament/Prominence Combinations.
     7.8.4.1. Types.
        7.8.4.1.1. ADF/APR. The activation of a quiescent filament/prominence, which has a
        portion of its active material on the disk and a portion extending beyond the limb.
        7.8.4.1.2. DSF/EPL. A filament on the disk erupts, and the displaced filament
        material becomes visible as a prominence as it moves beyond the limb.
     7.8.4.2. Reporting.
        7.8.4.2.1. Encode the name of the limb feature (APR = 02 or EPL = 05), and the
        location of the feature's endpoints and, if appropriate, intermediate points. Report
        enough points to allow the feature to be accurately redrawn from the report. For
        combined limb and disk activity, encode radial extent from the feature’s point of
        origin to the outermost extent of the feature, expressed in hundredths of the solar
        radius. If the radial extent is 0.15 solar radius or greater, it is a limb "event" (e.g.,
        LIMBE or LIMBW). NOTE: The feature's heliographic extent, or length, can be
        determined after-the-fact from the feature's reported location. However, the analyst
        can assist the forecast centers by reporting the heliographic extent in an appended
        PLAIN language message.
        7.8.4.2.2. Use of a PLAIN language message appended to the coded DALAS report

                        SCHEDULED PLAIN MESSAGE FORMAT

A5.1. First section: Indicate observing conditions, initial or changed equipment status, and an
outlook for the next period or next day.
A5.2. Second section: Report analyses of solar active regions.
   A5.2.1. Put each region in a separate paragraph, with one number symbol (#) at the start, and
   two number symbols (##) at the end, of each paragraph. Use the contraction RGN, the
   region's number, and the location (at the time of the PLAIN) in parentheses. Including the
   location is mandatory only for any SN, DL, or recently numbered region not listed in the
   most current daily AXXX02 KWNP, Solar Region Summary bulletin. Do not put a space
   between the latitude and longitude. EXAMPLES: #RGN 7901 (S12E23), #RGN SN91
   (N23W71).
   A5.2.2. Include a detailed description of each SWPC-numbered region, or locally numbered
   region of interest (i.e., SNs or DLs) at least once each observing day for regions with a
   magnetic complexity of Beta or less. Include Beta Gamma or more complex regions in every
   report. Concentrate on changes or information not previously reported in a PLAIN or coded
   message. Examples:
       A5.2.2.1. Sunspot classification changes. Development of new spots, penumbra, or light
       bridges. Sunspot dynamics such as spot rotation, relative spot motion, and merging of
       spots within an active region or with another region.
       A5.2.2.2. Plage compactness and intensity. Plage fluctuations or point brightenings (see
       Table 5.1 and 5.2 for definitions). Of particular interest are:
           A5.2.2.2.1. An increase or decrease in the intensity, number, or frequency of plage
           fluctuations or brightenings along a complex magnetic inversion line.
           A5.2.2.2.2. Bright plage encroachment on a strong sunspot, which is often
           accompanied by an inversion line filament encircling or pointing into the spot.
       A5.2.2.3. Inversion line filament activity (i.e., active dark filaments or their limb
       counterpart, active prominence regions). Report changes in size, darkness/brightness (i.e.,
       density), or Doppler shift measurements.
       A5.2.2.4. Magnetic classification changes. Magnetic gradients and trends. Inversion line
       kinks and orientation (e.g., basically NE-SW, closed or isolated pole, or mostly circular).
       Also report possible crossing of a large penumbra, causing a delta configuration.
       A5.2.2.5. Comments related to structure, growth (e.g., Arch Filament System formation),
       decay, or interaction of solar features.
       A5.2.2.6. Special characteristics or features of flares or DALAS activity during the
       period.
       A5.2.2.7. Impression of the region's flare potential (optional item; subject to analyst
       experience).

A5.3. Third section: Report features and activity not associated with a SWPC or locally assigned
numbered region (e.g., disappearing filaments and limb activity). Start this portion with
"#OTHER ACTIVITY:" and use two number symbols (##) as the end characters.
