This instruction implements AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk Management, and AFI 90-901, Operational
Risk Management. It establishes the requirement to integrate and sustain Operational Risk Management
(ORM) throughout the 45th Space Wing. It assigns responsibilities for program elements and contains
program management information. It applies to all 45th Space Wing personnel and functional areas. It
does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG) units, nor
contractor personnel.

SUMMARYOF CHANGES

This publication has been revised and must be completely reviewed. This version updates training
requirements in accordance with Air Force Space Command instruction.

Section A-ORM Process Description

1. Definition, Purpose and Scope .
   1.1. Definition: Operational Risk Management is a logic-based, common sense approach to making
   calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during, and after Air
   Force mission activities and operations.
   1.2. Purpose: The goal of ORM is to enhance mission effectiveness at all levels while minimizing
   risks. This instruction will define specific responsibilities for each level of management as well as
   the responsibilities of each individual assigned to the 45th Space Wing.
   1.3. Scope: ORM enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals to
   maximize operational capabilities while limiting all dimensions of risk by applying a simple,
   systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions both on and off duty. Effective risk
2                                                                          45SWI90-901 1 MAY 2009


    management begins at the top with commander support and is the responsibility of every person
    within the chain of command.
       1.3.1. By regulation, ORM is a Commander’s program. ORM has great applications in the safety
       arena and 45 SW Safety is the Office of Primary Responsibility. However, ORM is not limited
       to issues of safety and should be applied to all operations. The benefits of ORM include
       maximizing capabilities while minimizing all associated risks in every area of operations.

Section B-Program Management

2. Responsibilities. The following responsibilities are additions to those defined by AFI 90-901:
    2.1. The 45th Space Wing Commander maintains responsibility for implementation and
    administration of the ORM program in the 45 SW.
    2.2. Chief of Safety (45 SW/SE) will appoint, in writing, an ORM Program Manager to oversee
    ORM integration and sustainment wing wide.
    2.3. The Wing ORM Program Manager will ensure each 45 SW unit establishes an ORM program
    and provide oversight and feedback as required. Additionally, the ORM Program Manager will:

       requirements to sustain the ORM program within the wing.

       this requirement.
       2.3.4. Annually review all squadron ORM Training Programs and conduct an assessment of unit
       level ORM programs. A review by the Ground Safety Staff, conducting annual unit level

Section D-Application of ORM

4. Applying ORM to a process.
   4.1. Each unit is responsible for their own unique application of ORM within the scope of their

   2.6.2 of this instruction are encountered.

   the ORM six-step process.
      4.3.1. Although there is no standard format for a formal ORM product, the four Principles of
      ORM and the 6-step process, as defined in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management and
      AFPAM 90-902 must be applied.
      4.3.2. The scope of ORM used must be at a level appropriate for the process being evaluated.
      4.3.3. Examples of previously accomplished ORM analyses are available on the 45 SW Safety
      CoP website (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-SE-SP-07) in
