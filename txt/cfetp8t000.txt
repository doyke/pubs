                  CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

PART I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive document that
identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum
core task requirements for this special duty identifier (SDI). The CFETP provides personnel a
clear path to success and instills rigor in all aspects of SDI training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and control
training within the SDI.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of training in the SDI 8T000.
Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies SDI specialty
descriptions, career progression information, duties and responsibilities, selection criteria and
Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) information. Section C illustrates SDI training
requirements, and Section D focuses on resource requirements.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS)
and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) conducted training and core tasks; Sections B and C are not used. Section D
identifies training courses available to the SDI 8T000. Section E is not used.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP ensures individuals in this SDI receive effective and
efficient training. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan and
conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose.

1.1. This CFETP provides the information necessary for functional managers, commandants,
training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, conduct, and evaluate an
effective PME training program. Standardized education and training requirements for all PME
instructors are a must. This CFETP accurately reflects what is necessary for a new or
experienced instructor to prepare for basic instructional duties. Specifically, this CFETP:

1.1.1. Establishes baseline training requirements for initial qualification for SDI 8T000 duties.

1.1.2. Identifies the core tasks and knowledge training requirements for instruction, support, and
management duties.

1.1.3. Lists the training course(s) available for qualifying new instructors or re-qualifying
returning instructors.

1.1.4. Identifies opportunities within the PME SDI and describes the duty requirements for each
major position within PME.

1.1.5. Identifies the requirements for in-service training and professional development, as well
as earning the CCAF CIC and the ITMS Degree.

1.1.6. Identifies resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field
education and training program.

2. Use of the CFETP.

2.1. Managers in all PME programs use this comprehensive, standardized training program to
develop qualified faculty who are able to meet the unique requirements of each teaching,
management, or instructional support assignment.

2.2. AETC education and training personnel develop and revise formal resident, DL and
exportable training based upon user-established requirements outlined in Part II of this CFETP.
They work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining the resources needed
to satisfy identified training needs.

2.3. MAJCOM EPME managers and commandants ensure their training programs complement
the mandatory initial instructor qualification training requirements.

2.4. The Barnes Center uses the CFETP to program training requirements for personnel engaged
in developing, administering and evaluating PME instruction.

2.5. Individual PME faculty members must ensure they complete mandatory training
requirements specified in this plan. Part II of this CFETP identifies mandatory training
requirements and training references.


                                                 8
3. Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.

3.1. The Barnes Center serves as the Office of Primary Responsibility for the CFETP, hosts
U&TWs as directed by the AFCFM to determine 8T000 training requirements and
revises/develops an effective CFETP. The Barnes Center will maintain the CFETP, suggest
necessary revisions, and submit new or revised CFETP versions to the AFCFM for action.

3.2. The AFCFM will conduct an annual review of the CFETP in accordance with AFI 36-2201.




                                              9
Section B - PME Opportunities and Information

4. Specialty Descriptions.

4.1. This section identifies opportunities and duty positions within the PME SDI 8T000. By
evaluating what is available and the specific demands of each position, NCOs can decide if they
want to apply for PME duty, and where they would like to be assigned within PME.

4.2. Unlike ―typical‖ career fields such as Security Forces, medical, maintenance, or supply, a
career progression ladder does not exist for PME SDI 8T000. Since individual perceptions and
values control how we see a particular move within PME, rather than a systematic evolution of
training and experience, it is impossible to identify a standardized or typical career path an
8T000 might follow as they progress within the SDI. ―Opportunities‖ are functionally organized
in three basic areas: management, instruction and support.


                                  8T000 OPPORTUNITIES



                                           INSTRUCTION




                                    MANAGEMENT      SUPPORT




4.3. PME positions (instructors, managers and support) are controlled duty tours. Special duty
tour extensions and subsequent PME assignments must match Air Force needs. As a general
rule, consecutive PME assignments are selective and should be developmental in nature; when
applicable, they must weigh in the best interests of the Air Force.

5. Manpower Table. The tables on page 11 show opportunities by grade and function. The
exact number and availability of specific positions vary. Contact the specific organization to
verify unique requirements and availability at that organization.

Section C – 8T000 Training Requirements

10. Enlisted PME Instructor Qualification Training Requirements. Although the SDI 8T000
is awarded upon entry into PME special duty, all 8T000 assigned personnel must meet specific
training requirements to be considered qualified. EPME instructors must satisfy initial instructor
qualification training (IIQT) and lesson qualification training (LQT) requirements. This two-step
approach ensures instructors possess the subject matter expertise required to teach EPME
courses. Instructors can complete IIQT and LQT requirements simultaneously. Schools may
supplement these requirements as they see fit. Further, qualified instructors must complete
additional training requirements prior to being assigned as an instructor trainer (IT).

10.1. Initial Instructor Qualification Training (IIQT) Requirements.

10.1.1. Purpose. This section establishes the minimum mandatory training requirements for
IIQT. It defines the minimum acceptable IIQT, while being flexible enough to allow individual
schools to tailor their training programs to fit faculty needs and mission requirements. IIQT
requirements are considered complete when all pre-service education, teaching internship,
core tasks, and oral/written proficiency requirements are met.

10.1.2. Applicability. These IIQT requirements apply to all PME schools. Each instructor is
required to complete a thorough training program to be considered a qualified instructor. The
table below outlines IIQT requirements.

                 IIQT REQUIREMENTS
                                                                   Paragraph/Page

                 Oral/Written Proficiency                          10.1.6.

10.1.3. Pre-service Education. The initial skills provided by this course are considered
minimum requirements which must be met prior to full qualification as an 8T000 instructor.
New instructors should complete EPMEIC prior to IIQT. This ensures the instructors receive a
good foundation before entering the EPME classroom. See the USAF EPME Procedural


                                                  17
Guidance for examples of actions that can be completed before attending EPMEIC.

10.1.3.1. All individuals assigned to duties involving instruction, supervision of instruction, or
curriculum development must complete the EPMEIC before teaching or developing any
EPME course. If a new hire is a previous EPMEIC graduate, coordinate a waiver of attendance
with justification through the owning MAJCOM to EPME Academic Affairs/DE through EPME
Academic Affairs/DOP. Prior instructors must re-attend EPMEIC if more than five years have
passed since the instructor last performed instructor duty.

10.1.3.2. Attendance at EPMEIC is optional for NCOA and AFSNCOA Commandants and not
required for EPME MAJCOM Managers, HQ USAF/A1DLE, or Barnes Center Senior Enlisted
Leader.

10.1.4. Teaching Internship. Instructors should teach a variety of lessons during their
enrollment in the internship. However, new instructors do not have to teach every PME lesson to
complete teaching internship requirements. The minimum number of contact hours needed to
meet the requirements of the teaching internship is broken out by category below:

  TEACHING INTERNSHIP HOURLY REQUIREMENTS
                                                                                       HOURS

                                                                                       total 30 hrs
  TOTAL INTERNSHIP HOURS                                                               180

* NOTE: All assigned instructors will teach 120 hours of PME classroom instruction to meet
IIQT requirements. Use the IIQT Checklist to document these hours. Recommend instructors be
observed for as many of the 120 hours as possible. However, the first 36 hours (10 hours of
Managerial Communication, 14 hours of Military Professional/Operational Airman, and 12 hours
of Unit Manager) must be under the direct observation of another qualified instructor. After
completing 36 hours of observed teaching, individuals may teach the remainder of their 120-hour
requirement unobserved at the discretion of the Commandant based on the recommendation of
the instructor’s trainer. However, before instructors teach ANY lessons (IIQT or LQT) for the
first time unobserved, they must review the lesson with their trainer, and a lesson qualified
instructor must be available in the school to provide assistance as required. Individual schools
have the authority to increase direct observation hour requirements as they deem necessary based
on the trainee’s performance and ability.

10.1.4.1. Per CCAF Campus Affiliations Policies, Procedures and Guidelines, the teaching
internship requires documentation that the instructor was informed of the following information:

10.1.4.1.1. Affiliated school’s subject matter testing process requirements used to assess
instructor competence on course materials being taught. Instructors must score a minimum of

                                               18
90% on all objectively evaluated exercises and evaluations. Further, instructors must receive
a minimum of 90% or Go/No Go as applicable on all performance evaluations to include
communication skills.

10.1.4.1.2. Supervision and evaluation procedures. As a minimum, instructors must teach at
least one lesson every class throughout the completion of their teaching internship and have a
qualified instructor trainer (para.10.3) evaluate their performance. Document evaluation results
on an Instructor Evaluation Checklist, as outlined in USAF EPME Procedural Guidance.
Maintain these evaluations in the instructor’s faculty folder. Once the instructor completes all
teaching internship requirements, schools will conduct further evaluations per the USAF EPME
Procedural Guidance and local guidance.

10.1.4.1.3. Documents used to track and certify faculty qualification training. Use the IIQT
Checklist to document and track completion of all teaching internship requirements. File the
IIQT Checklist in Section 3 of the instructor’s faculty folder.

10.1.4.1.4. Procedures describing the teaching internship completion process. Explain teaching
internship hourly requirements. See USAF EPME Procedural Guidance for detailed teaching
internship completion process.

10.1.5. Core Task Requirements. All PME instructor core task requirements can be found in
part II of this CFETP. Instructors must complete all core task requirements before the
Commandant submits teaching internship completion data to CCAF.

10.1.6. Oral and Written Proficiency Requirements. Instructors meet oral and written
proficiency requirements as outlined in paragraphs 22 – 27 of the USAF EPME Procedural
Guidance through attendance at EPMEIC, subject matter testing, and evaluations conducted
throughout the IIQT process.

10.2. Lesson Qualification Training (LQT).

10.2.1. Purpose. This area outlines the requirements necessary to ensure a standardized
instructor lesson qualification program. Use the following procedure to track instructor lesson
qualification training:

10.2.1.1. Use the Instructor Lesson Qualification Log to document all instructor lesson
qualification training. Once instructors demonstrate subject-matter expertise and instructional
ability (via direct observation, formal IST or one-on-one IST with their trainer), they are
considered qualified on a lesson. Instructors must continue to expand their subject matter
expertise and instructional abilities by becoming qualified on every lesson for the level of EPME
they currently teach.

10.2.1.2. LQT is complete once instructors qualify on every lesson for the level of EPME they
currently teach. Continue to update instructor qualification accordingly when EPME Academic
Affairs revises lessons or adds new lessons to the curriculum. File the Instructor Lesson
Qualification Log in Section 1 of the instructor’s faculty folder.

10.3. Instructor Trainer (IT) Requirements.

                                               19
10.3.1. Purpose. To establish the training requirements necessary to prepare qualified
instructors to train and supervise trainees.

10.3.2. Applicability. These IT requirements apply to all 8T000s in teaching positions and
must be completed prior to training and supervising new instructors. The requirements are listed
below:
     Complete IIQT
     Complete LQT

policies and procedures. In-service training is a mandatory training requirement to the extent
required by an organization’s mission, the readiness of its faculty to execute that mission, and
changing curriculum.

11.1.2. Responsibilities/Minimum Requirements. Commandants must ensure each 8T000
receives at least 32 hours of IST annually. EPME Academic Affairs/DE ensures each 8T000
instructional designer in a teaching position receives at least 32 hours of IST annually. Some
suggested opportunities for IST include providing faculty members training on new lessons,
improvement opportunities identified through inter-/intra-flight analysis comparisons, group
norming evaluations of verbal and written assignments, schoolhouse updates on policies and/or
procedures, outbriefs from worldwide conferences, and one-on-one informal feedback on lesson
presentations.

11.1.3. Documentation. Document in-service training via the IST and PD Log.

11.2. Professional Development.

11.2.1. Purpose. Air Force PME programs require 8T000s to exemplify professional conduct
