           1992                                                                      Distribution: F

This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 36-30, Military Entitlements. It governs prepar-
ing, issuing, using, accounting for, and disposing of USAFE Form 174, USAFE Privilege and Identifi-
cation Card, and USAFE Form 276, Application for USAFE Form 174, USAFE Privilege And
Identification Card. It applies to all US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) units. It does not apply to US
Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard units. This instruction requires the collection and maintenance
of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. The authorizations to collect and maintain the data
prescribed in this regulation are United States Code (U.S.C.), Title 10, Armed Forces, Sections 133 and
8013; and Executive Order 9397.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Changes made to this instruction update the correct paragraph sites and information contained in the cur-
rent revision of AFI 36-3026 (I), Identification Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Fam-
ily Members, and Other Eligible Personnel.



1. USAFE Form 174 Eligibility . USAFE Form 174, USAFE Privilege and Identification Card, is
issued to personnel who are not eligible to receive other Department of Defense (DOD) identification for
the purpose of obtaining authorized logistical support. Recipients include:
   1.1. US citizens holding a DD Form 2 (Retired), United States Uniformed Services Identification
   Card, and DD Form 1173, Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card, or any other
   authorized identification (ID), who cannot use that form to obtain access to commissaries, exchanges,
   and other authorized privileges overseas. An example would be a non-working dependent residing
   with an United States Air Force retiree sponsor in the overseas area, where the retiree works as a civil-
   ian or contract employee. If the applicant is eligible for another form of identification that provides
   access to all forms of authorized support, the applicant will be issued that ID instead of USAFE Form
   174.
2                                                                      USAFEI36-3001 20 JULY 1998

    1.2. Non-US citizen employees and foreign armed forces personnel and their dependents, who are
    authorized access to US facilities under international agreements but do not possess an ID card, which
    would allow them that access.

2. Definitions.
    2.1. Full-Time Employment. Civilian employees who are regularly scheduled to be employed in a
    paid status, 20 or more hours per week are considered to be employed “full-time.”
    2.2. Sponsoring Agency. The employing unit or the unit that maintains the employee's personnel
    record. Verification of retired status is accomplished by reviewing employee's current DD Form 2 (ID
    Card), retirement order, DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, or
    AF Form 1613, Statement of Service (formerly DD Form 13). Military Personnel Flight (MPF) ver-
    ification is not required.
    2.3. Dependent. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Status of Forces Agreement
    (SOFA) defines a “dependent” as “the spouse of a member of a force or of a civilian component, or a
    child of such member depending on him or her for support.” The United States has concluded bilat-
    eral agreements with NATO nations which extend dependent status to other family members (e.g.,
    parents, parents-in-law, brothers, and sisters). In general, a person must be living with a military or
    civilian component sponsor and must be financially dependent on that sponsor for over 50 percent of
    their support to qualify for status as a dependent under these agreements. Unless inconsistent with an
    existing international agreement the following people may be issued a USAFE Form 174 upon pro-
    duction of the documents indicated:
       2.3.1. Spouse. Marriage certificate with raised seal.
       2.3.2. Child. Copy of birth certificate or court order (for adopted children) establishing relation-
       ship to sponsor and copy of orders authorizing overseas movement. NOTE: Dependent children
       of personnel stationed within the USAFE area of jurisdiction are considered to be residing with the
       sponsor even though attending a DOD-dependent school or other accredited educational institu-
       tion at a location removed from the sponsor's duty station but within the USAFE area.
       2.3.3. Parent, Step-Parent, Parent-in-Law, or Other Family Member Authorized Travel at Govern-
       ment Expense. Copy of orders authorizing overseas movement.
       2.3.4. Other Close Blood or Affinitive Relative. Requests will be submitted by letter, signed by
       the sponsor, verified by the servicing MPF or Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF), and sent through
       the local installation commander to Personnel Programs Division (HQ USAFE/DPP), Unit 3050
       Box 25, APO AE 09094-5025, for approval. Forward only applications recommended for
       approval. At a minimum, applications will contain the following:
           2.3.4.1. A statement indicating relationship of applicant to sponsor, that applicant perma-
           nently resides with the sponsor, and that the residency is expected to continue after completion
           of the sponsor's overseas tour.
           2.3.4.2. One of the following documents:
               2.3.4.2.1. Documentation from a physician regarding the applicant's poor health or dis-
               ability and a statement explaining why the sponsor is obligated to provide domicile for the
               applicant and why no other relative can provide this domicile.
USAFEI36-3001 20 JULY 1998                                                                                 3

              2.3.4.2.2. A full explanation why a physically and mentally healthy applicant, who
              receives more than 50 percent of his or her support from the sponsor, cannot maintain a
              reasonable standard of living without support from the sponsor. This explanation will
              include a full financial statement showing the applicant's income from all sources and
              monthly living expenses. (The applicant's rent is the sponsor's rent plus utilities divided by
              the number of persons residing in the home. Military sponsors living in government quar-
              ters will use the monthly basic allowance for quarters entitlement for this computation.
              Civilian sponsors living in government quarters will use the maximum allowable rate for
              living quarters allowance in effect at the time.)
