                                            Chapter 1

         INTRODUCTION TO AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES

1.1. Background. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is both an Air Force
major command (MAJCOM) and the air component to United States Special Operations
Command (USSOCOM), a unified combatant command (UCC).
    1.1.1. MAJCOM Responsibilities. As an Air Force MAJCOM under the direction of the
    Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), the
    Commander, AFSOC (COMAFSOC), is responsible for training, organizing, equipping, and
    providing operationally ready Air Force Special Operations forces (AFSOF) to unified,
    specified, and Air Force commands worldwide. AFSOC also provides operational support
    forces, Special Operations test and evaluation, and Special Operations education. The CSAF
    has designated AFSOC as the Air Force Lead MAJCOM for Special Operations and the
    Component MAJCOM to CDRUSSOCOM.
    1.1.2. Air Component Responsibilities. As the Air Force component commander to
    USSOCOM, COMAFSOC executes or directly supports the following primary Special
    Operations activities: direct action, special reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, foreign
    internal defense, counter-proliferation, civil affairs, psychological operations, information
    operations, and counter-terrorism. To accomplish these missions, AFSOC has identified the
    following core mission areas: specialized air mobility; specialized refueling; precision fires;
    battlefield air operations; psychological operations dissemination; aviation foreign internal
    defense; command and control; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; information
    operations; and agile combat support.
1.2. Command Relationships.
    1.2.1. General. The President and/or Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) exercise authority over
    missions and forces assigned to combatant commands through the combatant commander
    (CCDR) with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).
    For purposes other than operational direction of forces assigned to the combatant commands,
    the President and/or Secretary of Defense exercise authority and control through the service
    secretaries and service chiefs of staff.
    1.2.2. Operational Command Relationships (operational direction of forces assigned to
    Combatant Commands).
       1.2.2.1. Combatant Command (COCOM). [See Figure 1-1]
           1.2.2.1.1. COCOM is a nontransferable command authority established by 10 U.S.C.
           § 164, exercised only by commanders of unified or specified combatant commands
           over assigned forces unless otherwise directed by the President or the Secretary of
           Defense. COCOM cannot be delegated and is the authority of a combatant
           commander to perform those functions of command. COCOM includes the authority
           to give authoritative direction to subordinate commands and forces necessary to carry
           out missions assigned to the command, including authoritative direction over all
           aspects of military operations, joint training, and logistics; prescribe the chain of
           command to the commands and forces within the command; organize commands and
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                      5


        forces within that command as he considers necessary to carry out missions assigned
        to the command; employ forces within that command as he considers necessary to
        carry out missions assigned to the command; assign command functions to
        subordinate commanders; coordinate and approve those aspects of administration and
        support (including control of resources and equipment, internal organization, and
        training) and discipline necessary to carry out missions assigned to the command; and
        exercise the authority with respect to selecting subordinate commanders, selecting
        combatant command staff, suspending subordinates, and convening courts-martial.
        1.2.2.1.2. 10 U.S.C. § 167 provides that, unless otherwise directed by the Secretary
        of Defense, all active and reserve Special Operations forces (SOF) of the armed
        forces stationed in the United States are assigned to the unified combatant command
        for Special Operations (USSOCOM).          CDR, USSOCOM has COCOM authority
        over all contiguous United States (CONUS)-based AFSOF and, when given an
        operational mission, exercises this authority. The combatant commanders of the
        various geographic combatant commands (GCCs) exercise COCOM of AFSOF
        assigned to their theaters under the Forces For Unified Commands Annex to the
        Global Force Management Implementation Guidance Document (GFMIG).
     1.2.2.2. Operational Control (OPCON).
        1.2.2.2.1. OPCON is command authority that may be exercised by commanders at
        any echelon at or below the level of combatant command, is inherent in COCOM, and
        may be delegated within the command. When forces are transferred between
        combatant commands, the command relationship the gaining CDR will exercise (and
        the losing CDR will relinquish) over these forces must be specified by the SecDef.
        OPCON is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
        forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks,
        designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the
        mission. It includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and
        joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command, and should
        be exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally, this
        authority is exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or
        functional component commanders. OPCON normally provides full authority to
        organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in
        operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions; it does not,
        in and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of
        administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
        1.2.2.2.2. IAW USSOCOM Directive 10-1, Terms of Reference – Roles, Missions,
        and Functions of Component Commands, COMAFSOC exercises command authority
        consistent with OPCON over all CONUS-based AFSOF (active duty, reserve, and
        guard on Title 10 orders). AFSOC Wing, Group, and Unit commanders exercise
        command authority consistent with OPCON over their squadrons.
        1.2.2.2.3. The combatant commanders of the various geographic combatant
        commands (GCCs) usually exercise COCOM and OPCON of assigned AFSOF as
        well as OPCON of forces attached via a SECDEF-approved deployment order.
6                                                           AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


       Combatant commanders normally delegate OPCON to the theater Special Operations
       Commander (TSOC).
          1.2.2.2.3.1. For conventional forces, the JFC normally delegates OPCON to, or
          executes OPCON through, the Service components (e.g. OPCON of USAF forces
          delegated to the COMAFFOR). When a Service component is designated a
          functional component (e.g. Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC)),
          the commander of that functional component gains assets from other Service
          components (e.g. ―   excess‖ USMC sorties). Unlike the larger Joint force, SOF
          routinely train jointly and present forces jointly. The SOF ― Service component‖
          is the TSOC (under USSOCOM’s ―          Service-like responsibilities‖). When the
          TSOC is designated the functional component for SOF (Joint Force Special
          Operations Component Commander (JFSOCC)), the focus changes, but the forces
          remain the same. Therefore, the TSOC normally delegates OPCON of AFSOF to
          a Joint Special Operations Air Component Commander who is usually dual-hatted
          as Commander of Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF) or
          Commander of Army Special Operations Aviation (COMARSOA).
          1.2.2.2.3.2. In smaller operations, the JSOACC/COMAFSOC may be
          subordinated to a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF). In this situation,
          the TSOC may choose to delegate OPCON to the JSOTF Commander.
          1.2.2.2.3.3. Under certain circumstances, a JSOTF commander may directly
          exercise OPCON of AFSOF, reporting to the President/SECDEF through the
          CJCS.
    1.2.2.3. Tactical Control (TACON).
       1.2.2.3.1. TACON is command authority over assigned or attached forces or
       commands, or military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited
       to the detailed direction and control of movements or maneuvers within the
       operational area necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned. TACON is
       inherent in OPCON. It may be delegated to, and exercised at, any level at or below
       the level of combatant command. TACON provides sufficient authority for
       controlling and directing the application of force or tactical use of combat support
       assets within the assigned mission or task. TACON does not provide organizational
       authority or authoritative direction for administrative and logistic support; the
       commander of the parent unit continues to exercise these authorities unless otherwise
       specified in the establishing directive.
       1.2.2.3.2. Depending on the nature of a given operational mission, COMAFSOC may
       either retain TACON of CONUS-based AFSOF (active duty, reserve, and guard on
       Title 10 orders) or delegate TACON to subordinate Special Operations wings
       (SOWs).
       1.2.2.3.3. The combatant commanders of the various geographic combatant
       commands (GCCs) exercise TACON of forces deployed to their theaters for exercise
       purposes. TACON of forward-based and forward-deployed AFSOF is normally
       executed through a JSOACC.
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                           7


      1.2.2.4. Other Authorities. In addition to COCOM, OPCON, and TACON, recognized
      operational command authorities include Support (Direct, General, Mutual, and Close
      Support), Direct Liaison Authority (DIRLAUTH), and Coordinating Authority (See JP 1,
      Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States for definitions and discussion of these
      authorities). These relationships are extremely flexible and specific authorities are
      established based upon the situation.

Figure 1.1. Typical Operational Command Authorities (Title 10, Section 164) for SOF Air.




   1.2.3. Administrative Control (ADCON). [See Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3]
      1.2.3.1. ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other
      organizations in respect to administration and support, including organization of Service
      forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics,
      individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other
      matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.
      It is a Service authority, not a joint authority. It is exercised under the authority of and is
8                                                             AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


    delegated by the service secretaries. ADCON is synonymous with the Services’ Title 10
    authorities and responsibilities. However, 10 U.S.C. § 167 vests CDR, USSOCOM with
    certain Service-like responsibilities, to include specified elements of ADCON over all
    SOF, worldwide, with regard to Special Operations-unique requirements.
    1.2.3.2. The SECAF exercises primary ADCON of all active duty AFSOF world-wide
    through CSAF to COMAFSOC, and of Air Force Reserve SOF through the Commander,
    Air Force Reserve Command. CDR, USSOCOM exercises specified ADCON over all
    AFSOF through COMAFSOC. CDR, USSOCOM’s specified ADCON responsibilities
    include: developing strategy, doctrine, and tactics; preparing and submitting program
    recommendations and budget proposals for Special Operations forces and other forces
    assigned to USSOCOM; exercising authority, direction, and control over the expenditure
    of funds for forces assigned to the Special Operations command and for Special
    Operations forces assigned to other UCCs; training assigned forces; conducting
    specialized courses of instruction for commissioned and noncommissioned officers;
    validating requirements; establishing priorities for requirements; ensuring the
    interoperability of equipment and forces; formulating and submitting requirements for
    intelligence support; monitoring the promotions, assignments, retention, training, and
    professional military education of Special Operations forces officers; ensuring the combat
    readiness of forces assigned to the Special Operations command; monitoring the
    preparedness to carry out assigned missions of Special Operations forces assigned to
    other unified combatant commands; development and acquisition of Special Operations-
    peculiar equipment; and acquisition of Special Operations-peculiar material, supplies,
    and services.
    1.2.3.3. COMAFSOC is responsible to both CDRUSSOCOM and CSAF for executing
    their separate world-wide ADCON responsibilities. To ensure that those responsibilities
    are adequately executed for forward-based or forward-deployed AFSOF, COMAFSOC,
    in coordination with CDRUSSOCOM and the Commander, Theater Special Operations
    Command, nominates a Commander, Air Force Special Operations Forces
    (COMAFSOF) to ensure continuity and integration of operations and to ―         carry‖
    COMAFSOC’s (and hence CDRUSSOCOM’s and CSAF’s) ADCON authorities
    forward.
    1.2.3.4. COMAFSOC will normally transfer specified elements of ADCON to Air Force
    installation commanders for AFSOF units assigned/attached to Air Force installations
    (i.e. AFSOF tenants). The Air Force host installation commander will exercise his/her
    authority over, and responsibilities for, Air Forces forces on his/her base as specified in
    the applicable order (e.g. DEPORD) or agreement (e.g. MOA). Such authorities and
    responsibilities may include UCMJ, protection of assigned forces and assets, billeting,
    dining, and administrative reporting. Similarly, for AFSOF units operating on
    expeditionary Air Force installations (i.e. Air Force officer designated as installation
    commander), COMAFSOC will normally transfer specified ADCON of those forces to
    the installation commander.

Figure 1.3. Typical Special Operations ADCON (Title 10, Section 167) Relationships for
SOF Air.




1.3. AFSOF Units. Air Force Special Operations Forces are composed of one major command
(MAJCOM), one Numbered Air Force (NAF) with one directly-subordinate Air and Space
Operations Center (AOC) and two squadrons, two active duty Special Operations Wings
(SOWs), one Air Force Reserve SOW, one Air National Guard SOW, one Special Tactics Group
(STG), two overseas Special Operations Groups (SOGs), and the Air Force Special Operations
Training Center (AFSOTC).
     1.3.1. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). AFSOC is commanded by an
     Air Force Lieutenant General, who is usually referred to as COMAFSOC. AFSOC is a
     management headquarters and thus has a full range of functional staff (AFI 38-101). AFSOC
     is an Air Force MAJCOM, the Air Force Lead MAJCOM for Special Operations, the Air
     Force Lead MAJCOM for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and the Component
     MAJCOM to USSOCOM.
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                       11


     1.3.1.1. As an Air Force MAJCOM, AFSOC is responsible for organizing, training, and
     equipping Air Force Special Operations Forces; establishing policy and providing
     guidance to those forces; and providing those operationally ready forces to unified,
     specified, and Air Force commands worldwide (organize, train, and equip / policy and
     guidance, or OT&E/P&G). It is also responsible for providing non-SOF operational
     support forces, conducting operational test and evaluation for Air Force Special
     Operations, and providing education in Special Operations.
     1.3.1.2. As the USAF Lead MAJCOM for Special Operations, AFSOC is the proponent
     to CSAF and within the USAF on all matters relating to Air Force Special Operations.
     1.3.1.3. As the USAF Lead MAJCOM for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS),
     AFSOC will coordinate with all user commands to establish the guidance for operations
     of SUAS and training and evaluation of crews.
     1.3.1.4. As the Air Force Component MAJCOM to USSOCOM, AFSOC executes or
     directly supports Special Operations activities through its subordinate organizations and
     maintains command authorities consistent with OPCON as directed in USSOCOM
     Directive 10-1 (Terms of Reference).
  1.3.2. 23d Air Force (23 AF). 23 AF is a Component Numbered Air Force (NAF)
  commanded by a Brigadier General (23 AF/CC) who is dual-hatted as the AFSOC Director
  of Operations (AFSOC/A3). A NAF is a level of command directly under a MAJCOM and
  is a tactical echelon that provides operational leadership and supervision. It is not a
  management headquarters and does not have a complete functional staff (AFI 38-101). As a
  component NAF headquarters, 23 AF supports the AF component commander
  (COMAFSOC) at the operational and tactical level. As with other Component NAFs, 23 AF
  includes, but is not limited to, an AOC Weapons System and AFFOR staff (HQ USAF
  Program Action Directive 06-09). 23 AF provides centralized command and control over all
  Air Force Forces assigned or attached to USSOCOM. 23 AF provides the CDRUSSOCOM
  visibility over Service force activities, and contributes to joint solutions on a variety of
  issues, including strategies, administration and logistics, personnel, security cooperation,
  joint communications, joint basing, joint training, and prioritization of resourcing efforts.
  Effective C2 of air, space and information operations forces requires headquarters that are
  properly structured, equipped, manned and trained. However, effective C2 also requires
  leadership that can properly focus on the assigned mission, which may fall anywhere within
  the range of military operations. The 23 AF/CC supports COMAFSOC by maintaining and
  directing a staff and subordinate organizations that are focused on operations and operational
  support rather than OT&E/P&G. The 23 AF staff consists of a dual-hatted A3/23AF
  Director of Staff, special staff, and administrative staff. COMAFSOC executes OPCON
  through 23AF/CC. 23 AF/CC, in turn, monitors, assesses, plans, and, when directed,
  executes day-to-day activities of CONUS-based and selected OCONUS AFSOF through the
  623 AOC.
  1.3.3. 623d Air and Space Operations Center (623 AOC). The 623 AOC is a Wing-level
  organization, commanded by a Colonel. In general, an AOC is a USAF weapon system with
  the capability to plan, task, execute, monitor and assess air, space, and information operations
  (HQ USAF PAD 06-09). The 623 AOC executes air component functions for USSOCOM
  and AFSOC above wing level tasks, enables deployable Joint Special Operations Air
12                                                                  AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


     Components, and ensures special operations integration to Joint Forces Air Component
     Commanders through Special Operations Liaison Elements. The AOC is a persistent
     reachback command and control (C2), intelligence processing center, C4I integrator, and
     global force manager for AFSOC units and C2 elements worldwide. The 623 AOC acts as a
     proponent within the MAJCOM for operational and C2 requirements, supports 23 AF/CC
     and COMAFSOC at the operational and tactical levels, and manages external requests for
     support for AFSOC’s CONUS-based Special Operations Wings. The 623 AOC is
     specifically tailored to provide both forward-deployed C2 of airpower in support of SOF as
     well as reachback support to those forces. The AOC is a key element in fulfilling
     CDRUSSOCOM’s requirement for COMAFSOC to provide two Joint Special Operations
     Air Components (JSOACs) and two Special Operations Liaison Elements (SOLEs) that are
     trained, exercised, and tracked. AOC personnel are educated, trained, and experienced in
     both SOF and USAF C2 systems and processes, and therefore form a core capability that
     provides a robust operational-level C2 capability to CDRUSSOCOM, a JFSOCC, or JSOTF.
     1.3.4. 11th Intelligence Squadron (11 IS). The 11 IS reports to, and takes mission taskings
     from, 23 AF/CC. 11 IS provides USSOCOM, its components, and SOF worldwide with a
     focused, timely, multi-source intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability
     as part of the SOF Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS). The 11 IS executes
     processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) of full-motion video (FMV) from both
     manned and unmanned systems with other multi-source intelligence data to provide tailored
     support to the entire spectrum of special operations. The 11 IS fuses tactical and national-
     derived data and enables SOF operations with specialized products, derived from PED and
     fusion, tailored to meet their mission planning and execution requirements. The 11 IS
     executes PED either in a reachback mode from CONUS or deploys teams to forward SOF
     elements (Joint Special Operations Task Forces and/or Joint Special Operations Air
     Components) for line-of-sight execution. The 11 IS also trains and deploys enlisted and
     officer ISR Tactical Coordinators (ITC) that embed at the lowest tactical level to plan, task,
     control, and execute ISR operations.
     1.3.5. 18th Flight Test Squadron (18 FLTS). As AFSOC's independent field test agency,
     the 18th Flight Test Squadron evaluates aircraft, equipment and tactics in realistic battlespace
     environments to provide decision makers accurate, timely and complete assessments of
     mission capability. From concept development to system fielding, the unit's mission
     improves the survivability and combat capability of special operations forces worldwide.
     The 18 FLTS does not source force modules to Combatant Commanders, but rather provides
     SOF-unique skill sets (e.g. SOF aviators) as individuals to augment AFSOF units forward
     (e.g. Expeditionary Special Operations Wings, Joint Special Operations Air Components).
     1.3.6. 1st Special Operations Wing (1 SOW). 1 SOW directly reports to COMAFSOC but
     takes mission taskings from 23AF/CC. The 1 SOW is composed of a primary mission group
     – 1st Special Operations Group (1 SOG) – as well as a Special Operations Maintenance
     Group (1 SOMXG), Special Operations Medical Group (1 SOMDG), and Special Operations
     Mission Support Group (1 SOMSG). By combining both mission and support elements, 1
     SOW provides a significant capability under a single commander. It is responsible for
     maintaining the installation (Hurlburt Field, FL) and is capable of self-support in functional
     areas like maintenance, supply, and munitions, as needed. The 1 SOW provides full-
     spectrum SOF combat capability through its subordinate units to include fires (AC-130U),
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                    13


  specialized mobility (MC-130H/P, CV-22, U-28A), helicopter air refueling (MC-130H/P),
  and a combat aviation advisory unit, as well as the maintenance, medical, and mission
  support required for deployed operations.
  1.3.7. 27th Special Operations Wing (27 SOW). 27 SOW directly reports to COMAFSOC
  but takes mission taskings from 23AF/CC. The 27 SOW is composed of a primary mission
  group – 27th Special Operations Group (27 SOG) – as well as a Special Operations
  Maintenance Group (27 SOMXG), Special Operations Medical Group (27 SOMDG), and
  Special Operations Mission Support Group (27 SOMSG). By combining both mission and
  support elements, 27 SOW provides a significant capability under a single commander. It is
  responsible for maintaining the installation (Cannon AFB, NM) and is capable of self-
  support in functional areas like maintenance, supply, and munitions, as needed. The 27
  SOW provides full-spectrum SOF combat capability through its subordinate units to include
  fires (AC-130H), specialized mobility (MC-130W/PC-12), helicopter air refueling (MC-
  130W), surveillance and reconnaissance (MQ-1/9), as well as the maintenance, medical, and
  mission support required for deployed operations.
  1.3.8. 919th Special Operations Wing (919 SOW). 919 SOW is a USSOCOM-assigned,
  AFSOC-gained reserve wing. When gained by AFSOC, 919 SOW reports to COMAFSOC,
  but takes mission taskings from 23 AF/CC. The 919 SOW is composed of a primary mission
  group – 919th Operations Group (919 OG) – as well as a Maintenance Group (919 MXG),
  Mission Support Group (919 MSG), and Medical Squadron (919 MDS). By combining both
  mission and support elements, 919 SOW provides a significant capability under a single
  commander. Eglin AFB (96 ABW) is responsible for maintaining the installation (Duke
  Field, FL), but the 919 SOW is capable of self-support in functional areas like maintenance,
  supply, and munitions, as needed. The 919 SOW provides specialized SOF mobility and
  helicopter air refueling (MC-130E), surveillance and reconnaissance (MQ-1 crews), and
  Operational and Flying Training Unit support (U-28) through its subordinate units, as well as
  the maintenance, medical, and mission support required for deployed operations.
  1.3.9. 193d Special Operations Wing (193 SOW). 193 SOW is a Pennsylvania Air
  National Guard Wing that, when mobilized under Title 10, is USSOCOM-assigned and
  AFSOC-gained. For Federal missions (Title 10), 193 SOW reports to COMAFSOC, but
  takes mission taskings from 23 AF/CC. The 193d SOW is composed of a primary mission
  group – 193d Special Operations Group (193 SOG) – as well as a Special Operations
  Maintenance Group (193 SOMXG), a Special Operations Mission Support Group (193
  SOMSG), and Special Operations Medical Group (193 SOMDG). By combining both
  mission and support elements, 193 SOW provides a significant capability under a single
  commander. 193 SOW is responsible for maintaining the military facilities at the Harrisburg
  International Airport, Middletown, Pennsylvania and is capable of self-support in functional
  areas like maintenance, supply, and munitions, as needed. The 193 SOW provides airborne
  psychological operations broadcasting and SOF (SOFFLEX) Mobility through AFSOC
  JAAC process and its subordinate units (EC-130J Commando Solo & EC-130J Non-
  Commando Solo aircraft), as well as the maintenance, medical, and mission support required
  for deployed operations.
  1.3.10. 720th Special Tactics Group (720 STG). 720 STG directly reports to
  COMAFSOC but takes mission taskings from 23AF/CC. The 720 STG is composed of a
  small group staff, four CONUS-based Special Tactics Squadrons (21, 22, 23, and 24 STS),
14                                                                AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


     two Air National Guard Special Tactics Squadrons (123 and 125 STS), one Air Support
     Operations Squadron (17 ASOS), one Combat Weather Squadron (10 CWS), and an
     Operations Support Squadron (720 OSS). In addition, the 720 STG provides administrative
     and logistics support to two overseas units (320 and 321 STS) that are assigned to the 353
     and 352 SOG, respectively. The 720 STG provides the air-surface interface for USSOCOM,
     to include Combat Control Teams, Pararescuemen, Combat Weather Teams, and selected
     Tactical Air Controllers. While largely self-reliant, 720 STG forces do depend upon
     supported organizations (e.g. Joint Special Operations Air Component, Joint Special
     Operations Task Force, Ranger Battalion) for some portions of their mission support.
     1.3.11. 352d Special Operations Group (352 SOG). 352 SOG is assigned to Commander
     United States European Command (CDR USEUCOM), who has delegated OPCON to
     Special Operations Command, Europe (SOCEUR). The 352 SOG is the focal point for all
     USAF special operations activities throughout the USEUCOM Theater. The 352 SOG
     Commander is designated the Commander, Air Force Special Operations Forces
     (COMAFSOF) in EUCOM and is dual-hatted as the Commander, Joint Special Operations
     Air Component - Europe (JSOAC-E), SOCEUR's standing headquarters for command and
     control of special operations and other designated aviation assets and activities. The 352
     SOG is an overseas, wing-equivalent group composed of a group staff, two special
     operations squadrons (7 SOS and 67 SOS), a maintenance squadron (352 SOMXS), a
     specialized operations support squadron (352 SOSS), and a special tactics squadron (321
     STS), that provides specialized SOF airpower and supporting functions throughout the
     EUCOM AOR or where required. By combining both mission and support elements, 352
     SOG provides a significant capability under a single commander. The 352 SOG receives
     administrative and logistics support (ADCON) through Air Force Special Operations
     Command (AFSOC). The 100th Air Refueling Wing (US Air Forces Europe, or USAFE) is
     responsible for maintaining the installation (RAF Mildenhall, UK), but the 352 SOG is
     capable of self-support in mission-critical functional areas such as maintenance, supply, and
     munitions, as needed. The 352 SOG provides specialized SOF mobility and helicopter air
     refueling (MC-130H and MC-130P) through its subordinate units, as well as the
     maintenance, medical, and mission support required for deployed operations.
     1.3.12. 353d Special Operations Group (353 SOG). 353 SOG is assigned to Commander
     United States Pacific Command (CDR USPACOM), who has delegated OPCON to Special
     Operations Command, Pacific (SOCPAC). The 353 SOG is the focal point for all USAF
     special operations activities throughout the USPACOM Theater. The 353 SOG Commander
     is designated the Commander, Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF) in
     PACOM, the Commander, Combined/Joint Special Operations Air Component (C/JSOACC)
     for operations in Korea, and may be designated JSOACC for other operations in the Pacific
     Theater by SOCPAC. The 353 SOG is an overseas, wing-equivalent group composed of a
     group staff, two special operations squadrons (1 SOS and 17 SOS), a maintenance squadron
     (353 SOMXS), a specialized operations support squadron (353 SOSS), and a special tactics
     squadron (320 STS), that provides specialized SOF airpower and supporting functions
     throughout the PACOM AOR or where required. By combining both mission and support
     elements, 353 SOG provides a significant capability under a single commander. The 353
     SOG receives administrative and logistics support (ADCON) through Air Force Special
     Operations Command (AFSOC). The 18th Wing (Pacific Air Forces, or PACAF) is
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                         15


   responsible for maintaining the installation (Kadena AB, Japan), but the 353 SOG is capable
   of self-support in functional areas like maintenance, supply, and munitions, as needed. The
   353 SOG provides specialized SOF mobility and helicopter air refueling (MC-130H and MC-
   130P) through its subordinate units, as well as the maintenance, medical, and mission support
   required for deployed operations.
   1.3.13. Air Force Special Operations Training Center (AFSOTC). AFSOTC reports to
   COMAFSOC. AFSOTC provides the means to recruit, assess, select, and train AFSOC
   aircrew and battlefield airmen. By consolidating the training elements from the SOWs and
   STG, AFSOTC provides a significant capability with AFSOC’s training under a single
   commander. AFSOTC works closely with AFSOC wings and groups to provide
   comprehensive and realistic training to Active Duty, Air Force Reserve and Air National
   Guard students. AFSOTC is composed of 6 subordinate units. The 19th Special Operations
   Squadron provides advanced Weapons Instruction and Mission Rehearsal and is the AFSOC
   formal school for Combat Aviation Advisors, AC-130U, PC-12/U-28A and MC-130E
   training and mission rehearsal. The 5th Special Operations Squadron, an Air Force Reserve
   unit, augments instruction and flying training within the 19th SOS. The Special Tactics
   Training Squadron trains SOF Battlefield Airmen (Combat Controllers; Pararescuemen;
   Special Operations Weather and Deployed Aircraft Ground Response personnel; Special
   Tactics and Combat Rescue Officers; and Combat Aviation Advisors) to integrate,
   synchronize and control air and space power on the battlefield. Detachment 1, AFSOTC’s
   detachment at Cannon AFB, provides advanced Weapons Instruction and Mission Rehearsal
   and is the AFSOC formal school for Q200, M-28, MQ-1, AC-130H and MC-130W training.
   It will be re-designated as the 551st SOS in 2009. The United States Air Force Special
   Operations School provides Special Operations education to DoD, USG, and selected foreign
   students, as well as foreign language instruction for AFSOC personnel. Finally, the 745
   Special Operations Squadron (Provisional) provides training in the RC-26, which is used for
   specialized airlift to SOF forces. The AFSOTC doesn’t source operational forces except as
   individual augmentees.
1.4. AFSOF Basic Operational Capability Requirements. AFSOF must be able to:
   1.4.1. Deploy combat forces and equipment to a variety of locations in hostile or denied
   areas using low-level, long-range, night, all-weather capable fixed-wing assets in the air-land

                                           Chapter 2

           FORCE PRESENTATION FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Commander, United States Special Operations Command (CDRUSSOCOM). Title 10
United States Code, Section 167 assigns all active and reserve special operations forces of the
armed forces stationed in the United States to USSOCOM. For purposes of Title 10, special
operations forces are identified as those core forces or augmenting forces in the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, Annex E, dated December 17, 1985; those described in
the Terms of Reference and Conceptual Operations Plan for the Joint Special Operations
Command, as in effect on April 1, 1986; or those designated as special operations forces by the
Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). For a list of all forces currently designated as special
operations forces, see the SECDEF Global Force Management Implementation Guidance
(GFMIG), Section II ―   Assignment of Forces (Forces For Unified Commands)‖, formerly the
―Forces For Letter‖. The Unified Command Plan (UCP) specifies that CDRUSSOCOM is the
SOF Joint Force Provider, responsible for providing combat-ready special operations forces to
other combatant commanders as directed; identifying and recommending global joint sourcing
solutions to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), in coordination with the Services
and other combatant commanders, from all special operations forces and capabilities; and
supervising the implementation of sourcing decisions. For SOF Air Force forces assigned to or
gained by AFSOC (generally those forces funded by Major Force Program 11), CDRUSSOCOM
works through COMAFSOC to deploy active component and/or mobilize and deploy reserve
component forces. For certain non-SOF Air Force forces assigned to or gained by AFSOC
(generally those non-SOF Air Force forces which may not be funded by Major Force Program 11
but which are organic to SOF Air Force force's operations), CDRUSSOCOM works through
COMAFSOC to deploy active component and/or mobilize and deploy reserve component forces.
2.2. Commander, United States Joint Forces Command (CDRUSJFCOM). Title 10 United
States Code, Section 162 directs the Secretaries of the military departments to assign all forces
under their jurisdiction to unified and specified combatant commands or to the United States
element of the North American Aerospace Defense Command to perform missions assigned to
those commands. It further directs that such assignments be made as directed by the Secretary of
Defense, including direction as to the command to which forces are to be assigned. The
SECDEF GFMIG, in turn, assigns all active and reserve forces of the armed forces stationed in
the United States that are not designated as special operations forces to USJFCOM. The UCP
specifies that USJFCOM is the Primary Joint Force Provider for conventional forces responsible
for deploying trained and ready joint forces and providing operational and intelligence support
from assigned forces in response to the requirements of supported combatant commanders;
identifying and recommending global joint sourcing solutions to the CJCS, in coordination with
the Services and other combatant commanders, from all worldwide forces and capabilities
(except designated forces sourced by USSOCOM, USSTRATCOM, and USTRANSCOM), and
supervising the implementation of sourcing decisions; and serving as the DoD Joint Deployment
Process Owner, responsible for maintaining the global capability for rapid and decisive military
force power projection and redeployment. For non-SOF Air Force forces assigned to or gained
by AFSOC (generally those forces funded by other than Major Force Program 11),
CDRUSJFCOM works through COMACC to deploy active component and/or mobilize and
deploy reserve component forces. For certain non-SOF Air Force forces assigned to or gained
18                                                            AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


by AFSOC (generally those forces funded by other than Major Force Program 11 and not
organic to SOF Air Force force's operations), CDRUSJFCOM works through COMACC to
deploy active component and/or mobilize and deploy reserve component forces.
2.3. Commander, Air Force Special Operations Command (COMAFSOC). Air Force
Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is the Service component to USSOCOM. The AFSOC
commander (COMAFSOC) is charged with providing trained and ready Air Force special
operations forces to the CCDRs. When directed by CDRUSSOCOM, COMAFSOC deploys
active component AFSOF and/or mobilizes and deploys reserve component forces.
2.4. Commander, ACC (COMACC). Air Combat Command (ACC) is the Service component
to USJFCOM. The ACC Commander (COMACC) is charged with providing trained and ready
conventional Air Force forces to the CCDRs. When directed by CDRUSJFCOM, COMACC
deploys active component and/or mobilizes and deploys reserve component forces. ACC is
supported by the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) for the deployment of Expeditionary
Combat Support Forces. The AFPC also schedules UTCs and airmen to fill individual
augmentation billets and Joint Expeditionary Taskings (formerly In Lieu Of (ILO) taskings) for
the USAF.
2.5. Combatant Commanders (CCDRs). Title 10 United States Code, Section 162, states that,
―A force assigned to a combatant command or to the United States element of the North
American Aerospace Defense Command under this section may be transferred from the
command to which it is assigned only by authority of the Secretary of Defense; and under
procedures prescribed by the Secretary and approved by the President.‖ In accordance with the
SECDEF GFMIG, a CCDR requiring additional forces to meet operational requirements submits
a Request for Forces (RFF) to the Joint Staff. The Joint Staff, in coordination with the Joint
Force Providers (USJFCOM, USSOCOM, and USTRANSCOM), Military Departments,
applicable combatant commands, and the OSD, validates the RFF and identifies a sourcing
solution, after which the CJCS certifies and releases force allocations orders (DEPORD, PTDO,
GFMAP Modifications, EXORD Modification) under the authority of the SECDEF. For a
detailed discussion of this process, see the SECDEF GFMIG. When forces arrive in theater, the
CCDR determines the command relationships of those forces. Normally, OPCON of SOF will
be delegated to the TSOC. Other forces required for execution of the SOF mission may also be
provided OPCON to the TSOC.
2.6. Theater SOCs (TSOCs). TSOCs (e.g. Special Operations Command Central, or
SOCCENT) conduct analyses of their assigned missions and determine the forces required to
accomplish them. If forces assigned are inadequate, they generate RFFs for submission to their
combatant commanders for validation and forwarding to the SECDEF. When special operations
forces arrive in theater, the combatant commanders will normally delegate OPCON of those
forces to the TSOC for mission execution and may delegate OPCON of other forces required for
execution of the SOF mission. The TSOC may conduct Reception, Staging, Onward Movement,
and Integration (RSOI) of forces made available by the CCDR to prepare them for combat
operations. Once those forces are ready, the TSOC makes them available to the CFSOCC
(usually the same commander, but a different staff function). The CFSOCC executes command
and control of forces provided for combat operations.
2.7. CONUS-Based Units. Air Force units (e.g. 1 SOW, 4 SOS) are established through
publication of G-Series orders under the authority provided the Secretary of the Air Force
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                     19


(SECAF) under 10 U.S.C. § 8013. Air Force special operations forces assigned COCOM to
USSOCOM by the GFMIG are administratively assigned to those units to fulfill the SECAF’s
requirement to organize, train, and equip forces. When given an operational mission to execute
by the SECDEF, CDRUSSOCOM may execute OPCON of forces from those units through
COMAFSOC; however CDRUSSOCOM usually acts in his capacity as the SOF Joint Force
Provider, providing forces from those units OPCON (CHOPs) to geographic combatant
commanders at the direction of the SECDEF.
2.8. OCONUS-Based Units. Air Force units (e.g. 352 SOG, 67 SOS) are established through
publication of G-Series orders under the authority provided the Secretary of the Air Force
(SECAF) under 10 U.S.C. § 8013. Air Force special operations forces assigned COCOM to the
geographic combatant commanders by the GFMIG are administratively assigned to those units to
fulfill the SECAF’s requirement to organize, train, and equip forces. The geographic combatant
commanders usually execute OPCON of forces from those units through the TSOC; however the
geographic combatant commander may provide forces from those units OPCON (CHOP) to
another geographic commander after coordination with USSOCOM, as the SOF Joint Force
Provider and at the direction of the SECDEF.
2.9. Expeditionary Units. Expeditionary units (e.g. 623 ESOG, 318 ESOS) are established
through publication of G-Series orders under the authority provided the Secretary of the Air
Force (SECAF) under 10 U.S.C. § 8013. Air Force special operations forces attached OPCON
(CHOPed) to a combatant commander under a SECDEF deployment order (DEPORD) or
execution order (EXORD) are administratively assigned to those units to fulfill the SECAF’s
requirement to provide administrative and logistics support to those forces. The geographic
combatant commanders usually exercise OPCON/TACON of the forces assigned to the
expeditionary units in their AOR through the TSOC and JSOACC, and CDRUSSOCOM and the
SECAF provide ADCON support (SOF-unique and Service common, respectively) to the forces
assigned to the expeditionary units through the COMAFSOF.
2.10. Overview of the RFF Process.
   2.10.1. Generating the RFF. When a combatant commander (CCDR) is given a mission,
   he conducts a mission analysis during which he identifies the forces required to meet
   operational requirements and tasks to subordinates – to include tasks for the SOF component.
   The TSOC or, when established, the CFSOCC conducts a mission analysis for those tasks
   that the CCDR has given him and similarly identifies the forces required to meet operational
   requirements. If the TSOC/CFSOCC determines that he requires SOF air assets in excess of
   those assigned to him (to include STS, Combat Weather, and SOF TACPs), he submits a
   request for forces (RFF) to the CCDR for validation. The CCDR’s staff ensures that there
   are no assets assigned or attached to his command that can satisfy the TSOC/CFSOCC
   requirement and, if there aren’t, submits the RFF to the Joint Staff for validation. The CCDR
   will also submit RFFs for non-SOF Air Force forces to the Joint Staff, some of which may be
   sourced from non-SOF personnel assigned to AFSOC (e.g. Expeditionary Combat Support).
   2.10.2. Sourcing Requests for Air Force SOF. IAW the GFMIG, the Joint Staff, in
   coordination with the Joint Force Providers (USJFCOM, USSOCOM, and USTRANSCOM),
   Military Departments, applicable combatant commands, and the OSD, validates the RFF and
   identifies a sourcing solution. Since the Unified Command Plan (UCP) specifies that
   CDRUSSOCOM is the SOF Joint Force Provider, RFFs for SOF air capabilities will be
20                                                               AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


     forwarded to USSOCOM for feasibility assessment, validation, and sourcing. In turn,
     USSOCOM will request a feasibility assessment from Air Force Special Operations
     Command (AFSOC), as the Service component to USSOCOM. AFSOC will look at what
     forces are available globally (CONUS and OCONUS), and make a sourcing recommendation
     to USSOCOM. If the recommended solution is to source forces from another geographic
     combatant command, USSOCOM will coordinate with that command prior to submitting the
     recommended solution to the Joint Staff.
     2.10.3. Sourcing Requests for Non-SOF. Since the Unified Command Plan (UCP)
     specifies that USJFCOM is the Primary Joint Force Provider for conventional forces, RFFs
     for conventional capabilities will be forwarded to USJFCOM for feasibility assessment,
     validation and sourcing. In turn, USJFCOM will request a feasibility assessment from Air
     Combat Command (ACC), as the Service component to USJFCOM. In coordination with
     the Air Force Personnel Center, ACC will look at what forces are available globally
     (CONUS and OCONUS), and make a sourcing recommendation to JFCOM. If the
     recommended solution is to source forces from another geographic combatant command,
     USJFCOM will coordinate with that command prior to submitting the recommended solution
     to the Joint Staff. AFSOC forces are largely aligned to the Enabler Library; however,
     AFSOC has a number of forces (generally those forces funded by other than Major Force
     Program 11) that are included in the Air Force’s AEF system and are vulnerable to AEF
     tasking.
     2.10.4. Deploying Forces in Response to the RFF. Once the RFF has been validated and a
     sourcing solution identified, the CJCS certifies and releases force allocation orders
     (DEPORD, PTDO, GFMAP Modifications, EXORD Modification) under the authority of the
     SECDEF. The force allocation orders will direct the losing CCDR to relinquish OPCON and
     the gaining CCDR to assume OPCON of the deploying force at a specific point in space or
     time, but generally does not specify command relationships below the CCDR. Once the
     orders are released, the CCDR normally determines the command relationships of the
     inbound forces (usually, OPCON of SOF will be delegated to the TSOC, while other forces
     required for execution of the SOF mission may also be provided OPCON to the TSOC).
     COMAFSOC will publish G-Series orders for expeditionary units to which deploying Air
     Force SOF will be attached and, in coordination with the TSOC, designate a COMAFSOF
     for the theater (if one is not already designated). For AFSOC personnel deploying in support
     of AEF rotations, the theater COMAFFOR will establish the units to which the deploying
     AFSOC personnel will be attached.
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                      21


                                          Chapter 3

                         COMMAND AND CONTROL OF AFSOF

3.1. Global Commitment. The Air Force special operations mission is supported by global
special operations command and control networks provided by USSOCOM, AFSOC, and the
Theater Special Operations Commanders (SOCs). Expansion of this network is necessary during
wartime, contingencies, and exercises to support an increase in operating locations and aircraft
utilization rates. USEUCOM and USPACOM have permanently assigned forces, a designated
Commander of Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF), and a standing theater Joint
Special Operations Air Component (JSOAC). The other theaters are provided a designated
COMAFSOF with the forces deployed to their areas of responsibility (AORs) who is usually
designated the JSOAC Commander (JSOACC) by the TSOC.
3.2. Key Components of SOF Theater Command and Control. The following are key
components of SOF C2 in a Combatant Commander’s Area of Responsibility:
   3.2.1. Theater Special Operations Commander (TSOC). The TSOC is a subordinate
   unified commander under a Combatant Commander (CCDR). While a TSOC is established
   at the discretion of the CCDR, all theaters except USNORTHCOM have done so. Currently
   established TSOCs include: SOCEUR, SOCPAC, SOCSOUTH, SOCCENT, SOCAFRICA,
   and SOCKOR (Korea). In lieu of a standing TSOC, USNORTHCOM has established a
   Special Operations Division under the J3 (J3-SOD). The TSOC’s role is similar to that of the
   Service component commanders in a theater (e.g. COMUSAFE, COMPACAF), except that
   special operations forces are intrinsically joint, that is, joint by nature. The TSOC has four
   primary responsibilities: provide Special Operations expertise and advice to the Combatant
   Commander, assume OPCON of SOF made available by the CCDR, provide SOF ADCON
   support to SOF assigned to theater (see chapter 1 for a discussion of SOF-unique ADCON),
   and maintain a theater-wide focus.
   3.2.2. Joint Forces Special Operations Component (JFSOC). A JFSOC is an operational-
   level warfighting functional component for Special Operations under a CCDR. A JFSOC is
   established (and a commander appointed – the JFSOCC) at the discretion of the CCDR and
   fulfills the same role as other functional component commanders (e.g. JFACC, JFLCC). The
   TSOC is normally designated the JFSOCC. When established, the JFSOCC is the senior
   SOF operational commander in a theater and normally has TACON of SOF made available
   for tasking by the TSOC.
   3.2.3. Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF). A JSOTF is a command element
   that is usually established for a limited-duration operation or responsible for a limited
   operational area. Depending on the theater organization and the JSOTF mission, the JSOTF
   may have an operational-level or tactical-level focus. The JSOTF may be composed of any
   combination of an Army Special Operations Task Force (ARSOTF), Ranger Task Force,
   Marine Special Operations Component (MARSOC), Navy Special Operations Component
   (NAVSOC), or, when a JSOAC has not been established, an Air Force Special Operations
   Force (AFSOF).
   3.2.4. Commander, Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF). The
   COMAFSOF is the senior Air Force SOF airman in theater. The COMAFSOF and staff is
22                                                                 AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


     the Air Force component of the subordinate unified command for Special Operations in the
     Theater (TSOC). The COMAFSOF has OPCON of theater-assigned or –attached AFSOF
     and provides SOF and Service ADCON support to subordinate forces. The COMAFSOF is
     therefore responsible for AFSOF’s C2, operations, logistics, transportation, intelligence,
     communications, medical, maintenance, and security.
     3.2.5. Joint Special Operations Air Component (JSOAC). The term JSOAC refers to the
     commander and staff of a joint special operations functional air component under a unified
     command, subordinate unified command, or Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF).
     Authority to form a JSOAC rests solely with the Joint Forces Special Operations Component
     Commander (JFSOCC). The JSOAC is a scalable, operational-level, command and control
     (C2) organization, whose size and composition is tailored to the mission, and is established
     as the senior SOF air C2 element in a Joint Operating Area (JOA) or AOR. NOTE: The term
     JSOAC is also frequently used to refer to the forces under the command of the JSOAC
     Commander, though such forces are usually assigned to Expeditionary Special Operations
     Wings, Groups, and Squadrons (AF SOF) or Battalions, and Companies (USA SOF). The
     JSOAC commander (JSOACC) is normally the commander with the preponderance of assets
     and/or greatest ability to plan, coordinate, allocate, task, control, and support the assigned
     joint special operations aviation assets. The JSOAC is responsible for planning and
     executing joint special air operations, and for integrating, coordinating and deconflicting
     those operations with conventional air operations through the Special Operations Liaison
     Element (SOLE). When the JFSOCC establishes a JSOAC, he normally delegates OPCON
     of all SOF air assets to the JSOACC, who will also normally exercise TACON of other air
     assets made available to the SOF component by the CCDR to support SO in theater.
     3.2.6. Joint Special Operations Air Detachment (JSOAD) and Air Force Special
     Operations Detachment (AFSOD). JSOADs and AFSODs are scalable, tactical-level, C2
     organizations (joint and AF-only, respectively), that are subordinate to the JSOAC. The
     JSOACC normally establishes a JSOAD or AFSOD when he or she determines that mission
     requirements and/or the specific operating environment (distance, terrain, threat, etc) require
     geographically separated forces to most effectively or efficiently achieve the mission and that
     those forces require an intermediate, tactical C2 node. The JSOAD/AFSOD is responsible
     for tactical planning and force generation to accomplish missions assigned by the JSOACC.
     3.2.7. Special Operations Liaison Element (SOLE). The Joint Forces Special Operations
     Component Commander (JFSOCC) normally provides a SOLE to the JFACC to coordinate
     and synchronize SOF air, surface and subsurface operations with joint air operations. The
     SOLE Director places liaison officers in divisions of the JAOC to integrate with the JFACC
     staff. The SOLE Director also serves as the JFSOCC’s personal liaison to the JFACC. The
     SOLE coordinates, integrates, and deconflicts all SOF air, surface and subsurface activities
     by providing a SOF presence in the JAOC. Additionally, the SOLE ensures coordination of
     SOF operations in the JFACC’s air tasking order and airspace control order (ATO/ACO).
     3.2.8. Joint Air Coordination Element (JACE). The JACE is an organization that
     provides air expertise to the JSOTF/JFSOC Commander and staff and is an extension of the
     JSOAC. The JACE Director reports directly to the JSOACC who will normally delegate
     specific authorities to the JACE Director. The JACE will be aligned and collocated with the
     JFSOCC/JSOTF and will advise and coordinate all SOF and conventional air support for the
     JFSOCC/COMJSOTF and manage air assets in his Joint Special Operations Area (JSOAC),
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                      23


   when established. The JACE composition is mission-dependent, but may include SOF and
   conventional Fires personnel (TACP JTACs or ALO/Non-rated ALO), Combat Controllers
   (STS/CCT), ISR collection managers, and Electronic Warfare Officers. The JACE manages
   all JTACs or other air experts attached to lower echelons (e.g. ODAs), ensuring they are
   current and qualified when entering the theater.
   3.2.9. Expeditionary Special Operations Wings/ Groups/ Squadrons (ESOW/G/S). The
   COMAFSOF usually organizes deployed AFSOC forces into expeditionary units
   (wings/groups/squadrons) to provide clear OPCON and ADCON authorities to those forces
   and to preserve unit history. The COMAFSOF exercises OPCON of assigned and attached
   forces unless/until the JFSOCC establishes a JSOAC and designates a JSOACC, in which
   case/at which time the JSOACC exercises OPCON. The COMAFSOF provides ADCON to
   assigned and attached forces through these expeditionary units. As depicted in Figure 1-1 in
   Chapter 1, OPCON authorities are normally delegated from the CCDR to the Theater
   SOC/JFSOCC to the JSOACC to command assigned forces (the ESOW or ESOG to the
   lowest tactical level). As depicted in Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1, the Service ADCON
   authorities are normally delegated from the SECAF to COMAFSOC and Theater
   COMAFFOR to the COMAFSOF in theater to provide administrative and logistics support to
   assigned and attached forces (the ESOW or ESOG to the lowest tactical unit). As depicted in
   Figure 1-3 in Chapter 1, SOF ADCON authorities are normally delegated from the ASD-
   SOLIC to USSOCOM to COMAFSOC and the Theater SOC to the COMAFSOF in theater
   to provide administrative and logistics support to assigned and attached forces (the ESOW or
   ESOG to the lowest tactical unit). To the extent possible, unit history is preserved through
   expeditionary unit associations to force provider units (e.g. 16 SOS providing forces to 16
   ESOS).
3.3. Transfer of Forces Procedures.
   3.3.1. USSOCOM as SOF Joint Force Provider. AFSOC forces provided by USSOCOM
   to a combatant command under force allocation orders (DEPORD, PTDO, GFMAP
   Modifications, EXORD Modification) are under the control of COMAFSOC until reaching a
   specific point in time or space designated in the force allocation orders, at which point the
   gaining CCDR assumes OPCON. COMAFSOC exercises control through the 23 AF/CC
   who, in turn, controls and supports the deploying force through the 623 AOC.
   3.3.2. Other CCDR as Force Provider. AFSOC forces provided by one CCDR to another
   under force allocations orders are under the operational control of the losing CCDR until
   reaching a specific point in time or space designated in the force allocation orders, at which
   point the gaining CCDR assumes OPCON. The specific command arrangement existing
   within the providing command may vary by theater, however, normally the CCDR delegates
   OPCON of assigned SOF to the TSOC, who delegates it further to the COMAFSOF. When a
   JSOAC is established by the TSOC/JFSOCC/COMJSOTF, the COMAFSOF is normally
   dual-hatted as the JSOACC and exercises OPCON/TACON of the deploying force until the
   force CHOPs to the gaining commander. Otherwise, the COMAFSOF exercises OPCON,
   TACON, and ADCON of the deploying force until it CHOPs to the gaining CCDR.
   3.3.3. Gaining Command with Established COMAFSOF. The COMAFSOF is the senior
   SOF Airman in a theater and executes Service ADCON responsibilities on behalf of
   COMAFSOC and theater COMAFFOR. The COMAFSOF also normally has OPCON of Air
24                                                                AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


     Force forces assigned to the special operations component. Command relationships may
     vary by theater, however, normally the gaining CCDR delegates OPCON of attached SOF to
     the TSOC, who delegates it further to the designated COMAFSOF. When a JSOAC is
     established by the TSOC/JFSOCC/COMJSOTF, the COMAFSOF is normally dual-hatted as
     the JSOACC and exercises OPCON/TACON of the arriving force after the force CHOPs.
     Otherwise, the COMAFSOF exercises OPCON, TACON, and ADCON of the arriving force.
     3.3.4. Gaining Command with No Established COMAFSOF. The COMAFSOF is the
     senior SOF Airman in a theater and executes Service ADCON responsibilities on behalf of
     COMAFSOC and the theater COMAFFOR. The COMAFSOF also normally has OPCON of
     Air Force forces assigned to the special operations component. Command relationships may
     vary by theater, however, normally the gaining CCDR delegates OPCON of attached SOF to
     the TSOC, who delegates it further to the designated COMAFSOF. If AFSOF are deploying
     to a theater in which they will be the first AFSOF presence and there is no standing or
     rotational COMAFSOF HQ, the TSOC will normally accept OPCON and TACON of the
     arriving force directly (usually through the SOJ3-Air) until such time as the deploying force
     is able to establish the necessary structure and processes to manage forces as the SOF air
     component.
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                      25


                                          Chapter 4

                       AFSOC DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Deployment Requirements. Each AFSOC unit must be prepared to deploy squadron
   elements or individuals on a no-notice basis to support worldwide crisis and contingency
   operations.
      4.1.1.1. ANG and USAFR SOF are augmenting forces designed to support CCDRs
      during crisis and contingency operations. It is essential that these forces be staffed,
      trained, and equipped with resources required to meet their wartime tasking.
      4.1.1.2. AFSOC forces will deploy with required mobility equipment, readiness spares
      packages (RSP) and necessary maintenance, supply, and planning personnel to perform
      planned mission sorties.
      4.1.1.3. AFSOC units with an Operations Plan (OPLAN) tasked mobility commitment,
      or units with a mobility capability designated by their designed operational capability
      (DOC) statement, will be provided with the mobility equipment required to support their
      mobility mission.
      4.1.1.4. When tasked to deploy, AFSOC units will pare and tailor existing UTCs to
      develop detailed plans and identify airlift requirements to AFSOC, and then be prepared
      to marshal forces and equipment to meet scheduled airlift.
   4.1.2. Employment Requirements.
      4.1.2.1. AFSOC units are equipped and prepared to operate under austere basing
      conditions.
      4.1.2.2. Base Operating Support (BOS) is the responsibility of the supported theater.
      4.1.2.3. Deployed units are prepared to operate at the wartime emergency work rates in
      the Air Force WMP-1, Manpower Supplement, on arrival at deployed locations.
      4.1.2.4. Deployed units are prepared to conduct theater operations in support of TSOC
      taskings.
   4.1.3. Training and Evaluation.
      4.1.3.1. To ensure mobility readiness, standards expressed in this regulation and AFSOC
      supplements will be reflected in documents used to define unit readiness capability,
      training requirement, and inspection criteria. Unilateral exercises, as well as operational
      training exercises, are essential to maintain these standards. Unit mobility capability is
      evaluated in operational readiness inspections and management capability inspections as
      detailed in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities.
      4.1.3.2. According to AFPD 16-8, Arming of Aircrew, Mobility, and Overseas, all unit
      type codes (UTC) members deploying outside of the contiguous United States (CONUS)
      must be armed and have completed weapons qualification training. In addition, all
      members will complete arming and use of force training.
26                                                               AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


        4.1.3.3. Unit commanders will ensure that all military personnel and emergency essential
        civilians deploying to a CBRN Medium Threat Area (MTA) or High Threat Area (HTA)
        complete the demonstration-performance portion of CBRN training, NLT 60 days after
        completing the computer based portion training
        4.1.3.4. Unit commanders will ensure that all personnel requiring specialized emergency
        management training (e.g. shelter management, contamination control) receive that
        training.
        4.1.3.5. Unit commanders will ensure that all personnel requiring specialized training on
        the Chemical/Biological Aircraft Survivability Barrier (CASB) receive that training.
     4.1.4. Chemical/Biological Aircraft Survivability Barrier (CASB) Capability. CASB
     provides AFSOC MC-130 aircraft with a unique capability to safely transport and handle
     CBRN-contaminated warfighters and equipment without cross-contaminating the aircraft.
     This capability is limited but available for immediate employment wherever MC-130
     operations are deployed/employed.
     4.1.5. Munitions Capabilities. Specific plans provide instructions for the designation,
     airlift, and employment of standard air munitions packages (STAMP) and standard tanks,
     racks, adapters, and pylons packages (STRAPP). These packages are available for
     immediate deployment upon unit notification. Coordination among Air Force, Air Force
     Material Command, and air component commanders is maintained to ensure development
     and maintenance of STAMP and STRAPP remain consistent with planned use.
4.2. CONUS-Based Special Operations Wings:
     4.2.1. General.
        4.2.1.1. The 1 SOW and 27 SOW will be the initial response force for no-notice crises in
        theaters where no forward deployed forces are stationed.
        4.2.1.2. The 193 SOW is an Air National Guard unit. Its primary mission is providing
        psychological operation support with the EC-130 Commando Solo.
        4.2.1.3. The 919 SOW is an Air Force Reserve unit. It provides CONUS-based special
        operations fixed wing aircraft, MQ-1 crews, and support personnel.
        4.2.1.4. The SOWs do not deploy as complete units but must be able to provide detailed
        force modules of personnel and equipment necessary to rapidly deploy to austere
        locations and commence stand-alone operations. Detailed force modules reside in JOPES.
        The SOWs have coordinated mobility staffs which can tailor force packages to ensure
        flexible and effective support for planning, staging, deployment, employment, and
        mission execution.
     4.2.2. Deployment and Employment. The CONUS-based SOWs must be able to:

adequate security by conducting vulnerability assessments, interfacing with in-place host nation
and other base defense forces, and providing close-in security for AFSOC resources.
   4.5.1. Anti-Terrorism Officers (ATO) are assigned to the JSOAC/JSOAD to advise the
   commander on issues related to AT/FP as well as SOSF requirements and employment.
   4.5.2. Flight leadership elements maintain C2 for up to 60 assigned SOSF personnel.
   4.5.3. Aircraft and site security teams provide security for deployed AFSOC aircraft and C4I
   facilities.
   4.5.4. Advanced designated marksmanship teams provide enhanced situational awareness
   though observation and reporting and can provide precision engagement out to 600 meters.
   4.5.5. SOF fly-away security teams (FAST) provide security for aircraft transiting airfields
   where security is unknown or deemed inadequate to counter local threats.
4.6. C2 Communications Support. The extent of communications support for a deployment
depends on the size of the base population supported and the communications capacity resident
at the base or provided by other forces. The A6 provides a scalable suite of communications
capability to right size the package deployed to the requirements of the deployed location. If
communication support is inadequate, the deployed A6 will identify shortfalls and initiate
request for additional communication support. AFSOC Communications provide the following
UTC’s:
30                                                              AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010

     breakouts the support provided by AFSOC communication units.
4.7. Civil Engineer. AFSOC maintains CE forces postured to support conventional Air
Expeditionary Forces and SOF taskings. This section specifically addresses deployment and
employment of SOF-supporting CE forces. These forces fill the void between early-arriving
SOF and the arrival of more robust conventional force base operating support (BOS). Teams
employ cutting edge Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP’s) and exploit new technology to
the greatest extent possible. Force packages are tailored to be as small as possible consistent
with mission accomplishment and, in most cases, personnel are trained in multiple skills to
substantially reduce the manpower footprint. SOF-supporting capabilities include Explosive
Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Gunship support and Force Protection teams, Civil Engineer
expeditionary teams, Emergency Management (CBRN/WMD) teams, Collective Protection (Col-
Pro), and a family of light easily employable beddown assets known as Air Rapid Response Kits
(ARRK). These teams, their capabilities, and TTP are largely unique to AFSOC.
     4.7.1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Gunship Support and Force Protection
     Teams. EOD teams provide a ―     render-safe‖ capability for AFSOC-unique aviation weapons
     systems and munitions. Additionally, these teams enhance force protection capabilities by
     defeating terrorist explosive devices. These teams deploy with and utilize specialized EOD
     equipment to include robotics, all terrain vehicles, and explosives.
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                    31


     4.7.1.1. AFSOC provides 1- and 2-person Special Operations Explosive Ordnance
     Disposal (SOEOD) independent and dependent UTCs equipped to provide immediate
     SOEOD capabilities to SOF worldwide.
     4.7.1.2. Two dependent UTCs are designed to fragment and move from beddown
     locations to forward areas with fixed-wing or rotary-wing assets for forward operations
     support. UTC’s can typically sustain operations without resupply for 10 days.
     4.7.1.3. SOEOD teams also augment the US Secret Service and the US State
     Department, providing protective services to the President, Vice President, and other
     dignitaries who may visit operational locations. These forces are able to deploy
     worldwide in accordance with the War and Mobilization Plan-1 (WMP-1).
     4.7.1.4. Deployment and Employment. To provide the capability described in the
     organization’s designed operational capability (DOC) statement, the teams must be able
     to: Survey deployment locations for explosive hazards; clear IED’s, booby-traps, and
     clandestine explosive devices from beddown and areas of operation; conduct munitions
     technical intelligence assessment, exploitation, certification and recovery; provide
     augmentation to other special operations forces or conventional forces on short notice.
     NOTE: SOEOD teams have a limited capability to employ by helo fast rope, repel, water,
     and watercraft.
  4.7.2. Civil Engineer Expeditionary Teams: Civil Engineer quick response teams (8 and 10
  personnel) set up, sustain, operate, and reconstitute AFSOC unique beddown assets at bare
  base and forward operating locations.
     4.7.2.1. Deployment and Employment. To provide the capability described in the

     surveys; layout beddown sites; and aid in the development of expedient force protection
     construction. These forces are able to deploy worldwide in accordance with the War and
     Mobilization Plan-1 (WMP-1).
  4.7.3. Emergency Management (CBRN/WMD) Teams;                        Chemical, Biological,
  Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) teams (1 and 2 personnel) provide preliminary risk and
  vulnerability assessment, CBRN/WMD warfare agent and Toxic Industrial Material (TIM)
  planning, detection, identification, sampling, reporting, mask refurbishment and personnel
  decontamination.
  4.7.4. Collective Protection (Col-Pro): Col-Pro teams (12 personnel)         setup, operate,
  maintain, and reconstitute a CBRN-hardened Collective Protection Small       Shelter System
  (CPSSS-3), which provides protection for approximately 60 (120 hot bunk)     personnel. In a
  CBRN environment the CPSSS-3 provides personnel with a toxin-free            rest and relief
  environment and can also be configured as a C2 facility.
  4.7.5. High-Mobility Decontamination System (HMDS): The HMDS is a one-of-a-kind
  HUMMVV-based tactical decontamination system capable of applying numerous
  decontaminants in diverse circumstances. The HMDS is capable of autonomously applying
  decontamination agents in high-reach, gross area, road surface, and point operations.
32                                                                  AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


     4.7.6. Air Rapid Response Kits (ARRK): ARRKs are rapid force beddown kits designed
     to support 100 personnel with billeting, shower/shave and a small command and control
     facility. Each ARRK requires three 463L pallet positions, easily deployable on one C-130
     aircraft. ARRK assets provide only the most basic necessities (no HVAC systems,
     rudimentary toilets, etc). This configuration allows ― light-lean-agile‖ mission-critical forces
     to move forward quickly. ―  Playbook Options‖ have been developed and to allow planners to
     flow additional support equipment as time and airlift allow.
        4.7.6.1. The basic ARRK includes the following equipment: (5) personnel shelters, (1)
        shower/shave shelter, (1) multi use shelter, (2) heavy duty commercial generators, (1)
        3,000 gallon water bladder, (1) brief relief latrine system with privacy tent, (1) Diesel/JP8
        water heater (1) four stall shower and (1) 3 basin field sink.
        4.7.6.2. The Environmental Control Unit (ECU) Option adds: (8) 5-Ton ECU’s, (2)
        35Kw Commercial generators, (4) Power Distribution Boxes with support equipment and
        HVAC technician tools. This option requires one pallet position.
        4.7.6.3. The Water Purification Option adds: (1) ASPEN 5000 system with support
        equipment (e.g. a 3000 gallon water bladder, solar power shade (1kw), light set, water
        test kit) to produce 5000 gallons of potable water per day. This option requires one pallet
        position.
        4.7.6.4. The Extreme Cold Weather Support Kit Option adds: Water heaters, hoses, and
        temperature-extreme-hardened water storage bladders. This option requires one pallet
        position.
        4.7.6.5. The Fuel Storage Option provides air transportable storage for 1000 gallons of
        fuel and requires one pallet position.
        4.7.6.6. The Weapons Storage Option provides cleaning, work surfaces, and storage for
        eighty M-16 or M-4 weapons. This option requires one pallet position.
        4.7.6.7. The Command and Control Facility Option provides a tactical C2 facility with
        several ancillary work areas that can be used for support activities such as Intel, MOC,
        etc. This kit provides work stations, status boards, projectors, tables, and chairs, but does
        not include ADP equipment. This option requires three pallet positions.
4.8. Medical. AFSOC maintains medical capabilities to provide medical support IAW Mission
Capabilities Statements (MISCAPS) described for assigned medical unit type codes (UTCs) to
meet the contingency medical support requirements of the force. They provide primary care,
force sustainment, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advanced Cardiac Life Support
(ACLS), preventive and aerospace medicine, and casualty evacuation support from forward areas
to the SOF air-ground interface point, usually at the SOF Intermediate or Forward Staging Base
(ISB/FSB). This capability can be provided in various conditions at austere, bare base, or fixed
base or during low light or night operations utilizing special night vision devices. At the
ISB/FSB, casualties transition to the conventional medical regulating and aeromedical
evacuation systems. These medical resources may deploy as a part of an aviation package or as a
tailored, task-organized module separate from aviation units depending on mission requirements.
AFSOC medical assets are limited and do not have the capability for inpatient medical care.
Therefore, proper planning and coordination is essential to ensure success of the entire medical
support mission.
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                        33


  4.8.1. The AFSOC Command Surgeon will ensure that AFSOF active duty and ARC-gained
  medical elements/units are organized, trained, equipped and maintained to meet mission
  requirements.
  4.8.2. Deployment of AFSOF medical resources is identified in the time-phased force and
  deployment list (TPFDL) of the supported commander. Once deployed to the theater of
  operations, these resources are under the operational control of the senior AFSOF line
  commander.
  4.8.3. On arrival at the employment location, AFSOF medical elements will:
     4.8.3.1. Establish contact with the supported air component command surgeon and the
     supported theater command surgeon.
     4.8.3.2. Coordinate with the appropriate theater aeromedical evacuation (AE) forces and
     ensure a smooth and effective interface between the SOF casualty evacuation and
     conventional AE systems.
     4.8.3.3. Establish and maintain liaison with the theater Patient Movement Requirements
     Center (PMRC), aeromedical staging activities, and inpatient treatment facilities.
     4.8.3.4. Establish an outpatient and advanced-trauma, life-support capable medical
     system consistent with the medical threat and oriented toward prevention of illness or
     injury for deployed personnel.
     4.8.3.5. Assess other military services, host nation and coalition medical capabilities.
     4.8.3.6. Provide initial medical command and control/liaison for all onsite AFSOF
     medical assets and as serve as the medical representative for JSOTF/JSOAC/SOG
     operation planning.
     4.8.3.7. Provide deployed preventive medicine and public health services for collocated
     JSOAC personnel.
     4.8.3.8. Develop CASEVAC/Transload operations plans.
     4.8.3.9. Provide JSOAC aircraft mishap response/investigation capabilities as required.
  4.8.4. Deployment and Employment Concept. The forces described above are designed to
  provide limited, quick-response medical support to SOF in an austere or bare-base
  environment. Normal base support functions such as billeting, messing, laundry, etc., must be
  provided to AFSOF medical forces for extended operations. AFSOC medical UTC have been
  developed utilizing the building block principle. This allows planners to select specific
  UTCs required to support a contingency or those used for developing OPLANs. This is
  accomplished by modifying medical assets to meet the operational need. Each UTC is
  developed to support a specific operational medical requirement and has specific mission
  capabilities. Equipment packages are designed for highly mobile and austere conditions. As
  workload changes or is expected to increase/decrease, UTC packages (personnel and
  equipment) can be tailored (up or down), replicated, or combined with previously deployed
  UTCs at the needed locations. The concept is to identify the actual resources required to
  meet mission requirements and choose the package/packages to support the need.
  Additionally it reduces the labor-intensive task of sending fragmented UTCs.
34                                                                AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010


        4.8.4.1. If AFSOF medical forces deploy to a SOF Intermediate or Forward Staging Base
        (ISB/FSB), AFSOF medical forces can combine to operate a unified medical element
        responsible to the joint special operations task force (JSOTF) Air Force special
        operations detachment (AFSOD) or theater AFSOC commander for medical support to
        the force. Normally, the senior deployed AFSOF flight surgeon will serve as the
        COMAFSOF/JSOAC surgeon.
     4.8.5. Mobility Capability Standards:
        4.8.5.1. AFSOF medical units will meet response times indicated in designed operational
        capability (DOC) statements.
        4.8.5.2. AFSOF medical forces will establish initial medical operations immediately
        upon arrival at the deployment location. Full operations will be established not later than
        four hours after arrival.
     4.8.6. Medical Support. AFSOF and AFSOF-gained Reserve medical units maintain
     assigned personnel and equipment UTCs in a high state of readiness to provide the medical
     personnel, supplies and equipment to provide medical support as listed in the mission
     capabilities section of the MANFOR.
        4.8.6.1. The AFSOC medical UTC employment concept is to deploy several UTCs in
        support of AFSOC missions. The Special Operations Forces Medical Element and SOF
        Medical Kit (backpack carried by each person) are the initial building blocks for AFSOC
        medical support and may be built upon as the contingency intensifies or as workload
        increases. Additional medical equipment and supplies can be provided by the Rapid
        Response Deployment Kit (whole or partial) or SOF Base Medical Support as the
        workload and medical requirements dictate.
        4.8.6.2. AFSOC can readily increase its medical capability at a staging base by adding an
        AFSOC Special Operations Surgical Team (SOST), Special Operations Critical Care
        Evacuation Teams (SOCCET), and/or SOF Medical Element Augmentation packages.
        Conventional medical and/or AE elements may also be integrated with organic medical
        capabilities of special operations units to enhance the medical and AE support to the
        operation as needed.
        4.8.6.3. A major benefit received from the development of the AFSOC medical modules
        is the flexibility for incremental deployment, modifying (up or down) the RRDK, and the
        overall effect of adjusting to or reducing transportation requirements. The SOF Medical
        Kit allows deploying medics to hand carry this initial response package with them on any
        organic deploying AFSOC aircraft or palletize it with other mobility equipment being
        marshaled. Follow on medical equipment can be transported as needed, or as airlift
        permits or by generating a separate airlift requirement. In essence, AFSOC medical
        capability can still be deployed when airlift is limited.
4.9. Chaplaincy. AFSOC maintains chaplaincy personnel, UTCs, and supply and equipment to
meet the contingency religious support requirements of the force. AFSOC may deploy chaplain
readiness teams (CRT) as part of an aviation package or separate from aviation units, depending
on mission requirements. AFSOC chaplaincy assets are limited and do not have the capacity for
simultaneously sustaining CONUS and deployed chaplaincy requirements. Therefore, proper
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                       35


planning and coordination is essential to ensure success of the entire chaplaincy support mission.
CRTs are comprised entirely of 52Rx and 5R0x1 personnel.
   4.9.1. The AFSOC command chaplain will:
       4.9.1.1. Ensure that AFSOC active duty and ARC-gained CRTs are organized, trained,
       equipped and maintained to meet mission requirements.
       4.9.1.2. Identify AFSOC CRTs deployed in the time phased force and deployment list
       (TPFDL) of the supported commander.
   4.9.2. Deployment and Employment Concepts:
       4.9.2.1. CRTs are designed to provide limited, quick response chaplaincy support.
       Normal base support functions such as billeting, messing laundry, etc., must be provided
       to AFSOC CRTs for extended operations.
       4.9.2.2. Once deployed to the theater of operations, these resources are under the
       operational control of the senior air component commander.
       4.9.2.3. On arrival at the employment location, AFSOC CRTs will provide ministry of
       presence, worship, liturgies and rites, pastoral counseling, and other appropriate
       ministries in support of the mission.
       4.9.2.4. If AFSOC CRTs deploy to an intermediate or forward staging base, they will
       combine with other deployed chaplaincy resources to operate a unified chaplaincy
       ministry responsible to the joint special operations task force commander.
   4.9.3. Mobility Capability Standards. AFSOC CRTs will provide appropriate religious
   support throughout pre-deployment, deployment, employment and redeployment phases.
   4.9.4. Chaplaincy Support. AFSOC and AFSOC-gained ARC CRTs maintain professional
   mobility equipment and lightweight mobility kits which provide the chaplain ministry
   supplies and equipment to provide religious support.

                                 AUSTERE BASE OPERATIONS

5.1. General. In certain operational situations, AFSOF may be required to conduct operations
from an austere location. AFSOC organizes, trains, and equips forces that can deploy in
minimum time and respond to immediate bare base operational requirements.
5.2. Bare-Base Operational Concepts. Support for AFSOF and the methods used to provide
such support are dependent on location, the concept of operations, and the availability of local
resources. The following basic concepts and standards are to provide general guidance for the
mobility of AFSOF during deployment, employment and redeployment when using bare bases.
     5.2.1. A primary consideration for AFSOF bare base operations is minimizing the number of
     personnel and the quantity and weight of equipment that must be deployed.
     5.2.2. HQ AFSOC will review bare base materiel requirements once a year with HQ AFMC
     to establish levels consistent with unit operational and population factors.
     5.2.3. Initial civil engineering support, including site layout, utilities, fire protection, crash
     rescue, emergency management, and special operations explosive ordnance disposal may be
     provided by AFSOF.
     5.2.4. The supported theater commander must provide en route and terminal navigational
     support as well as ensure required common-user communications are in place at deployed
     locations for support of AFSOF.
     5.2.5. SOF-unique assets required by AFSOF will be deployed or prepositioned as specified
     in the logistics annex of applicable OPLANs.
5.3. Base Operating Support Requirements. For AFSOF units deploying to an established
bare base, AFSOC will coordinate logistics support requirements with appropriate unified and
specified commands, the TSOC, other services, and geographic combatant commanders. The
base operating support provided by host units or commands includes, but may not be limited to:
     5.3.1. Supply and spares storage, and requisitioning and issue under standard supply system
     procedures. (AFSOF units should plan on using their readiness spares packages (RSP) for the
     first 30 days.)
     5.3.2. Available and dependable POL stocks and refueling capability, as required.
     5.3.3. Vehicle maintenance beyond the organic capability of the deployed AFSOF forces.
     5.3.4. Civil engineering support, including site layout, utilities, fire protection, and crash
     rescue, emergency management, and explosive ordnance disposal.
     5.3.5. Services (SV) support including food service, billeting, laundry, mortuary affairs,
     recreation centers and fitness centers.
     5.3.6. Weapon system security for deployed aircraft. If security or defense requirements at
     the deployment bases exceed host command and HQ AFSOC capabilities, US Air Force
     assistance may be required.
AFI10-410 7 JANUARY 2010                                                                       37


   5.3.7. Knowledge operations management support to include: Official and personal mail,
   reprographics and copier support, administrative orders, locator service, records
   management, document security guidance, and centralized classified destruction (with the
   unit retaining responsibility for actual destruction of classified material).
   5.3.8. Aircrew weather brief and staff support. If weather support is inadequate, AFSOC will
   arrange additional weather support.
5.4. Maintenance Concept. AFSOF units will initially deploy with equipment and personnel
necessary to perform on-equipment, remove and replace, flight line maintenance. The number
and types of maintenance personnel deployed for bare base operations are determined by the
projected maximum number of aircraft on the ground (by mission design series, requiring
simultaneous servicing). Heavy maintenance will be conducted at designated recovery locations
outside the contingency area. Deployment of follow-on intermediate level support equipment
will be under a separate UTC and predicated on the duration and location of the deployment.
5.5. Supply Concept.
   5.5.1. Initial supply support for AFSOF, other than war consumables, will be provided from
   a combination of the assets at the deployment base and home unit mobility, contingency, and
   RSP assets.
   5.5.2. Resupply will be provided by the theater commander through established supply
   channels as outlined in the logistics annex of each OPLAN and supporting plans.
   5.5.3. All mobility contingency equipment and aircraft spares will be configured on a
   modular concept to facilitate deployment and support of varied force sizes.
   5.5.4. War consumables, support equipment, and mobility contingency assets required to
   support deploying forces will be provided as specified in the logistics annex of each OPLAN
   and supporting plan.
   5.5.5. Aircraft will normally arrive in the contingency area with enough fuel for a departure
   flight to an en route or recovery base. Refueling of aircraft will not normally be conducted in
   the contingency area of operations.
5.6. Intelligence Support. AFSOF deploys with an organic Intelligence capability since host
units may not be able to satisfy SOF-unique requirements. AFSOF intelligence personnel
provide Intelligence support to mission planning and Intelligence briefing and debriefing.
5.7. Weather Support. AFSOC weather personnel deploying to the theater will be integrated
into theater weather teams. AFSOC will determine augmentation requirements as necessary.
   5.7.1. Weather Equipment. Weather units must identify equipment and maintenance
   requirements to the appropriate communications units. Adequate communication capabilities
   (including tactical) are essential for weather teams to provide meteorological services to
   deployed forces. When dedicated circuits cannot be provided, weather support personnel will
   be given access to common user or command and control communications with a priority
   dictated by operational considerations.
   5.7.2. Weather Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA). ARC weather IMAs are
   generally used in wartime to backfill CONUS units, but may deploy overseas as required.

5.8. Contingency Contracting Support. Contingency contracting support is provided by
AFSOC contracting personnel. Contingency contracting support required by deploying forces
will be provided as specified in the logistics annex of each OPLAN and supporting plans.
AFSOC will retain the capability for self-support of contracting requirements in those situations
where support cannot be provided by the host unit.
     5.8.1. If no comptroller support is available at the deployed location, a paying agent and a
     contracting agent will deploy to procure adequate quarters and messing for AFSOC pay and
     travel entitlements.
     5.8.2. If a contracting and/or paying capability exists at the deployed location, AFSOC
     personnel will deploy with adequate funds in the form of an AF-616, Fund Cite
     Authorization, or Military Departmental Purchase Request (MIPR).
     5.8.3. When using unit funds, commanders will ensure that expenses are coded with an
     appropriate emergency and special program (ESP) code if one has been assigned.
