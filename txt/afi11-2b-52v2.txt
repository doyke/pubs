SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change removes references to Combat Mission Pilot (CMP) and eliminates CMP evaluation
criteria, in recognition of the fact that CMP is a course syllabus and not a qualification.
Emergency traffic patterns and VFR Pattern/Approach are now required for all copilot
INSTM/QUAL evaluations, and copilot air refueling qualification is added as an optional special
qualification. Clarified guidance is added for dual seat pilot and navigator evaluations. Chapter 4
EPE guidance is reorganized and clarified, including revised grading criteria for pilot emergency
procedures evaluations, including ―Q-‖ criteria for non-boldface procedures, as well as defined
evaluation areas for weapons jettison and weapons malfunctions. A margin bar (|) indicates
revision from the previous version.

                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program, and this instruction. Information gathering documents will
be established as forms in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this instruction is the MAJCOM A3. Waivers will be
requested from the parent MAJCOM A3 through appropriate Stan/Eval channels.
1.3. Procedures.
     1.3.1. Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 and
     Chapter 4 to conduct all flight, Aircrew Training Device (ATD), and Emergency Procedure
     Evaluations (EPE). To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight examiners will be
     thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
     1.3.2. -(N/A FTU) In order to validate the ability of the aircrews to fulfill nuclear mission
     requirements and ensure emphasis on proper training in the nuclear mission, all units with a
     nuclear mission in their unit DOC tasking will accomplish at least 20% of mission
     evaluations using a dedicated nuclear profile.
     1.3.3. Avionics Mid-life Improvement (AMI) Block upgrade allows for data capture which
     can be used to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
     1.3.4. The FE should not occupy a primary crew position during evaluations to ensure the
     most comprehensive and objective evaluation. However, if conditions warrant, the flight
     examiner may occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation. While occupying a
     primary crew position, the FE will execute the duties of that position.
     1.3.5. The FE will explain the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be conducted prior
     to flight. The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning in accordance with
     their crew position during the evaluation. FEs may assist in mission planning/briefing as
     tasked and will be furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, target folders, and any
     additional items they deem necessary.
     1.3.6. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include the
     examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified)
     and any required additional training.
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202, Volume 2 and this instruction.
     1.4.1. Evaluation criteria shall be based upon crewmember qualification as follows:
        1.4.1.1. (P) is used to denote Pilots and Instructor Pilots.
        1.4.1.2. (CP) is used to denote Copilots.
        1.4.1.3. DELETED.
        1.4.1.4. (RN) is used to denote non-dual seat qualified Radar Navigators.
AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                       5


        1.4.1.5. (N) is used to denote Instructor Navigators and non-dual seat qualified
        Navigators.
        1.4.1.6. (DSN) is used to denote non-instructor Dual Seat Navigators.
        1.4.1.7. (E) is used to denote Electronic Warfare Officers.
     1.4.2. The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air. Do
     not consider momentary deviations from tolerances provided the examinee applies prompt
     corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. The FE will consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
        1.4.2.1. When grading criteria specify that airspeed will be evaluated and the flight
        manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed for that area, the
        examinee will brief the desired airspeed.
     1.4.3. The FE will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
     evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the
     area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite of
     the observed events and tasks IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, evaluator judgment, and this
     instruction.
        1.4.3.1. FEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area
        grades. Judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and when
        specific situations are not covered.
        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
        identified by this volume, an overall qualification level of ―Q-3‖ will be assigned.
        1.4.3.3. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
        1.4.3.4. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted
        for specific events and instrument final approaches:

                                             Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
     2.1.2. Flight phase requisites for all evaluations are shown in Tables 2.1-2.3. When
     conditions such as equipment malfunction, operational requirements, or weather preclude
     evaluation of a particular event in-flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e.,
     ATD, CPT, or verbal evaluation) in order to complete the evaluation. Document the reason
     and type of alternate method used in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of
     Aircrew Qualification. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately
     evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete
     the evaluation. ATDs will only be used for areas that are certified in AFI 11-2B-52V1, B-52
     Aircrew Training, or the Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum. Progress check
     sortie items may be used at the discretion of the evaluator to finish incomplete student
     Formal Training Unit (FTU) evaluations when an ATD or verbal completion is not
     appropriate. Specific procedures will be included in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
     2.1.3. For Combat Mission Ready aircrew to complete an evaluation, all areas annotated
     with an ―R‖ must be accomplished. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) aircrew will be evaluated
     in only those areas in which they maintain proficiency. Strive to complete all evaluation
     requirements on one flight for efficiency.
     2.1.4. Weapons Qualification. (N/A AFMC). For purposes of this instruction, weapons
     qualified crewmembers include all pilots, copilots, radar navigators, navigators, and weapons
     school graduates. All weapons qualified crewmembers will take the Weapons Open Book
     Examination. All weapons qualified crewmembers will be required to accomplish a Nuclear
     Weapons preflight in conjunction with their MSN evaluation. Weapons test will reflect
     knowledge used in each crew position to employ weapons (i.e. pilots on jettison and weight
     and balance, navigators on OAS faults and jettison procedures).
     2.1.5. Dual Seat Qualification. The following guidance is provided to clarify how dual seat
     qualifications are earned and retained. Reference AFI 11-2B52V1 and V3 for operational
     limits and currency requirements with inexperienced and experienced single AFSC pilots and
     navigators. In addition, the units letter of X’s will be altered in such a way as to make clear
     each aviator’s qualifications based on the following paragraphs.
        2.1.5.1. Dual Seat Pilot and Navigator Qualification. Copilots and Navigators current
        and qualified under the single seat training syllabi who are operating under unique
        AFSCs do not lose their right seat qualifications when they complete a left seat
        qualification program (PUP/NUP or PUP-A/NUP-A with local flying) and checkride.
        Radar navigators will complete the requirements of paragraph 2.1.5.2 ―Dual Seat
        Navigator Evaluations. Aircraft commanders will complete the requirements under
        paragraph 2.1.5.4 ―Pilot Dual Seat Evaluations.
        2.1.5.2. Dual Seat Navigator Evaluations. Dual Seat Navigators will demonstrate
        duties applicable to the RN and N positions including guided weapons employment,
AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                     9


     unguided weapons employment, radar tuning, system management, OAS operation,
     navigation, and time control. The examinee may be evaluated in the opposite seat in the
     ATD if these duties were not demonstrated in flight. Most evaluation areas can be
     evaluated in either seat. However, as a minimum, DSNs will be evaluated in both seats in
     the following areas:
         2.1.5.2.1. Area 7. CRUISE/NAVIGATION.
         2.1.5.2.2. Area 10.       EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS.
         2.1.5.2.3. Area 12. CREW COORDINATION.
         2.1.5.2.4. Area 13. AIR REFUELING.
         2.1.5.2.5. Area 21. KNOWLEDGE.
         2.1.5.2.6. Area 48. WEAPON EMPLOYMENT (GUIDED & UNGUIDED).
     2.1.5.3. DELETED.
     2.1.5.4. Initial Dual Seat Pilot Evaluations. Non-instructor pilots, who are current and
     qualified in the right seat, may become dual seat qualified on their initial left seat
     checkride if they demonstrate an instrument approach (area 33 or 34) to a touch and go in
     the right seat. If the evaluation is completed without meeting this requirement, the
     examinee will only be qualified in the left seat until an instrument approach to a touch
     and go is successfully evaluated in the right seat. If an examinee gains dual seat
     qualification during a SPOT evaluation, that qualification will only be valid until the end
     of the eligibility window for the examinee’s next INSTM/QUAL evaluation, regardless
     of when the SPOT evaluation was administered.
         2.1.5.4.1. Recurring Dual Seat Pilot Evaluations. During recurring dual seat pilot
         evaluations, the examinee may fly the evaluation in either seat and perform an
         instrument approach to a touch and go in the opposite seat. However, the examinee
         should be evaluated primarily in the left seat. If mission requirements drive the
         examinee to perform the evaluation in right seat, an instrument approach to a touch
         and go in the left seat is required to complete the evaluation. If an examinee gains or
         regains dual seat qualification during a SPOT evaluation, that evaluation will only be
         valid until the end of the eligibility window for the examinee’s next INSTM/QUAL
         evaluation, regardless of when the SPOT evaluation was administered.
     2.1.5.5. Copilot Air Refueling. At the discretion of the assigned/attached flying
     squadron commander, copilots may qualify in air refueling procedures during any in-
     flight (initial, recurring, or SPOT) evaluation by meeting the provisions of paragraph
     2.3.2 and successfully completing the following:
         2.1.5.5.1. Five minutes of contact time must be completed within 15 minutes after
         initial pre-contact position.
  2.1.6. Crew Compartment/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with
  AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management, CRM skills will be evaluated during all
  evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight and are embedded within specific
  grading criteria. As all the CRM skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria
  Training/Evaluation Form, are included/embedded, use of the Form 4031 is unnecessary for
 10                                                              AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009


   evaluations in the B-52. The Stan/Eval trend program can be used to measure the
   effectiveness of CRM training.
   2.1.7. Crew Compartment Responsibility. For grading areas where crewmembers
   occupying either the pilot/copilot or the radar navigator/navigator crew positions are
   responsible, but not necessarily both (designated by P/CP or RN/N), determine individual
   responsibility by the flight manual and sound crew procedures.
   2.1.8. Preplanned Mission Data. When using a staff agency derived flight plan, fuel log,
   etc., do not grade the individual for those portions computed by the staff. An individual
   using a certified computer product is responsible for the initial data input. The individual is
   responsible to ensure the data used in the aircraft is accurate and effective for mission
   accomplishment.
   2.1.9. Currency of Flight Publications. On all flight evaluations, all technical orders,
   checklists, and publications required for the flight will be checked for currency and accuracy.
   When unit-maintained publications are used in-flight, the examinee will ensure currency and
   suitability for flight. The unit addendum to AFI 11-202V2 may specify additional
   publications to be checked.
2.2. Instrument/Qualification or Qualification Evaluation: A mission flown according to
instrument flight rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the
INSTM/QUAL evaluation. This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training
mission.
   2.2.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.2.1.1. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
       2.2.1.2. Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination.
       2.2.1.3. EPE/ATD (see Chapter 4).
       2.2.1.4. Instrument Examination. (N/A for Electronic Warfare Officers).
   2.2.2. EP Patterns. (P/CP): Emergency/abnormal procedures will normally be
   accomplished in conjunction with instrument approaches. Actions taken in response to actual
   or simulated emergencies that occur during the flight evaluation will be evaluated until the
   evaluator declares the evaluation terminated. For six-engine approaches, the simulated loss of
   engines must be accomplished during level flight with sufficient time provided to allow
   completion of the emergency procedures checklist prior to final approach. The use of all
   engines may be returned after the go-around has been completed and a safe altitude and
   airspeed have been attained. On recurring qualification evaluations, a minimum of two of the
   following EP patterns will be accomplished at the discretion of the evaluator. On initial
   qualification evaluations, all EP patterns will be accomplished
       2.2.2.1. Six-engine approach and missed approach. (Simulated six-engine approach and
       missed approach will be accomplished from an instrument approach demonstrating
       technique for asymmetric thrust conditions.). On initial IP evaluations, the IP will also
       accomplish a six-engine approach to a landing or touch and go. On recurring IP
       evaluations, the IP may accomplish the six-engine landing in lieu of a six-engine
       approach and missed approach.
AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                       11


       2.2.2.2. Simulated Loss of Engine on Takeoff.
       2.2.2.3. Flaps up approach and go-around.
2.3. Mission Evaluation: MSN evaluation will be flown IAW current tactics, unit tasking and
theater Area of Responsibility scenarios and will incorporate all appropriate evaluation
requirements from Table 2.1 - 2.3. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational
Capability (DOC) tasking or current AEF requirements satisfy the requirements of this
evaluation. Provide the employment scenario IAW AFI 11-415, Weapons and Tactics Program,
Attachment 3, and include (as a minimum): intelligence scenario, orders of battle (electronic and
air), commander’s intent, strike mission objectives and Special Instructions (SPINS). The
scenario portion of the flight need not encompass the entire sortie but must include at least one
weapon event. On missions when SPINS are not available or used, use command guidance from
appropriate instructions. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are not prohibited;
however units should apply operational risk management principles to the scheduling of the
evaluation. Real world contingencies may provide a unique opportunity to conduct evaluations;
however factors beyond the control of the examinee and FE may preclude its successful
completion.
   2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.3.1.1. EPE (if MSN evaluation is stand-alone evaluation. See Chapter 4).
       2.3.1.2. Open Book weapons examination (Weapons Qualified Crewmembers).
       2.3.1.3. Weapons Preflight (Weapons Qualified Crewmembers).
       2.3.1.4. (N/A AFRC) All weapons qualified crewmembers who are nuclear CMR
       (CMR-N) or are in training to become CMR-N will perform a preflight of an inert or WR
       resources for those already PRP certified. Document on the ground phase of the AF
       Form 8 as ―Nuclear Weapons Preflight.‖ The overall grade for nuclear weapons preflight
       will be 1 or 3.
       2.3.1.5. ATD Exercise. (E) The ATD exercise must be accomplished for all mission
       evaluations and annotated within the ground phase on the AF Form 8. Enter ATD
       Exercise date and grade (1, 2, or 3). An examinee receiving a grade of 3 (unqualified)
       will be placed on supervised status IAW AFI11-202v2 paragraph 5.7.
           2.3.1.5.1. The ATD exercise will start with sufficient time prior to expected activity
           to provide realism. This exercise will evaluate all areas listed as ―R‖ under the ATD
           column in Table 2.3. The exercise must include, but is not limited to, analyzing one
           system malfunction, a fighter attack (forward and/or rear hemisphere), and the
           penetration of high and/or low altitude threat areas according to the mission scenario.
           The exercise should have appropriate types and density of threats, which accurately
           reflect a typical unit OPLAN. The examinee’s EPE may be accomplished
           concurrently in this ATD mission. Each unit will have a minimum of two different
           check missions. Unit stan/eval will ensure that all threats and threat modes presented
           in check missions are represented in continuation training ATD missions.
   2.3.2. Air Refueling. The evaluation will include the following areas applicable to the
   examinee’s crew position: air refueling communication, air refueling rendezvous (any type)
   with a tanker aircraft, aircraft control, descent, contact, fuel management and transfer, visual
12                                                                AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009


  signals (may be done orally if necessary), post refueling, and breakaway. Air refueling tracks
  will allow at least 30 minutes of air refueling per examinee. Deviations from this requirement
  are permissible only when tanker/bomber formation ratio or length of the published air
  refueling track prohibits compliance. However, each examinee must have sufficient time to
  meet requirements in paragraphs 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.2.2 below. Air refueling practice
  emergency separation procedures must be initiated with the receiver in contact or in the
  refueling envelope. Grade buddy rendezvous procedures using the formation criteria.
        2.3.2.1. (P). Ten minutes of contact time (20 for initial qualification evaluations) must
        be completed within 30 minutes after initial pre-contact position.
        2.3.2.2. DELETED.
  2.3.3. Terrain Avoidance (TA). (If applicable) (P/CP/RN/N) Requirements include a TA
  operational check, at least 10 minutes terrain avoidance with an operational TA system, and
  at least 10 minutes terrain avoidance utilizing integrated Electro-Optical Viewing System
  (EVS)/visual contour procedures. Conduct TA in mountainous routes when possible.
     2.3.4. Weapon Employment Requirements:
        2.3.4.1. Weapon employment classes are defined as: unguided (e.g. GP, B-61, or B-83
        etc.), and guided (e.g., JDAM, WCMD, LGB, ALCM, CALCM, and JASSM). Units will
        design written mission evaluation profiles using current tactics, unit tasking and theater
        AOR scenarios and will incorporate all appropriate evaluation requirements from Tables
        2.1 - 2.3. Scenarios that represent unit DOC tasking satisfy the requirements of this
        evaluation. The profiles will be designed to evaluate training, flight position, special
        qualifications, and basic airmanship. Initial mission evaluations should be given in the
        primary DOC of the unit.
        2.3.4.2. Aircrew should demonstrate proficiency in both guided and unguided weapons
        employment; however, only one is required to complete an evaluation.
           2.3.4.2.1. Guided conventional or nuclear weapon employment consists of direct
           engagement scenarios using weapons such as JDAM, WCMD, or LGB and indirect
           engagement scenarios using weapons such as CALCM, JASSM, or ALCM. Direct
           engagement scenarios typically involve man-in-the-loop decisions and limited
           standoff range. Indirect engagement scenarios typically involve autonomous systems
           and increased standoff range. Either direct or indirect guided weapons employment is
           acceptable.
           2.3.4.2.2. Unguided weapons employment consists of conventional or nuclear
           scenarios using weapons such as GP, B-61, or B-83.
        2.3.4.3. Use EMCON procedures and techniques to the maximum extent possible,
        conditions permitting, and use threat avoidance/evasive action techniques as directed by
        the employment scenario.
        2.3.4.4. Grade each release of a multiple unguided gravity weapon separately. Any type
        of scoring is acceptable, however, for live weapons deliveries, range scoring is preferred.
        2.3.4.5. (ACC) For TA qualified crewmembers, an unguided gravity release should be
        accomplished at TA altitudes.
AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009                                                                              13


           2.3.4.5.1. (RN/N). When weather or equipment malfunctions preclude bombing at
           TA altitude, configure the radar scope in TA sector, except when optimum
           presentation requires another setting, use TA procedures, and accomplish the run at
           minimum safe altitude/instrument flight rules altitude. If equipment malfunctions
           preclude synchronous capability, alternate bombing meets the requirements of the
           evaluation.
   2.3.5. Electronic Countermeasures Requirements. The examinee will accomplish at least
   one electronic attack (EA) run. To the maximum extent possible, the run should be
   scheduled against a Multiple Threat Emissions Systems (MUTES) capable site. The flight
   examiner will, during mission planning for mission evaluations, select a strategic, tactical, or
   naval MUTES scenario. For no-notice evaluations, scheduled scenario(s) may be changed by
   the examinee to a Sierra, Tango, or November scenario.
       2.3.5.1. Flight examiners will not consider EW performance as less than qualified based
       solely on unreliable/substandard scores.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Aircrew evaluations conducted as part of a formal FTU
training syllabus will be flown IAW syllabus mission profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission
profile developed from syllabus training objectives. Use applicable grading criteria in Chapter
3 and Chapter 4.
2.5. Instructor Evaluation:
   2.5.1. All flying personnel selected for instructor duty must be evaluated to determine their
   judgment, technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of student
   activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their aircrew specialty. All
   evaluation areas will be evaluated during all instructor evaluations. Initial instructor
   evaluations may be accomplished in conjunction with INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluations.
   2.5.2. Instructors must demonstrate proficiency by instructing a student or qualified
   individual acting as a student. The evaluator may require the examinee to present verbal
   explanations of equipment operations, procedures, and techniques pertinent to crew specialty
   duties and responsibilities.
   2.5.3. Initial Flight evaluation. To initially qualify as an instructor, flying personnel selected
   for instructor duty must successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation. This is a one-
   time evaluation in which the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in some phase of
   the unit’s mission. Except for requirements delineated under Area 25, Instructor
   Performance, in Chapter 3, specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the flight
   examiner.
   2.5.4. Subsequent aircrew evaluations (i.e. INSTM/QUAL/MSN) will include instructor
   portions during the evaluations.
   2.5.5. Instructor Pilot Requirements. Instructor Pilots will occupy the right seat during
   their initial instructor evaluation for takeoff, air refueling, initial buffet, and all traffic pattern
   activity. Instructor pilots must demonstrate the ability to instruct in mission accomplishment
   as well as flying the aircraft as described below.
       2.5.5.1. Initial buffet and recovery demonstration in-flight (on recurring evaluations this
       event may be accomplished as part of the EPE).
 14                                                              AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009


       2.5.5.2. Air refueling boom envelope limit demonstration. Contact time may be reduced
       to 5 minutes excluding the time required to demonstrate boom envelope limits.
       Inadvertent disconnect tolerances are not applicable during demonstration of boom
       envelope limits. On recurring evaluations, the boom limit demonstration is desired, but
       may be waived at the discretion of the evaluator.
       2.5.5.3. Accomplish EP patterns as directed in paragraph 2.2.2.
   2.5.6. Instructor Navigator Requirements. Initial instructor evaluations should be
   conducted in the ATD. Subsequent instructor evaluations may be conducted in-flight or in
   the ATD. Evaluatees will thoroughly brief, conduct, and critique a profile representative of
   the unit’s DOC.
   2.5.7. Instructor Electronic Warfare Officer Requirements. Use unit-specific missions
   to evaluate the instructor (except FTU instructors). Enter Instructor ATD, date, and grade (1
   or 3) under the ground phase on the AF Form 8. On all instructor evaluations the student will
   not be evaluated, except for Safety of Flight.
       2.5.7.1. Instructor evaluations will be accomplished in the ATD except as outlined in
       paragraph 1.6.4.
2.6. Reporting Deviations/Discrepancies by Unlike Specialty. Evaluators must report
deviations/discrepancies within their aircraft from established procedures/directives in any area,
regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to the OGV for evaluation and necessary action. If
the deviation/discrepancy is found to warrant overall Qualification Level 3 AF Form 8
documentation, annotate SPOT in the Flight Phase block. The Chief of OGV will sign as the
flight examiner.
   2.6.1. For formation purposes, evaluators of like or unlike specialty in other aircraft within
   the formation who observe deviations/discrepancies affecting the overall safe conduct of the
   formation will report such deviation/discrepancy to OGV for evaluation and necessary
   action. If AF Form 8 documentation is warranted, use the procedures in paragraph 2.6.
2.7. Crew Compartment Spot Evaluations. When an individual in a crew compartment is
receiving an evaluation, the other compartment individual may receive a Spot evaluation. Only
annotate SPOT when the evaluation does not update the individual’s expiration date. Individuals
must declare their desire to update the expiration date on mission planning day. Annotate the
type of evaluation given (i.e., INSTM/QUAL/MSN not SPOT) in the Flight Phase.

Notes:
*Indicates a critical area.
1. Copilots do not require a grade unless they are actually flying the aircraft; grade them in checklist procedures and fuel
panel operations.
2. Accomplish either a Takeoff/Departure or an Instrument Penetration/Enroute Descent. Published letdown and
departures for low altitude routes may also be used. During initial aircraft commander pilot evaluations, a
takeoff/departure are desired.
3. One precision approach (ILS or PAR) must be flown. If PAR facilities are available, the examinee has the option of
accomplishing a PAR approach in-lieu of an ILS approach.
4. On initial IP evaluations, all ―R‖ items are required except as specified in note 2 above.
5. Holding may be accomplished in the ATD.
6. On recurring qualification evaluations, a minimum of two EP patterns outlined in paragraph 2.2.3. will be
accomplished at the discretion of the evaluator. On initial qualification evaluations, all EP patterns will be accomplished.
7. On initial IP evaluations, IPs will also accomplish a six-engine landing. On recurring IP evaluations, IPs may
accomplish the six-engine landing in lieu of a six-engine approach and missed approach.
8. On recurring IP evaluations, boom limit demonstration is desired, but may be waived at the discretion of the evaluator.
9. All pilots must perform at least one touch and go for checkride completion. Dual seat pilots will perform one in each
seat.

  3.2.3. Area 3--Pre-Takeoff (Includes all activity up to crossing the hold line):
     3.2.3.1. Procedures:
         3.2.3.1.1. Q. Established and adhered to station, start engine, taxi times to assure
         thorough preflight, check of personal equipment, crew briefing, weapons preflight (if
         carried) etc. Performed all checks and procedures prior to takeoff in accordance with
         approved checklists and applicable directives. Unplanned deviations were out of the
         examinee’s control. Nuclear weapons preflight, no deviations.
         3.2.3.1.2. Q-. Minor deviations, omissions, and/or errors occurred which did not
         detract from mission effectiveness, performance, and/or knowledge was the minimum
         acceptable and indicated a definite need for assigned study and/or additional training.
         3.2.3.1.3. U. Omitted major item(s) of the appropriate checklist. Major deviations in
         procedure, which would preclude safe mission accomplishment. Failed to accurately
         determine readiness of aircraft for flight. Crew errors directly contributed to a late
         takeoff, which degraded the mission or made it non-effective. Nuclear weapons
         preflight. Committed any checklist deviation, omission, and/or error.
     3.2.3.2. (Weapons Qualified Crewmembers) Weapons: Weapon preflight may be
     evaluated on all actual weapon release and tactical ferry sorties. Weapon preflight on an
     actual weapon release sortie can satisfy the Conventional Weapons Preflight or Nuclear
     Weapons Preflight (as applicable) on the ground phase requisite of the MSN evaluation if
     not previously accomplished. Although navigators have primary responsibility for
     weapons preflight IAW current technical order procedures, pilots and weapons qualified
     EWs are responsible for cross checking and ensuring proper weapons preflight
     procedures.
         3.2.3.2.1. The intent of weapons preflight evaluation is to accurately reflect each
         crewmembers responsibilities in employing weapons. It is expected that pilots will
         emphasize proper aircraft loading and navigators proper weapons configuration but
         both will be verbally evaluated to ensure a sufficient level of knowledge to provide
         for safe and effective weapons employment.
         3.2.3.2.2. In the event that a grade less than 1 for weapons preflight is awarded to any
         crewmember, the flight examiner will use judgment and discretion in determining
         how that affects the overall grade for the MSN evaluation.
         3.2.3.2.3. Q. Accomplished all checklist items without any deviations. For nuclear
         weapons preflights, two crewmembers form a two person team and complete the
         checklist using challenge and response on all items.
24                                                            AFI11-2B-52V2 4 JUNE 2009


        3.2.3.2.4. Q-. (Conventional weapon preflight only) Accomplished checklist items
        with only minor deviations, omissions, and/or errors which would not preclude
        effective weapons delivery or cause the examinee to takeoff with an improper
        weapons load.
        3.2.3.2.5. U. Not up to ―Q-‖ standards. Major checklist deviations, omissions, and/or
        errors which could preclude effective weapons delivery or cause the examinee to
        takeoff with an improper weapons load.
            3.2.3.2.5.1. Nuclear weapons preflight. Committed any checklist deviation,
            omission, and/or error. NOTE: The flight examiner may also grade the examinee
            unqualified in AIRMANSHIP if the aircraft would have taken off with an
            improper weapon load or examinee would not be able to deliver an effective
            weapon due to improper weapon preflight.

                    EMERGENCY PROCEDURES EVALUATIONS

4.1. General:
   4.1.1. Emergency Procedures Evaluation. Pilot and navigator EPEs will be conducted in
   the Weapons System Trainer (WST). Electronic Warfare Officers may conduct QUAL and
   MSN EPEs in an ATD or verbally to include all boldface procedures and a sampling of non-
   boldface procedures. Only flight examiners may conduct EPEs. Grading criteria for each
   required item are listed in paragraph 4.3.
   4.1.2. Units may include additional items in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
   as required.
   4.1.3. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
   until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
   accomplished.     Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an
   unsatisfactory BOLDFACE accomplishment will not be permitted to fly until a successful
   reevaluation is accomplished. For EPEs in which the examinee is qualified, but requires
   additional training, the additional training will be accomplished before the next flight.
   Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   4.1.4. QUAL EPE:
      4.1.4.1. Pilots will accomplish QUAL EPEs in the WST/CPT to include all BOLDFACE
      procedures and a sampling of Non-BOLDFACE procedures.
      4.1.4.2. Navigators should accomplish QUAL EPE in the WST in concurrently with the
      MSN EPE, to include, at a minimum, all BOLDFACE procedures. If the ATD is
      unavailable, the EPE may be accomplished verbally.
   4.1.5. MSN EPE. Pilots will be evaluated on nuclear or conventional weapons jettison
   procedures. Navigators will be evaluated on nuclear or conventional weapons malfunction
   analysis and jettison procedures. As a minimum, weapons malfunction analysis will include a
   programmable weapon (e.g., JDAM, JASSM, ALCM). If the MSN EPE is administered
   separately from the QUAL EPE, it should be accomplished in the WST, but may be
   accomplished verbally if the WST is unavailable.
4.2. General Grading Standards: Use all sections for criteria applicable to the events
performed on the evaluation.
4.3. Grading.
   4.3.1. Area 201-209--BOLDFACE Procedures:
