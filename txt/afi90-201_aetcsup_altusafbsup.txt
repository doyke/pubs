SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised due to renumbering of AFI 90-201 and must be
completely reviewed. This publication replaces AFI 90-201/AAFB Sup 1, 26 October 2011.
Significant revisions include: Integration of the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT)
software program and revised Self-Assessment Program (SAP) (formerly Self-Inspection
Program (SIP)). For purposes of this instruction, Director of Maintenance is considered a Group
Commander equivalent. 97 AMW/MX, Group refers to the directorate (e.g., 97 AMW/MX), and
Squadron or Unit refers to Divisions within the Directorate (e.g., 97 AMW/MXA). Also, for
purposes of this instruction, 97 AMW Director of Staff is considered a Group Commander
equivalent, and Wing Staff Agencies are considered Unit level equivalents. More specific
information about the 97 AMW Self-Assessment Program and the use of MICT can be found in
the 97 AMW MICT Business Rules located on the 97 AMW/IG SharePoint page.

2.8.2.4. (Added) 97 AMW Gatekeeper Program (refer to 97 AMW MICT Business Rules).

2.13.6. (Added) 97 AMW SII Procedures (refer to 97 AMW MICT Business Rules).

2.13.7. (Added) 97 AMW CII Procedures (refer to 97 AMW MICT Business Rules).

6.3.3.2.1. (Added) The 97 AMW/CC should review the SAP results semi-annually. This review
may be accomplished using MICT and/or by reviewing the reports or briefs from the 97
AMW/IG.

6.3.3.2.2. (Added) Following a major inspection (e.g. AETC/IG Consolidated Unit Inspection
(CUI)), the 97 AMW/CC may waive the next semi-annual self-assessment (SA) cycle
requirements stipulated in the 97 AMW MICT Business Rules.

6.3.3.4.1. (Added) The Wing Self-Assessment Program Manager should normally work in the 97
AMW/IG office.

6.3.3.5.1. (Added) The Wing MICT Lead Manager should normally work in the 97 AMW/IG
office.

6.3.3.6. (Added) The 97 AMW/CC or CV is the waiver authority for items in this supplement.

6.3.4.13. (Added) 97 AMW/IG should act as the wing SAP manager. If the 97 AMW/CC
designates a different office or agency, then they will fulfill the roles assigned to 97 AMW/IG in
this instruction.

6.3.4.14. (Added) 97 AMW/IG may report the completion of all SAs to 97 AMW/CC. This can
be accomplished via MICT and with a final SA report to the 97 AMW/CC. This report can be
generated from "Reports" > "Inspection" > "Commander Compliance." 97 AMW/IG should
keep a copy of these reports until the next AETC CUI.


6.3.5.8. (Added) 97 AMW/IG should function as the 97 AMW’s MICT Help Desk. 97 AMW/IG
AFI90-201_AETC_ALTUSAFBSUP 30 MAY 2013                                                           3


may provide additional MICT training to group and unit monitors as needed. After receiving
training, group and unit monitors are expected to train their unit personnel via the train-the-
trainer concept. 97 AMW/IG should function as the final troubleshooting resource for group and
unit monitors when MICT issues cannot be resolved at the lowest possible level (e.g., MICT
training modules, help guides, and how-to demonstrations available under the "Assistance" tab).
Users should exhaust all available resources before contacting the AF MICT Help Desk.
Additionally, 97 AMW/IG should function as the single 97 AMW liaison to the MAJCOM level
MICT POC.

6.3.6. (Added) Group Commanders and Wing Director of Staff (DS)

6.3.6.1. (Added) Group commanders should appoint, in writing, group assessment monitors
(GAMs). Groups should forward appointment letter updates to 97 AMW/IG. 97 AMW/DS
should appoint a primary and alternate SAP monitor for the wing staff agencies.

6.3.6.2. (Added) Group commanders should review their organization’s SAP on a quarterly
basis. The review should be completed in sufficient detail to ensure deficiencies (especially those
that have remained open more than 6 months) or issues are being resolved in a timely manner.
MICT provides adequate details to effect this level of review.

6.3.6.3. (Added) Group commanders should determine who in their organizations (e.g. staff
organization such as CSS, OGV, etc.) are allowed to “finalize” assessments and close
deficiencies. The group assessment monitor should implement the commander’s choices by
assigning the appropriate permissions in MICT (refer to 97 AMW MICT Business Rules).

6.3.6.4. (Added) Group commanders may provide additional guidance concerning the
implementation of the SAP within their units. Additionally, group commanders may delegate
this responsibility, in writing, to subordinate commanders (or agency chiefs for WSA).

6.3.7. (Added) Squadron Commanders and Wing Staff Agency (WSA) Chiefs

6.3.7.1. (Added) Squadron commanders and wing staff agency chiefs should appoint, in writing,
a unit SAP monitor (see SAM in Para. 6.3.9.). Send SA appointment letters to the respective
group and wing assessment monitors.

6.3.7.2. (Added) Squadron commanders and agency chiefs should monitor their SAP on a
quarterly basis. MICT provides adequate detail to ensure commanders are aware of deficiencies
or issues affecting their unit.

6.3.7.3. (Added) If delegated the authority by their group commander, squadron commanders or
agency chiefs may provide additional guidance concerning the implementation of the SAP within
their units.

6.3.7.4. (Added) Commanders should determine who in their organizations is allowed to
“finalize” assessments and close deficiencies. The squadron assessment monitor should
implement the commander’s choices by assigning the appropriate permissions in MICT.

(See 97 AMW/IG MICT Business Rules)

6.3.8. (Added) Group Assessment Monitors (GAMs)

6.3.8.1. (Added) GAMs should lead a review of all unit regulatory guidance libraries to ensure
the group staff is operating from current and accurate guidance.

6.3.8.2. (Added) GAMs should ensure all group staff SA checklists are current and accurate. If
necessary, contact the appropriate functional area managers (FAMs) and points of contact
(POCs) to ensure the currency and accuracy of SA checklists. If checklists are generated or
supplemented locally, ensure any recent guidance changes have been incorporated into the
checklists (e.g., additional duty and safety checklists).

6.3.8.3. (Added) GAMs should ensure the permissions assigned within MICT for their unit are
correct. This includes ensuring those who are no longer in the unit (i.e. group staff) have been
unassigned from the unit (i.e. given a loss date for the unit in MICT). They should also ensure
checklist POCs and supervisors are correctly assigned within their unit. 97 AMW/IG
recommends adding MICT to all in/out-processing checklists.

6.3.8.4. (Added) Group monitors should compile and submit unit reports to their group
commanders.

6.3.8.5. (Added) Group monitors should attempt to solve MICT issues at the lowest possible
level and troubleshoot within their groups using MICT training modules, help guides, and how-
to demonstrations.

6.3.8.6. (Added) GAMs can assign permissions to ensure only commander authorized
individuals finalize assessments or close deficiencies.

6.3.8.7. (Added) GAMs should conduct MICT training for group staff and SAMs.

6.3.9. (Added) Squadron or Agency (Unit) Assessment Monitors (SAMs)

6.3.9.1. (Added) SAMs should lead a review of all published guidance libraries to ensure the unit
is operating from current and accurate guidance. 97 AMW/IG recommends using AF
ePublishing.

6.3.9.2. (Added) SAMs should ensure all unit SA checklists are current and accurate. If
necessary, contact the appropriate functional area managers and points of contact (POCs) to
ensure the currency and accuracy of SA checklists. If checklists are generated or supplemented
locally, ensure any recent guidance changes have been incorporated into the checklists (e.g.,
additional duty and safety checklists).

6.3.9.3. (Added) SAMs should ensure the permissions assigned within MICT for their unit are
correct. This includes ensuring that individuals who are no longer in the unit have been
unassigned from the unit (i.e. given a loss date for the unit in MICT). They should also ensure

checklist POCs and Supervisors are correctly assigned within their unit. 97 AMW/IG
recommends adding MICT to all in/out-processing checklists.

6.3.9.4. (Added) Upon completion of an assessment, SAMs should prepare a summary report
documenting the inspection for the unit commander.

6.3.9.5. (Added) SAMs can assign permissions to ensure only commander authorized individuals
finalize assessments or close deficiencies.

6.3.9.6. (Added) SAMs should provide MICT training for unit members.

troubleshoot within their units using MICT training modules, help guides, and how-to
demonstrations.


6.4. (Added) 97 AMW's MICT hierarchy should be utilized as follows: Squadron > Group >
Wing. For instance, squadron users need to seek their SAM's assistance for issues before
contacting their GAM or the Wing SAP Manager.
