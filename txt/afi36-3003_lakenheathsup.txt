AFI 36-3003, 26 October 2009, is supplemented as follows: This supplement provides
guidance regarding leave and responsibilities of LeaveWeb for all units assigned to the 48th
Fighter Wing (48 FW). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, prescribed by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program;
route AF Form 847s from the field through MAJCOM publications/forms managers. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at: https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of
1974 authorized by Title 10, USC 8013 and Executive Order (EO) 9397. System of Records
notice F036 AF PC C, Military Personnel Records System, applies.

1. All military members are encouraged to take an active role in planning and using leave
responsibly. The purpose of this supplement is to establish a consistent leave and pass
implementation policy that will help ensure operational mission requirements are met.
Commanders should establish and exercise effective personnel accountability programs within
their squadron. Liberty Passes allow members to depart and return from the United Kingdom on
recognized movement orders to minimize any concerns with UK customs and also allow
commanders a structured means of maintaining accountability for Airmen who leave the country
during pass periods. Liberty Passes should be maintained in a centralized location within the
 2                                 AFI 36-3003_LAKENHEATHSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2011


squadron for easy access for the commander (i.e. shared drive, file drawer, etc.). Airmen who
travel outside the United Kingdom will fill out an AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization,
prescribed by AFMAN 65-116V2, Defense Joint Military Pay System Unit Procedures
Excluding Operations, and will contact their unit anytime there is an event (such as a natural
disaster, inclement weather, hospitalization, vehicle breakdown, etc.) that could impact their
ability to return. In addition, it is suggested that all supervisors review the Operational Risk
Management (ORM) Risk Matrix and evaluate the risks associated with planned trips to ensure
all possible ways to reduce risks have been assessed. Supervisors are highly encouraged to
emphasize personal and professional ORM to assess hazards and control risks prior to travel.

6.5.9.4.1. (Added) Members and/or dependents stationed at RAF Lakenheath are authorized
emergency leave travel to:
6.5.9.4.1.1. (Added) The closest CONUS International airport from RAF Lakenheath. Boston,
Massachusetts will be the APOD for CONUS locations.
6.5.9.4.1.2. (Added) Any other CONUS airport that is closer to the traveler’s destination if the
transportation cost to the other airport is less than the transportation cost to the international
airports described above. Note: If the member chooses a more expensive airport the member
will pay the difference between the authorized APOD and the chosen airport.
6.5.9.4.1.3. (Added) An airport in a NON-FOREIGN OCONUS area.
6.5.9.4.1.4. (Added) Any other OCONUS location as determined by AFI 36-3003.
8.3.1. (Added) A Liberty Pass is a regular pass (normal time off) or special pass (awarded time
off) which allow Airmen to depart and return from the United Kingdom without using annual
leave. The Liberty Pass is documented on an AF Form 988.
8.3.1.1. (Added) Airmen who plan to depart the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales,
and Northern Ireland) will need an approved Liberty Pass signed by the member’s supervisor for
a regular pass or commander or Wing Staff Agency Division Chief for a special pass.
8.3.1.2. (Added) The member’s supervisor (regular pass) or commander (special pass) will
determine, based on the mission and operational commitments of the unit, whether to approve
the Liberty Pass or charge leave. A Liberty Pass is not authorized if a member is in use/lose
status (for example, if member has 55 days of leave on 1 October, they have 10 days of use/lose
for the year and would be unable to use a Liberty Pass until their LES reports 0 in the use/lose
block). A Liberty Pass is used during non-duty time. Members will complete an AF Form 988
and have it signed by their supervisor/commander. In Block eight of the form, members will
mark the box labeled ―other‖ and type ―Liberty Pass‖ in the remarks section. Parts one and three
of the form will be kept at the unit and destroyed upon member’s return to duty. Part two will be
given to the Airman. If the Airman is unable to return within the allotted period, parts one and
three of the form will be submitted to the 48 Force Support Squadron (FSS), Military Personnel
Section (MPS) Customer Support office and the Airman will be placed on leave status.
8.3.1.3. (Added) Liberty Passes may be taken in conjunction with leave without a duty day
between the liberty and leave periods. However, the Airman must be physically present in the
local area when departing and returning from leave. If the Airman wishes to leave the local area
during the Liberty Pass period and not return prior to the beginning of the leave period, then the
entire leave and liberty period will be charged as leave. For example: an Airman may take a 3-
day Liberty Pass (e.g. Fri-Sun or Sat-Mon) or 4-day Liberty Pass (e.g. Thurs-Sun, Sat-Tues, or
Fri- Mon) in conjunction with a leave period without having to return to duty for a day.
However, the leave period must begin and end in the local area.
8.3.1.4. (Added) Leave will not be charged and the AF Form 988 will not be processed if the
Airman has returned to duty within the specified time and date indicated on the Liberty Pass.
8.4.1.1. (Added) There are no wing-wide time or geographical pass restrictions beyond basic
AFI 36-3003 guidance. Group/Squadron commanders may implement more restrictive pass
policies based on their specific mission requirements.
AFI 36-3003_LAKENHEATHSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                     5


8.4.2.1. (Added) If the Airman fails to return to duty upon expiration of pass period, execute the
AF Form 988 to charge leave in accordance with AFI 36-3003, Paragraph 6, Authorized Leave.
8.4.5.1. (Added) Airmen who are on an approved Liberty Pass and cannot return to the local
area from the pass and need unplanned leave, will ask their home unit to submit their AF Form
988 (parts 1 and 3) which are maintained at the unit, to the MPS Customer Support office to be
processed and the member will be charged leave.
8.4.9.1. (Added) Advice for safe driving includes the following recommended practices:
8.4.9.1.1. (Added) Avoid travel during normal sleep periods.
8.4.9.1.2. (Added) Avoid driving for travel if you have been awake for longer than 12 hours.
8.4.9.1.3. (Added) Be well rested before driving; approximately 7-9 hours required on average.
8.4.9.1.4. (Added) Taking a ―road trip‖ immediately after working is a bad idea.
8.4.9.1.5. (Added) Caffeine improves alertness; however, it should not be used in lieu of proper
rest.
8.4.9.1.6. (Added) Prior to driving, avoid medications that may cause or increase drowsiness.
8.4.9.1.7. (Added) While driving, take breaks every 100 miles or 2 hours.
8.4.9.1.8. Added) Supervisors should review subordinates’ travel plans.
8.4.9.1.9. (Added) Drive with a companion who will be awake and keep you company and will
be able to handle all distractions so you can focus on driving.
8.4.9.2. (Added) United Kingdom Customs may require active duty military personnel stationed
in the United Kingdom to present movement orders in addition to their passport in order to re-
enter the country. Movement orders are Temporary Duty (TDY) orders, leave forms or passes.
PCS orders will not suffice as they do not show movement between the duty location and other
countries visited and the dates of travel; therefore, it is suggested, but not mandated by United
Kingdom Customs that military members keep their AF Form 988 (Ordinary Leave, Permissive
TDY, or Liberty Pass) with them because the customs agents recognize the form as movement
orders. Personal passports are no guarantee that active duty personnel will be allowed back into
the United Kingdom without movement orders.
8.4.10. (Added) LeaveWeb Responsibilities.
8.4.10.1. (Added) If the member is unable to log into LeaveWeb, contact the MPS Customer
Support office (located in the Liberty Center) to establish a LeaveWeb account. Submit leave
request via the LeaveWeb system when requesting regular leave. If the member wants to submit
leave for other than ordinary leave, they must submit a hardcopy AF Form 988, and any
supporting documentation to the MPS Customer Support office for review. Upon return from
leave, complete leave return via LeaveWeb, or sign-in from leave at the MPS Customer Support
office.
8.4.10.2. (Added) Supervisor/Approval Authority will approve or disapprove the request, unless
the request for leave is other than regular leave or regular pass.
8.4.10.3. (Added) Commander. The Airman’s commander or Wing Staff Agency Division
Chief is the approval authority for other than ordinary leave requests, i.e., Special Passes,
 6                                AFI 36-3003_LAKENHEATHSUP 12 SEPTEMBER 2011


Convalescent, Permissive TDY (PTDY), Terminal, and Emergency Leave and will ensure
requests are approved at a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or
equivalent.
8.4.10.4. (Added) The MPS Customer Support office will keep accurate records of leave and
will ensure leave monitors have access to current leave guidance (AFI 36-3003, AFMAN 65-
116V, Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) – Unit Procedures Excluding FSO, 16 March
2007).
8.4.10.4.1. (Added) The MPS Customer Support office will maintain LeaveWeb user accounts,
review the Airman’s leave request for accuracy and compliance with AFI 36-3003, check
LeaveWeb periodically throughout the day to process any pending leave actions, validate
pending leave requests and leave returns, and contact the Airman or their supervisor on any
overdue leave returns to ensure prompt leave accountability.
8.4.10.4.2. (Added) The MPS Customer Support office will print and review the leave balance
listing every 45 days to verify any additions and/or deletions to the 48 Comptroller Squadron
Operations Office (CPTS/FSO). The Manpower and Personnel Flight Commander (MPF/CC)
and/or 48 FSS Operations Officer (FSO) will review the leave control log on a monthly basis to
ensure all transactions have been closed, validated, and reconciled. The MPF/CC will address
negative trends noticed during monthly review with supported commanders.
8.4.10.4.3. (Added) The MPS Customer Support office will be able to provide, on a case by
case basis, a leave balance listing to unit commanders/First Sergeant monthly to assist them with
managing the leave program.
8.4.10.4.4. (Added) The MPS Customer Support office will annotate the date into LeaveWeb,
of other than ordinary leaves, at top of hardcopy AF Form 988 and forward to 48 CPTS/FSO for
their records.
8.4.10.4.5. (Added) The MPS/Customer Support office will print an AF Form 1486, Unit Leave
Control Log, 19900401, V5,every 30 days, consisting of 45 days of leave input. Attach a review
memorandum and annotate any leave requests that have not been closed, validated, reconciled, or
require follow-up action. The MPS Customer Support office will then submit this package to the
MPF/CC or FSS/FSO for review and annotate corrective action taken on any leave request that
was identified during the review process and file.
8.4.10.4.6. (Added) The MPS Customer Support office will retain Part IIIs of AF Form 988 for
members currently on terminal leave and dispose of them 10 days following the last day of leave
unless the member returns from leave early.
