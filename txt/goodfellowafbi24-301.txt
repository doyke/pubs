Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer recommended changes and

     1.4. Vehicle Incident. The GOV is damaged under conditions that are reasonably beyond
     the control of the vehicle operator. An incident letter from the using organization’s Vehicle
     Control Officer/NCO (VCO/VCNCO) will accompany any vehicle turned in for incident
     damage. Examples of incidents are:

            the Base Legal Office (17 TRW/JA) not later than one duty day after the damage for
            all accidents involving POVs or private property.
            2.1.5.2. The using organization will inform vehicle maintenance upon turning the

            information about the accident to determine if the POV or GOV driver was at fault.

                             EXAMPLES OF VEHICLE ABUSE

A2.1. Vehicle abuse action will be initiated for vehicle/equipment damage or failure resulting
from:

   according to established requirements, or failure to monitor dash instrumentation.

   A2.1.4. Improper distribution or securing of loads in vehicle cargo areas or not following
   established loading and unloading procedures.
   A2.1.5. Using a vehicle for other than its intended or designed purpose (i.e., 6K F/L used to

   A2.1.6. Failure to clean/maintain vehicle’s interior/exterior to meet corrosion control and
   appearance requirements.
