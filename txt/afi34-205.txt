      AIR FORCE NONAPPROPRIATED FUND FACILITIES PANEL PROCESS

2.1. Panel Actions on AFBCIF and AFLF Facility Projects. The Panel reviews AFBCIF and
AFLF projects during the validation, design, and funding process. The Panel also reviews a
project if it experiences scope, cost, or concept changes beyond the MAJCOM authority to
approve. The Panel meets as required to review and recommend action on projects.
2.2. Recommending Projects for an Independent PVA.
   2.2.1. AFBCIF Projects. The Panel reviews all projects submitted by the MAJCOM for
   AFBCIF funding consideration. The Panel evaluates and recommends projects for PVAs
   based on the projected funding available for the program year. Factors considered in the
   Panel’s evaluation are the INVS Relative Needs Score (RNS); the MAJCOM priority; facility
   condition; operational, fiscal, or environmental urgencies; payback and Rate of Return
   (ROR) for Category C activities; and requirements driven by AF Services strategic
   initiatives.
   2.2.2. AFLF Projects. The Panel evaluates and recommends Temporary Lodging Facility
   (TLF) and Visiting Quarters (VQ) projects for PVAs based on the projected funding
   available for the program year. Factors considered in the Panel’s evaluation include the AF
   TLF and VQ prioritization lists, the MAJCOM and installation priorities, input from the
   AFSVA staff, and requirements driven by AF Services strategic initiatives.
2.3. Recommending Projects for Design Funding. The Panel reviews projects after a final
PVA report is issued. If the installation, MAJCOM, and AFSVA concur with the scope, cost,
and concept recommended in the report, the Panel may recommend the project for design. If the
installation, MAJCOM, or AFSVA do not concur, the AFSVA staff will work with the
MAJCOM and installation staffs and the PVA contractor to resolve any areas of disagreement.
If resolution cannot be achieved, the Panel will recommend action on the PVA based upon inputs
from all parties. The Panel recommends projects for design funding only if the need is validated
by the PVA and there is sufficient cash flow to support the action.
2.4. Recommending Projects for Facility Funding.
   2.4.1. AFBCIF Projects. The Panel uses the Facility Merit Evaluation System scores to rank
   the projects for funding consideration. After reviewing all information relative to the project,
   the Panel recommends projects to HQ USAF/A1S for funding based upon the amount of
   projected funding available for the program year.
   2.4.2. AFLF Projects. The TLF and VQ projects both compete for funding from the AFLF.
   In determining projects to recommend for funding, the Panel attempts to maintain a balance
   between the two types of projects.
       2.4.2.1. For TLF projects, the Panel uses the TLF prioritization listing, MAJCOM input,
       off-installation lodging costs, facility condition, and average length of stay to recommend
       projects for funding.
       2.4.2.2. For VQ projects, the Panel uses the VQ prioritization listing, MAJCOM input,
       off-installation lodging costs, facility condition, and cost savings to the travel line to
 10                                                                 AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


      recommend projects for funding. The authorized funds source for VQs is APFs.
      Therefore, VQ projects require a waiver to fund source in accordance with AFI 65-106,
      Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated
      Fund Instrumentalities, paragraph 6.8, in to qualify for NAF funding. Refer to AFI 32-
      1022 regarding processing waivers to funds source.
   2.4.3. Projects are considered for funding at the time they have achieved the required level
   of design. This point varies depending on the project’s method of execution.
      2.4.3.1. Projects accomplished using the design-bid-build execution method are
      considered for funding only if they have achieved an acceptable 65 percent design level.
      2.4.3.2. Projects accomplished using the design-build execution method must achieve an
      acceptable design level between 15 percent and 35 percent and have an acceptable
      Request for Proposal (RFP) package to qualify for funding consideration.
2.5. Panel Action on Changes to Project Scope, Cost, or Concept. The Panel approves,
disapproves, or recommends action on changes to the scope, cost, and concept of AFBCIF
projects (see paragraph 5.5) and AFLF projects (see paragraph 6.4.).
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                           11

                         NAF FACILITY PROJECT VALIDATION

3.1. Purpose and Types of Project Validation. The project validation process validates and
documents the need for NAF projects. These assessments support the need for a project as it is
reviewed at the various approval levels. In the case of Category C activities, the assessment also
determines the financial viability of proposed projects. The cost of the project determines the
type of validation used to document the need.
3.2. Deleted.
3.3. INVS. The installation must complete an INVS for any project proposed for AF central
funding. Also, an INVS is required for each new Category B or C construction, addition, or
add/alter project where the facility projects, contingency, and Supervision, Inspection, and
Overhead (SIOH) costs are $200,000 or more, regardless of the source of the NAFs. For
installation/MAJCOM funded NAF SRM projects with a total NAF investment of $500,000 or
higher, the MAJCOM may waive the requirement for an INVS as long as a MAJCOM PVA is
accomplished. Installation commanders and key staff use the INVS to validate need for projects
and prioritize projects being considered for NAF funding at AF level. The Panel uses the INVS
to evaluate projects competing for AFBCIF funds. Information on completing the INVS is
available at the AFSVA Community of Practice under Facilities.
3.4. PVA. A PVA is required to validate the need for projects over $300K. These assessments
support the need for a project as it is reviewed and approved by the CSAF and OSD on its way
for review by the Armed Services Committees in Congress. The PVA verifies the condition of
the existing facility, analyzes current and proposed programs/financial operations, reviews
market demographics and competition, and validates market demand through user surveys and
focus groups (where applicable). It also determines required scope and concept of operations,
reviews potential facility options to meet the identified need, calculates estimated project costs,
determines financial viability, and formally documents the requirement. The PVA addresses the
most viable options to meet the identified need. MAJCOM/installation unique architectural
standards are identified and itemized costs for items exceeding AF design standards are included
for Panel consideration when determining final project cost. The joint AFSVA/Army and Air
Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Name Brand Fast Food Assessment serves as a PVA for
Name Brand Fast Food projects. Dependent upon the project cost, source of funding, and
complexity of the project, PVAs may be accomplished by the MAJCOM, AFSVA, or a
commercial contractor (see below).
   3.4.1. Arranging for PVAs. HQ AFSVA/SVXF arranges for or accomplishes PVAs for all
   NAF projects funded with AF central funds and for any AF Services NAF project requiring
   submittal to Congress, regardless of the fund source.
       3.4.1.1. AFSVA contracts with independent civilian firms to perform PVAs on NAF
       projects costing $750K or greater. This includes any proposed NAF project whether
       funded by AF, MAJCOM, or installation funds.
       3.4.1.2. The AFSVA staff conducts studies on AF-funded projects that are $750K or
       less, Category B SRM projects up to $1.5M, or non-patron projects (structures which do
       not provide direct patron service); unless the AFSVA staff believes the circumstances or
12                                                                   AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


     conditions surrounding the project call for a contractor study. An independent contractor
     may be required to revalidate AFSVA-conducted PVAs, if the validated project cost goes
     over the limits shown above. AFSVA/CC can approve a waiver to the requirement for a
     contractor to conduct a PVA when justified by the circumstances related to a specific
     project. Contracted PVAs done on installation or MAJCOM funded projects are paid for
     by the installation or MAJCOM.
     3.4.1.3. MAJCOM staff may accomplish PVAs, at their installations, for any installation
     or MAJCOM funded NAF construction project $750K or less and Category B SRM
     project up to $1M. A MAJCOM PVA must involve both MAJCOM CE and A1S staffs.
     A study accomplished by the MAJCOM must provide a final report containing the same
     information as those done at the AF level. AFSVA/SVXF must review and coordinate on
     MAJCOM-conducted PVAs prior to finalization of the assessment. If the validated
     project cost goes over the specified limit, an independent contractor must revalidate
     MAJCOM-conducted PVAs. AFSVA/CC can approve a waiver to the requirement to
     conduct a contract PVA when justified by the circumstances related to a specific project.
  3.4.2. Conducting PVAs. Standard PVAs consist of three phases; advance information and
  surveys, site visit, and the draft and final report. Conduct of a PVA involves actions and
  support by AFSVA, MAJCOM CE and A1S, and installation CE and FSS. Installation FSS
  provides information and input related to activity operations and NAF financial items.
  Installation CE provides information, documents, and drawings relating to installation
  buildings, installation infrastructure issues, environmental issues, installation architectural
  standards, and the installation master plan. MAJCOM CE and A1S provide guidance on
  MAJCOM specific or unique policies or standards. Installation FSS and CEs are asked to
  assign project officers to collect the needed Services and CE information and assist during
  the site visit.
     3.4.2.1. Advance Information and Surveys. The initial phase of the PVA involves data
     collection and analysis. Prior to visiting an installation, the PVA team sends a request for
     advance information to the installation. For projects that involve patrons from the
     installation and surrounding community, the team will also send out surveys to a
     percentage of the active duty, civilian, and retired population supported by the
     installation. Normally, AFSVA will not schedule an installation site visit until the
     advance information and surveys are returned and analyzed.
     3.4.2.2. Site Visits. The PVA contractors perform site visits to the installation to verify
     the advance information and evaluate the existing facility, programs, financial operations,
     and market to determine the best option to meet the identified need. For patron-use
     facilities, they will conduct focus groups with a cross section of the activity users. The
     PVA team composition varies according to the project, but usually consists of a team
     leader/operations specialist, a financial specialist, and an architect. The team provides an
     in-brief and out-brief to installation leadership during the site visit. A listing of
     installation CE and FSS personnel whom the PVA team will interact with during their
     visit will be provided in advance of the PVA site visit. Ensuring these personnel are
     available during the visit is critical to the PVA process. MAJCOM CE and A1S staffs
     should participate in PVA site visits whenever possible as they provide valuable
     information to the PVA team and have a better understanding of the thought process
     behind the PVA recommendation when reviewing and commenting on the draft PVA
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                       13


     report. The PVA site visits are busy and it is essential the installation provide on-base
     lodging for the PVA team whenever possible.
     3.4.2.3. PVA Draft Reports. The PVA team provides a draft of the study report for
     review and comment by the installation, MAJCOM, and AFSVA staffs prior to finalizing
     the report. The PVA reviews are critical to the success of the project. Installations and
     MAJCOMs have 30 days after receipt of a draft study to review and provide comments to
     HQ AFSVA/SVXF. Offices which should review and provide comments on the draft
     PVA will be specified when the documents are provided for review. HQ AFSVA cannot
     authorize the NAF contractor to finalize the PVA without certified comments from these
     functions. Areas of disagreement with recommendations presented in the PVA must be
     identified and clearly explained. The contractor is required to address all comments and
     incorporate information or changes which correct administrative, mathematical, or factual
     errors; changes which are driven by AF policy or new criteria; changes which reflect
     information not available during the site visit; or circumstances which have changed
     subsequent to the site visit. The contractor is not required to implement changes based on
     comments which are contrary to the contractor’s professional opinion.
  3.4.3. The AFSVA staff works with the PVA contractor to revalidate study
  recommendations when changes to program, financial, and facility data occur after the PVA
  site visit, or 3 years have elapsed since completion of the PVA report. Generally, the
  AFSVA staff will revalidate changes in program, financial, and facility data. Supplemental
  PVAs are not conducted unless the changes are significant enough to invalidate the original
  PVA. The Panel determines if a supplemental PVA is needed to clarify issues relating to a
  project. AF will fund any costs related to supplemental studies needed for AF-funded
  projects. The same contractor which accomplished the original PVA will conduct any
  required supplemental study if the issue warrants such level of revalidation. Attachment 2
  contains the process for resolution of disagreements with a PVA recommendation.
  3.4.4. Installation Commander Agreement with the PVA. Design and facility funding for a
  NAF project is contingent upon the Installation Commander signing a memorandum agreeing
  to implement the operational/financial assumptions contained in the PVA Executive
  Summary. If the Installation Commander changes prior to consideration for facility funding,
  a new memorandum must be accomplished and provided to HQ AFSVA/SVX.

       NAF FACILITY PROJECT FINANCIAL PARAMETERS AND ANALYSIS

4.1. Pro Forma Financial Analysis. A pro forma financial analysis is required for any NAF
Category C project with a cost of $200K or more and any NAF project submitted as part of the
Annual NAF Report to Congress. The pro forma quantifies the expected NAF financial impacts
of constructing and repairing a facility and projects expected revenues and expenses compared to
current figures. The pro forma provides the project’s net present value of a project, Rate of
Return (ROR) on the investment, and the years required to payback the investment based upon
projected income and expenses. Congress requires this information on all NAF projects
submitted in the Annual NAF Report to Congress. Once a submitted project is approved for
study, the PVA team will develop a new pro forma based upon the information obtained during
the PVA site visit and the cost of the recommended project.
4.2. Financial Parameters for Category C NAF Projects.
   4.2.1. NAF facility projects ($200K or greater) for Category C activities must meet
   minimum financial parameters for ROR and payback of the investment. Projects failing to
   meet these parameters will not be considered for AFBCIF, MAJCOM, or installation funding
   without an exceptionally strong and compelling justification of need. HQ USAF/A1S is the
   waiver authority for these financial requirements. The cost of the project, for the purposes of
   ROR/payback calculations, includes design, design management, construction, SIOH,
   contingency, environmental assessments, demolition (if paid for by NAFs), cost of temporary
   structures, and Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment (FF&E).              Other NAF facility
   improvements ($200K or greater), which are approved, in progress, or completed within the
   same activity (beneficial occupancy achieved) during the previous 5 years, are also
   considered when doing the ROR and payback calculations for NAF projects. Guidance and
   templates for preparing the pro forma financial analysis are available at the AFSVA
   Community of Practice in Facilities under INVS.
       4.2.1.1. NAF construction, addition, and addition/alteration projects must have a
       minimum 7 percent ROR and have a payback period not to exceed 20 years.
       4.2.1.2. NAF SRM projects, which do not increase the scope of a facility, must have a
       minimum 3 percent ROR and have a payback period not to exceed 20 years.
   4.2.2. During design, HQ AFSVA/SVFA performs an interim financial analysis of Category
   C projects to ensure the projects remain within Air Force financial parameters for ROR and
   payback. Projects require financial reviews at 35 percent, 65 percent, and 95 percent design
   points if the project cost has increased by more than 1 percent or $100K, whichever is less.
   These reviews involve verifying the data and assumptions in the project pro forma remain
   valid at the increased cost. This does not apply to projects after a construction contract is
   awarded. If an interim analysis indicates a project no longer meets financial criteria, the
   project is referred to the Panel, which recommends a course of action to HQ USAF/A1S.
4.3. AFLF Projects. Lodging projects are evaluated using a pro forma income and expense,
and an analysis of projected travel line savings.

           AIR FORCE BASE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND PROJECTS

5.1. AFBCIF Guidelines. This information in this chapter applies only to AFBCIF projects and
implements CSAF direction on funding NAF facilities projects for Services Category B and C
activities.
   5.1.1. Primary objectives of the AFBCIF are to ensure the most urgent NAF facility needs
   are addressed first and to accelerate the validation and funding process to provide needed
   facilities for Air Force members and families as quickly as possible.
   5.1.2. The AFBCIF program operates within the following guidance and parameters:
       5.1.2.1. Do not use NAFs where APFs are authorized without a waiver from the
       appropriate authority. See AFI 65-106 for further guidance.
       5.1.2.2. Installations should fund any project within their capability. At a minimum,
       installations are expected to fund small projects and equipment requirements with local
       funds or through MAJCOM grants.
       5.1.2.3. The AFBCIF does not fund projects less than $200K.
       5.1.2.4. Category C projects must meet required financial parameters for ROR and
       payback or have an approved waiver (see paragraph 4.2.1.).
       5.1.2.5. The project scope/need must meet a validated market demand.
5.2. Submitting Projects for AFBCIF Funding Consideration. Projects may be forwarded to
Air Force for funding consideration in response to the Air Force Services NAF project call or as
a result of an emergency situation. Use of NAFs for a facility authorized APF funding requires
approval of a waiver to fund source by OSD.
   5.2.1. AFSVA Call for Projects. AFSVA/CC issues a call for MAJCOMs to submit
   qualified NAF projects for Air Force funding consideration. Submittals go to the AFSVA
   (HQ AFSVA/SVXF) in accordance with due date set forth in the call memo. MAJCOMs
   should not submit projects for which they or the installation have adequate funding to
   accomplish.
       5.2.1.1. MAJCOMs are responsible for reviewing project documentation for accuracy
       and completeness before submission to AFSVA.
       5.2.1.2. Each MAJCOM must provide a priority listing, signed by the MAJCOM Chiefs
       of Services, of all projects submitted by the MAJCOM for AF funding consideration.
   5.2.2. Project Submittal Criteria. Projects submitted for Air Force funding must exceed
   installation and MAJCOM funding capability, exceed $200K in total cost, and be authorized
   for NAF funding.
       5.2.2.1. Required Information. Required documentation for project submittals consists
       of a completed and signed INVS with current pro forma financial analysis information,
       current DD Forms 1391/1391C, Military Construction Project Data , and a detailed
       Parametric Cost Estimate.
 16                                                                   AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


   5.2.3. Emergency Funding Requirements. Most emergency funding requirements for
   facilities are authorized support from APFs and are not eligible for NAF dollars. In a case
   where NAF dollars are the appropriate fund source, the MAJCOM signs a memo to CSAF
   requesting the funding. The memo must explain the reason the submittal is an emergency
   and include appropriate supporting documentation. A project is not authorized emergency
   NAF funding if it is within the installation or MAJCOM ability to fund, either through its
   own NAF resources or through the use of MAJCOM/CC common-cause authority to move
   funds between installations.
       5.2.3.1. Facilities destroyed or damaged by an act of God or fire. These conditions
       qualify for APF support to repair or replace the facilities. Refer to AFI 32-1022 and AFI
       65-106 for specific examples.
       5.2.3.2. A facility structural condition or facility-related environmental issue which, if
       not acted upon immediately, will result in an environmental Notification of Violation
       incident or the immediate closure of an activity. Except for environmental issues caused
       by NAF operations and work to support Category C activity operations, APFs are
       authorized to correct these circumstances (refer to AFI 65-106).
   5.2.4. Non-Emergency Conditions. The following are not considered emergency conditions
   because they are usually planned sufficiently in advance to allow programming replacement
   facilities as part of the annual program.
       5.2.4.1. Establishing, Activating, and Expanding a Military Installation. Projects to
       support new missions and mission changes which increase the installation population by
       25 percent within a 2-year period, qualify for APF support (refer to AFI 32-1022 and AFI
       65-106).
       5.2.4.2. Facilities Relocated for the Convenience of the Government. Replacing a
       facility constructed or renovated with NAFs, when the activity is relocated for the
       convenience of the government, must be programmed as part of the project causing the
       relocation of the activity.
5.3. PVA Selection and Funding. Projects submitted for AF funding consideration compete
for PVAs based upon their INVS RNS and factors relating to facility condition, financial
payback, and environmental, fiscal, or operational urgency. The Panel recommends projects for
a PVA based upon the projected funding available for the year of the program. Projects not
selected for a PVA may be resubmitted as part of a subsequent program call. The MAJCOM
selects projects to receive PVAs when installation or MAJCOM NAF dollars are the project fund
source. The AFBCIF pays the cost of PVAs for all Air Force centrally funded projects and the
installation or MAJCOM pays for PVAs for projects funded from installation or MAJCOM
NAFs.
5.4. Project Scope and Cost Changes within MAJCOM Authority to Approve. The
MAJCOM/CC has approval authority for the level of scope and cost changes specified below, as
long as the project remains within acceptable ROR and payback parameters, the change does not
involve cancellation of another AFBCIF project(s), and the MAJCOM/installations fund any
resulting cost increases which exceed approved project funding. This authority applies only after
project funding is approved. Prior to project funding approval, all changes require
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                           17


coordination/action by AFSVA or the Panel. MAJCOMs/installations are responsible for
funding all increases resulting from project changes after AFBCIF funding approval.
   5.4.1. Scope Authority. The MAJCOM/A7, after coordination with MAJCOM/A1S, may
   approve scope variations (plus or minus) from the Panel approved scope (including approved
   amendments), after project funding is approved. This approval is not to exceed 2 percent for
   projects with scope under 10,000 square feet (SF), 1.5 percent for projects from 10,000 SF to
   20,000 SF, and 1 percent for projects over 20,000 SF
   5.4.2. Cost Authority. The MAJCOM/A1S, after coordination with the MAJCOM/A7, may
   approve cost increases up to 10 percent of the approved amount or $50K, whichever is
   greater. This applies only to cost increases occurring after AF funding is approved. Cost
   increases occurring after funding is approved are a MAJCOM/installation responsibility. All
   Category C projects must include a revised pro forma which shows the project remains
   within acceptable pay-back and ROR parameters.
   5.4.3. The MAJCOM/A1S forward all other changes to the Panel Chair, AFSVA/CD, with a
   request for action.
5.5. Project Scope, Cost, and Concept Changes within Panel Authority to Approve. The
Panel acts on changes which exceed the MAJCOM authority. Submit requested changes to HQ
AFSVA/SVXF for presentation to the Panel. For user requested change, the command must
justify its request, provide a cost benefit analysis, pro forma financial analysis (where
appropriate) and identify the proposed method to pay for any additional cost. The Panel has
authority to modify projects, as noted below, if the changes are supported by a valid justification
clearly showing the change is required, the benefit of the action is supportable when compared to
the cost, and the project remains within acceptable ROR and payback parameters.
   5.5.1. Concept changes. The Panel can approve changes supported by a justification clearly
   showing the change requested is the most cost-effective way to meet the market demand
   identified in the PVA. Proposed modifications which change the project cost must include a
   revised pro forma, showing ROR and payback calculation where applicable.
   5.5.2. Scope change authority. Not to exceed plus or minus 10 percent of approved scope.
   5.5.3. Cost change authority. Not to exceed 25 percent of approved amount. Cost increases
   after funding approval are paid with MAJCOM/installation funds. All Category C projects
   must include a revised pro forma and remain within acceptable payback parameters.
5.6. Project Scope, Cost, and Concept Changes Requiring HQ USAF/A1S Action. HQ
USAF/A1S acts on requests to modify projects which exceed the Panel’s authority. MAJCOMs
submit modification requests to the Panel, which provides a recommendation to HQ USAF/A1S
for action. This process applies under any of the following circumstances:
   5.6.1. Cost increase exceeds 25 percent of the approved amount. (See paragraph 5.6.4.).
   5.6.2. Scope change is over 10 percent of the approved scope. (See paragraph 5.6.4.).
   5.6.3. Project does not remain within acceptable ROR and payback parameters.
   5.6.4. Projects reported to Congress, which exceed the reported scope by more than 10
   percent or exceed the reported cost by more than 25 percent, must be re-reported to
   Congress.
 18                                                                   AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


5.7. Funding Project Cost Increases. After the CSAF approves project funding, project cost
increases are paid by the MAJCOM/installation using any of the following fund sources, as long
as the project increase is a correct use of NAFs and appropriate approval is obtained:
   5.7.1. The installation may use local funds.
   5.7.2. The MAJCOM may use command funds.
   5.7.3. The MAJCOM/CC is authorized to move NAFs between installations within their
   command (common-cause approach) to pay for project cost increases.
   5.7.4. The MAJCOM/ CV may request USAF/CV approval to cancel the command’s lowest
   priority approved Air Force-funded project and apply those funds to the project cost increase.
   (See paragraph 5.9 for additional guidance.)
   5.7.5. Cost Increases Caused by Currency Fluctuation. Installations are not responsible for
   funding cost increases caused solely by currency fluctuation for AF funded projects.
   Funding increases to a project which are solely the result of currency fluctuation are
   approved by the NAF Facilities Panel for cost increases up to 25 percent of the total NAF
   investment. The Panel refers increases which exceed 25 percent to HQ USAF/A1S for
   approval and re-reporting to Congress.
       5.7.5.1. The foreign currency exchange rate for overseas projects is the published rate on
       the day the project is recommended for funding by the Panel. All subsequent requests for
       funding increases due to foreign currency fluctuation are compared to that rate.
       Installations are responsible for cost increases due to currency fluctuation on user
       changes.
5.8. Reprogramming Approved Funds. Reprogramming of funds between the design,
construction, or equipment categories requires MAJCOM/A1S and HQ AFSVA/SVX
coordination and approval by HQ AFSVA/SVXF, HQ AFSVA/SVX, the Panel, or HQ
USAF/A1S, as noted below. Requests are sent to HQ AFSVA/SVXF for action or presentation
to the Panel.
   5.8.1. Reprogramming Due to Insufficient Funds. Reprogramming is limited to 25 percent
   of the originally approved amount in each category and approval is subject to the following
   parameters:
       5.8.1.1. HQ AFSVA/SVXF approves reprogramming of funds up to a cumulative total of
       $25K during the lifetime of the project and briefs the Panel as a matter of record.
       5.8.1.2. HQ AFSVA/SVX approves reprogramming of funds over $25K per action, up to
       a cumulative total of $100K during the lifetime of the project and briefs the Panel as a
       matter of record.
       5.8.1.3. The Panel approves reprogramming of funds over $100K per action, up to a
       cumulative total of $500K, during the lifetime of the project.
       5.8.1.4. Funds are only reprogrammed to equipment for items on the original approved
       project equipment listing. The MAJCOM/installation fund items not identified on the
       original equipment list.
       5.8.1.5. Cost increases/shortfalls resulting from reprogramming of funds between
       categories are funded by the MAJCOM/installation.
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                            19


       5.8.1.6. Environmental funding is specified for environmental assessments only and may
       not be reprogrammed for another use.
       5.8.1.7. The SIOH funding may not be reprogrammed while the project is in design or
       construction. After completion of the project, SIOH funding may be reprogrammed to
       cover cost increases paid by the installation, as long as they are not related to user
       changes or MAJCOM/installation failure to advise the PVA contractor of conditions or
       circumstances which result in contract modifications.
       5.8.1.8. The MAJCOM/Chief of Services (A1S), or Deputy, must sign requests for
       reprogramming. The package must explain the reason for the reprogramming, justify the
       request as the best action, and address why other funding options cannot be used.
       5.8.1.9. HQ USAF/A1S action is required on all reprogramming actions outside the
       above parameters.
   5.8.2. Administrative Realignment. HQ AFSVA/SVXF is authorized to administratively
   realign funding between categories if such action is required solely as a result of the
   execution method or structure of the facility contract. Examples include moving design
   funds to facilities when the execution method is design-build and the contractor will be paid
   for some of the design as part of the facility contract, or moving FF&E funds to facility if the
   contract language requires the contractor to furnish items which were included in the original
   FFE budget. Any actions of this nature will be clearly documented in the project files and
   briefed to the Panel as a matter of record.
5.9. Cancelling an AFBCIF Project. The MAJCOM/installations are responsible for funding
project cost increases that arise after project funding approval. After the MAJCOM and
installation have exhausted all available resources, they may request cancellation of their lowest
priority approved project and reprogramming of the funds to another approved project(s) in
accordance with paragraph 5.7.4. The request must be signed by MAJCOM/CV and sent to the
Panel for HQ USAF/CV action. This applies only to projects cancelled in order to fund another
approved AFBCIF project and the following applies:
   5.9.1. Funds from cancelled projects at Installation Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
   installations cannot be used to fund other MAJCOM projects.
   5.9.2. Funds from cancelled projects that are part of a specified funding initiative or set aside
   cannot be reprogrammed to projects outside that initiative or set aside.
   5.9.3. Funds from projects cancelled due to inability to award or execute are not available to
   fund other projects in the MAJCOM.
   5.9.4. If the cancelled project is under design (design contract awarded), the following
   applies:
       5.9.4.1. If the project design has not gone beyond 35 percent, the design will be
       cancelled at the 35 percent design point. This will allow the contractor to finish the 35
       percent design and the AF can hold the project for future consideration.
       5.9.4.2. If the project is beyond 35 percent design, HQ AFSVA/SVXF will work with the
       MAJCOM to determine if it is more cost effective to continue the design or to negotiate
       with the design firm to cancel the contract.
 20                                                                    AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


   5.9.5. A MAJCOM may resubmit cancelled Air Force-funded projects to compete for
   funding consideration in a future year. If a cancelled project is funded within 2 years, then
   funds remaining from the original project, if any, are applied to the new project.
   5.9.6. When a project is cancelled, any balance of funds is retained in the AFBCIF for 2
   years from the date the cancellation was approved. These funds are available for up to 2
   years to fund previously cancelled projects or for future cost increases within the same
   MAJCOM.
5.10. What Projects a MAJCOM or Installation Should Fund. The MAJCOMs/installations
are expected to fund NAF facility projects within their capability, regardless of cost. The
AFBCIF does not fund projects which cost less than $200K. HQ USAF/A1S approves waivers
to this policy.
5.11. APF Companion Projects. Approval for NAF project funding is contingent upon
funding and execution of the APF companion projects. Prior to Panel action to recommend NAF
funding approval by CSAF, the MAJCOM/installation must provide a memo to HQ
AFSVA/SVXF signed by the CE or Deputy CE indicating APFs are programmed for execution
of the APF companion projects. When it is more economical or efficient for a NAF design or
construction contractor to accomplish the APF companion project as part of the overall design or
construction contract for a facility, this may be done through the use of a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) between the Comptroller representing the APFs and the contracting
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI). See Paragraph 8.11 for additional guidance.
   5.11.1. Site Preparation. The MAJCOMs are responsible for providing APFs for site
   preparation to provide a clean site (i.e., demolition, abatement, and remediation) where NAF
   was not the origin of the environmental issue (e.g. repairing a converted APF facility vice
   working on an existing AAFES gas station). This should be accomplished by a separate APF
   project executed in advance of the NAF project.
5.12. Projects with Multiple Structures. If there are multiple structures approved in a single
project, the scope variation authority applies to the total square footage of all the buildings.
Cabins are an example of this authority. However, this does not apply to activities with different
functions. For example, the scope for a golf course cannot be applied to building structures and
the scope authorized a maintenance building cannot be applied to a golf clubhouse. The scope
variation authority applies to each different type of function independently.
5.13. NAF Funding for Environmental Assessments. Some projects require an environmental
assessment to determine if the project is feasible. For Category C activities, the cost of such an
assessment may be a NAF responsibility (refer to AFI 65-106 for additional guidance). The
AFBCIF funding is authorized for Category C activity project environmental assessments if the
requirement is identified in the initial project submittal documents and included in the PVA
report. Environmental costs for Category A and B activities are funded with APFs. The
MAJCOM/installations must pay for environmental assessments not identified in the initial
submittal documents. Environmental assessments determine if an environmental impact study is
required. NAFs are not used to fund an environmental impact study except under special
circumstances. The Panel will address requests for such funding on a case-by-case basis.
5.14. AF Signature Brands and Name Brands in AFBCIF Projects. AFBCIF projects may
include both AF Signature Brand and/or commercial Name Brand operations within the project
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                       21


scope. The funding and construction of such projects are subject to specific provisions as
outlined below.
   5.14.1. AF Signature Brands. Signature Brands are AF-developed branded theme restaurant
   concepts for Category C activities. See Food and Beverage, Clubs, Food and Beverage, and
   Signature Brands at AF Services Agency web site for detailed information on the AF
   Signature Brands.
      5.14.1.1. AF Signature Brand projects less than $750K. Signature Brand projects with a
      construction cost of less than $750K are funded on a cost share basis between the AF
      Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Fund and the installation MWR Fund.
      5.14.1.2. AF Signature Brand projects where the construction cost is $750K or more
      must be accomplished under the AFBCIF funding process. AF Signature Brands must be
      included in AFBCIF funded club projects, when validated by a PVA, unless waived by
      HQ USAF/A1S. Projects which include Signature Brands require a signed Signature
      Brand Operating Agreement (SBOA) prior to funding approval. The Panel will not
      consider funding a Signature Brand project unless a signed SBOA is part of the project
      information provided the Panel.
   5.14.2. Name Brands. Name brand concepts are national, regional, or local brands
   recognized in the civilian sector. An installation desiring a name brand operation for a
   Services activity will submit a request through the MAJCOM to AFSVA. AFSVA will assist
   in arranging for a validation assessment (jointly with AAFES, in the case of name brand fast
   foods) and select the method to satisfy a valid name brand requirement. Any name brand
   operation not secured through AAFES must be secured by contract issued by the Air Force
   NAF Purchasing Office. Facility projects for name brand operations may be funded by
   MWRFs or by the AFBCIF; projects where the construction costs exceed $750K must use
   the AFBCIF process and be included in the Annual NAF Report to Congress.

                                            Chapter 6

                                AFLF FACILITY PROJECTS

6.1. AF Lodging Capital Improvement Program (LCIP). Facility construction of AF VQ
and TLF facility projects with AFLFs is part of the LCIP. VQ and TLF facility projects are
identified for funding based on annual facility funding authority received from HQ USAF/A1S,
AF-wide TLF and VQ prioritization lists resulting from analysis of need, MAJCOM/A1S
concurrence, and CSAF approval. The VQ and TLF prioritization lists plus the availability of
funds in the AFLF provide the basis for annual programming of specific NAF lodging facility
projects. The number of rooms/units is determined using an AF lodging prioritization system
and validated by an independent contractor PVA.
   6.1.1. Revisions to the priority list require supporting documentation indicating significant
   changes to facility conditions, occupancy rates, mission requirements, and other pertinent
   factors used to prioritize worldwide lodging requirements.
   6.1.2. Elements Authorized in AFLF projects. The elements listed below are authorized for
   inclusion in projects funded with AFLF dollars. Incorporation of any activity not shown
   below requires approval of HQ USAF/A1S.
       6.1.2.1. TLFs. In addition to basic living units, the following elements are authorized as
       part of the TLF: housekeeping, mechanical, and storage space, a playground, parking,
       and appropriate landscaping and irrigation. Laundry facilities are part of each unit.
       6.1.2.2. VQs. In addition to guest rooms, the following elements are authorized as part
       of the VQ: laundry rooms, business center, meeting/training room (accommodating up to
       25 employees), retail sales outlet, reception, administration, housekeeping, storage, and
       mechanical space, up to a 75-person conference room with video teleconferencing and
       catering capability, and an AF Signature Brand or Name Brand food operation. AFLFs
       provide the space and utilities access. Signature Brand/Name Brand funds are used for
       interior décor and FF&E. Projects will include appropriate parking, landscaping and an
       irrigation system.
          6.1.2.2.1. AFLF projects that include Signature Brands require a signed SBOA prior
          to funding approval. The SBOA must be part of the project information provided to
          the Panel when it considers the project for funding.
   6.1.3. HQ USAF/A1S approves changes in scope (e.g., number and size of guestrooms) of
   proposed facilities in the priority lists. However, AFSVA/CC has authority to approve a
   change of plus or minus two guest rooms per floor if needed to permit technical adjustments
   to the project or provide a more beneficial design.
6.2. Funding Policy for NAF Lodging Facility Projects.
   6.2.1. Funding for facility construction of all NAF lodging projects comes from the AFLF,
   except as identified in the following paragraphs. The Panel seeks to achieve an equitable
   distribution of funding between TLF and VQ facility requirements based upon urgency of
   need, quality of life, financial benefit to the AF and to AF families, and availability of funds.
       6.2.1.1. HQ USAF/A1S approves design-related funding for all AFLF projects.
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                        23


      6.2.1.2. CSAF approves facility and equipment funding for AFLF projects.
      6.2.1.3. The Panel will use the “aggregate funding” method to fund the design and
      facility construction of AFLF projects within each program year. Aggregate funding
      permits management of facility funding by annual program year rather than on a single
      project basis. This allows reprogramming of savings which may occur on one project to
      help cover higher than anticipated costs on another project in the same program year. All
      projects for a program year are managed within the total approved aggregate funding for
      that year. Reprogramming approval authority is outlined in paragraph 6.5.
      6.2.1.4. APF Companion Projects. Approval for AFLF project funding is contingent
      upon funding and execution of any APF companion projects.                    The
      MAJCOM/installations must certify, via a memo to HQ AFSVA/SVXF signed by the CE
      or Deputy CE, that funds for APF companion projects are programmed prior to Panel
      action to recommend NAF funding approval by CSAF.
          6.2.1.4.1. MOAs for APFs to pay a NAFI for doing work authorized with APFs.
          When it is more economical or efficient for a NAF design or facility construction
          contractor to accomplish the APF companion project as part of the overall design or
          facility construction contract for a facility, this may be done through the use of an
          MOA between the Comptroller representing the APFs and the contracting NAFI. The
          MOA permits the installation Comptroller to pay the installation MWRF for APF
          authorized work accomplished with NAF dollars. This is authorized under the
          provisions of AFMAN 64-302, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Contracting
          Procedures, paragraph 11.13. Ensure any such MOA fully compensates the NAFI for
          all of its direct and indirect costs and for undertaking the added responsibility.
          Contact HQ AFSVA/SVXF for assistance in preparing an MOA.
   6.2.2. Budgeting and Cash Flow. HQ AFSVA/SVO budgets funds for project validation
   studies and works with HQ AFSVA/SVF and HQ AFSVA/SVXF on projection of design and
   construction expenditures in the AFLF cash flow budget.
6.3. Project Items Authorized Funding Support with AFLFs.
   6.3.1. Design. Includes design fees, design management fees, value engineering (VE) study
   fees, and environmental assessment costs.
      6.3.1.1. Environmental Assessments. AFLF will pay for an environmental assessment
      for AFLF projects. When an environmental assessment determines an environmental
      impact study/analysis is required, APFs must fund the study. AFLF are not authorized
      for environmental impact studies/analyses.
   6.3.2. Facility Construction. Includes facility construction, contingency, management
   reserve, management fees, and SIOH/facility construction management. Real Property
   Installed Equipment (RPIE) is a part of construction.
      6.3.2.1. Contingency Funds. Contingency fund cost will be budgeted at 5 percent for
      new facility construction projects and 10 percent for renovation projects.
      6.3.2.2. SIOH/Construction Management (Title II Services). The SIOH funding for
      AFLF projects is subject to special rules (reference paragraph 8.10). Installations do not
 24                                                                   AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


      have authority to commit funding for SIOH without specific approval from HQ
      AFSVA/SVXF.
      6.3.2.3. Landscaping. Facility construction budgets for AFLF projects include funding
      for landscaping (includes lawn sprinkler systems) installation upon a maximum dollar
      cost, as established by the NAF Facilities Panel, per 1,000 SF of project site. Waivers to
      exceed this amount are approved by the NAF Facilities Panel.
      6.3.2.4. Playgrounds. As part of overall project funding, TLF new facility projects may
      receive funding assistance for play area development/equipment. This equipment is
      RPIE and its purchase and installation is part of facility projects. This allowance is
      subject to the unavailability of existing play areas at or near the TLFs. The funding
      required is determined during the initial programming process.
   6.3.3. FF&E. This includes all equipment needed for a complete and useable facility
   according to AF standards in the VQ and TLF design guides, as applicable. For AFLF
   projects, this may include items normally considered as supplies and expendable equipment.
   These items are included in the FF&E funding. However, items authorized APFs must be
   obtained with APFs. See Attachment 3 for items not authorized for purchase from AFLFs
   in support of a NAF construction project.
      6.3.3.1. Telephones. The AFLF will pay for adding telephone equipment requirements
      for new rooms and the lodging reception desks if an installation-owned NAF system
      already exists in lodging. If a third party owns the telephone system, the installation will
      be responsible for renegotiating its contract to expand the system as needed to
      accommodate the new rooms. Communications equipment not related to the new lodging
      rooms or expanded reception function are not a NAF responsibility (See AFI 65-106,
      Table 6.1.).
   6.3.4. Site Preparation. The MAJCOMs are responsible for providing APFs for site
   preparation to provide a clean site (i.e., demolition, abatement, and remediation) where NAF
   was not to origin of the environmental issue (e.g. repairing a converted AFP facility vice
   working on an existing AAFES gas station). This should be accomplished by a separate
   APF project executed in advance of the NAF project. The MAJCOMs are responsible for
   auxiliary equipment, furnishings, and supplies beyond that required for a complete and
   usable facility (examples of MAJCOM-funded items are picnic pavilions, barbeques, or
   items which are outsides AF lodging/facility standards).
6.4. Project Scope and Cost Changes. The AFLF projects are subject to special requirements
regarding changes to scope or cost.
   6.4.1. Changes Prior to Funding Approval. Any deviation from the AF programmed scope
   and cost must be coordinated with HQ AFSVA/SVXF/SVOL. Design changes resulting in
   scope or cost changes are not authorized to proceed without prior authorization from HQ
   AFSVA/SVXF after coordination with HQ AFSVA/SVOL.
   6.4.2. Changes after Funding Approval. Projects which have changes in scope or cost after
   funding approval must go to the Panel for action. The MAJCOM does not have the authority
   to change the scope or cost of an AFLF project. Submit requested changes, with appropriate
   justification, to HQ AFSVA/SVXF for presentation to the Panel.
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                          25


      6.4.2.1. Scope Change Authority. The Panel can approve scope changes not to exceed
      plus or minus 10 percent of approved scope required due to technical issues, except
      changes in the number of size of rooms (see 6.1.3. above). Changes beyond 10 percent
      are forwarded to HQ USAF/A1S for action.
      6.4.2.2. Cost Change Authority. The Panel can approve cost changes not to exceed 25
      percent of approved amount. Cost changes exceeding 25 percent are forwarded to HQ
      USAF/A1S for action. Projects which were reported to Congress, which exceed scope by
      more than 10 percent or exceed cost by more than 25 percent, require CSAF approval and
      must be reported to Congress again. Authority for cost changes is installation on
      cumulative change amount. When any single change causes the cumulative amount to
      exceed an approval threshold, the project is referred to the next level approving authority.
          6.4.2.2.1. For AFLF projects, the Panel can approve cost increases within 25 percent
          of approved amount, as long as they do not individually exceed $1M, funding is
          available within the program year budget, and no AF Lodging standards are
          compromised.
          6.4.2.2.2. Cost increases which exceed the approved amount by 25 percent or
          individually are over $1M, where funding is not available within the program year
          budget, or represent a significant deviation from the current approved lodging facility
          design standards, are forwarded to HQ USAF/A1S for action.
   6.4.3. Cost Increases Caused by Currency Fluctuation. Installations are not responsible for
   funding cost increases caused solely by currency fluctuation. The foreign currency exchange
   rate for overseas projects is the published rate on the day the project is recommended for
   funding by the Panel. Funding increases to a project which are solely the result of currency
   fluctuation are approved by the Panel for cost increases up to 10 percent, not to exceed
   $500K. The Panel refers currency fluctuation cost increases over 10 percent, or $500K, to
   HQ USAF/A1S for action.
6.5. Reprogramming Approved Funds. Reprogramming of funds between categories of an
individual project, or between projects within the same program year, is installation upon
cumulative totals over the life of the project and is subject to the following:
   6.5.1. Reprogramming of SIOH is not authorized to permit award of a project. However, at
   completion of a project, and after payment of all invoices, any remaining SIOH funding may
   be reprogrammed under the aggregate funding concept. Individual authorities below are
   subject to not exceeding 25 percent of the amount reported to Congress or, if the project is
   not reportable, 25 percent of the originally approved cost. All actions approved below Panel
   level are subsequently presented to the Panel as a matter of record.
      6.5.1.1. HQ AFSVA/SVXF Authority. HQ AFSVA/SVXF, with the coordination of HQ
      AFSVA/SVOL, approves individual reprogramming requests up to $50K, which do not
      exceed a cumulative total $250K over the life of the project.
      6.5.1.2. HQ AFSVA/SVX Authority. HQ AFSVA/SVX, with the coordination of HQ
      AFSVA/SVO, approves individual reprogramming requests up to $200K, which do not
      exceed a cumulative total of $1M over the life of the project.
26                                                              AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


     6.5.1.3. Panel Chair Authority. The NAF Facilities Panel Chair, with HQ AFSVA/SVF,
     SVO, and SVX coordination, approves reprogramming requests up to $500K which do
     not exceed a cumulative total of $2.5M, over the life of the project.
     6.5.1.4. Panel Authority. The Panel approves individual reprogramming requests up to
     $1M which do not exceed $5M over the life of project. The Panel also reviews and
     recommends action to HQ USAF/A1S on funding requirements exceeding approved
     amounts which cannot be handled by reprogramming or under the aggregate funding
     authority.
     6.5.1.5. HQ USAF/A1S Authority. HQ USAF/A1S approves individual reprogramming
     requests which exceed $1M, or any request which would cause the total project cost to
     increase by over $5M.
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                          27


                                           Chapter 7

                AFBCIF AND AFLF PROJECT FUNDING PROCEDURES

7.1. Project Funding Guidance. Unless noted, the guidance in this chapter applies to both
AFBCIF and AFLF projects. Funding for these projects is managed by HQ AFSVA/SVXF, and
administered through the Air Force Cash Management and Investment Program (CMIP).
Administration and movement of funds for AF projects is done through each installation’s CMIP
Automatic Reimbursement Account (ARA) using an AFBCIF number assigned to each project.
All correspondence concerning funding actions must include the AFBCIF number.
7.2. Establishing Project ARAs. Once a project is approved for design, HQ AFSVA/SVXF
requests HQ AFSVA/SVF to establish the project account in the CMIP based on the approved
PVA costs approved by the Panel. An associated record is also established in the Facility
Management Information System database to track the progress of the project and maintain a
record of all funding actions and project information. Project subaccounts are established in
three categories; design, construction, and equipment. These subaccounts are only activated for
projects which have approved funds in these categories. Uses within each category include:
   7.2.1. Design Funds. Used for design, design management services, site investigation, and
   environmental assessments (environmental assessments only if identified in the PVA).
   7.2.2. Facility Construction Funds. Used for facility construction costs, RPIE, contingency,
   SIOH, project management, temporary buildings costs, and demolition when it is a NAF
   expense (demolition applies only to AFBCIF projects).
   7.2.3. Equipment Funds (FF&E that are not RPIE). AFBCIF funding is authorized for
   equipment and furnishings for new facilities, additions, or areas in existing facilities
   programmed for renovation using AFBCIF money unless the items are authorized APF
   support. Use of AFLF dollars to purchase equipment for AFLF projects is subject to the
   provisions of AFI 65-106, Chapter 6, Figure 6.1. The MAJCOMs are required to provide a
   list of proposed equipment to HQ AFSVA/SVXF for coordination when requesting
   allocation of project equipment funds. Do not purchase project equipment without prior
   coordination of HQ AFSVA.
7.3. Prohibited Uses of Project Funds.
   7.3.1. AFBCIF Projects. Use of AFBCIF project funds is not authorized for any item
   eligible for APF support or for resale inventory, supplies, operating capital, or grand opening
   expenses.
   7.3.2. AFLF Projects. The AFLF project funds cannot be used for resale inventory or grand
   opening expenses. See attachment 3 for additional guidance on items not authorized for
   purchase from AFLFs in support of a NAF construction project.
7.4. Design, Facility Construction, and SIOH Funds Allocation. Funds are allocated (made
available in the ARA account) when HQ AFSVA/SVXF is notified of the actual amount of the
contract award for design, construction, or SIOH (Title II construction management services).
7.5. Contingency Funds Allocation. Contingency funds are approved for use in cases where
unforeseen site conditions prevent proper completion of the project. They are not authorized for
 28                                                                     AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


user-desired changes. The use of contingency funds is closely monitored and each use must be
fully justified. HQ AFSVA will allocate the approved contingency funds for the project at the
same time the construction funds are allocated to allow project modifications which must be
immediately implemented to correct an unforeseen condition and avoid contractor delays. The
MAJCOM/A1S facilities POC is responsible for ensuring contingency funds are used for the
intended purpose and not for user-desired changes. Required modifications must be the most
cost-effective option to correct the problem. On a monthly basis, the MAJCOM facilities POC
provides HQ AFSVA/SVXF a listing of change orders executed during the month for review and
incorporation into the project file. The list will contain the change order number, date executed,
a description of what action was required, and the cost. If no contingency funds are used during
the month, a negative report is required. During the AFSVA review, any change orders which
do not meet the specified parameters for NAF contingency expenditures will become the
responsibility of the installation/MAJCOM. AFSVA will electronically withdraw funding from
the installation MWRF to cover such expenditures. Contingency funds may be used to
supplement construction funds for award of the project, but such action requires coordination
with HQ AFSVA/SVXF. For AFBCIF projects, this also requires certification by the installation
which they are prepared to cover any project funding shortfalls caused by this action.
7.6. Equipment Funds Allocation. Prior to obligation of equipment funds, an installation will
provide the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVXF with an itemized listing of equipment items
required for the project. The listing must include the name of item, quantity, unit cost, and total
costs. HQ AFSVA/SVXF will validate the items which are appropriate for the project, provide
the installation with an equipment list approved for purchase, and allocate funds to the
equipment category of the ARA account.
7.7. Certification of Funds. HQ AFSVA/SVXF certifies design funds when the project ARA is
established and certifies construction funds when the MAJCOM/installation requests authority to
advertise from HQ USAF/A7CPE. Equipment funds certification is done when HQ
AFSVA/SVXF approves the equipment listing. Do not advertise projects for construction and/or
order equipment until notification of fund certification is received
7.8 . Expiration of Project Funding Approval. Funding approval for AFBCIF and AFLF
projects expires at the same time the project approval expires. Requests for extension of funding
approval require review by the Panel and approval by HQ USAF/A1S. MAJCOMs must submit
requests at least 90 days prior to expiration and provide justification for the requested extension.
7.9. Payment of Invoices and Procedures for ARA Drawdowns.
   7.9.1. When invoices are received from the servicing contracting office during design and
   construction, the installation RM obtains certification from the CE project manager (PM), or
   the construction manager (AF, US Army Corp of Engineers, or Naval Facilities Command),
   that the work has been satisfactorily completed. After the certification is received, the RM
   processes a receiving report in the Internet Based Purchasing System (IBPS) or prepares a
   DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, for the work. The RM emails a
   request for payment of the invoice, with copies of the receiving report or DD Form 250, the
   invoice, and appropriate CE or PM certification documents (if not annotated on the invoices)
   to HQ AFSVA/SVXF at AFSVA.SVXF@us.af.mil. HQ AFSVA/SVXF will validate the
   payment documents and authorize payment of the invoice and reimbursement of the
   installation’s MWRF or Lodging Fund from the ARA. The receiving report must contain the
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                           29


   installation CMIP #, project ARA #, project AFBCIF #, the project title and the appropriate
   payment action code in the description block. Failure to include these items can delay
   payment. Construction contracts normally have a requirement for payment within 14 days
   from receipt of invoice, so prompt action to process the required documentation is required.
   The email subject line should follow this format: Installation, Project Title, (firm name)
   invoice # AFBCIF#, ARA#, CMIP#-(payment action code).
   7.9.2. Payment Action Codes. One of the following payment action codes is required in
   order to process a reimbursement from the project ARA to the installation MWRF or
   Lodging Fund. The code must be spelled exactly as shown and must be all upper case letters.
   Include the code in the email subject line and in the description block of the receiving report.

                                           Chapter 8

      AFBCIF AND AFLF DESIGN OVERSIGHT AND PROJECT MONITORING

8.1. Design Execution. Design execution is the responsibility of either AFCEE (major
construction) or the BCE (minor construction and SRM) within the context of the parameters
outlined in this document. The appropriate organizational PM develops the project design and
construction schedule with the coordination of the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVXF. Selection
of a design agent is subject to the provisions of paragraph 8.8 below. HQ AFSVA/SVXF
approval is required prior to committing AFBCIF or AFLF funds for design management
services to an organization outside the AF.
8.2. Design Instructions (DIs). HQ AFSVA/SVXF requests HQ USAF/A7CP or the
MAJCOM, as appropriate, issue a DI for a validated NAF project after the installation,
MAJCOM, AFSVA staffs concur with, and the panel approves, the project’s scope, costs, and
concept as recommended in the PVA. The DI is issued to the AFCEE/CM or MAJCOM/A7 who
notifies the installation the project is authorized for design. HQ AFSVA/SVXF provides
AFCEE/MAJCOM/A7 MAJCOM/A1S additional details of the project scope and cost, plus
certification of funding availability when the design funds are approved.
8.3. AFSVA Design Oversight. HQ AFSVA/SVXF is responsible for functional design
oversight for all AFBCIF and AFLF projects. This includes ensuring projects remain within the
approved scope, cost, and concept, are functionally and cost efficient, and are within AF Services
program and policy guidelines. The following policies apply:
   8.3.1. Project Management Plan (PMP). Every AFBCIF and AFLF project will have a PMP
   defining the scope, cost, and concept of the project and outlining the actions and
   responsibilities of the individuals at the installation, MAJCOM, AFCEE, and AFSVA level
   in regard to design, construction, and funding of the project. HQ AFSVA/SVXF will work
   with the MAJCOM and installation to assist in obtaining a PMP for projects executed by the
   US Army Corps of Engineers or the Naval Facilities Command. AFSVA will not provide
   fund certification for the project until the PMP is completed and signed by all parties.
   8.3.2. Design Statement of Work (SOW). HQ AFSVA/SVXF must review and coordinate
   on all design SOWs for AFBCIF and AFLF projects prior to release to proposed contractors.
   No changes to the coordinated SOWs are authorized without HQ AFSVA/SVXF
   concurrence. Every design SOW will contain a provision allowing the AF an option to stop
   design at the 35 percent design point if the project exceeds AF approved parameters.
   8.3.3. Design Meetings. AFBCIF and AFLF projects require the following design review
   meetings: predesign, design charrette/15 percent, 35 percent, 65 percent, and 95 percent.
   The design charrette process will be used to design these projects, unless a waiver is obtained
   from HQ AFSVA/ SVXF.
       8.3.3.1. AFSVA Participation in Design Meetings. HQ AFSVA/SVXF staff will
       participate in the predesign, charrette/15 percent, 35 percent design meetings, and 65
       percent design meetings, and will review the design documents and provide comments
       for incorporation at 95 percent. HQ AFSVA/SVOL Lodging program staff will attend
       design meetings on lodging projects. HQ AFSVA/SVXF must be notified of all design
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                           31


       review meetings at least 30 days in advance of their scheduled date. Failure to provide
       the advance notice may require rescheduling of the meeting.
8.4. Design Approval. Written authorization from HQ AFSVA/SVX is required before design
can proceed beyond the 35 percent, 65 percent, and 95percent levels.
   8.4.1. Design actions, which modify the approved scope, cost, or concept of a project must
   be addressed as outlined in Chapter 5 (AFBCIF projects) and Chapter 6 (AFLF projects).
   8.4.2. Incorporation or resolution of HQ AFSVA/SVXF comments is required before
   proceeding with further design action. AFSVA requires copies of all design comments and
   responses related to all design submissions for AF funded NAF projects. Failure to
   incorporate or resolve comments may cause project delays and may subject the installation to
   added costs to rectify unapproved design actions.
8.5. Standard Designs and Design Standards/Criteria. Use of applicable Uniform Facilities
Criteria (UFC), AF Services standard designs, and design standards/criteria for MWR Category
B, Category C, and AFLF lodging activities is mandatory unless waived by HQ AFSVA/SVX.
UFC are available at www.wbdg.org under Popular Links.
   8.5.1. Functional Coordination. HQ AFSVA/SVXF coordinates with the appropriate HQ
   AFSVA functional program manager to establish and validate design standards/criteria for
   recreational activities. Design criteria, design guides, standards, etc., are referenced in the
   Requirements Document provided to the A-E and are available on the AFSVA web site.
   These criteria are reemphasized/clarified at the pre-design or charrette meetings. HQ
   AFSVA/SVXF works with the appropriate HQ AFSVA functional staff and the
   installation/MAJCOM-level functional managers to ensure design of the facility is in
   compliance with the applicable design guide/standard.
       8.5.1.1. For AFLF projects, the AF Lodging interior designer or a contracted interior
       designer, in conjunction with HQ AFSVA/SVOL, will assemble a comprehensive interior
       design (CID) presentation for coordination by installation leadership. Once a selection is
       made, deviations from the CID are approved only to accommodate discontinued
       materials, room layout, changes to AF Lodging standards, and other unique
       circumstances. HQ AFSVA/SVOL, in coordination with HQ AFSVA/SVXF, is the
       approval authority.
       8.5.1.2. No changes to facility design standards contained in the AF Design Guides are
       authorized without a waiver from HQ AFSVA/SVX. Modifications for unexpected local
       siting constraints, exterior design considerations, and changes required for validated force
       protection requirements are exceptions and do not require a waiver. However,
       coordination with HQ AFSVA/SVXF is required prior to proceeding with such changes.
8.6. Renderings and Models. The cost of any renderings or models is the responsibility of the
requesting organization. This includes any requirement for 3-Dimensional Computer Aided
Design Drawings.
8.7. Installation/MAJCOM Design Costs. The installations/MAJCOMs are responsible for
funding additional design costs resulting from failure to comply with above design execution
policy or for additional design related to user changes.
 32                                                                    AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


8.8. IDIQ Design Contracts. Use of AF IDIQ A-E design contracts is mandatory unless HQ
USAF/A1S and HQ USAF/A7C approve a faster, less costly method. AFSVA has NAF IDIQ
design contracts specifically available for use on any NAF facility contracts. However, IDIQ
contracts negotiated by AFCEE or any AF organization are acceptable if coordinated with HQ
AFSVA/SVXF.
   8.8.1. NAF IDIQ A-E Design Contracts. Information on use of AF Services NAF IDIQ A-E
   design contracts for the design of NAF projects is available through the Air Force NAF
   Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO), HQ AFSVA/SVC, at DSN 969-7821. A full range of A-E
   services are available, including on-site investigation, complete design services, and full-time
   construction inspection. The purpose of these contracts is to reduce time and costs for
   project design. The contracts are for use on NAF projects funded by installation, MAJCOM,
   or AF. However, their use on overseas projects must comply with the Status of Forces
   Agreement (SOFA) and any other applicable country-to-country agreements.
       8.8.1.1. IDIQ Contract Use. To use these contracts, submit a request (coordinated with
       appropriate installation and MAJCOM A1S and A7 offices) HQ AFSVA/SVC, 2261
       Hughes, Suite 156, Lackland AFB, TX 78235-9852. The request package must contain
       the following:
       8.8.1.2. A memorandum requesting the services required and certifying funding is
       approved and available.
       8.8.1.3. A current and complete DD Form 1391 that reflects the project concept
       recommended by the AF NAF Facilities Panel.
       8.8.1.4. A cost estimate for the requested services and a synopsis of the work/Statement
       of Work (SOW) based upon the concept approved by the Panel.
       8.8.1.5. HQ AFSVA/SVC will coordinate with HQ AFSVA/SVXF to determine and
       assign the most qualified contractor installation on the project requirements and will work
       closely with the contracting office on negotiations with the contractor to secure the best
       fee possible for the project. After an acceptable fee proposal is negotiated, the
       installation RM submits an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, to HQ AFSVA/SVC.
       Complete contract documentation is provided to the installation once the delivery order is
       finalized. These contracts include construction management, but do not encompass
       construction contracting. Construction contracting is available through AFCEE or
       installations may use the local contracting office if they have the capability. The US
       Army Corps of Engineers or Naval Facilities Command will provide contracting services
       for projects where they are the construction manager.
8.9. Value Engineering (VE) for NAF Projects. VE is mandatory for all AFBCIF and AFLF
projects with a construction cost exceeding $10M. VE for projects over $1M should be
considered if the anticipated ratio of benefit to cost is at least 10 to 1.
8.10. Construction Management/SIOH. AF IDIQ contracts for SIOH/construction
management, when available, are the primary source of construction management for NAF
projects, except in overseas areas where precluded by SOFA or other country-to-country
agreements. Requests to use other sources for SIOH/construction management must be
coordinated in advance with HQ AFSVA/SVX and be supported by a cost-benefit analysis
showing the proposed method is less costly and provides service equal to or exceeding the IDIQ
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                           33


contract. Projects less than $750K are exempt from this requirement. However, IDIQ services
are available for such projects, if required.
8.11. MOA for NAF Execution of APF Companion Projects. Many NAF construction and
add/alter projects involve companion projects authorized APF support. This often requires
separate NAF and APF contracts affecting the same overall project with two different contractors
working on the same site. This doubles the contracting effort and often results in the contractors’
work overlapping in the same area. HQ USAF/A1S has authorized optional use of an alternative
set forth in DoDI 1015.15, Procedures for Establishment, Management, and Control of
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities and Financial Management of Supporting Resources,
Enclosure 6, which addresses the DoD Uniform Funding and Management Practice. Under this
Practice, APFs made available for support of MWR facility projects may be transferred to a
NAFI to accomplish the APF companion project. This permits both the NAF and APF
companion requirements to be accomplished under a single NAF contract.
   8.11.1. To use this alternative, an MOA must be accomplished between the installation and
   AFSVA. The Installation Commander and Comptroller and the AFSVA Commander and
   Comptroller (as the AFMWRF/AFLF Custodian) sign the MOA. It provides the vehicle for
   transferring the APFs to the AFMWRF/AFLF and identifying what the AFMWRF is to do
   with the APFs provided. Once transferred, the APFs become NAFs and they are expended
   using NAF procedures. An MOA template is provided at Attachment 4. Contact HQ
   AFSVA/SVXF for assistance in preparing such an MOA. A similar procedure is available
   for lodging projects under AFMAN 64-302, paragraph 11.13. Contact HQ AFSVA/SVXF
   for more information on this procedure.
 34                                                                    AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


                                            Chapter 9

            PROJECT OVERSIGHT, CLOSE OUT AND POLICY WAIVERS

9.1. AFBCIF Project Status Report (PSR), RCS. HAF-SVX(M)9465. Installation FSS
deputies are responsible for providing a monthly update on the status of each AF centrally
funded NAF project at their installations. The first update is due the month after the DI is issued
and continues until the final invoice is paid. The update is required by the 10th workday of each
month. If no activity has occurred, simply state this in the comments section. The AFSVA
installation projects database on the Services Activities Information System (SAIS) allows
updating the status of AFBCIF and AFLF projects via the internet. While the updates are only
required monthly, installations should update the project data whenever something occurs related
to the project. The format provides not only dates and related information, but contains a
comment feature which allows installations to provide additional information on developments
related to the project. For reporting purposes, this requirement is designated emergency code
C3-“Continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence.” Submit data
requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher
precedence information. Instructions on how to update a project are available at the HQ AFSVA
Community of Practice under SAIS.
9.2. Project Completion and Closeout. Project completion and closeout occur at different
times. Project completion occurs when Services has beneficial occupancy of the facility or
system. Project closeout is when the last invoice is paid. Each phase requires specific action by
the FSS deputy.
   9.2.1. Project Completion. For AFBCIF and AFLF projects, the date the installation
   receives beneficial occupancy of a facility is the date which should go into the “100 percent
   complete” (actual) block in the SAIS. Do not delay reporting the 100 percent complete status
   if there are unpaid bills or punch list items to be done.
       9.2.1.1. Beneficial Occupancy. The beneficial occupancy date is the date the new or
       renovated facility is open for patron use. If the project is not for patron use, the
       beneficial occupancy date is the date the structure is used by employees (i.e., golf
       maintenance facility) or for its intended purpose (i.e., golf irrigation system). The FSS
       deputy takes the following actions based upon the beneficial occupancy date on a NAF
       funded project.
           9.2.1.1.1. Within 5 days after beneficial occupancy, send a memo to the RM, with a
           copy to the NAFFA, providing the beneficial occupancy date and requesting the RM
           take action to move all project costs from GLAC 185XXXX and 1800000,
           Construction in Progress, to the appropriate asset GLAC. The RM has 25 days to
           submit necessary general ledger adjustment forms and fixed asset forms to the
           AFSVA Shared Service Center (SSC) to properly transfer the project from
           construction in progress to the appropriate general ledger accounts.
           9.2.1.1.2. Within 30 days after project completion, the FSS deputy notifies HQ
           AFSVA/SVXF the project is completed by updating the status of the construction to
           100 percent when doing the monthly project update on SAIS. In addition, e-mail a
AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011                                                                          35


           scanned copy of DD Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property,
           to HQ AFSVA/SVXF.
   9.2.2. Financial Close Out: AFBCIF and AFLF project financial close out is accomplished
   when all bills are paid. Once the final invoice is paid, make appropriate annotations to the
   installation projects database indicating “Yes” in the block asking “All Invoices Received
   and Paid.” Put the following words in the comments section: “The final invoice was paid on
   (enter date). Please close this project.” HQ AFSVA/SVXF will close out the project ARA
   account upon receipt of this information.
       9.2.2.1. If final payment is not made within 1 year after beneficial occupancy, AFSVA
       will close the project account. When late invoices are received, notify AFSVA, through
       the MAJCOM, of the purpose and amount of the invoice and request AFSVA reopen the
       account. Provide a copy of the applicable purchase request/order and a copy of the
       invoice. AFSVA will validate the expense is authorized from project funds and, if there
       are adequate funds in the project account, reopen the account for sufficient time to permit
       the installation to process a cash transfer for the amount of the invoice.
9.3. Correction of Discrepancies. AFSVA will consider requests to use any remaining project
funding to correct unknown facility project discrepancies for a period of 1 year from the
beneficial occupancy date, regardless of when the discrepancy was identified, as long as the
items are not covered under warranty. After one year, such discrepancies are the responsibility
of the installation. NAFs are not authorized to correct items which qualify for APF support,
regardless of when they are identified.
9.4. Post Occupancy Facility and Financial Evaluation. AFSVA will perform a post
occupancy facility and financial review of all AF-funded facility projects to determine how well
the project meets the validated need, the effectiveness of the design and construction process,
what changes to the process would improve the project, and if the activity is meeting the PVA
financial projections.
   9.4.1. Facility Evaluation. Between 6-12 months after a major improvement project is
   completed, AFSVA will generate a request for project evaluation to the MAJCOM. The
   request will include a questionnaire dealing with the project’s functional adequacy, its
   compliance with the PVA recommendations, the effectiveness of the design/construction
   process, a recap of patron usage and programs, and a determination of customer reactions and
   satisfaction with the completed facility. Responses are used to improve the planning and
   design of future projects.
   9.4.2. Project Financial Evaluation. For the first 5 full fiscal years after completion of a
   Category C project, AFSVA will compare the financial projections in the PVA to the actual
   operational results achieved by the activity. A recap of the analyses for all projects is
   presented to the Panel annually. The Panel will review the results and provide them, with
   comments/ recommendations, to HQ USAF/A1S for information or action as appropriate.
9.5. Air Force Services Facilities Inventory Report, RCS: HAF-SV(A)9464. This report
lists both APF and NAF FSS facilities at each installation and includes these elements:
MAJCOM, Installation Code, Facility Category Code, Facility Description, Facility Number,
Scope Requirement, Scope Existing (current facility size), Facility Condition Code, Type of
Construction, Control Code, and Facility Completion Date. Annually, HQ AFSVA/SVXF
 36                                                                  AFI34-205 5 JULY 2011


provides a listing of each installation's FSS facilities for verification and updating. The FSS
Deputy submits the annotated report to, HQ AFSVA/SXVF, with a copy to the MAJCOM/A1S,
in accordance with the required suspense date. This report is designated emergency status code
C-3-“continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence.” Submit data
requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher
precedence reports.
9.6. Air Force FSS Long-Range Capital Improvement Planning. Long-range planning is
critical to an effective capital improvement program. Budgeting for NAF capital requirements is
done via the NRB in the Budget and Financial Analysis program. The NRB is the primary
planning document for NAF capital improvements and integrates APF and NAF
programming/budgeting at installation, MAJCOM, and AF level to ensure funds are available
when needed. Effective long-range planning for facility requirements should extend over a
period covering the current year plus at least 5 years to allow a smooth coordinated program to
maintain and improve Services activities.
9.7. Waivers. Requests for actions or waivers relating to the policies in this AFI shall be
coordinated through or originated by the MAJCOM/A1 and sent to AFSVA/CD for action by the
Panel.    The Panel will forward the request to HQ USAF/A1S with comments or
recommendations.

       PROCESS FOR RESOLUTION OF DISAGREEMENT WITH A PROJECT
              VALIDATION ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATION

A2.1. HQ AFSVA/SVXF will work with the PVA contractor to resolve any disagreements
identified in the comments submitted by the installation or MAJCOM. If discussions with the
installation/MAJCOM and contractor fail to resolve disagreements, the installation and
MAJCOM may provide written comments to the Panel for consideration, along with the PVA
recommendations.     The Panel will evaluate all project documentation and provide a
recommendation to HQ USAF/A1S.             The following procedures apply in resolving
disagreements:
   A2.1.1. If the cause for disagreement is technical/engineering specific, HQ AFSVA/SVXF
   will seek resolution from HQ USAF/A7CP.
   A2.1.2. If the cause for disagreement is costing methodology, HQ AFSVA/SVXF will work
   with the PVA contractor and the MAJCOM/installation to resolve the disagreement. If the
   PVA contractor followed the appropriate estimating guidelines for the cost estimating system
   used, and the issue cannot be resolved, the PVA contractor estimate is used in the report with
   a caveat containing the information relative to the MAJCOM/installation estimates. If
   MAJCOM or installation-unique architectural items or requirements cause the cost
   disagreement, the MAJCOM may provide written comments for inclusion with the project
   information to the Panel. The Panel will evaluate all project information and provide a
   recommendation to HQ USAF/A1S.
   A2.1.3. If the disagreement is related to the PVA concept, market research, or financial
   analysis, HQ AFSVA/SVXF will work with the MAJCOM, installation, and contractor to
   resolve the disagreements and ensure the contractor has all relevant information. Should
   discussions with the MAJCOM, installation, and contractor fail to resolve the disagreement
   the MAJCOM and/or installation may provide written comments to the Panel. The Panel
   will evaluate all project information/comments and provide a recommendation to HQ
   USAF/A1S.
   A2.1.4. A PVA is not changed for disagreements relating to opinions on market demand,
   operational concepts, financial projections, or other business-related issues. A PVA is only
   changed for issues conflicting with AF policy, mathematical errors, incorrect/erroneous data
   or information, or significant changes to the installation mission or population which occur
   after the PVA site visit.
