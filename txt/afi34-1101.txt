                                            Chapter 1

               AIR FORCE WARRIOR AND SURVIVOR CARE OVERVIEW

1.1. Introduction. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care encompasses all non-clinical support
to seriously wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families. Air Force Warrior and Survivor
Care (AF/A1SZ) provides policy and oversight for the AFW2 Program, the Recovery
Coordination Program (RCP), the Casualty Services Program and the AFSAP.
1.2. Philosophy. The Air Force has numerous resources to draw upon to assist Airmen who are
seriously wounded, ill or injured. The Air Force team includes active duty, reserve, guard, and
civilian federal employees. Airmen and their families, civilians and private citizens should be
rendered the maximum level of assistance permitted by law.
1.3. Procedural Guidance
     1.3.1. This instruction is the source document for Air Force guidance regarding support to
     wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families. It focuses on information flow to
     families and the integration and harmonization of benefits and assistance.
     1.3.2. This instruction is not intended to replace guidance regarding individual entitlements,
     benefits and services contained in function-specific directives. Commanders and other users
     of this instruction are expected to use this instruction, other source documents and contact
     with functional experts to gain a working understanding of the range of services available to
     them to help those in need.
     1.3.3. Air Force organizations and functional managers responsible for processes which are
     integral to the objectives of Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care program will coordinate
     with AF/A1SZ to ensure this instruction provides current detailed guidance and maintain
     policy in related directives which complement this instruction. These processes include
     wounded, ill and injured care, casualty reporting, mortuary affairs, long term survivor care,
     integrated disability evaluation system, and transition support. AF/A1SZ will ensure this
     instruction is kept current through regular consultation with the interacting functions.
1.4. Use of this Instruction: This instruction provides an overview of services and support that
should be offered to seriously wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families.
     1.4.1. Use of the procedures and assistance strategy described in this instruction does not
     constitute an admission of legal liability for any fatalities or property losses that may have
     been experienced in conjunction with Air Force operations.
     1.4.2. Use of the procedures and support processes described in this instruction is solely
     intended to assure timely, appropriate, and compassionate humanitarian assistance within the
     limits of Federal law.
1.5. Persons Eligible to Receive Information and Assistance Under This Instruction. This
instruction is designed to help commanders anticipate and plan to assist a broad range of
individuals who could require support, or specific benefits and entitlements, and assistance to
wounded, ill and injured personnel, their families and caregivers. The specific directive
appropriate to the entitlement in question must be directly consulted whenever definitive
guidance is required. Information on wounded, ill and injured Airmen should only be shared
outside of the recovery care team members if approval is received from the member. In the case
AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012                                                                           5


where a member is incapacitated and cannot give consent to release of information, consult the
local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) regarding release of such information.
   1.5.1. Next-of-Kin (NOK): ―NOK‖ is the term used to describe the sole person who has a
   specific, legally defined relationship with another person who has become wounded, ill or
   injured.
   1.5.2. Family Members: A working definition of persons who should be considered ―family
   members‖ is essential to the effectiveness of the processes described in this instruction. This
   is a complex issue, particularly in that the Air Force must distinguish between those who
   have unequivocal rights to certain entitlements and the far wider range of individuals with
   legitimate interest in the circumstances surrounding the care and support of a wounded, ill or
   injured Airman. This instruction embodies a broader definition of the concept of family than
   is found in other Air Force publications because it is designed to serve the needs of the entire
   spectrum of persons who are part of the close circle that will assist in the care and recovery
   of the Airman. Therefore, for the purpose of this instruction, “family” is defined as NOK
   and the individuals identified by the Airman as part of their close circle of family and friends.
   1.5.3. Other Individuals: Given the wide range of personal relationships, a commander may
   recognize a greater number of individuals in providing desired information, support or
   services. Examples of such individuals may include fiancées, step parents, foster parents,
   former spouses, etc. Commanders should approach each situation of this type sensitively, but
   only in close consultation with their SJA and ensure that in such cases, first priority is given
   to NOK and family members.

                                            Chapter 2

                  KEY PERSONNEL IN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES

2.1. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care refers to the
program headquartered at AF/A1SZ. This program encompasses all support provided to
seriously wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families. AF/A1SZ provides policy and
oversight for the AFW2 Program, the RCP, the Casualty Services Program, and the AFSAP.
2.2. The Chain of Command of the Wounded, Ill, or Injured. Military operations carry
inherent risks. Commanders have an ongoing obligation to ensure the members under their
command are aware of those risks and manage them responsibly. In turn, members may desire
to keep their families aware of the nature of their duties and the hazards they entail. Support to
wounded, ill or injured Airmen and their families is an inherent obligation of command. By
extension, if persons from outside the unit, including civilians, suffer wounds, illness or injury as
a result of Air Force operations, the chain of command of the unit most closely associated with
the event must ensure support and assistance are rendered to the maximum extent allowable by
law. Wing/installation commanders attempting to fulfill such obligations will be supported by
their parent Major Command (MAJCOM). Should Air Force-level assistance be required (for
logistics, funding, etc), Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care will work with the entire chain of
command to help execute the provisions of this instruction as fully as possible. Specific
responsibilities are as follows:
     2.2.1. MAJCOM Commanders. MAJCOM Commanders must ensure timely, effective care
     and support for the wounded, ill and injured within their MAJCOM.
     2.2.2. The MAJCOM Survivor Assistance Program (SAP) Manager. The MAJCOM SAP
     Manager is responsible for developing and promoting SAP awareness training, assisting
     bases with FLO training, and reporting FLO information in a timely manner. The MAJCOM
     SAP Manager also:
        2.2.2.1. Ensures bases report FLO assignment containing rank, name, unit, DSN,
        commercial and cell phone numbers and e-mail address to Air Force Warrior and
        Survivor Care via the organizational e-mail address at USAFHELP@pentagon.af.mil.
        2.2.2.2. Ensures FLOs for wounded, ill and injured Airmen maintain logs that are sent at
        least weekly to Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care. The FLO Log is a Microsoft Word
        document that includes a date/time entry and a description of the FLO activity for that
        period.
     2.2.3. Wing/Installation Commanders. Wing/Installation Commanders must ensure base-
     wide programs in the military treatment facilities/clinics, personnel services, chaplain
     services, Airmen and Family Readiness Centers, and other base organizations, are unified in
     their support and priority of care for the wounded, ill and injured. Commanders should
     ensure these programs work closely with the Recovery Care Coordinators and Air Force
     Wounded Warrior Care Managers. In addition, Wing/Installation Commanders also:
        2.2.3.1. Ensure all functional managers provide support as prescribed in this and
        referenced instructions.
AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012                                                                       7


       2.2.3.2. Appoint FLOs for all affected families within 24 hours of notification of the
       serious wound, illness or injury. For ANG, assign a FLO from the installations Active
       Guard Reserves (AGRs) or Full-Time Technicians within member’s own squadron, or
       within the appropriate group.
       2.2.3.3. Ensure FLO training is provided in accordance with this instruction as outlined
       in Chapter 5.
       2.2.3.4. Ensure FLO appointments do not adversely affect mission capability or unit
       readiness. Where small units are involved, request augmentation from similar units at
       other bases as necessary (augmentees may be for operational purposes or assigned to
       FLO duty as the situation dictates).
   2.2.4. Unit Commanders. Unit commanders represent the first line of communication for
   families to ensure their needs are addressed as completely as law, directives, and custom
   allow. Unit commanders:
       2.2.4.1. Recommend FLO appointment to the installation commander, briefs the FLO on
       their responsibilities and introduces the FLO to the family.
       2.2.4.2. Keep the installation commander apprised of any issues or problems that arise or
       are referred by the FLO for assistance or resolution.
2.3. The AFW2 Program. The AFW2 Program is located at the Air Force Personnel Center
(AFPC). AFW2 Non-Medical Care Managers provide a wide range of flexible proactive
personnel advocacy and services to support wounded Airmen. These Airmen receive
comprehensive information and guidance on all benefits and entitlements and assistance in
remaining on active duty or transitioning back into the civilian sector. AFW2 Program provides
concentrated services to Airmen who sustained a combat or hostile-related wound, injury or
illness requiring long-term care that may require a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) or Physical
Evaluation Board (PEB) to determine fitness for duty.
2.4. The RCC. The RCC is the key individual in the RCP managed by Air Force Warrior and
Survivor Care. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care assigns an RCC to all seriously injured or
very seriously injured wounded, ill and injured Airmen. The RCC serves as the focal point for
wounded, ill and injured service members, veterans and families to oversee the development and
delivery of services/resources through the Comprehensive Recovery Plan in conjunction with the
Multi-Disciplinary Teams ensuring quality care and accountability. More information about
RCCs will be discussed in Chapter 4.
2.5. The FLO. The FLO is an individual appointed to assist seriously wounded, ill and injured
Airmen and their families. FLOs are responsible for logistical support to the member and his or
her family, such as meeting family members at the airport and arranging lodging and
transportation. FLOs also serve as a ―facilitator‖ by assisting the Airman and his or her family
navigate the various agencies involved in recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration.
2.6. The Airmen and Family Readiness Center (A&FRC). Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-
3009, Airmen and Family Readiness Center Program, outlines the A&FRC Program’s mission
and responsibilities. A&FRCs are a key resource in providing a wide range of support to
families and wounded, ill, and injured members. A&FRC staffs represent consistent sources of
corporate knowledge about their base and local communities which assist FLO whenever
 8                                                                  AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012


needed. ANG Airman and Family Readiness Program Managers provide services support,
information and referral to members and families within the National Guard.
2.7. Military Chaplains and Chaplain Assistants. Responsibilities of chaplains and chaplain
assistants as they relate to Warrior and Survivor Care are covered in AFI 52-101, Planning and
Organizing, and AFI 52-104, Chaplain Service Readiness. Chaplains are instrumental in the
support of other agencies care to wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families, such as
death notification.
2.8. Other Service Providers. No single agency can meet the complex needs of families when
an Airman becomes wounded, ill or injured. However, such situations can be anticipated and
provided for in advance if partnerships and formal relationships with potential supplemental
sources of support are forged before a crisis develops. Various sources of augmentation,
information and outreach are available to aid affected families, communities and others who
potentially may require information and assistance beyond the resources of the Air Force.
     2.8.1. Where statutory relationships and responsibilities for support and information do not
     exist, Headquarters (HQ) United States Air Force (USAF), MAJCOMs, and local
     commanders and A&FRC advisors are to develop appropriate contacts and formal
     relationships as necessary to arrange, validate, and exercise these capabilities. (National,
     private or quasi-official organizations will only be contacted by HQ USAF for this purpose.)
     However, all such agreements must include specific service tracking and accounting
     procedures, along with detailed reimbursement plans. Examples of such agencies include:
        2.8.1.1. The American Red Cross (ARC). The ARC has a long history of service to
        military members in times of need. It assists the Armed Forces in programs related to
        health, welfare, recreation, and morale of military personnel and their families. In
        keeping with the 1905 Act of Congress, the Red Cross provides emergency
        communications services, humanitarian relief, and other social services to members of
        the Armed Forces and their family members, in peace or war, within or outside the
        territorial limits of the United States. Our relationships are defined through AFPD 36-31,
        Personal Affairs.
        2.8.1.2. The Air Force Aid Society (AFAS). The AFAS is the official charity of the Air
        Force. Its activities are managed at base level by the A&FRC, and it works closely with
        the ARC.
        2.8.1.3. Private Organizations.    Recent years have seen the growth of private
        organizations, such as the ―Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors‖; ―Family Service
        America‖ (for general social service information), America Supports You (for wounded
        in action members), and others. All are geared toward providing or locating counseling
        and mutual support resources. While the Department of the Air Force may not endorse
        organizations which are not specifically provided for by statute (such as the ARC),
        commanders will facilitate any family requests to be put in contact with such
        organizations.

                                          Chapter 3

                                  THE AFW2 PROGRAM

3.1. Introduction. The Air Force will provide the same level of loyalty and commitment in the
care of those combat or hostile-related wounded, ill and injured Airmen as it does in preparing
them for deployment and combat. When disabled as the result of a combat hostile-related illness
or injury, the Air Force will ensure they receive personalized service and assistance via the
AFW2 Program.
3.2. AFW2 Program Strategic Statement. Provide personalized support to combat or hostile-
related wounded Airmen and their families, regardless of their location or military status. A
phased continuum of care is used to address their needs and assist with a range of personnel,
benefits and entitlements, financial and employment services, policy and guidance and connect
member with federal, state and local resources and other DoD programs.
   3.2.1. The program fully supports the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) initiatives to
   retain wounded warriors on active duty or if found unfit for military service, will assist the
   wounded warrior in navigating through their transition/integration into the civilian
   community, ensure warm hand offs to outside agencies and foster resilience, independence
   and stability. The program manages the wounded warrior website, publishes a news bulletin
   and manages the outreach and event coordination process for wounded warriors.
3.3. Background Information and AFW2 Program Definition:
   3.3.1. The AFW2 Program was implemented in support of the OSD initiative to ensure that
   all combat or hostile-related, medically separated members of the DoD receive
   comprehensive information and guidance on all benefits and entitlements, and that each
   service component develop procedures to assist wounded warriors in remaining on active
   duty or transitioning back into the civilian sector.
   3.3.2. The definition of a wounded warrior is any Airman who has a combat or hostile-
   related injury or illness that may require long-term care or a Medical or PEB to determine
   fitness for duty. This includes a combat or hostile-related injury or illness resulting from
   hazardous service or performance of duty under conditions simulating war or through an
   instrumentality of war.
3.4. Concept of Operations:
   3.4.1. The AFW2 program is located at AFPC under the operational control of the AFPC/CC
   who provides oversight, guidance and ensures sufficient resources are available to execute
   the AFW2 Program. AFPC provides a wide range of flexible, proactive personnel services to
   support our wounded ill or injured Airmen. The AFW2 program is an integral part of the
   recovery team and executes the non-medical care manager (NMCM) duties and services
   mandated in DoDI 1300.24 for wounded warriors, families and caregivers before, during and
   after relocation.
       3.4.1.1. The benchmark number of cases assigned to each AFW2 NMCM, at a
       maximum, is 40 in accordance with DoDI 1300.24. The number of cases assigned to
       each AFW2 manager will be closely monitored to ensure appropriate assistance can
       continue to be provided to each Airman.
 10                                                                   AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012


       3.4.1.1.1. It is vital that AFW2 Program leadership monitor the level of service each
       case requires and ensure a tiered approach of service delivery. Level of service and not
       case loads should be used to validate the benchmark. For example: where one case may
       require a significant level of service, other cases may be in the sustainment phase and
       require only periodic review and follow-up.
       3.4.1.2. Coordinates AFW2 Program operational guidance, policies and procedures
       affecting wounded, ill and injured Airmen and keeps leadership advised on program
       variances.
       3.4.1.3. Provides program data, metrics, reports and briefings to key leadership as
       required.
   3.4.2. When the AFW2 Program, initially becomes aware of, or identifies, a Wounded
   Warrior, a NMCM is assigned.
       3.4.2.1. There are three ways in which an Airman is identified and subsequently
       classified as an AFW2. In all three methods, the Reporting Identifier (RI) of 9W200
       (enlisted) / 92W2 (officer) is awarded and recorded in the member’s record in the
       Personnel Data System (PDS) as the secondary or tertiary AFSC for tracking purposes.
          3.4.2.1.1. Wounded Warrior identified upon medical evacuation.
          3.4.2.1.2. Wounded Warrior identified externally to AFW2 Program; no medical
          evacuation and no MEB.
          3.4.2.1.3. Wounded Warrior identified via MEB/PEB or Integrated Disability
          Evaluation System (IDES).

     evaluation completed. If there are enough days of supervision for an Enlisted
     Performance Report (EPR)/Officer Performance Report (OPR) to be accomplished prior
     to identification as a Wounded Warrior, an EPR/OPR will be accomplished with a
     closeout date one day prior to identification as a Wounded Warrior.
     3.5.5.3. The LOE will contain a mandatory comment ―Member under the Wounded
     Warrior Program.‖ If the AFW2 has performed duties or served in ways that go beyond
     the self-care expected of a patient, comments will be entered to address that performance.
     3.5.5.4. These LOEs will be signed by the individual’s unit/squadron commander.

                                           THE RCP

4.1. Overview. The RCP is mandated by law under the 2008 National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) and through DoDI 1300.24. Its intent is for the military services to adequately
support recovering service members (RSMs).
4.2. Scope of the Program. The RCP was designed to address reforms to existing care
managements processes within the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA). It improves the uniformity and effectiveness of care, management and transition
across the Military Departments, as well as transfers to VA Medical Centers, Polytrauma
Rehabilitation Centers and civilian providers, through the use of standardized policies, processes,
personnel programs and tools.
4.3. Responsibility for Execution of the Program. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care
(AF/A1SZ) will work in concert with the Surgeon General of the Air Force (AF/SG) to ensure
seamless support to the RSM. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care will manage the Recovery
Coordination Program and all non-medical support to recovering Airmen. Medical support to
recovering Airmen will be delivered by AF/SG.
4.4. Program Elements. The four cornerstones of the RCP are: (1) the Recovery Team, (2) the
RCC, (3) the Comprehensive Recovery Plan (CRP), and (4) the National Resource Directory
(NRD).
   4.4.1. The Recovery Team is composed of the medical and non-medical personnel providing
   care, services and resources to the RSM and family at any point in the recovery,
   rehabilitation and reintegration phases of care. The key individual is the RCC, but other
   individuals will include, at a minimum, a Medical Care Case Manager (MCCM) and a Non-
   Medical Care Manager (NMCM). A Federal Recovery Coordinator (FRC) may also be
   assigned to Airmen with catastrophic wounds, injuries or illness.
   4.4.2. The RCC is the individual assigned by the Air Force to serve as an independent
   advocate for recovering Airmen whose duties include overseeing and assisting the recovering
   Airman as they process through the entire spectrum of care, management, transition and
   rehabilitation. More information about Recovery Care Coordinators will be discussed later
   in this chapter.
   4.4.3. The CRP will be developed by the RCC in conjunction with the entire Recovery
   Team. It will begin with a medical and non-medical needs assessment, set goals and create
   action steps based on the needs and desires of the recovering Airman and family. The CRP
   will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.
   4.4.4. The NRD is an online tool for wounded, ill and injured Service Members, Veterans,
   their families and those who support them. It will be discussed in more detail in section 5.9.
4.5. The Coordination Process. The care, management and transition coordination process is
composed of 10 uniform steps for support that are executed through the above four cornerstones
of the RCP. They are:
16                                                                  AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012


  4.5.1. Screening. Airmen are screened for medical and psychological needs upon initial
  presentation to a medical care provider in accordance with standard medical practice. For
  those Airmen who are Seriously Ill/Injured (SI), Very Seriously Ill/Injured (VSI), suffer a
  combat related injury or illness, or are unlikely to return to duty within 180 days, Air Force
  Warrior and Survivor Care will initiate the member into its RCP and appoint a RCC.
  Individuals may also self-refer or be referred by their command, their medical care provider
  or Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care for additional screening and assessment.
  4.5.2. Assigning. The uniform methodology for assigning a member to the RCP uses
  information obtained from the medical or psychological screening as described above.
     4.5.2.1. Service members who are determined to be not seriously wounded, ill or injured
     (NSI) will receive primarily outpatient and specialized inpatient medical treatment and
     rehabilitation. They are supported by their unit commands with appropriate medical and
     non-medical care management and are not assigned to the RCP unless a long-term
     situation requiring oversight by an RCC develops.
     4.5.2.2. All SI and VSI recovering Airmen will be enrolled into Air Force Warrior and
     Survivor Care’s RCP and assigned an RCC.
  4.5.3. Coordinating. Once the Airman is enrolled into the RCP, a Recovery Team will be
  assigned. At a minimum, the Recovery Team will include an RCC, a MCCM and a NMCM.
  Catastrophically wounded, ill or injured Airmen will also be appointed a FRC who is
  employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
     4.5.3.1. Additional members of the Recovery Team may include: medical professionals
     such as primary care managers, physical therapists, occupational therapists; Physical
     Evaluation Board Liaison Officers; unit commanders; Chaplains; and others as
     applicable.
  4.5.4. Assessing. After enrollment in the Air Force’s RCP, additional information on the
  medical and non-medical needs of the recovering Airman and family will be collected.
  Medical needs will be collected by military care providers while non-medical needs will be
  collected through multiple sources but overseen by the RCC.
  4.5.5. Planning. In this phase, SI and VSI Airmen receive an individual CRP personalized
  based on medical and non-medical input from the Airman and family. More information on
  the CRP is found later in this chapter.
  4.5.6. Supporting. Support for a recovering Airman ranges from initial support provided to a
  seriously wounded, ill or injured Airman by a FLO to long-range support provided by
  A&FRC and the AFW2.
  4.5.7. Evaluating. This step in the process refers to when a recovering Airman is referred to
  the Disability Evaluation System.
  4.5.8. Processing. This step in the process refers to an Airman’s return to duty, if possible.
  4.5.9. Transitioning. Transition support will be provided to a recovering Airman and their
  family before, during and after relocation from one treatment or rehabilitation facility to
  another or from one care provider to another. Logistical support will be provided by the
  appointed FLO and ongoing non-medical support will be provided by the RCC.
AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012                                                                         17


   4.5.10. Reviewing. Satisfaction with medical care will be accomplished by AF/SG in
   accordance with existing medical assessment tools. Evaluation of the RCP will be reported
   annually, no later than December of each year, to OSD; the evaluation methodology has not
   yet been determined.
4.6. RCCs. The RCC serves as an independent advocate for wounded, ill and injured airmen.
The ultimate purpose of the RCC is to ensure that recovering Airmen and families understand the
likely path of the member’s recovery, the types of care and services that will be needed and
provided, and how much time recovery may take. RCCs oversee the development and
implementation of the CRP and work with MCCM involved in various aspects of care for the
recovering Airman and advocate for the Airman across locations and agencies.
   4.6.1. The duties and responsibilities of the RCC are as follows:
       4.6.1.1. Ensure that recovering Airmen and families have access to all medical and non-
       medical services throughout the duration of their recovery, rehabilitation and
       reintegration.
       4.6.1.2. Minimize delays and gaps in treatment and services.
       4.6.1.3. Ensure the development, implementation and oversight of the CRP.
       4.6.1.4. Monitor the execution of services across the continuum of care as documented in
       the CRP.
       4.6.1.5. Remain as the ultimate point of contact across the care continuum. The AFW2
       Care Managers and FLOs will coordinate all activities with the assigned RCC.
       4.6.1.6. Facilitate an efficient, effective and smooth rehabilitation and transition back to
       active duty or civilian life working cooperatively across geography and agency
       proponency for care or benefits. Responsibilities continue through:
       4.6.1.7. The recovering Airman’s transfers between and among medical or other
       treatment facilities.
       4.6.1.8. The recovering Airman’s discharge from medical facilities.
       4.6.1.9. The recovering Airman’s retirement or separation from military service.
       4.6.1.10. Monitor the CRP and regularly make modifications in conjunction with the
       multiple, multi-disciplinary teams that will be formed around the service needs of the
       recovering Airman. Changes in services will be based on transitions between fixed and
       non-fixed facilities and changes in family support requirements.
       4.6.1.11. Engage the multiple, multi-disciplinary teams to develop specific plans to
       remove barriers to improve the delivery of care and improve outcomes for the recovering
       Airman and family.
       4.6.1.12. Coordinate the assessment of the CRP’s implementation and ensure adherence
       to its goals and objectives.
       4.6.1.13. Coordinate with the entire Recovery Team to resolve medical and non-medical
       issues. Examples of non-medical issues include administrative and personnel paperwork,
       benefits and compensation, finances, housing, transportation and overall quality of life.
 18                                                                AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012


   4.6.2. Workload. The benchmark number of recovering service members an RCC will be
   assigned to serve, at a maximum, is 40, in accordance with DoDI 1300.24. However, the
   actual number assigned will depend on the acuity of the RSM’s medical condition and the
   complexity of non-medical needs. Level of effort, not case load, should be used to validate
   the benchmark. The number of cases assigned to each RCC will be closely monitored. The
   benchmark will be reviewed as part of the overall RCP.
   4.6.3. Supervision. Supervisors of RCCs will ensure execution of the uniform roles and
   responsibilities throughout the RCP. Supervisors of RCCs shall be military officers in the
   grade of O-5 or O-6, or civilian employees in the grade of GS-14 or higher. The supervisors
   shall have the authority needed to make personnel decisions and address barriers that may be
   encountered. Occupational specialty for persons appointed to supervise RCCs is at the
   discretion of AF/A1SZ.
   4.6.4. Training. All RCCs shall complete uniform, core training prior to independently
   assuming the duties of their position. Training will be provided and tracked under guidance
   from AF/A1SZ. In addition, all RCCs will complete specialized training on the detection of
   early warning signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, suicidal or homicidal thoughts or
   behaviors and other behavioral health concerns among RSMs.
4.7. Other Members of the Recovery Team:
   4.7.1. The MCCM, also known as Clinical Case Manager, is a licensed healthcare
   professional who helps the recovering Airman and family to understand the medical
   conditions and treatment regimes recommended by various providers. AF/SG is develops
   guidance on roles and responsibilities of the MCCM as it relates to this instruction.
   4.7.2. NMCM’s are non-medical staff with in-depth knowledge of military and Department
   of Veteran’s Affairs processes relating to military and veterans’ benefits and entitlements.
   They work closely with RCCs to connect recovering Airmen and families with resources and
   services to solve problems that are non-medical in nature throughout the continuum of care.
   4.7.3. FRC’s are experienced and highly trained social workers or nurses who are employed
   by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and perform their duties under VA supervision.
   FRCs are assigned to catastrophically wounded, ill or injured recovering service members.
   They work with existing case managers involved in discrete aspects of care for the
   recovering service member (RSM) and advocate for the RSM across systems.
4.8. The CRP. The CRP will be developed by the RCC in conjunction with the entire Recovery
Team. Information on procedures, format and content of the CRP are as follows:
   4.8.1. Procedures. The CRP will begin with a medical and non-medical needs assessment,
   set goals and create action steps based on the needs and desires of the recovering Airman and
   family.
      4.8.1.1. Medical and Non-Medical Needs Assessment. The MCCM and NMCM
      members of the Recovery Team ensure that a medical and non-medical needs assessment
      has been completed for a recovering service member. The information is recorded and
      serves as a baseline for the goal development process in the CRP. The RCC meets with
      the recovering Airman and family to identify needs and develop a plan to address those
      needs.
AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012                                                                        19


       4.8.1.2. Goal-Setting. The RCC will work with the entire Recovery Team, the
       recovering Airman and family to set goals consistent with the member’s needs and
       medical condition. Goals will be prioritized and contain specific action steps.
       4.8.1.3. Creating Action Steps. Action steps will be created in coordination with the
       recovering Airman, family and Recovery Team. Action steps must be specific,
       measurable and achievable within an agreed upon time frame. In addition, each action
       step must include a lead point of contact for each step, support and resources available to
       the recovering Airman and family, and location of the support and resources.
       4.8.1.4. Accepting the Plan. The recovering Airman, family, RCC and other members of
       the Recovery Team will review and agree upon the goals and action steps included in the
       CRP. All members will sign the document demonstrating their understanding of the CRP
       and their commitment to its implementation. Finally, a hard copy will be provided to the
       recovering Airman and family (when appropriate) upon completion.
       4.8.1.5. Reviewing. The RCC will review the CRP with the recovering Airman and
       family as frequently as necessary based on the individual needs of the recovering Airman
       and family. The CRP will be re-evaluated and updated before transition phases in a
       recovering Airman’s care, such as change in location, family status, financial status, etc.
       A new hard copy will be provided to the recovering Airman and family whenever
       changes are made to the document.
       4.8.1.6. Closing out the CRP. A CRP may be closed out when the recovering Airman
       has met all goals or declines any further support. All documents will be kept is
       accordance with the appropriate records disposition schedule.
   4.8.2. Format and Content. The CRP will be entered into the Recovery Care Plan – Support
   Solution (RCP-SS) and maintained electronically. The RCP-SS is an OSD level computer
   program that provides greater security, continuity and management capabilities than the
   paper version. Future development of the Air Force Wounded, Ill and Injured Care
   Management System (AFWIICMS) will provide additional records capability and RCCs and
   AFW2 personnel will be required to update and maintain records in this system.
   AFWIICMS (when fielded) will provide superior records management and reports
   capabilities, but will not provide for the CRP records. Therefore, both RCP-SS and
   AFWIICMS will be used to maintain the case records.
4.9. The National Resource Directory (NRD). The NRD is an online tool for wounded, ill and
injured Service Members, Veterans, their families and those who support them. It provides
access to more than 11,000 services and resources at the national and state level that support
recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. Maintained by the Departments of
Defense, Labor and Veterans Affairs, the NRD links to federal, state and government agencies;
Veterans service and benefit organizations; non-profit and community-based organizations;
academic institutions; and professional associations who provide assistance to wounded warriors
and their families. The NRD is a valuable tool for Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care and
RCCs to assist recovering Airmen.

                                          Chapter 5

                THE AIR FORCE SURVIVOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

5.1. Overview. The AFSAP is designed to marshal all available resources in support of family
needs when an Airman becomes seriously wounded, ill or injured, or when an Airman dies while
on active duty. At the same time, the AFSAP also provides a systematic structure through which
offers of assistance, information and support are made available on the family’s terms. Families
have different needs, so each case must be considered and handled on an individual basis.
5.2. The FLO. The FLO is the keystone of the AFSAP. FLOs are appointed to assist seriously
wounded, ill and injured Airmen and their families and the families of Airmen who die while on
active duty. FLOs help families of wounded, ill and injured Airmen navigate the various
agencies involved in recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration. FLOs remain engaged as long as
the family needs assistance. For additional information regarding FLOs for the families of the
fallen, reference AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program.
5.3. When to Appoint a FLO for Wounded, Ill and Injured.
   5.3.1. Commanders must appoint a FLO in the following circumstances:
       5.3.1.1. To seriously wounded, ill or injured Airmen who are away from their home unit.
       5.3.1.2. To all medically evacuated, wounded in action Airmen at each treatment
       location until they return to their home unit.
   5.3.2. Commanders may also appoint a FLO in the following circumstances:
       5.3.2.1. Any time a FLO’s support and assistance is in the best interests of the Air Force
       team member, their family, the unit or the mission.
5.4. Selecting a FLO. Selecting a FLO should be based on both objective and subjective
criteria. The overarching consideration for selecting a FLO should be on the basis of the
individual’s capacity to assist an Airman or family in need. Guidelines for FLO selection
include:
   5.4.1. The seriously wounded, ill or injured Airman or family’s request and preference.
   5.4.2. The potential FLO’s rank or civilian grade. FLOs should hold the military rank of E-7
   or higher and civilians should be GS-9 or higher.
       5.4.2.1. A lower ranking individual may only be appointed when the commander is
       confident of the individual’s maturity and abilities.
   5.4.3. The unit’s mission and composition, and the potential FLO’s frequency of
   deployments or off-station TDYs.
   5.4.4. The potential FLO’s career field; whenever possible, the FLO should hold the same
   AFSC and type of job as the seriously wounded, ill, or injured Airman.
   5.4.5. Only volunteers should serve as FLOs, however, FLOs will be appointed if sufficient
   volunteers cannot be found.
   5.4.6. Commanders and First Sergeants should not serve as FLOs as their responsibility is to
   the unit as a whole.
AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012                                                                         21


   5.4.7. Potential FLOs should be able to be released from regular job duties in order to
   perform FLO duties full-time. FLOs often assist Airmen and families outside the normal
   duty day and as such, should be able to make the appropriate time commitment.
5.5. Training Requirements. Training is divided into two categories; AFSAP Awareness
training and FLO training. All training will be conducted in accordance with this instruction as
follows:
   5.5.1. Prospective wing and group commanders receive AFSAP Awareness training from the
   Ira C. Eaker College for Professional Development prior to taking command; MAJCOMs
   supplement that training as needed. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care prepares course
   content and provides trainers.
   5.5.2. AFSAP Awareness training for unit/squadron commanders is conducted by
   MAJCOMs in conjunction with other training conducted prior to taking command.
   (Exception: ARC Commanders may receive training after taking command).
   5.5.3. Force Support Squadrons will facilitate annual AFSAP Awareness training for wing,
   group and squadron commanders, First Sergeants and other responsible individuals.
       5.5.3.1. Each unit on the installation and in the geographic area of the installation must
       have an individual in a leadership or supervisory position in the military grade of E-7 or
       GS-9 or higher, trained or retrained annually.
       5.5.3.2. Force Support Squadrons should offer AFSAP Awareness training at least twice
       annually to reach the widest possible audience.
       5.5.3.3. Initial AFSAP Awareness training must be classroom or lecture format but
       refresher training may be completed via the computer based training method of
       instruction.
   5.5.4. FLOs receive ―just-in-time‖ training.
       5.5.4.1. For seriously ill or injured Airmen who are being treated away from their home
       station, or wounded, ill or injured Airmen medically evacuated from a theater of
       operations, the AFSAP will notify the MAJCOM who will in turn advise the Force
       Support Squadron at the installation nearest to or owning the treatment locale to appoint a
       FLO, conduct the training and arrange additional training from other support agencies.
5.6. Content of Training. Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care and the Ira C. Eaker College
for Professional Development develop appropriate modules for wing and group commander
training. MAJCOMs, in conjunction with Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care and the Air
Force Mortuary Affairs Operations Center (AFMAO), develop lesson plans for awareness
training and FLO training. It is important that awareness training include all aspects of Air Force
Warrior and Survivor Care. All formal training and self-study in the provisions of this
instruction should emphasize three themes: 1) Timely and compassionate information flow; 2)
Information about the benefits and support activities available to wounded, ill and injured
Airmen and the families of those who have died; and 3) Any other information the Airman or
family considers important.
5.7. Duties and Responsibilities of the FLO. FLOs must understand the nature of the expertise
that the various functional specialists can bring to families without trying to become experts
themselves and to seek out the right experts for thorough answers to any specific questions
 22                                                                AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012


families might raise or assistance they might need. A sample FLO Checklist can be found at
Attachment 3.
   5.7.1. Below is a non-inclusive listing of common duties and responsibilities of a FLO:
      5.7.1.1. Maintain logs that are sent at least weekly to Air Force Warrior and Survivor
      Care. Frequency will depend on the complexity of the wounded, ill or injured Airman’s
      situation.
      5.7.1.2. Familiarize oneself with the patient’s FLOs at other treatment locations (to
      ensure successful hand-off), members of the Recovery Team to include medical liaisons,
      RCC, AFW2 Care Manager (for combat related illness or injury) and other personnel
      such as the hospital social worker and leadership at the member’s home unit.
      5.7.1.3. Meet the Airman and family members at the medical evacuation arrival location
      or civilian airport.
      5.7.1.4. Assist the family in securing lodging and transportation.
      5.7.1.5. Assist the family in arranging childcare.
      5.7.1.6. Assist the family in arranging other services such as housekeeping or
      coordinating meals.
      5.7.1.7. Assist the Airman and family in coordinating any entitlements, special pay or
      benefits available to them by ensuring they are connected with the appropriate agencies.
   5.7.2. FLOs should not be responsible for personally performing the following types of
   assistance:
      5.7.2.1. Grief, bereavement or other types of counseling. Rather, the FLO should alert
      the appropriate agency that such care is needed.
      5.7.2.2. Housekeeping, cleaning, babysitting, cooking or other household chores. The
      FLO should coordinate assistance from unit volunteers or support agencies to meet these
      needs.
      5.7.2.3. Personal or medical services such as helping the wounded, ill or injured Airman
      dress, wash or change bandages.
      5.7.2.4. Provide transportation in their privately owned vehicles other than meeting the
      Airman or family member at the airport or infrequent trips to military offices. If
      transportation becomes a recurrent issue, address this need with the appropriate helping
      agency.
AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012                                                                    23


5.8. When the FLO Should Seek Assistance. The FLO is not expected to be the expert, but
rather to help the Airman and family navigate the various agencies involved during a difficult
time. There are numerous situations that may arise that the FLO is not able to adequately
address. For example, the FLO may not be able to ascertain the appropriate agency responsible
for providing entitlements or benefits; the needs of the Airman or family become too great to
address without assistance; or unforeseen situations arise which prevent the FLO from
adequately continuing their duties and responsibilities. In such cases, the FLO should contact
their commander, or Air Force Warrior and Survivor Care for guidance.

Terms
Air Force Survivor Assistance Program (AFSAP)— designed to marshal all available
resources in support of family needs when an Airman becomes seriously wounded, ill or injured,
or when an Airman dies while on active duty. AFSAP also provides a systematic structure
through which offers of assistance, information and support are made available on the family’s
terms. Families have different needs, so each case must be considered and handled on an
individual basis.
Air Force Wounded Warrior (AFW2)— an Airman that has a combat-related injury or illness
requiring long-term care that will require an MEB and PEB to determine fitness for duty
Airman/Airmen— As used in this document refers to uniformed members of the active Air
Force, Air National Guard, AF Reserves, and those individuals who are retired or medically
separated due to an illness or injury incurred or exacerbated while serving in any component of
the USAF.
Family Liaison Officer (FLO)— FLOs are appointed to assist seriously wounded, ill and
injured Airmen and their families and the families of Airmen who die while on active duty.
FLOs help families of wounded, ill and injured Airmen navigate the various agencies involved in
recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration. In the case of Airmen who die while on active duty,
AFI34-1101 21 JUNE 2012                                                                   27


FLOs may assist the family with navigating the various organizations necessary to receive
entitlements and benefits. FLOs remain engaged as long as the family needs assistance.
Recovery Care Coordinator (RCC)— The ultimate purpose of the RCC is to ensure that
recovering Airmen and families understand the likely path of the member’s recovery, the types
of care and services that will be needed and provided, and how much time recovery may take.
RCCs oversee the development and implementation of the CRP and work with the MCCM
involved in various aspects of care for the recovering Airman and advocate for the Airman
across locations and agencies.

Make contact with the overseas FLO, if applicable, and obtain the status of the member.
Talk to the member if possible and obtain any background information you may need.

Be sure you introduce yourself to the Air Force Patient Liaison and Recovery Care
Coordinator assigned to the medical facility and to the member’s attending physician
and social worker. Explain your role as a FLO and let them know to contact you for
any issues that need to be resolved.

Check arrival time of the member to medical facility; make arrangements to meet the
member when they arrive, if possible.

Check the travel status of family members; make arrangements to provide
transportation from the airport to their accommodations as needed.

Check lodging requirements for family members; make reservations as needed (Try the
Fisher House if there is one located at the member’s destination medical treatment
facility). Check with Air Force Liaison for alternate lodging options if needed.

Check with the local Air Force Casualty office on the status of Emergency Family
Member Travel Orders (EFMTs). Be sure the casualty office is aware of the member’s
arrival times and the travel plans of family members. Provide family contact
information to the Casualty Office as needed. The toll-free number to Air Force
Casualty is 800-433-0048.

Check with the family members to find out if they have any special circumstances that
may require special accommodations

If the family has children between the ages of 4wks - 12 years who require child care,
contact the Family Member Programs Flight Chief (Airman and Family Services Flight
Chief). Remind families to bring a copy of the child's most recent shot records, and any
special needs information that would help the program provide the best care for their
child (IEP, IDP, dietary restrictions, etc).

see their loved one. (High costs, traffic, and parking costs in Washington DC, for
example).

Verify the Casualty office explained the reimbursements allowed to family members.

Meet the member when they arrive, if possible. After your first meeting, send a report
to USAFHelp@pentagon.af.mil. Indicate the member’s condition, any questions he or
she has that are unanswered, requests the member made, general attitude, and any other
information you deem necessary. There are no small issues so be sure to listen
attentively and pass along what you hear.

If the member meets the criteria for being medically evacuated from the AOR, ensure
he/she has received the $250 clothing allowance authorized by the 2005 NDAA.

Make arrangements to get family members to the hospital and get them in touch with
the hospital social worker (available in all major military hospitals).

Ensure the family is aware of places to eat in the local area, both on and off base. Have
a map available, if possible, and phone numbers for local restaurants. Ensure
member/family received patient handbook from AF Patient liaison. This handbook has
pertinent information and guidance for member and family while staying at Walter
Reed or Bethesda medical centers, if applicable.

Serve as a liaison between the member and family and the Casualty Affairs Office,
Hospital and any other agencies that support the member.

Contact the member’s home unit and provide a progress report. If the member needs
any assistance from the home unit, be sure to pass that information along.

If the wounded member agrees, obtain authorization by consent letter to notify
members of Congress of hospitalization of a Wounded Airman. *This may have
already been accomplished on night of arrival by Air Force Patient Liaison. Note: See
attachment 5C Privacy Act consent letter. Fax letter to 703-604-0323 or DSN 664-
0323. This should be done as soon as practical.

If the member has a traumatic injury, check with the casualty office on the applicability
of TSGLI; the casualty office will have the qualifying injuries for this benefit and
should be able to guide you. One of your main concerns as a FLO is ensuring the
member and family are in contact with the right offices for benefits. The Air Force
Patient Liaison will facilitate the completion of the application for TSGLI by member
and physician and will send completed application and copy of records to AFPC for
processing. All service members to include Air National guard and AF Reserves who

are covered under SGLI are automatically covered under TSGLI and may qualify for
payment based on a qualifying loss.

Find out if the family needs cash. If so, arrange with the local finance office (Bolling
AFB) to provide a cash advance once EFMT orders are available. Take the family
members to the finance office for the cash advance.

If the member is being treated on a military installation, check the requirements for the
family to drive their POV on the installation and assist in getting them the required
authorization.

Ensure the member and/or family is aware of pay and entitlements for wounded
warriors. Here is a link to a printable handbook:
http://www.dfas.mil/army2/woundedinaction/WWEHandbook_Web_062607.pdf

Ensure the member and/or family is aware of pay and entitlements available for
wounded ANG members who incur or aggrevate an injury, illness, or disease or who
demonstrate a loss of earned income, due to a condition incurred or aggrevated IAW
AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination, as provided in ANGI 36-3001,
Air National Guard Incapacitation Benefits.

Contact the Air Force Wounded Warrior representative assigned to the case and pass
among any information needed along with obtaining benefits information for the
wounded member.

For wounded warriors at Walter Reed National Medical Center or Brooke Army
Medical Center, please be sure they are aware of the Wounded Warrior Clothing
Support Program. Nurse case managers can complete the request to have uniforms
modified.

There are many organizations that assist the wounded. Most Military Treatment
Facilities have an office that is aware of these organizations and what benefits they
offer. Walter Reed, for example, has the Medical Family Assistance Office. The social
worker assigned to the service member should be able to guide you to resources. There
are also several web sites that can assist with finding benefits information. First-Gov
provides a list of many agencies that deal with available benefits:
