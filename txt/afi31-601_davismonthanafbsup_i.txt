SUMMARY OF CHANGES

 This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access to
classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the DD
Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors
Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring
contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated information systems
(AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and eliminating the requirement
to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report. (NOTE: As used in this
publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it negate the “security and
policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. The term
"sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified contract that
has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security
Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | )

      report in the visitor group’s files for 2 years.
      1.8.1.4. The ISPM is responsible for notifying other AF activities, e.g., contracting
      office, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), when appropriate.
   1.8.2. Reporting Security Violations.
      1.8.2.1. A designated on-base “cleared facility” reports the loss, compromise, suspected
      compromise or other security violations pursuant to the NISPOM through the ISPM, who
      in-turn is responsible for notifying the CSO.
      1.8.2.2. On-base integrated visitor groups report such incidents and/or information in
      accordance with AFI 31-401 to the ISPM via the AF activity security manager. This
      reporting requirement must be specified in the VGSA, if applicable. The commander of
      the AF activity being supported appoints an assigned federal employee (military or
      civilian) to conduct the preliminary inquiry in accordance with AFI 31-401, Chapter 9.
      1.8.2.3. The CSO and ISPM report significant contractor security violations and
      compromises (resulting in actual loss or compromise) of classified information to the

                                          Chapter 2

                                 SECURITY CLEARANCES

2.1. Facility Security Clearances (FCLs).
   2.1.1. Sponsoring FCLs. The contracting office (CO) is responsible for Facility Security
   Clearance (FCL) sponsorship. Defense Security Service is the authorizing agent for the FCL.
   DSS establishes and maintains all FCLs within the NISP. Also see DOD 5220.22-M, DOD
   5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security, and AFI 31-501,
   Personnel Security Program Management.
       2.1.1.1. To request an FCL sponsorship, write to the CSO with oversight responsibility
       for the sponsored facility.
       2.1.1.2. Give the full name for the sponsored facility, its physical and mailing address,
       telephone number, and a specific point of contact at the facility, when known. Give the
       full name, job title, and direct-dial telephone number of the Air Force sponsor.
       2.1.1.3. Establishing final FCLs through DSS may take several months. When
       circumstances do not permit such delays, sponsors may request an interim FCL through
       DSS.
   2.1.2. Sponsoring Interim FCLs. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential
   and Secret FCLs for interim clearances when possible. However, Air Force sponsorship of
   interim Top Secret FCLs must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD
   5220.22-R. To request a Top Secret interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships
   through command channels to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each
   request must include these items:
       2.1.2.1. An explanation of why an interim Top Secret FCL would prevent a crucial delay
       in the award or performance of a classified contract.
       2.1.2.2. A listing giving the legal name of the facility being sponsored, its complete
       street address, and the names and positions of people who are applying for interim
       Top Secret access authorization.
       2.1.2.3. The address of the authorizing DSS.
   2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations
   participating in the NISP.
       2.1.3.1. The ISPM with oversight responsibility for a cleared facility conducts required
       security reviews of the operation and assists the CSO, as necessary.
       2.1.3.2. The ISPM also conducts surveys and/or administrative inquiries pertaining to an
       on-base cleared facility as requested by the CSO and ensures contractor compliance with
       DOD 5220.22‐ M, NISPOM.
       2.1.3.3. Complete the survey by using the DD Form 374, Facility Security Clearance
       Survey Data Sheet, [DOD 5220.22-R], or an equivalent/acceptable automated format
       when conducting survey for an on-base cleared facility and forward a copy to the CSO.
2.2. Contractors with Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).
AFI31-601_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP_I 5 JANUARY 2011                                                  13


   2.2.1. The CSO tells COs if a contractor performing on a classified contract has foreign
   ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) or whether it can be negated. Such influence might
   jeopardize the security of classified information held by the contractor.
   2.2.2. To resolve a FOCI problem, the CSO may establish a facility clearance that limits the
   level and type of classified information to which a FOCI contractor has access. Such
   restrictions might affect ongoing, pending and future classified contracts with the contractor.
   The CO should discuss this impact with the ISPM and servicing Foreign Disclosure office.
   2.2.3. The CO considers sponsoring a National Interest Determination (NID) after receiving
   written justification from the requesting program office or activity. This justification must
   address and explain how the FOCI contractor’s product or service is crucial or is the sole
   available source to the AF. If applicable, the program or activity must also provide a written
   explanation when contract cancellation would cause unacceptable delays for mission-
   essential weapons systems in the field or for support organizations.
      2.2.3.1. The requesting program office or activity is responsible for obtaining written
      release approval authority from the functional owner of the “proscribed information,”
      prior to submitting the NID to the contracting office. The program office or activity
      contacts the OCA for Top Secret (TS), NSA for Communications Security (COMSEC),
      DCI for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and DOE for Restricted Data (RD)
      or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) to obtain release approval. (NOTE: All release
      determination request (NID) involving/for SCI must be submitted to HQ USAF/XOIIS
      for review, coordination and processing).
      2.2.3.2. The CO reviews, validates, and processes the NID and associated written
      approvals as follows:
          2.2.3.2.1. Forward request for NID related to special access program (SAP)
          performance through the appropriate SAP and command channels to the Deputy for
          Security and Investigative Programs, Office of the Administrative Assistant
          (SAF/AAZ), 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20330-1720 for approval.
          2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to
          HQ USAF/XOS-FI for review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to
          SAF/AAZ for review and endorsement.
      2.2.3.3. SAF/AA endorse the NID and forwards it to the Office of the Under Secretary of
      Defense for Counterintelligence and Security (OSD-USD/I), 5000 Defense Pentagon,
      Washington, D.C. 20301-3040, for final approval.
2.3. Contractor Personnel Security Clearances (PCLs).
   2.3.1. The Defense Security Service grants and maintains contractor PCLs. DSS also
   terminates contractor PCLs when the contractor no longer needs them or when a contractor
   employee is terminated. Administrative termination of a PCL carries no adverse implications
   regarding the employee or the contractor.
   2.3.2. The Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review, DOD Office of General
   Counsel, may suspend or revoke contractor PCLs following due process.
   2.3.3. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential or Secret PCLs for interim
   clearances, where possible.
 14                            AFI31-601_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP_I 5 JANUARY 2011


   2.3.4. When a contractor employee who is not cleared for access to Top Secret information
   needs such access to perform on an Air Force classified contract, the employing contractor
   may sponsor the individual for an interim Top Secret PCL.
       2.3.4.1. The contractor should send requests to the CO who seeks concurrence of the
       system program office (SPO), system manager (SM), or program manager (PM).
       2.3.4.2. The contractor’s request should document clearly why the individual needs an
       interim PCL, why contract requirements may not be satisfied with another individual
       more suitably cleared, and what the potential adverse impact would be on contract
       performance if an interim PCL were not granted. The contracting officer will deny
       contractor requests that do not meet these criteria.
       2.3.4.3. The CO routes the appropriate contractor’s request for interim Top Secret PCLs
       to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval.
       2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then includes
       the endorsement in the personnel security questionnaire package for transmission to DSS
       for action. The CO promptly returns denied requests.
2.4. Processing Trustworthiness Determinations.
   2.4.1. When contractors require unescorted entry to restricted areas, access to sensitive
   unclassified information, access to government automated information systems (AIS) and/ or
   sensitive equipment, not involving access to classified information, the contractor’s personnel
   security questionnaire is processed by the sponsoring Air Force activity per DOD 5200.2-R
   and AFI 31-501.
   2.4.1. (DAVISMONTHANAFB) Unit security managers or designated trusted agents will
   facilitate completion of security forms for contractors who occupy "positions of trust" within
   their unit. This will include delivery of the security forms and notifications to the subject and
   scheduling an interview 355th Fighter Wing Information Protection (355 FW/IP) for
   processing.
2.5. Reciprocity. The CO, ISPM, and other installation security disciplines offices of primary
responsibility (OPRs) work together to resolve issues pertaining to reciprocity, as applicable to
inspections, surveys, audits, security clearances, security reviews, etc. Elevate reciprocity issues
to the next higher level of command when they can not be resolved locally.

                         SECURITY TRAINING AND BRIEFINGS

3.1. Security Training Requirements.
   3.1.1. Air Force classified solicitations and/or contracts [Statement of Objectives (SOO),
   Statement of Work (SOW), Request for Bid (RFB), Request for Quote (RFQ), VGSA, etc.]
   may stipulate contractor compliance with and participation in pertinent Air Force, command
   and installation security training programs when performance or services will occur on an
   Air Force installation.
   3.1.2. When specified in an executed VGSA, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management, security training requirements satisfy the NISPOM training provision for on-
   base integrated visitor groups. Other Air Force functionals and/or security discipline OPRs
   may use this training provision for operational efficiency, however the specific requirements
   must be identified in the VGSA.
   3.1.3. When an on-base contractor operation is designated as a cleared facility, the ISPM
   will provide the initial facility security officer (FSO) briefing in accordance with the
   NISPOM and CSO guidance.
   3.1.4. Air Force unit security managers or security officers will provide information security
   program training (initial, refresher and annual) and other security awareness support to
   integrated visitor groups. The AF activity, working in concert with the ISPM, will
   incorporate language into the VGSA, which requires visitor group personnel to attend and/or
   receive information security training per DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401, Chapter 8. Unit
   security managers will ensure integrated visitor group personnel are included in their security
   education program.
3.2. Security Briefing/Debriefing Requirements.
   3.2.1. Management officials of the on-base cleared facility visitor groups are responsible for
   ensuring their employees receive all required security briefings and debriefings as mandated
   by the NISPOM.
   3.2.2. For integrated visitor groups, DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 security training
   requirements are equivalent to and satisfy the training requirements of NISPOM, where
   appropriate. On-base contractor management officials are responsible for ensuring their
   personnel’s attendance and satisfying NISPOM documentation requirements.
   3.2.3. The ISPM will invite on-base cleared facility, Facility Security Officers (FSOs) and/or
   security representatives, to the installation’s information security manager meetings.

   COs can sign, modify or negotiate changes to contracts.
   4.1.2. When a contractor requires access to classified information, the AF program, project
   or activity prepares the required DD Forms 254, DOD Contract Security Classification
   Specifications. The contractor should use the security requirements in this form to accurately
   estimate the cost of security measures. More detailed security requirements are specified in
   the statement of work (SOW), statement of objectives (SOO), performance work statement
   (PWS), Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA), etc.
   4.1.3. The responsible AF program, project, or activity will identify (by title, functional
   OPR, and approval date), the specific security classification guidance or guides (SCGs)
   applicable to the contract in Block #13 of the DD Form 254. The AF activity/program will
   provide copies of the SCG to the contractor prior to the contract commencing.
4.2. DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specifications.
   4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified
   contract. When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with
   the CO, ISPM and other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the
   terms of the solicitation/contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is
   forwarded to the CO for processing. The contractor should use the security
   classification/declassification specifications and other contractual security requirements
   listed in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
   4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security
   disciplines and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security
   guidance is being provided to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the
   requesting AF entity/activity incorporates the necessary changes and prepares and forwards
   an original DD Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and signing.
   4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security
   disciplines and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD Form
   254. This review and coordination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13 (office
   symbol, date and initial’s of reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and
   maintain a copy of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the respective contract file. When
   SAPs are involved, coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the office responsible
   for SAP security oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and SAPs
   unclassified, whenever possible.
4.3. Reviewing and Certifying the DD Form 254.
   4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security
   classification guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only
AFI31-601_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP_I 5 JANUARY 2011                                                    17


   annotates Block 13 of the draft DD Form 254. Other security requirements are incorporated
   into the SOW, SOO, PWS, VGSA, etc.
   4.3.2. The AF program, project or activity reviews the DD Form 254 and applicable security
   classification/declassification guidance at least once every five years or as required, to ensure
   accuracy and currency. When changes are necessary, the contract will be modified, if
   appropriate and revised guidance issued.
   4.3.3. The CO certifies (signs) the DD Form 254, Block 16e. At the CO discretion, this
   authority may be delegated (in writing) as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations
   (FAR) or supplementation thereto.
4.4. Distribution of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.1. When DSS is relieved of security oversight responsibility for cleared facilities
   performing on SCI or SAP programs, furnish Headquarters DSS, 1340 Braddock Place,
   Alexandria VA 22314‐ 1651, a copy of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.2. When a contractor’s performance will be on Air Force installation, the AF program,
   project or activity must identify/specify all contract performance locations, if known, on the
   DD Form 254. When the contract is performed elsewhere, the CO will provide a copy of the
   signed DD Form 254 to that location’s ISPM.
   4.4.3. Procuring Contracting Officers (PCOs), their designated representatives, including
   Administrative Contracting Officers (ACOs), distribute DD Form 254.
4.5. Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).
   4.5.1. Execute a VGSA with all contractor operations located on Air Force installations that
   will require access to classified information. At the IC’s discretion, the VGSA execution
   requirement may be extended to contractors performing on contracts that require access to
   sensitive unclassified information, sensitive resources or frequent "entry" to the installation.
   4.5.2. The installation ISPM, security disciplines and functional OPRs work in concert with
   the AF program, project and/or activity to develop the Visitor Group Security Agreement
   (VGSA) requirements. The requirement to execute a VGSA is in addition to preparing the
   DD Form 254.
   4.5.3. The VGSA must address those security requirements and/or procedures that are
   unique to the installation for which the contractor will be held contractually liable. VGSAs
   need only address those areas of security, safeguarding and/or protection that have not been
   covered elsewhere within the contract, DD Form 254, SOW, SOO, PWS, etc.
   4.5.4. The ISPM is the technical OPR for development and preparation of the VGSA. For
   coordination purposes, the ISPM routes the VGSA to all installation security discipline
   OPRs and/or other agencies lending expertise to the contractual security requirements.
   4.5.4. (DAVISMONTHANAFB) As a minimum, the Information Security Program
   Manager (ISPM) will route the initial draft of the Visitor Group Security Agreement
   (VGSA) to the commander of the hosting unit.
   4.5.5. The ISPM signs the VGSA on behalf of the installation commander. The ISPM
   forwards a copy of the executed/signed VGSA to the contracting officer who awarded the
   contract or to the contracting officer’s designated representative, when appropriate.

                                       SAFEGUARDING

5.1. Designation of On-Base Visitor Groups. The IC works in concert with the Air Force
activity, CO and ISPM to determine the designation of an on-base visitor group (cleared facility,
integrated visitor group or intermittent visitor).
5.2. Integrated Visitor Group.
   5.2.1. Integrated visitor groups operate in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental
   guidance thereto. They handle, generate, process, and store classified information per AF
   guidance. The exception being, their “access” is limited to “need-to-know” contract-specific
   classified performance information.
   5.2.1. (DAVISMONTHANAFB) The host unit will provide Intermittent and Long Term
   visitor groups information on applicable security regulations, to include Air Combat
   Command (ACC) and local requirements.
   5.2.2. The AF must stipulate the specific DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental guidance, which
   is applicable under the terms of the executed VGSA.
   5.2.3. The guidance conveyed to on-base contractor operation via the VGSA is limited to the
   AF installation and the AF solicitation/contract which it was executed to support. All other
   NISPOM mandated security requirements not addressed or specifically exempted by the
   executed VGSA or other contracting document must be implemented by the contractor.
   5.2.4. The VGSA must clearly reflect that the Air Force is accountable for and controls all
   classified information. Integrated contractor visitor groups are prohibited from establishing
   separate classified information controls. (NOTE: Integrated visitor group personnel can not
   be appointed as primary or alternate security managers for AF activities. However, they can
   be required (via the VGSA) to provide other security program support, under AF direction,
   such as, conducting end-of-day security checks, security training/briefings, etc.).
       5.2.4.1. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) The hosting unit will supply, maintain and
       control all security containers utilized by visitor groups.
       5.2.4.2. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) At least one Department of Defense (DoD)
       military or civilian member of the hosting unit will have access to all security containers
       used by the contractor.
           5.2.4.2.1. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) Changes to the security container
           combination by contractor visitor group personnel are not authorized. An
           appropriately cleared, authorized member of the host unit will make all required
           combination changes.
       5.2.4.3. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) The hosting unit security manager or
       another member of the host unit designated, in writing, by the unit commander may
       perform random entry/exit inspections of all personnel entering or existing the facility.
           5.2.4.3.1. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) These checks may consist of a
           physical inspection of all hand carried materials, but need not include wallets, change
 20                           AFI31-601_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP_I 5 JANUARY 2011


           purses, clothing, or other items of an unusually personal nature. They will not
           include physical touching of the subject, a "pat down", or any other personally
           invasive procedures. A record of these checks should be maintained for one calendar
           year.
           5.2.4.3.2. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) At the unit commander’s discretion,
           the hosting unit may give a trusted senior management official of the visitor group an
           opportunity to be present during the inspections. If an advance notice of an
           inspection is provided to a senior management official, they may not divulge the
           information until after the inspection has been completed.
           5.2.4.3.3. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) Personnel who refuse to comply with
           the inspection, attempt to evade exit/entry checks, or are found to be in possession of
           classified material without proper authorization will be immediately reported to the
           unit commander. A senior management official of the visitor group will also be
           notified immediately. The individual may further be remanded to other federal or
           civilian authorities or debarred from the installation.
           5.2.4.3.4. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) Units will conspicuously post notices
           at all entry and exits advising all personnel entering or departing the facilities that
           they are subject to random inspections of their personal effects.
5.3. Cleared Facility. An on-base cleared facility operates under the security mandates and
requirements of the NISPOM. See AFPD 31-6 for further guidance regarding their
establishment.
5.4. Intermittent Visitors. Intermittent visitors may operate under the security requirements of
the NISPOM or the installation security program. The IC makes this determination after
considering the intermittent visitor’s relationship and interface with the AF activity and/or
installation.
5.5. On-Base Contract Completion or Termination. The program, project or AF activity will
notify the ISPM in writing when the contractual services and/or performance has been completed
or terminated.
5.5. (DAVISMONTHANAFB)On-Base Contract Completion or Termination. The
program, project or AF activity will notify the ISPM in writing 30 days prior to contractual
services and/or performance being completed or terminated to schedule a final inspection of the
“on base” contractor operations.
   5.5.1. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) When notified of a contract termination the ISPM
   will schedule a final review of “on base” contractor operations to ensure all classified
   material has been properly accounted for and the visitor group is completely cleared from
   access to classified material. This requirement will be included in all VGSA's on Davis
   Monthan Air Force Base (DMAFB). A copy of the final review will be provided to the unit
   security manager and visitor group security focal point. The ISPM will maintain a copy of
   the document in the "closed" contractor's file for 2 years.
AFI31-601_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP_I 5 JANUARY 2011                                                     21

             OVERSIGHT REVIEWS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Conducting Industrial Security Reviews (SRs).
   6.1.1. Industrial Security Reviews. The ISPM conduct security reviews (SRs) of on-base
   cleared facilities that performs classified work on Air Force installations. Such SRs evaluate
   the contractor’s compliance with contract specific-security requirements and pertinent DOD
   and Air Force security instructions.
   6.1.2. Scheduling Industrial Security Reviews. Conduct (SRs) of on-base cleared facilities
   per DOD 5220.22-M and DOD 5220.22-R. Unless conducting an unannounced security
   review on a cleared facility, provide contractor activity’s management 30 days advanced
   written notification.
   6.1.3. Performing Industrial Security Reviews. ISPMs coordinate with other Air Force
   security discipline OPRs such as; Operations Security (OPSEC), Computer Security
   (COMPUSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC), to provide specialized expertise
   when necessary to complete a security review. The SR is complete when all security
   requirements imposed under the terms of the contract have been evaluated.
      6.1.3.1. When SRs are conducted for cleared facilities, provide copies of completed SR
      report, with all related correspondence, to the CSO. Use DSS’ automated format to
      document the results of the SR. Contact HQ USAF/XOS-FI to obtain a copy of the
      automated DSS format.
      6.1.3.2. Facility security clearance (FCL) files must contain all key documentation
      prescribed by DOD 5220.22‐ R and the CSO, to include DD Form 254 and related
      contract security requirement documents.
   6.1.4. Post‐ Industrial Security Review Requirements.
      6.1.4.1. Send a letter/report to senior management officials of the cleared facility within
      10 days of completing the security review. The letter should:
      6.1.4.2. Confirm the contractor’s security status as discussed during the exit interview.
      6.1.4.3. List any deficiencies requiring corrective action.
      6.1.4.4. Within 30 days, request written confirmation on the status of any open major
      discrepancy (condition which resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in the
      loss or compromise of classified information).
      6.1.4.5. The ISPM may extend the time for corrective action if required changes are
      significant and the contractor is making a conscientious effort to resolve problems
      expeditiously.
   6.1.5. Unsatisfactory Industrial Security Reviews.
      6.1.5.1. The ISPM assigns an on-base cleared facility an unsatisfactory SR rating:
          6.1.5.1.1. To a cleared facility visitor groups if it fails to satisfactorily perform its
          contractual security responsibilities.
 22                           AFI31-601_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP_I 5 JANUARY 2011


          6.1.5.1.2. When major failures in the contractor’s security program have resulted in
          or could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or compromise of classified
          information.
          6.1.5.1.3. When the contractor is clearly responsible for the security problems cited
          during a security review.
          6.1.5.1.4. The ISPM coordinates with the CSO and contracting officer when
          assigning an unsatisfactory SR rating for an on-base cleared facility.
          6.1.5.1.5. The home office facility (HOF) for the cleared facility is ultimately
          responsible for meeting contract security requirements. When assigning an
          unsatisfactory SR rating, the ISPM notifies the HOF immediately through the
          contracting office and requests prompt and complete corrective action. If the HOF
          fails to take corrective action, its security clearance may be affected. The servicing
          security activity should notify the HOF’s CSO if problems continue.
   6.1.6. Invalidating the Facility Security Clearance (FCL).
      6.1.6.1. The CSO notifies the contracting officers in writing when the FCL of a
      contractor under their jurisdiction is invalidated.
      6.1.6.2. A contractor who fails to correct security deficiencies that subsequently results
      in invalidation may lose its FCL.
      6.1.6.3. Although most contractors resolve invalidations promptly, contractors with
      foreign owned, controlled, or influence (FOCI) invalidations may have to wait for many
      months. Where FOCI is evident, the facility clearance may remain invalidated for more
      than a year while methods to resolve the FOCI are considered, approved, and
      implemented. The FCL is invalidated while DSS negotiates voting trusts, proxy
      agreements, or special agreements with foreign interests.
      6.1.6.4. Document SR for an on-base cleared facility as required by the DOD 5220.22-
      M, DOD 5220.22-R, and CSO guidance. Keep copies of completed SR reports with pre-
      security review letter and completed post‐ review correspondence for 2 years from the
      date of the most recent SR.
      6.1.6.5. Maintain copies of self-inspection reports or reviews for 2 years from date of the
      most recent self-inspection.
6.2. Conducting Information Security Program Reviews.
   6.2.1. Information Security Program Reviews. On-base integrated visitor groups will be
   evaluated and conduct self-inspections collectively with the AF activity per DOD 5200.1-R
   and AFI 31-401, guidance. Integrated visitor groups will not be subjected to the SR
   requirements of the NISPOM. The installation prescribes the report for documenting
   program reviews.
   6.2.1. (DAVISMONTHANAFB) Whenever feasible, the ISPM will schedule the industrial
   security program review for all visitor groups as part of the sponsoring activities annual
   security program review. The ISPM will provide copies of the annual security program
   review schedule to each Facility Security Officer and on-base designated security focal point
   to serve as an advance/official notice to the contractor.

     used to substitute for one of the self-inspections. (NOTE: The maintenance of self-
     inspection reports is optional for ISPMs).
         6.2.4.5.1. (Added-DAVISMONTHANAFB) 355 FW/IP will maintain a copy of the
         self-inspection reports until superseded.
     6.2.4.6. DELETED.
  6.2.5. For visitor groups, the ISPM briefs key Air Force and designated visitor group
  managers on the status of the unit’s security program. Provide both parties a copy of the PR
  report and any other related assessment, survey or staff assistance visit (SAV) report. Do not
  furnish copies of these reports to the CSO.
     6.2.5.1. When warranted, AF commanders notify the contractor’s home office facility

                                    SUBCONTRACTING

8.1. Prime Contractor’s Responsibilities.
   8.1.1. Prime contractors are responsible for ensuring their on-base subcontractors are
   knowledgeable of and comply with the applicable security requirements (NISPOM,
   installation, etc.) as identified in contracts and/or other contracting documents.
   8.1.2. Prime contractors supporting classified efforts must include a provision in each on-
   base subcontract that requires subcontractors to contact the installation commander or
   designee and execute a VGSA prior to beginning on-base operations.
8.2. Subcontractor Responsibilities. On-base subcontractors must execute a separate and/or
independent VGSA with the installation. (NOTE: As an alternative, when multiple subcontractor
perform services in support of the same on-base classified contract and prime contractor, the
execution of this VGSA, can be satisfied by the subcontractor acknowledging review and
understanding of the security requirements identified in the prime contractor’s executed VGSA.
This being the case, executing and adding a signatory page only (attachment) to the prime’s
VGSA is acceptable).

Terms
Classified Contract—Any contract that requires or will require access to classified information
by the contractor or the employees in the performance of the contract. A contract may be
classified even though the contract document itself is not classified.
Cleared Facility—A non-government owned and operated industrial, educational, commercial,
or other facility for which DOD has made an administrative determination (from a security
viewpoint) that the entity is eligible for and requires access to classified information of a certain
category (Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret).
Cognizant Security Office—The designated Department of Defense (DOD) agency responsible
for industrial security program administration. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) has
designated the Defense Security Service (DSS) to perform this function. The Director of DSS
has further delegated this responsibility downward within the agency. DSS Regional Directors
provide industrial security administration for DOD contractor facilities located within their
respective geographical area. One exception, for which ISPM has responsible, is DOD
contractors on Air Force installation who have been designated as “visitor groups.” When used,
the language “Cognizant Security Office” (CSO), always refers to DSS or an entity thereof.
Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)—This AF entity implements and administers
the installation’s information, personnel and industrial security programs. The ISPM is
responsible for supervising and overseeing on-base contractor’s security programs and/or
operations.
Installation—An installation is an area in which the Air Force holds a real property interest or
real property over which the Air Force has jurdisdiction by agreement with a foreign government
or by right of occupation. The term installation also includes all auxiliary off-base or detached
installations under the jurisdiction of the commander of the primary installation.
Integrated Visitor Groups—An on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that
requires access to classified information and operates under the direct control/supervision of the
Air Force. The integrated visitor group is authorized to function in accordance with DOD
5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 per the VGSA. The Air Force maintains control of all classified and
provides day-to-day supervision over this type of contractor operation. It basically differs from
the on-base cleared facility because of its close interaction and/or relationship with the AF
organization it supports.
Interim Facility Security Clearances (Interim FCL)—Interim FCL are temporary, limited
company security clearances established by the DSS. It does not permit access to Restricted
Data, COMSEC, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), SCI, SAP, or Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency classified Information. However, if an interim Top Secret FCL is issued,
the contractor may access such information at the level of Secret and Confidential. Interim FCLs
 34                             AFI31-601_DAVISMONTHANAFBSUP_I 5 JANUARY 2011


may not be appropriate for all contractual needs and are not available for all sponsored
companies.
Intermittent Visitor—A contractor or company, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that require
“entry” to an Air Force installation for brief periods of time on a scheduled or on call basis to
perform contractual duties. An intermittent visitor’s presence on an installation usually does not
exceed 90 consecutive days.
Invalidation—A condition at a cleared facility caused by changed conditions or performance
under which the facility may no longer be eligible for an FCL unless the facility promptly
initiates appropriate corrective actions.
Major Discrepancy—A condition, which resulted in or could reasonably be, expected to result
in the loss or compromise of classified information.
On-Base Cleared Facility—An on-base contractor operation cleared under the provisions of the
NISP and established at the discretion of the IC per DOD 5220.22-R. These entities operate
under NISPOM guidance and the ISPM has been designated by the IC to provide security
oversight.
Reciprocity—A reciprocal condition, relationship, mutual or cooperative agreement, between
two or more agencies, components, or departments agreeing to recognize and accept the efforts
(requirements, procedures, actions, etc.) of the other in exchange for the same compensation.
Visitor Group—Any on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that requires
access to classified information. The installation commander determines their “official” on-base
designation. (NOTE: All on-base contractor operations are considered “visitor groups,” per this
AFI. The IC assesses and evaluates the working relationship and interactions between the visitor
group and AF activity to determining their “official” designation, i.e., cleared facility, integrated
visitor group or intermittent visitor).
Visitor Group Security Agreement—A documented and legally binding contractual agreement
between an Air Force activity and a DOD contractor whereby the contractor commits to
complying with, rendering or performing specific security tasks or functions for compensation.
The VGSA attest to and certifies the existence of such an agreement, including applicable
changes and amendments, attachments, supplements and exhibits.

   IC 2005-1 TO AFI 31-601, INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

29 JUNE 2005
This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. It
provides guidance for implementing the National Industrial Security Program. Use this
instruction with DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual
(NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-R, Industrial Security Regulation, and DOD 5200.1-R, Information
Security ProgramRegulation and changes thereto. Maintain and dispose of all records created as
a result of processes prescribed in this instruction in accordance with the WebRims Records
Disposition Schedule. HQ USAF/XOS-FI is delegated approval authority for revision of this
AFI.
OPR: HQ USAF/XOS-F
Certification: HQ USAF/XOS-FI

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access to
classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the DD
Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors
Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring
contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated information systems
(AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and eliminating the requirement
to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report. (NOTE: As used in this
publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it negate the “security and
policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies andProcedures. The term
"sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified contract that
has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security
Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | )
indicates a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.
