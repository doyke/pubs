information from the new online banking system, the changes to the review and approval times
for Cardholders (CHs) and Approving Officials (AOs) with their duties and responsibilities, as
well as the new responsibilities for the Installation Program Coordinators (IPCs). Further, it
clarifies the duties of the MAJCOMs in the NAF P-Card program. Single purchase limits were
changed, and the requirement for AF Form 4140 was deleted. It explains how to properly
document authorized transactions in the bank’s online system, the training used, how to use a
Nonappropriated fund (NAF) purchase card as a method of payment against a contract and the
limits for span of control for AOs and allows for third party payments.

                                            Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. General Information. The Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office
(AFNAFPO) awarded a contract for Commercial Credit Card Service for NAF purchases. The
contractor (hereinafter referred to as the bank) provides commercial credit cards and associated
services to military members and federal civilian employees to pay for official NAF government
purchases.
1.2. Requests for Technical Assistance. Submit requests for clarification or interpretation of
this instruction through the MAJCOM/A1SR to HQ AFSVA/SVC.
1.3. Waivers. Submit requests for waivers to this instruction through the MAJCOM/A1SR to
HQ AFSVA/SVC for HQ USAF/A1S approval consideration.
1.4. Program Management. The MAJCOM/A1SR or designee serves as the Installation
Program Coordinator (IPC) for the MAJCOM NAF P-Card Program. MAJCOM program
responsibilities are defined in paragraph 4.1. Each installation Resource Manager (RM) or
designee shall serve as the IPC responsible for the day-to-day operations of the installation's
NAF Purchase card program. IPC program responsibilities are defined in paragraph 4.2. The
IPC monitors the program for compliance with these instructions, AFMAN 64-302, NAF
Contracting Procedures; any other applicable Air Force NAF instructions and manuals; and the
How to…Help Guide provided online by the bank. The card holder (CH) uses the NAF P-Card
for purchases according to the limitations set forth in this instruction. Exception: In the case of
geographically separated units (GSU) without an RM, the supporting main operating base RM
designates an on-site individual to work with them in managing the site’s program. For those
Air Force sites without an RM and the program is centrally managed by the MAJCOM/A1SR,
the MAJCOM/A1SR designates an on-site individual to work with the MAJCOM/A1SR in
managing the site’s program. See Table 4-1 for Roles and Responsibilities within the NAF P-
Card program.
1.5. Program Structure. The P-Card program’s structure is a three-level billing hierarchy:
IPC, Approving Official (AO), and CH; and a five-level reporting hierarchy. The NAF P-Card
program uses the levels described below to provide a system of checks, balances, and audit
controls from the lowest to the highest level within each organization.
     1.5.1. Level 1. The first reporting level of the reporting hierarchy represents the Department
     of Defense as a whole.
     1.5.2. Level 2. The second reporting level identifies the military service. The Level 2
     reporting level mandating policy for the Air Force government purchase card program is Air
     Force Contracting (SAF/AQC). A SAF/AQC staff member is designated to administer the
     Air Force Government purchase card program and serves as a liaison between the USAF and
     the GSA. This individual also provides statistical reports and program information regarding
     the USAF Government Purchase card Program to the Agency Program Coordinator (APC)
     for the Air Force Services NAF purchase card program and forwards recommendations from
     Level 3 to SAF/AQC. While the NAF P-Card is a government purchase card, it is
     administered by HQ AFSVA/SVC, but reports through SAF/AQC to OSD.
AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011                                                                         5


   1.5.3. Level 3. The third reporting level generally identifies the Defense Agency within a
   Level 2. HQ AFSVA/SVC is the designated Level 3 office responsible for managing the
   NAF P-Card Program. HQ AFSVA/SVCKB (P-Card Team) serves as the NAF P-Card APC.
   Level 3 APC primary responsibilities are: administer the AF NAF P-Card Program;
   recommend policies to Level 2 for approval consideration; recommend guidelines for AF
   Services-wide NAF implementation to HQ AFSVA/SVC, HQ AFSVA Directorate of
   Financial Management and Comptroller (HQ AFSVA/SVF), and AF/A1S for approval
   consideration; serve as liaison for SAF/AQC, and the bank; review AF NAF P-Card Level 3
   Summary Statistical Reports; and provide information to MAJCOM and installation IPCs.
   1.5.4. Level 4. The fourth reporting level within the NAF purchase card program identifies
   the installation or MAJCOM program. The Level 4 IPC has overall responsibility for the
   NAF Purchase card Program at installation and MAJCOM level. (See paragraph 1.5.)
   1.5.5. Level 5. The fifth reporting level with the program identifies a particular unit or
   company. The bank assigns a Level 5 (company number) to each NAF Level 4.
1.6. Field Communication. Installation-level IPCs shall first direct questions or issues to their
MAJCOM IPC. MAJCOM IPC may forward any issues they are unable to resolve to the HQ
AFSVA/SVC (NAF Purchase card Team).
1.7. Additional Guidance. The HQ AFSVA/SVC NAF P-Card APC, in conjunction with the
MAJCOM IPC, is responsible for developing additional guidance for the NAF P-Card program.

                 NAF PURCHASING WITH THE NAF PURCHASE CARD

2.1. Authorized Use of the NAF Government Purchase card.
     2.1.1. The NAF government P-Card is used to make authorized NAF government purchases.
     CHs are issued a written delegation of purchase authority from the IPC/CO to use the NAF
     Purchase card in lieu of AF Forms 2209 or 2209-1, Nonappropriated Fund Order for
     Supplies or Services, to purchase supplies and equipment up to $5,000 and non-personal
     services up to $2,500 where feasible and practical.
        2.1.1.1. Exception: When specified in a written delegation of authority from the IPC, if
        warranted, or a warranted contracting officer, cardholders not holding a NAF Contracting
        Officer warrant can purchase items up to $25,000 per transaction from the Army and Air
        Force Exchange Service (AAFES), the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), and
        printing services from the Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS).
        2.1.1.2. NAF COs (with appropriate purchase limitations) may specify the P-Card as a
        method of payment on agreements, purchase orders, delivery orders, and contracts up to
        the limit of their warrant. This includes orders for Prime Vendor or resale tickets and
        tour packages in Information Ticket and Tours (ITT). The CO can specify any
        cardholder at their installation, except themselves, as the payer.
        2.1.1.3. Consider sources of supply when making NAF P-Card purchases. Sources
        include:
            2.1.1.3.1. NAF requirements contracts (Essential Products Program (EPP)) are
            mandatory.
            2.1.1.3.2. The Javits-Wagner O’Day Act requires the Government to purchase non-
            resale supplies or services from the AbilityOne ―Procurement List‖ if they are
            available within the period required. The ―Procurement List‖ is located at the
            AbilityOne website, www.abilityone.org.
            2.1.1.3.3. NAF Purchasing Agreements (NPAs) shall be used as primary source of
            supply for other requirements.
            2.1.1.3.4. COs are encouraged to purchase Federal Prison Industries supplies and
            services to the maximum extent practicable. (www.unicor.gov)
        2.1.1.4. Purchase controlled medical substances for the installation veterinarian only
        when the veterinarian has a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) number. If the
        veterinarian does not have a DEA number, he or she orders controlled medical substances
        from installation medical supply, which is reimbursed with NAFs. Request uncontrolled
        items from installation medical supply and reimburse with NAFs or purchase from the
        open market. As the transfer of each veterinarian clinic to the Army is completed, the
        purchase of medical supplies for these clinics will no longer be authorized.
        2.1.1.5. The IPC may establish CH accounts as requested by training and education
        program managers with a single purchase limit of $25,000. The NAF P-Card is used to
        pay for non-government and/or government off-the-shelf training and education for an
AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011                                                                          7


       individual event or planned series of the same training event, activity, service, or course
       material. The NAF P-Card does not replace SF Form 182, Request, Authorization
       Agreement, Certification of Training and Reimbursement. Training and education
       program managers must review and approve requests for training. An SF Form 182 must
       be completed and approved prior to attending any training or education course or
       program.
       2.1.1.6. Purchase of aviation, diesel, or gasoline fuel or oil for aircraft and motorized
       vehicles is permitted for NAF-owned, government-loaned, or leased vehicles and aircraft
       or when purchased for resale.
       2.1.1.7. When specified in a written delegation of authority from the IPC, NAF ITT
       activity cardholders not holding a CO warrant may purchase against the Leisure Travel
       contract up to $25,000 per transaction. ITT CHs must review and sign the "Statement of
       Acknowledgement for ITT Cardholders‖ certificate (Attachment 5) before purchasing
       against the Leisure Travel contract.         Signed copies of the "Statement of
       Acknowledgement for ITT Cardholders‖ certificate will be kept on file by both the CH
       and the IPC.
2.2. Purchases Requiring Coordination. CHs must be aware there are numerous restrictions
on the types of purchases that can be made using NAFs and that these restrictions apply even
when the NAF P-Card is being used. In general, NAFs can be used only for purchases that
support the mission of the NAFI. Similarly, Appropriated Funds (APFs) will be used for
purchases that are authorized APF support. In such cases, the NAF P-Card should not be used.
To ensure adherence to these restrictions, purchase of the following commodities or services
requires the CH contact the specified controlling/servicing organization before making the
purchase. Except where noted below, or contrary to local policy, verbal or telephone approval is
sufficient. The CH must annotate in the authorization number for the approval, or if no number
available, the name of the individual providing approval in the transaction notes of the
transaction detail when the transaction posts to the on-line system.
   2.2.1. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT). Hazardous materials and potentially hazardous
   materials (e.g., acetone, alcohol, ammunition, benzol, ether, firearms, gasoline, naphtha,
   pesticides, refrigerants, poisons, radioactive materials, corrosive materials, equipment
   cleaning solvents, color toner for printers, etc.). The Installation Bioenvironmental Engineer
   and the Hazardous Material Pharmacy is the single point of authorization for use of
   hazardous materials on base except for ammunition and firearms. All purchases follow local
   HAZMAT procedures for single purchases and recurring orders. Transactions notes must
   annotate that authorization was received prior to purchase (e.g., date of authorization, local
   control number, etc.). Additionally, the purchase of ammunition and firearms used for resale
   in rod and gun clubs or on skeet ranges is authorized if proper purchase authority is received
   from applicable installation, local, state and/or federal entities.
   2.2.2. Communication and computer equipment and software. The requesting organization
   follows established local, MAJCOM and AF procedures when purchasing communication
   and computer equipment and software. Note: Purchase of non-standard AF NAF
   communications-computer systems also requires HQ AFSVA, Directorate of Management
   Systems (HQ AFSVA/SVS) and MAJCOM/A1SR approval.

    2.2.3. NAF travel related purchases. Requires prior approval, coordinated through
    respective AOs, from the IPC or designee. Use of the NAF P-Card is permitted for travel
    related expenses in support of an authorized Force Support Squadron NAF activity sponsored
    event, e.g., it may be used to pay for lodging, meals, fuel, etc., for an ITT trip. Do not use
    the NAF P-Card for official travel related expenses covered by the official government travel
    card (see paragraph 2.3.2.).
    2.2.4. Rental/lease of motor vehicles. Requires FSS Commander/Director written approval.
    Approval requests are initiated by AOs and coordinated through the IPC.
    2.2.5. Repair services. Use NAFs only when APFs are not authorized for repair services. A
    written order is required for repairs over $2,500. Use of the NAF P-Card requires NAF
    contracting office approval in writing. The AO initiates the request for approval. The CH
    and AO consult AFI 34-201 and AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale,
    Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, in preparing the
    request for approval certifying that APFs are not authorized. The CH also verifies the repair
    is not already covered by an existing preventative maintenance agreement. Enter the names
    of the persons contacted in the transaction notes. Consult the organizational equipment
    custodian for warranty information. New equipment may also be covered under warranty
    and repairs may be performed under these warranties at no cost to the AF.
    2.2.6. Construction services. The AO coordinates construction services with the FSS
    Deputy/construction manager, RM and Base Civil Engineer prior to purchase in writing. Use
    NAFs only when APFs are not authorized for construction services up to $2,000 with an
    approved AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request. The CH and AO consult AFI
    34-201and AFI 65-106 in preparing the request for approval certifying that APFs are not
    authorized. The FSS construction manager establishes local policy to ensure all work
    approved is properly planned and designed, materials used meet current construction
    standards, the work is properly inspected, and completed work is documented appropriately.
    (Note: The Davis-Bacon Act applies within the 50 states [including all U.S territories] and
    the District of Columbia).
    2.2.7. Civil engineer materials and real property installed equipment. The AO coordinates
    construction services with the FSS Deputy/construction manager, RM, and Base Civil
    Engineer prior to purchase in writing. The CH and AO consult AFI 34-201 and AFI 65-106
    in preparing the request for approval certifying that APFs are not authorized.
    2.2.8. Books, periodicals, and manuals. No specific approvals are required. However,
    activities are encouraged to check with the library prior to using the NAF P-Card especially
    for non- technical books. The base library may have funds to support purchase of books or
    manuals and/or may have books, periodicals, or manuals available.
    2.2.9. Purchase of professional services. The local servicing contracting office (SCO) or HQ
    AFSVA/SVC contracts for professional services, e.g., accountants and auditors. State law
    may require the services these individuals render be performed or approved by a person
    licensed, registered or certified to provide such services.
    2.2.10. Purchase of non-personal services up to $2,500. Examples of non-personal services

                                            Chapter 3

                  ESTABLISHING NAF PURCHASE CARD ACCOUNTS

3.1. Approving Officials and Cardholders. Flight chiefs submit requests for AOs and CHs to
the squadron/division IPC in writing. The FSS Commander/Director and the RM provide
assistance to flight chiefs and activity managers in identifying CHs and AOs. As the installation
NAF P-Card Program Coordinator, the RM or designee prepares a written Letter of Appointment
(Attachment 2) designating AOs and a Delegation of Purchase Authority (Attachment 3) for
each CH. The RM or IPC (if the IPC is not the RM) and a warranted CO sign the authorizations
if the RM or IPC does not have a contracting warrant. Provide a copy to the CH and the AO and
file the original appointment letter and CH delegation in the IPC binder located in the NAF
Accounting Office.
3.2. Cardholder Delegation of Purchase Authority. This document (Attachment 3), issued
by the IPC to each designated CH, fully describes the types of purchases authorized and dollar
limitations of the NAF Purchase card; identifies the name, rank/grade, duty title, and telephone
number of the CH(s) and AO(s); and specifies only use of NAF funds for P-Card transactions.
3.3. Budget Considerations. The NAF P-Card is subject to a single purchase limit and a
monthly CH limit. CHs, AOs, activity managers and flight chiefs coordinate purchase card
limits with the NAF budget analyst to the IPC in writing to ensure sufficient funds are budgeted
for and approved for NAF purchases. The IPC establishes the NAF P-Card accounts with the
bank according to the single purchase and monthly CH limits. AOs, activity mangers, flight
chiefs, and the IPC must closely monitor monthly individual activity (office) spending limits to
ensure the activity does not exceed budget authorizations. Note: Primary responsibility for
proper budget execution rests with respective activity managers.
3.4. Single Purchase Limit. The single purchase limit is a limitation on the procurement
authority delegated to the CH by the IPC and warranted CO. The maximum delegated single
purchase limit for non-warranted CHs is $5,000 (See paragraph 2.1.1.).
3.5. Monthly (Billing Cycle) Cardholder Limit. The AO in coordination with the IPC assigns
each CH a monthly credit limit. The total dollar value of purchases by the individual CH when
using the card for any single month must not exceed the monthly purchase limit.
3.6. Merchant Category Code (MCC) Groups. In setting up a NAF P-Card account, the IPC
assigns MCC groups based upon MCC Codes used to block purchases from specific merchant
types. The IPC chooses MCC groups to identify the spending requirements for the majority of
CHs. CHs shall not be permanently assigned the MCC group "999" (permits purchases from all
types of merchants) This ―999‖ code should only be used when the merchant is a known vendor
(used by the installation before) and should only be in the account for a short time (not to exceed
48 hours).
3.7. Establishing Credit Card Accounts. The MAJCOM, installation IPC, or designee use the
online banking tool provided by the bank, to establish and maintain CH accounts. These IPCs or
designees coordinate single and monthly purchase limits with the designated AO, and use the
online system to set these limits in the accounts.
12                                                               AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011


  3.7.1. The bank mails the NAF P-Card to the CH’s designated distribution point within two
  business days of the input of the account set-up information in the online system. The
  installation should receive the card within 7-10 business days.
  3.7.2. The bank uses a Voice Response Unit (VRU) to ensure receipt of the NAF P-Card by
  the CH or the designated distribution point. When the CH receives the NAF P-Card, he or
  she must immediately access the VRU. The VRU is accessible through the bank’s toll free
  number (or collect call telephone number for foreign users).
  3.7.3. The online banking system provides various reports to meet management and
  administrative needs and includes an ad hoc query option to allow for additional reporting
  capability.

                                         Chapter 4

       RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROCEDURES FOR NAF PURCHASE CARD
                             OPERATIONS

4.1. MAJCOM Responsibilities. Provide installations with name and contact information of a
MAJCOM IPC. The IPC assists installations in resolving issues, providing answers to questions,
clarifying guidance or referring questions to the HQ AFSVA/SVC P-Card Team. The MAJCOM
IPC also performs all the duties of an IPC for those cardholders at the MAJCOM (see Table 5-1
and paragraph 5.2. below). In addition, the MAJCOM IPC will:
   4.1.1. Disseminate information received from Higher Headquarters (HHQ).
   4.1.2. Consolidate information received from bases in response to requests for reports from
   the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and from the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense (OSD) to send to HQ AFSVA/SVC for further consolidation and submission to
   SAF/AQC.
   4.1.3. Perform periodic checks of information within the online system to ensure SPLs are
   acceptable, reviews are timely, approvals are done and transaction notes are completed.
4.2. IPC Responsibilities. IPC functions include entering NAF purchase card requests in the
online bank system; issuing delegations of contracting authority (when the IPC is a CO);
establishing a reporting system; and providing mandatory NAF purchase card training and
surveillance. The IPC provides each AO with a written letter of appointment (Attachment 2).
The IPC issues a written delegation of purchase authority to each CH (Attachment 3). The IPC
and a CO sign these documents if the IPC does not have a contracting warrant. The IPC is the
primary point of contact with the AF Services NAF P-Card Team for all NAF P-Card Program
business associated with the installation. In accordance with the nature of the duties and the
impacts on the system, neither the IPC nor the alternate IPC can be a CH nor should they be an
AO or alternate AO without a waiver from HQ AFSVA/SVC. Waivers to act as an AO will only
be considered for alternate IPCs, and then only for short periods such as during outbound and
inbound PCS’s of the AOs. The request can be either letter or email from the RM with
coordination from the FSS deputy. While the IPC may delegate some of these responsibilities,
overall program management remains an IPC responsibility. Additional responsibilities include
the following:
   4.2.1. Ensures NAF P-Card program implementation is coordinated with the AF Services
   NAF APC.
   4.2.2. Ensures the CHs properly set up their accounts in the bank’s online system to receive
   the electronic statement of account report monthly.
   4.2.3. Provide initial and refresher training to CHs and AOs in accordance with paragraph
   4.8.
   4.2.4. Maintains a current listing of all CHs and AOs under his/her jurisdiction including
   written, semiannual AO verifications that their respective cardholders are in possession of
   their NAF P-Cards.
 14                                                                  AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011


   4.2.5. Randomly surveys newly appointed CHs during the first three months to ensure they
   are effectively performing their duties and following all procedures.
   4.2.6. Suspends or terminates NAF P-Card privileges for NAF CHs and AOs where justified.
   4.2.7. The IPC follows procedures in AFI 34-202, Protecting Nonappropriated Fund Assets,
   for any loss of NAF assets resulting from misuse of the NAF P-Card.
   4.2.8. The IPC retains documents generated at the IPC level supporting CHs and AOs (e.g.,
   training records, surveillance records, etc.), as long as the CH and AO are performing that
   function and makes disposition IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule (AF RDS) located on
   the AF Portal in the AF Records Information Management System (AFRIMS), Table 64-4,
   Rule 26. Note: If the IPC determines the files have future value to the NAFI, requiring
   retention beyond that authorized by AF RDS, the IPC will contact the installation records
   manager and obtain approval for extended retention.
4.3. AO Responsibilities. The AO is the CH’s immediate supervisor or a higher level official
(activity manager or flight chief or higher level supervisor). A CH cannot be his or her own AO,
nor can the CH be an AO for his or her immediate supervisor. The AO shall not delegate his or
her authority. An alternate AO must be designated during leave or temporary duty (TDY) of the
primary AO to avoid transactions exporting without approval. AOs are responsible for the
performance and compliance with applicable guidance by their CHs, and submit requests in
writing to the IPC to instruct the bank to cancel the NAF Purchase card for any of his/her CHs at
any time. A primary AO will never have more than seven CHs assigned. Alternate AOs with
more than seven CHs assigned will need approval by their applicable MAJCOM IPC supported
by a letter on file showing the business case for the expanded numbers. An alternate AO will
never have more than 10 CHs assigned.
   4.3.1. The AO monitors all CH transactions for compliance with these instructions AFMAN
   64-302, any other applicable AF NAF instructions and manuals, and the How to….Help
   Guide the bank provides online.
   4.3.2. The AO recommends the number of CHs and the names of the designated CHs for
   their activity/office. Semiannually, not later than the 15th calendar day following 31 March
   and 30 September, the AO provides the IPC a list of their CHs certifying that they are in
   possession of their P-Cards.
   4.3.3. The AO, in coordination with their respective activity manager, recommends NAF P-
   Card SPL and monthly dollar limits to the IPC in writing for all of his/her CHs and ensures
   established limits are not exceeded. AOs, activity managers, and flight chiefs coordinate P-
   Card limits with the NAF budget analyst and IPC in writing to ensure sufficient funds are
   budgeted for and allocated for NAF purchases. CH’s activity managers and flight chiefs, in
   coordination with the FSS Commander/Director, establish these limits through the normal
   quarterly budget review and approval process. The AO tracks NAF P-Card purchases to
   avoid exceeding approved NAF budgetary ceilings.
   4.3.4. Daily, the AO will approve the items awaiting approval in the online banking system.
   For accountable property, the AO is responsible for verifying and entering the name of the
   individual (i.e., Property Custodian, assuming they are not the CH) who signed for
   acceptance of the property. At least three times each week, the AO will run a query to ensure
   CHs are reviewing transactions prior to the transactions exporting for payment. This ensures
AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011                                                                             15


   the items are reviewed/approved within four business days of the items posting to the online
   system. Each month the AO obtains and reviews each of their CH’s SOA report with copies
   of receipts attached ensuring purchases were appropriate, given the duties of the CH and type
   of activity, and were made according to this instruction and AFMAN 64-302. The AO also
   ensures an ―outstanding items list‖ of items purchased in the month or credits received, but
   not posted in the SOA, is sent to the RM by the second duty day after the end of month.
   When sales tax is included in the online transaction detail, the AO ensures the original
   amount and the settlement amount are the same and the sales tax was not paid (check the
   receipt to ensure no sales tax is listed as well). Some vendors cannot completely suppress
   this function. It is not misuse on the part of the cardholder as long as the receipt shows no
   tax was paid. The AO signs the bottom of the CH statement and keeps the original with
   copies of receipts or credit vouchers. The signed statement and copies of receipts will be
   maintained along with appointment letters and training certificates in his/her AO binder IAW
   AF RDS.
   4.3.5. AO ensures the IPC has sufficient time to act on CH designation requests, CH
   termination requests, and purchase approval requests as identified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
   Coordinate with the IPC and respective offices in determining appropriate timelines. Note:
   Expedite CH termination requests (verbal followed up with written request) if circumstances
   warrant immediate action.
   4.3.6. AOs and their respective activity managers/flight chiefs will ensure they and their
   CHs are proficiently cognizant and comply with the content of the regulatory guidance
   referenced in this AFI, as well as all Services appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund
   financial management, contracting, and accounting guidance.
   4.3.7. AOs and their respective managers will ensure procedures are in place within their
   activities that provide an approval mechanism for CH purchases prior to purchases being
   initiated. Note: Dollar thresholds, individual purchases, and budgeted amounts determine
   this. It is important that a management decision as to how and when to initiate purchases is
   known and that their respective cardholders are cognizant of those procedures.
   4.3.8. AOs and their respective activity managers and flight chiefs ensure timely receipt of
   merchandise and services is documented on invoices and/or delivery tickets by their staff,
   and that the person receiving the merchandise compares the order form to the invoice or
   delivery ticket.
   4.3.9. AOs and their respective activity managers provide training and assistance to their
   CHs on accounting document maintenance, account reconciliation, certification procedures,
   and activity purchase approval procedures.
4.4. Cardholder Responsibilities. The NAF P-Card bears the CH’s name and may only be
used by the named CH for authorized NAF purchases in compliance with this instruction and
other applicable AF NAF regulations and procedures. Issuing the NAF P-Card to a named
individual will not affect the individual’s credit rating as the bank will not list the account in the
individual CH’s name for credit reporting purposes. A CH who makes unauthorized purchases
with the NAF P-Card will be liable to the NAFI for the total dollar amount of unauthorized
purchases made to include any penalties or fees charged by the bank for these purchases. He or
she may also be subject to disciplinary action under applicable law and/or policy. (The NAF P-
Card is specially imprinted with the words ―USAF SERVICES‖ and a large red band with
 16                                                                  AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011


PURCHASING in white letters to avoid being mistaken for a personal credit card. It is also
imprinted with US Government Tax Exempt for additional clarification.) The NAFI is liable for
use of the NAF P-Card by authorized CHs.
   4.4.1. CHs ensure they do not exceed the purchase limits established for their accounts. The
   total of a single purchase may include multiple items, but cannot exceed the authorized single
   purchase limit. Purchases are denied at the point-of-sale if they exceed the established single
   purchase limit. Splitting purchases in order to stay within the single purchase limit is
   unauthorized.
   4.4.2. All items purchased over-the-counter must be available within the billing cycle. (1st
   of month to end of the month (EOM)). The item must be received or the service completed
   before the item appears on a statement of account. CHs must not place orders using the NAF
   purchase card if vendors are unable to ship the total quantity of the purchase in the same
   shipment unless: (1) all items purchased will be shipped within the same billing cycle in
   which they were ordered; or (2) all items purchased will not be shipped within the same
   billing cycle but the vendor is willing to delay billing the bank until all items are shipped.
   4.4.3. All items purchased by telephone and paid with the NAF P-Card must be delivered by
   the merchant within 30 days. Orders must not be placed without this assurance. If an item is
   not available immediately, back ordering is allowed only if procedures stated above are in
   effect. Exception: The NAF P-Card may be used to pay for delivery of subscriptions, e.g.,
   magazines, periodicals, and training seminars.
   4.4.4. CHs may use the NAF P-Card to purchase goods or services within the same NAFI or
   from another NAFI. Payment of labor costs for employees to cover short-term personnel
   needs is not authorized.
   4.4.5. CHs are required to document all purchases within the bank’s online system
   transaction notes. Use a locally devised ―outstanding items list‖ to record transactions made
   prior to the end of the month, that do not post in the system before the end of the month.
   Submit a copy of this log to the AO and the RM by the third duty day of the month. Within
   the online system, CHs record the appropriate General Ledger Account Code (GLAC), cost
   center and activity within four business days of the items posting in the system. CHs must
   also ensure the transaction notes include the items purchased and reason for the purchase as
   well as the inventory stock number, if applicable if not recorded elsewhere in the transaction.
   CHs retain copies of all documents until receipt and reconciliation of their monthly electronic
   statement of account (SOA) report. CHs attach copies of receipts for items reflected on the
   SOA and submit the SOA to their AO within three days after receipt of the monthly SOA.
   (See paragraph 4.4.18.) If sales tax is shown in the online transaction detail, check the sales
   receipt to ensure the original amount excludes sales tax and the online settlement amount
   matches the original amount.
   4.4.6. Ensure the supply or service is not one that must be purchased from mandatory NAF
   requirements contracts. If required sources provide these products or services, the CH must
   use these sources. Most of the required sources accept the NAF P-Card.
   4.4.7. Ensure the price includes delivery at Free on Board (FOB) destination. All
   transportation costs shall be included in the purchase price for NAF P-Card transactions.
AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011                                                                        17


  4.4.8. Rotate sources. Purchases of $5,000 or less are made without securing competition if
  the CH considers the prices to be fair and reasonable. Whenever practical, solicit suppliers
  other than the previous vendor before placing repeat orders. If suppliers furnish standing
  price quotations or catalog prices on a recurring basis, competition on individual purchases is
  not necessary, but CHs will periodically confirm the prices as current. When determining the
  number of sources to solicit, consider the nature of the item or service to be purchased and
  whether it is highly competitive. Use information from recent purchases of the same or
  similar items or services. Consider the urgency of the purchase, the dollar value of the
  purchase, and past experience concerning dealer prices. Distribute these purchases equitably
  among qualified vendors.
  4.4.9. Verify the quantity and quality of the items or services furnished are in accordance
  with the agreement (verbal or written) with the vendor. CHs ensure what they receive is in
  accordance with what they are being charged.
  4.4.10. For over-the-counter transactions, advise the merchant the purchase is exempt from
  state or local sales tax. (A notice of tax exemption also appears on the purchase card.) If a
  merchant questions tax-exempt status, notify the IPC for confirmation of the tax-exempt
  number. Reference: FAR 29.302, Application of State and local taxes to the Government.
  Overseas purchases may include the tax if vendors do not acknowledge tax-exempt status
  and circumstances make it impractical to buy from a local vendor which does not charge the
  tax or order from a U.S. vendor.
     4.4.10.1. Verify the dollar amount is correct and sales tax is not included.
     4.4.10.2. Sign the sales draft and retain a copy for record purposes and for verification of
     the posted transaction in the online system.
  4.4.11. When placing a telephone order using the NAF P-Card, the CH:
     4.4.11.1. Notifies the vendor the purchase is for official government purposes and is tax-
     exempt. If a merchant questions tax-exempt status, contact the IPC for the tax-exempt
     number. Purchases may include tax if vendors refuse to acknowledge tax-exempt status
     and circumstances make it impractical to order from another vendor.
     4.4.11.2. Confirms the vendor agrees not to bill the NAF P-Card account until items are
     shipped.
     4.4.11.3. Instructs the vendor to include the following information on the shipping
     document or packing slip to alert the receiving office and the NAF Accounting Office
     supplies were purchased with the purchase card: CH’s name and office symbol address;
     building number, room number, street address, city, and state; CH telephone number; and
     the term "NAF P-Card purchase."
  4.4.12. When the NAF purchase card is used as a payment method for a purchase using one
  of the purchase order or contract forms, provide the vendor the necessary contract
  information orally, either in person or by telephone, and include the statement "payment to
  be made by NAF P-Card " on the contract form. Request the vendor not process the
  transaction until the item is shipped. Upon notification of shipment from the vendor, provide
  the vendor with the NAF purchase card account number. For internal control purposes, do
  not include the NAF P-Card account number on the purchase order.
18                                                                   AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011


  4.4.13. CHs take advantage of any manufacturer/retailer rebates offered. Rebates are
  payable or endorsed to the purchasing NAFI. The CH forwards all rebates in the form of
  checks or cash to the activity cashier for deposit and processing as miscellaneous income to
  general ledger account code GLAC 8120000 on AF Form 1876, NAF Consolidated Cost
  Center Report in the purchasing activity’s cost center.
  4.4.14. When a purchase is made using the NAF P-Card, whether over the counter or by
  telephone, the CH must retain a document as proof of purchase. The document is later used
  to verify the purchase shown on the CH monthly SOA.
  4.4.15. For purchases made over the counter, the CH obtains the customer copy of the
  charge slip (make sure all carbons are destroyed). The CH documents the transaction in the
  transaction notes on the online system and keeps a copy of the charge slip to help in
  reconciling the CH SOA.
  4.4.16. For purchases made by phone, the CH may document the transaction on a locally
  devised form telephone purchase log to help in reconciling the CH SOA. They may also
  request the vendor provide some sort of document via email or fax. If a local form is used
  and someone other than the CH will receive the merchandise, the cardholder completes an
  itemized record of the order (such as an order entry form or locally devised form) to verify
  the accuracy of the order when received. The cardholder keeps a copy of this order with the
  log and provides the original to the person at the activity receiving the merchandise. The
  person receiving the merchandise compares the order form to the invoice or delivery ticket;
  annotates the appropriate GLAC and inventory stock number, if applicable; signs the
  document; and forwards it to the NAF AO no later than the next business day after receipt. If
  the item is an asset, submit the ticket with a filled out fixed asset form. The receiver gives a
  copy of the invoice or delivery ticket to the CH to use to annotate receipt of the merchandise
  and attaches to the log.
  4.4.17. The CH must reconcile their transactions in the online banking system, daily.
  Additionally, on the fifth day of the month, a SOA CH report for the previous month should
  be run (it can be set to run automatically), downloaded and printed. The SOA itemizes each
  transaction posted to the CH’s account during the past billing cycle.
     4.4.17.1. CHs must verify each purchase on the SOA for accuracy. Ensure the
     transaction amounts agree with receipts/documentation the CH has for the purchase. CHs
     and AOs must verify the statements and work any irregularities through the dispute
     process. CHs resolve disputes with the vendor to the maximum extent possible and will
     document information on disputes or variances on the SOA. CH will use the dispute
     button in the bank’s system to dispute transactions within 60 days from the post date.
     Dispute button is not used until after the CH has contacted the vendor and the vendor has
     refused to provide a refund.
     4.4.17.2. For returned items with a credit slip from the vendor, the CH verifies the SOA
     reflects the credit. If purchased items and credits are not on the next monthly SOA, the
     CH retains the transaction documentation until the purchase or credit appears on the
     SOA. If a purchase or credit does not appear in the online banking system before the
     next SOA is due, the CH or AO contacts the IPC and RMFC.
AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011                                                                          19


       4.4.17.3. The CH attaches copies of the outstanding items list, telephone purchase log
       and sales receipts, checks the SOA for accuracy, signs the document where indicated and
       forwards it to the AO within three business days of the 6th of the month.
   4.4.18. The cardholder will maintain a copy of the SOA and supporting documentation
   signed by both themselves and their AO in their cardholder binder IAW AF Records
   Disposition Schedule (AF RDS). The official copies of the SOA and supporting
   documentation may be maintained as part of the activity’s official file plan. In that case, the
   CH should have a page in their binder that states: ―signed SOA and original receipts are
   maintained in official files located at‖, then name where the files are located.
4.5. Resource Management Responsibilities.
   4.5.1. The IPC or designated individual(s) within the NAF Accounting Office provides
   initial and annual training for CHs and prepares certificates, letters or other documentation
   for attendees at the time of satisfactory completion of training. The documentation is
   provided to each attendee, and a copy is provided to respective AOs and activity managers.
   Minimum training requirements for initial and annual training are provided in paragraph 4.8.
   See Attachment 4 for a sample training letter. Flight chiefs and activity managers will
   consolidate training requirements whenever possible.
   4.5.2. The NAF Accounting Office is not required to maintain AO certified CH statements,
   purchase logs, and receipts. The NAF Accounting Office also reconciles the CMIP draws
   with Cash in Bank (CIB) and accrues for outstanding purchases that did not post to the online
   system at the end of the month to ensure transactions are entered into the correct accounting
   month.
   4.5.3. The NAF Accounting Office accrues for items when those items do not post in the
   online system prior to the EOM in which they were purchased. The cardholder will send the
   locally devised ―outstanding items‖ log to the NAF Accounting Office within one business
   day after EOM.
4.6. Refunds or Rebates. Quarterly, the bank provides rebates to AFSVA based on sales and
prompt payment. These rebates are then distributed to the installation/unit by AFSVA Treasury
Division.
4.7. Document Retention. The cardholder, AO, IPC and Resource Manager retain documents
according to AF RDS Table 64-4, Rule 26.
4.8. Training. All personnel must complete all required NAF P-Card program training in
program management office instructions on the HQ AFSVA NAF P-Card website prior to card
issuance. The Resource Manager, CO, or the IPC conducts the orientation/training providing
information and basic instructions on how to use the NAF P-Card to cardholders and Approving
Officials according to this instruction. All CHs and AOs must read and be familiar with the
requirements of this instruction and other applicable regulatory guidance.
   4.8.1. Annually, all CHs and AOs must take the online refresher training on the HQ AFSVA
   NAF P-Card website and provide a copy of their completion to the IPC. At the discretion of
   the Resource Manager, CHs and AOs can be required to attend an annual classroom training
   session conducted by the IPC, CO, or Resource Manager, which will include a review of this
   instruction and a discussion of issues noted at their installation. They will receive and sign a
 20                                                                  AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011


   document certifying they received this training. A sample training record is provided in
   Attachment 4. The IPC retains this document while the cardholders and AOs are active
   users in the bank’s online system.
4.9. Resolving Disputed Purchases. Disputed purchase items must be resolved between the
CH, the vendor, and the bank. In most cases, CHs are able to resolve problems by contacting the
vendor. If problems cannot be resolved with the vendor within 45 days of the charge appearing
on the CH’s statement, the CH must click the ―dispute‖ button within the bank’s online system.
The bank allows up to 60 days to submit a dispute.
   4.9.1. The following paragraphs explain when to complete and submit a dispute:
       4.9.1.1. Merchandise/service not received. CHs do not immediately dispute charges
       when an authorized purchase appears in the online system, but was not received. Instead,
       the CH contacts the vendor to verify shipment was made or service rendered. Make a
       note of non-receipt in the ―Outstanding Items List‖. If the vendor states the items were
       shipped and they are not received after 45 days, the CH clicks the dispute button in the
       transaction detail in the bank’s online system. The CH will need to put in their email
       address and the reason for the dispute in the system and click the submit button. The
       cardholder must dispute the transaction not later than 60 days after the item posted to the
       bank’s online system.
       4.9.1.2. Merchandise returned, credit not received, or duplicate processing. CHs attempt
       to resolve disputes with the vendor. If no resolution is reached, the CH clicks the dispute
       button in the original transaction for the returned merchandise. The CH must dispute the
       transaction no later than 60 days after the item posted to the online banking system.
       4.9.1.3. Unauthorized mail, internet, phone orders, alteration of amount, or unrecognized
       charges. CHs immediately attempt to resolve these disputes with the vendor. For
       disputes that cannot be resolved or if the vendor has no number, CHs immediately call
       the bank to report the problem and to determine if they have a number to contact the
       vendor. Note: If the charge appears to be fraudulent, the bank will close the CH account
       and open a new account.
       4.9.1.4. Defective items. CHs obtain replacement or correction item(s) for defective
       items from the vendor as soon as possible. If, after 45 days items are not replaced or
       corrected, CHs dispute the transaction in the bank’s online system by opening the
       transaction and clicking on the dispute button, inputting their email address, the reason
       for the dispute, and submitting it to the bank. The transaction must be disputed within 60
       days of posting in the bank’s online system.
       4.9.1.5. Sales tax and transportation costs. Sales tax or transportation costs erroneously
       charged by a vendor cannot be disputed through Visa Chargeback Regulations. CHs
       make every effort to obtain a credit to their account for the amount of the tax or
       transportation costs from the vendor. If a credit is not obtained, ordering agencies must
       pay the tax or transportation costs. Do not submit a dispute for tax or transportation
       costs.
   4.9.2. Upon receipt of a dispute, the bank places the charge in dispute until resolved. The
   bank verifies disputed charges. For valid disputes, the bank issues a credit against the CH’s
   SOA for the disputed amount.
AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011                                                                        21


   4.9.3. The bank notifies the CH of any denied disputed amounts.
   4.9.4. The CH records any resolved dispute credits received to the same expense GLAC and
   cost center used to record the original expense.
4.10. Card Reissue. The bank reissues a NAF P-Card every 36 months to each active CH.
4.11. NAF P-Card Program Surveillance Requirements.
   4.11.1. AFI 65-107, Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management Oversight
   Responsibilities, requires the Nonappropriated Fund Financial Analyst (NAFFA) conduct an
   annual review of the NAF P-Card program. Additionally, the IPC will perform periodic
   reviews of the NAF P-Card program using this checklist and in conjunction with their
   random reviews of newly appointed CHs to ensure all CHs are effectively performing their
   duties and following all procedures.
   4.11.2. The IPC takes advantage of bank automated systems which provide capabilities to
   examine reports of denied transactions for purchases from unauthorized merchants,
   violations of limits, and other irregular activities. The system also provides capabilities to
   determine non-use or low use of the card. The IPC will terminate those cards with no use in
   a three-month period, unless given specific justification as to why the card is required. The
   IPC uses these capabilities as part of the surveillance program and conducts on-site reviews
   immediately on CHs where violations are noted.
   4.11.3. The IPC maintains surveillance results on file in the NAF Accounting Office
   according to AF RDS. Copies of the surveillance results are forwarded to the FSS
   Commander/Director, the CH’s AO, and the CH. The IPC will meet with the CH to discuss
   each finding of noncompliance.
4.12. Violation of Air Force NAF P-Card Program Procedures. If, as a result of findings
from a surveillance visit or by any other means, it is discovered the CH is in violation of the
procedures contained herein, appropriate actions must be taken to preclude a reoccurrence.
Action taken will be commensurate with the violation(s). If a loss of NAF assets results from a
CH’s simple negligence, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the IPC takes action according
to procedures in AFI 34-202, Chapter 6, to determine pecuniary liability to recoup the loss. If
deemed necessary, a memo describing the violation and any remedial action(s) taken, and signed
by the FSS Commander/Director, is sent to the CH and AO. Depending upon the circumstances
of the violation, the IPC also takes appropriate action to reduce the CH’s monthly purchase limit
to $1.00 and suspends the card until the CH receives remedial training or the IPC cancels the
account and revokes NAF P-Card privileges for the CH.
4.13. Canceling Accounts. Upon reassignment, separation, retirement of the CH, or non-
activation of the card, the IPC will ensure the following actions are taken:
   4.13.1. The CH surrenders his/her card(s) for destruction and all documentation to the AO to
   be maintained by the IPC.
   4.13.2. AOs must notify the IPC in a timely manner (five calendar days upon receipt of
   notification from appropriate authority or the CH) to close accounts of CHs who have retired,
   separated, been reassigned, or who no longer have CHs responsibilities.
 22                                                                   AFI34-275 23 JUNE 2011


   4.13.3. The IPC closes the account in the bank’s online system and documents the reason in
   the system account and employee records and adds notes prior to changing the card status to
   ―closed‖.
4.14. Lost or Stolen Cards. CHs immediately report lost or stolen P-Cards to the bank, their
AO, and the IPC. The AO submits a written report (can be email) through the IPC to the HQ
AFSVA NAF Purchase card Agency Program Coordinator within five workdays of discovery of
a lost or stolen purchase card. The report includes the last four digits of the NAF purchase card
account number, the CH’s complete name, date and location of the loss, and the date reported to
police; the date and time the bank was notified; information about any purchase(s) made on the
day the NAF P-Card was lost or stolen; and any other pertinent information.
4.15. Replacement Cards. Upon notification of a lost or stolen card, the bank mails a new
NAF Purchase card within 24 hours (Monday through Friday). For international card
replacement, the bank mails a lost or stolen card within 48 hours of the reported loss or theft. If
the CH finds the original NAF P-Card, he or she cuts it in half and gives it to the IPC who
destroys it and notifies HQ AFSVA NAF P-Card Team via email regarding the destruction.
4.16. Foreign Purchases. Transactions initiated in a foreign currency post to an account in U.S.
dollars and may differ from the amount quoted by the vendor. The difference is the currency
conversion rate in effect for that purchase period and it may be higher or lower than the rate in
effect on the date of actual purchase. A VISA currency fee of 1% is also applied to the
transaction amount.
4.17. Base Closure. Use of the NAF P-Card should decrease and eventually terminate as
activities close. Follow procedures in AFI 34-201 on dissolving a NAFI prior to base closure.
