SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updates since the last publication are correction to minor errors to common aircraft systems.
1. General . The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness

Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable
aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded
mission systems such as prime mission equipment.
1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A
Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be
configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit's
requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
1.4. Reading the MESL . A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit code
(WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL) across
the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability
of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft; therefore, it is
important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL that are applicable to the unit's
assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and
report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with
TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TNG
columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the
FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the
MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
