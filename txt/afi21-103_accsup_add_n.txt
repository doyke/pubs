SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Mission columns have
been changed. Numerous systems Work Unit Codes (WUCs) and notes have been added or
deleted to better clarify mission capability requirements.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test or other missions. MESLs are not comprehensive WUC lists and are not
intended to mirror Minimum Equipment Lists. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in
readiness Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission
Capable (MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission in accordance with
COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
     be configured and generated to Mission Ready Available (MRA) status at an employment
     site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
     MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the
     unit's requirements, and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
     code (WUC) against the Full System Lists (FSL) and all applicable Basic System Lists
     (BSL)s across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement
     determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned
     aircraft and therefore it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL,
     which are applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with Combat Coded
     (CC) (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL
     columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would
     determine and report status using only the FSL and Training (TNG) columns, and units with
     CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TST
     columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL
     columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
