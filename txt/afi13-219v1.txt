                                            Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General. Although CCT and STO personnel are separate and distinct Air Force Specialties
with unique skill sets and capabilities, they do maintain some similar skill sets. These skill sets
are defined as the capability to shoot, move (to include tactical methods of insertion/extraction),
and communicate during all Special Tactics (ST) missions. Additionally, all CCT and STO
personnel are required to be world-wide deployable, trained in basic mobility processes and
operational deployment planning.
1.2. Policy. This instruction identifies the training requirements for CCT and STO. It
establishes a benchmark set of training events for commanders to use to increase/maintain depth
of knowledge and quantify task proficiency (results of training). Establishment of this
benchmark allows training to be accomplished at each organizational level and to be evaluated
under comparison for effectiveness while allowing for unit -unique training. Unit commanders
may institute more demanding training criteria to meet mission requirements, and must develop
lesson plans for unit-unique training requirements, but as a minimum, must report against this
published standard. Submit proposed changes through your chain of command to AF/A3O -AS
Workflow (SMPT: AF/A3OS.worflow@pentagon.af.mil) on AD Form 847.
1.3. Program Goals. The Air Force CCT and STO training program ensures all CCT and STO
obtain and maintain the qualification and proficiency needed to effectively perform their unit’s
mission. Programs should strive to fully prepare CCT and STO forces for wartime and
operational success. Safe, relevant, realistic and thorough training is the best way to prepare for
combat and other operational missions. The end state of CCT and STO training is complete
operational success on the battlefield and objective areas, the fulfillment of the Joint Forces
Commanders intent, and the safe and honorable return from each mission.
1.4. Waiver Authority. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, HQ USAF/A3O -A is
the waiver authority for this instruction. Request waivers to the basic guidance in this instruction
through applicable training channels to the MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent. MAJCOM/A3s will
forward request in message or memo format to HQ USAF/A3O -A, with a copy provided to HQ
USAF/A3O-AS. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled by the MAJCOM agency
that generated the supplement.
1.5. Responsibilities.
     1.5.1. HQ USAF/A3O-A:

                                            Chapter 4

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Overview. The continuation training program provides CCT/STO with the volume,
frequency and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification
level.
4.2. General Requirements. Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events.
Commanders will ensure operators receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual
proficiency. All training requirements are derived from mission guidance letters (MGL) and
correspond to mission essential task lists (METLs) and formal school syllabus training
requirements. Any training that does not specifically support MAJCOM and unit METLs or
formal school training should be questioned and reviewed by the unit commander.
4.3. Training Tasks. Training tasks allow for objective measurement of unit core task
proficiency. Each of the ST core, supporting and collateral tasks has associated training tasks
with defined and measurable conditions and standards. Each training task has a discreet task
identifier which will be loaded in Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) that allows unit
commanders to effectively track unit training and measure readiness in the unit. Required
training tasks reflect those skills identified by the lead MAJCOM for ST (AFSOC) as critical to
all ST forces and must be accomplished within the designated time period to retain currency.
Unit commanders select and prioritize training tasks based upon the unit’s assigned or likely
missions. While unit commanders may mandate more stringent conditions/standards/frequency
for the training tasks published within this instruction, they may not impose less stringent ones.
   4.3.1. Currency and Proficiency Training. Proficiency training is conducted to increase skill
   and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. Currency training is conducted to
   ensure competence in designated skills and qualifications. The CCT and STO Training Task
   (Attachment 3) outline the required condition, standard, and (Attachment 4) outlines
   frequency necessary to maintain currency and proficiency. Frequency standards are based
   upon a floating 365-day calendar. NOTE: Frequency standards for currency may not be the
   same as frequency standards for pay-related training items.
       4.3.1.1. Senior CCT and STO fulfilling key staff positions are required to maintain only
       those training currencies as outlined in Attachment 2 to this instruction. Key staff
       personnel are defined as those assigned to MAJCOM staff or higher positions, and others
       as identified by the MAJCOM, that would not normally be considered required to deploy
       as an ―operator‖. All CCT/STO assigned to AETC are also considered to be in key staff
       positions.
       4.3.1.2. If an individual does not accomplish a given task (Attachment 4) within the
       specified time period, the individual will become non-current and must accomplish the
       task in the presence of a trainer or certifier who is qualified in that task in order to
       become current again.
       4.3.1.3. Decertification and Retraining. If the individual is found to be non-proficient in
       a particular task then the individual will be decertified in that task. Decertification will be
       annotated in the individual’s AF Form 623, Individual Training Record. The individual
       will be retrained and recertified to meet the TCS for the applicable line item and any
AFI13-219V1 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                     11


       local, MAJCOM and/or Air Force guidance. Manage task certification and de-
       certification IAW AFI 36 -2201 Volume 3, and the applicable CFETP. Airmen that fail to
       meet the skill level standards IAW the CFETP will be reclassified to a new skill level or
       AFS IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). Prior to
       the member’s retraining/recertifying the individual will not perform any operational
       missions.
       4.3.1.4. Ancillary tasks: Conduct general Air Force ancillary training IAW AFI 36-2201
       Volume 1, Guidance Memorandum on Ancillary Training. Attachment 3 contains
       standard ARMS identifier codes to be used to track ancillary training for CCT/STO.
4.4. Core Skills. Train in order to be 100 percent successful in executing tasked missions. ST
units must be experts at employing priority core skills in combat and when called upon to
perform other missions. CCT and STO have many skills to maintain, and unit commanders must
strive for balance in core skill proficiency. Also, whenever possible, tailor and focus training for
known or projected missions. Listed below are the core skills for Combat Controllers. Core skills
are those most essential to accomplishing the ST mission sets and therefore receive highest
training priority:
   4.4.1. Combat Control Core Skills:
       4.4.1.1. JTAC Operations/Fire Support planning, guidance and control. Fire support
       training should involve difficult battlefield air operations scenarios as well as classroom
       academics. Look for opportunities to train with a variety of aerial attack platforms (i.e.
       bombers, fighters, gunships, helicopters and UAVs.) Incorporate fire support planning,
       especially in the joint environment. Additionally, conduct classroom and field training
       aimed at increasing CCT understanding and proficiency in ―weapons effects‖ especially
       with emerging munitions. Training in Naval Gunfire and Artillery direction is the lowest
       fire direction skill priority -- train in these skills as opportunities present themselves.
       4.4.1.2. Air Traffic Control. Maximize use of ATC simulators. Integrate as many core
       skill training events as possible into the simulator scenarios (i.e. ATC, JTAC, CFF and
       assault zone operations).
       4.4.1.3. Assault Zone (AZ) Operations. Train to and practice airfield operations and
       planning. Make use of exercises and AZ activities for training opportunities. Train with
       Contingency Response Group (CRG) elements when able on common ―open the airbase‖
       skills. Look for opportunities to train in airfield seizure operations with joint force
       counterparts.
       4.4.1.4. C2 Communications. Ensure combat controllers are communications experts
       with each assigned radio, including state-of-the-art data transmission and machine-to-
       machine technology.
       4.4.1.5. Combat/Tactical Operations (shoot/move/communicate). Train in field skills,
       small unit tactics, light and heavy weaponry, close quarter battle and immediate action
       drills both mounted and dismounted.
       4.4.1.6. Tactical Survey/Assessment. Train and maintain assault zone assessment/tactical
       survey skills. Additionally, train for mounted armed reconnaissance and surveillance
       operations.
 12                                                     AFI13-219V1 23 FEBRUARY 2009


      4.4.1.7. Combat Search and Rescue Operations (CSAR). Include SAR Security Team
      (SST) TTPs in CSAR training events.
      4.4.1.8. Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) Operations. Train on unit assigned
      SUAS. Where possible include them in core skill training events.
      4.4.1.9. Limited Weather Observation. Weather training should be included in all assault
      zone and air traffic control core skill training events.
      4.4.1.10. Demolitions. World events have forced demolition training back to a core skill
      requirement for all CCT/STO. Train to be proficient with SOF counterpart demolition
      equipment and TTPs.
   4.4.2. Special Tactics Officer (STO) Training. STOs are first and foremost combat leaders,
   train and employ them for this role. Simultaneously, STOs must be thoroughly trained in
   planning, coordinating and working in an Operations Center (STOC, TOC, JOC, AOC, etc.)
   Provide both the academic training and practical experience to ensure STOs succeed at the
   C2 level. STOs need to be familiar with all ST mission sets. Recommend all STOs get
   initially certified as JTACs and receive training in CSAR/PR operations as part of ST
   Advanced Skills Training. Commanders will ensure that all of their assigned STOs receive
   training and exposure to CSAR/PR mission sets – especially officers in ST units with
   assigned PJs who have the greatest opportunity and most pressing need for this training.
4.5. Supporting Task Training.
   4.5.1. Employment and Movement Skills Training. CCT/STO use a variety of tactical
   movement methods in order to get to the fight. Every effort should be made to maintain
   proficiency in these areas, but at a minimum CCT/STO need to be mission ready. When
   advance notice is available for deployments that indicate a specific employment method is
   probable, units should make every effort to become more proficient in this employment
   method.
      4.5.1.1. Tactical Land Vehicle Movement/Convoy  Operations,  primarily
      HMMWV/GMVs, ATV/bikes and when applicable, non-standard (HI-LUX-type)
      vehicles.
      4.5.1.2. Overland/Global Positioning (GPS)/Map & Compass Navigation, Moving Map
      and Falcon View.
      4.5.1.3. Helo/Air Assault Operations/Alternate Insertion Extraction (AIEs) (primarily
      fast rope, rope ladder, airland).
      4.5.1.4. High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) and Static Line (SL) Parachuting
      Operations.
      4.5.1.5. Amphibious/Over the Beach (OTB) Operations.
      4.5.1.6. Combat (SCUBA) Diving/Swimmer, Open and Closed Circuit.
      4.5.1.7. High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) Parachuting Operations.
   4.5.2. Environmental Training. Critical to success is the ability to move and operate in a
   variety of environments. Conduct environmental training in conjunction with core skill
   training and when opportunities present themselves. The priorities for training in each
AFI13-219V1 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   13


   environment will be determined by each STS commander based on current/projected
   taskings, operator environmental experience levels and training opportunities. Conduct
   CBRN training as part of both environmental and core skills training. CCT/STO top
   environmental training priorities (NOT in order of precedence) are:
       4.5.2.1. Urban.
       4.5.2.2. Mountain/High Altitude.
       4.5.2.3. Cold Weather/Arctic.
       4.5.2.4. Desert.
       4.5.2.5. Water (especially water rescue).
       4.5.2.6. Jungle.
   4.5.3. Operational Preparation of the Environment. OPE is another mission area getting
   increased attention and emphasis -- especially in the GWOT environment. Look for training
   opportunities to expand expertise and capabilities in this growth area.
   4.5.4. Planning. Absolutely essential to ST operations is the ability to plan tactical
   operations. We have had great success with the proven concept of having those that execute
   an operation play a key role in planning it. Ensure planning skills and techniques are taught,
   practiced and developed at all levels -- including joint planning skills and procedures. Each
   squadron will maintain a training program in Special Tactics Operation Center (STOC)
   operations.
4.6. Collateral Tasks. These tasks are not necessarily primary functions of CCT/STO, but
based on their inherent capabilities they are able to accomplish these missions. Training on these
events is the lowest priority unless assigned to a unit that has one of these mission areas as a
documented task (i.e. 6th SOS).
   4.6.1. Foreign Internal Defense (FID).
   4.6.2. Humanitarian Operations.
4.7. Tasks, Conditions, and Standards (TCS). TCSs identify what is required (the task),
under what conditions the task is required to be accomplished (the condition), and how the task
is to be accomplished or what the required results are (the standard). Attachment 4 describes the
TCSs associated with each training event.

                                            Chapter 5

                      UPGRADE AND ADVANCE QUALIFICATIONS

5.1. Overview. Upgrade training (UGT) leads to award of the higher skill level or special
qualification and is designed to increase skills and abilities. AFSC UGT requirements are
outlined in this AFI and the 1C2 CFETP. CCT must also meet the minimum requirements
outlined in AFI 36-2201 Volume 3, AFI 36 -2101, the Officer Classification Directory (OCD)
and the Enlisted Classification Directory (ECD).
5.2. General Upgrade Requirements. CCT must complete all mandatory training
requirements as outlined in their CFETP for award of 3-5-7-9 skill levels. Waiver requirements
are described in AFI 36-2201 Vol 3. The basis for the go/no go criteria that the trainee is held to
for passing for certification will be in the TCS for the applicable task line number. The Air Force
has set the standard of 3c IAW the qualitative requirements proficiency code key from the
specialty training standard as a base requirement for the go/no go criteria. All CCT/STO
maintaining mission ready status must keep current OJT records. Key staff positions as identified
in paragraph 4.3.1.1 of this instruction in the rank of E-7 or above for CCT and all STO that are
not maintaining mission ready status are not required to maintain current OJT records. CCT/STO
will keep training records in a caretaker status to facilitate rapid transition to operational status
when assignments change.
   5.2.1. Timelines for upgrade training are determined by unit commanders but must meet the
   minimum requirements in AFI 36-2201 Volume 3.
   5.2.2. Prior Service/Sister Service accessions personnel who have completed all UGT
   requirements may have their time in upgrade training requirement waived for award of 5 -
   level. Commanders may request waivers from HQ USAF/A3O -AS through the 720 OSS and
   MAJCO M functional manager.
   5.2.3. Task trainers will meet prerequisites outlined in AFI 36 -2201 Volume 2. Trainers will
   maintain proficiency on all tasks, train only on those tasks they are qualified and current in as
   documented in their Air Force Form 623. Each trainer must attend the Air Force Training
   Course and be recommended by their supervisor. Trainers are selected based on their
   experience level and ability to provide instruction to the trainees. They must receive an
   evaluation by another unit trainer prior to being qualified as a trainer. At a minimum,
   prospective trainers will watch a performance based training task and teach a trainee using a
   lesson plan under the control of a qualified trainer prior to receiving their evaluation. Task
   certifiers are not required for CCT/STO CFETP items as determined by the Air Force Career
   Field Managers.
   5.2.4. Task certifiers are required for certain advanced skill qualifications covered by other
   AFIs such as JTAC upgrades. For these events, task certifiers will be trained and certified
   IAW AFI36-2201 Volume 2 and identified by letter from the unit commander.
5.3. Advanced Qualifications: All CCT/STO possessing advanced qualifications will receive
an initial evaluation by a qualified and current trainer and will be assigned in writing by the unit
commander. Dive supervisor, static line jumpmaster and military freefall jumpmaster require
attendance at an Air Force or MAJCOM approved formal course of instruction. Other sources of
training such as a civilian equivalent course must be approved by the MAJCOM/A3.
AFI13-219V1 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  15


  5.3.1. Other advanced qualifications are obtained through in-unit upgrade following
  established MAJCOM guidelines. The AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations, or Stan
  Eval Evaluator guides will be used to document task qualification if the item is not located in
  the AFSC-specific Job qualification Standard (JQS). The AF Form 1098, Special Task
  Certification and Recurring Training will be used to identify and document items that
  require periodic recurring evaluation. All jumpmaster qualifications require aeronautical
  orders to be published and maintained in the individuals Aviation Resource Management
  (ARM) training folder as indicated in chapter six of this instruction. Commanders will
  authorize diving and demolition duty by publishing M-series orders. Where special orders are
  not appropriate, commanders will appoint individuals in writing.
  5.3.2. Skills not common to all operators in the unit and used in operational missions will be
  tracked on an in-house generated product known as a letter of X’s’. Units will develop their
  own letter of X’s based on their mission needs. This product is not an official document to
  annotate skill qualifications but an expedient tool for mission planning and team assignment.
  5.3.3. Joint Terminal Attack Control (JTAC) initial training, evaluation, currency and
  advanced qualifications and documentation (instructor/evaluator) will be IAW AFI 13 -112
  Volume 1, Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) Training Program and AFI 13-112
  Volume 2, Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) Standardization/Evaluation Program
  and Chapter 6 of this instruction.

                                     DOCUMENTATION

6.1. Overview. The AF Form 623 is the primary document for annotating initial and upgrade
training. Mission essential currency training requirements are normally documented in the
Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS). JTAC training is documented in a JTAC
training folder IAW AFI 13-112 Volume 1 and AFI 13-112 Volume 2.
6.2. General Requirements. Procedures for the documentation of training are outlined below.
If guidance for documentation in this instruction conflicts with existing or newly published
instructions, the governing AFI will take precedence. Specifically, AFI 36-2201 Volumes 1-3
mandate various training and documentation requirements utilizing prescribed forms. AFI 13-
112 Volume 1 and AFI 13-112 Volume 2 govern JTAC training and documentation, and AFI 11-
410, Personnel Parachute Operations, and 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service,
Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, govern ARMS documentation requirements and procedures.
6.3. Air Force Form 623. The primary document for annotating initial and upgrade training is
the AF Form 623. CCT in the rank of E-6 and below and STO in the rank of O-4 and below that
are not assigned to key staff positions (STO only) as identified in paragraph 4.3.1.1 of this
instruction are required to maintain AF Form 623. The AF Form 623 is divided into tabs which
are labeled at the bottom of the cover page. Each label should start with the top tab and run form
left to right.
   6.3.1. Tab 1 – CFETP. Maintain the 1C2X1 CCT/STO CFETP at tab 1. AF Form 797, Job
   Qualification Standard Continuation Sheet, will be maintained behind the CFETP. This form
   is used to list training tasks not listed in the CFETP, such as tactics, techniques, equipment
   and/or employment methods.
   6.3.2. Tab 2 - AF Form 623a, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet. This form
   (or equivalent) is used for those comments specified by AFI 36-2201. Initial evaluations,
   break in training, lack of training capability or situations interfering with a members UGT
   will be documented. Individuals in upgrade training (UGT) will file Extension Course
   Institute (ECI) Form 9, Volume Review Exercise, and ECI Form 34, Certification of Course
   Completion, on top of the CFETP. Remove these forms when UGT is complete.
   6.3.3. Tab 3 – Ancillary Training. Ancillary training reports (i.e. ARMS or Web Application
   products) are maintained under this tab. However, UTM and/or Aviation Resource Managers
   may track ancillary training in ARMS or STARTS/ST Web and place a memorandum behind
   the tab indicating the action. AF Form 1098, will be placed behind the ancillary training
   report. This form is used to record recurring training to include re-certification for tasks not
   tracked in ARMS, examples are range control officer, Mobile Microwave Landing System
   (MMLS), coxswain etc.
   6.3.4. Tab 4 - AFSOC Form 10, Individual Dive Record. Individuals may document training
   on AFSOC Form 10, US Navy Dive Reporting System (DRS) print out or ARMS report
   posted in this tab. If not maintained in this tab, indicate using a memorandum where the data
   is maintained.
AFI13-219V1 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   17


   6.3.5. Tab 5 -AF Form 803, Task Evaluation Form. A copy of all tasks using the Form 803
   or evaluator guide will be maintained for all spot checks and written or practical evaluations
   conducted on all operators IAW AFI 13-219 Volume 2.
   6.3.6. Tab 6 - Basic and Certification Documentation. Maintain a copy of special orders or
   commander certification letters placing individual on, or removing from demolition duty,
   dive duty, or other basic qualifications IAW Chapter 5 of this instruction.
   6.3.7. Tab 7 - Advanced Skills Documentation. Post unit task trainer/certifiers, dive
   supervisor, static line/freefall jumpmasters, rope/cast masters, Certified Tower Operator
   (CTO) certification (AF Form 3622, Air Traffic Control/Weather Certification and Rating
   Record), ATC proficiency training and certificates of graduation from formal courses.
6.4. ARMS Reports. The Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) is the official Air
Force approved database for tracking all mission essential training tasks for CCT/STO operators
IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
ARMS are a versatile tool that provides commanders, team leaders, supervisors, and individuals
with a record of ground/jump/flying training accomplishments and a measurement of currencies.
The Aviation Resource Manager will:
   6.4.1. Monitor, maintain, and update the ARMS database with the current Task Identifiers,
   frequency and volume requirements within this publication based on an annual training cycle
   (Jan– Dec).
   6.4.2. Maintain and update Unit Training Accomplishment report (TAR) to reflect current
   training in ARMS.
   6.4.3. Track Operator’s training and provides ARM products on an ―as needed‖ basis. At a
   minimum ARM personnel will maintain a copy of the Individual Training Summary (ITS) or
   other ARMS/Browser training products on each active aircrew/jump member assigned to
   their respective unit on a monthly basis. Upon PCS/PCA, a copy of the most current ITS will
   be placed in the member’s 6-Part ARM training folder (listed below) for individual to hand-
   carry to next unit of assignment. Upon arrival, they must turn in their ARM training folder
   within 10 days of assignment to the unit ARM personnel. ARM personnel must ensure the
   ARMS database is updated according to the Individual Training Summary once the HARM
   office has in processed the member.
   6.4.4. Maintain ARM training folder on each active aircrew/jump member assigned. Ensure
   each folder has a Privacy Act sticker. Using a 6 -part folder, the items to be contained are as
   follows:
       6.4.4.1. Part 1 - In/Out Processing (Checklist, PCS Orders, PCS ITS, Pay Briefing, and
       other documents, as needed.).

       6.4.5.3. Physiological Training (if applicable).
       6.4.5.4. Current Aeronautical Orders.
       6.4.5.5. Emergency Procedures (HALO, HAHO).
   6.4.6. Retain warning orders for current and previous training cycles (2 years). Have the
   Jumpmaster annotate on the warning order if the jump did not go due to lack of aircraft,
   aircraft malfunction, weather, etc.
6.5. Terminal Attack Control (TAC) Folder. TAC folders will be maintained IAW AFI 13-
112 Volume 1 and held at the unit TAC shop. TAC folders will be maintained and secured by the
TAC Program Manger or Chief TAC-I/SEE. CCT/STO personnel will hand carry copies of the
following information from their TAC folder on any TDY or deployment that requires TAC
duties.
6.6. Ancillary Training. Special Tactics Ancillary Resource Tracking System (STARTS) or
Special Tactics Web Apps (ST Web) may be used to track all ancillary training for CCT/STO
personnel. STARTS/ST Web may be used in conjunction with ARMS to track operator ancillary
training. All efforts will be made not to duplicate documentation. As the Air Force transitions
ancillary training to web based training and tracking system on the Air Force portal, CCT/STO
ancillary training will adjust accordingly.
6.7. Information Collection, Records, and Forms.
   6.7.1. Information Collections. No information collections are created by this publication.
   6.7.2. Records. The program records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this
   publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33 -363 and disposed of in
   accordance with the AFRIMS RDS located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af61/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
