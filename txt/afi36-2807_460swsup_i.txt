                                        GRAY EAGLE AWARD

2.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedures for the Gray Eagle Award, assigns appropriate
responsibilities, and establishes selection criteria. All Air Force general officer line pilots currently on
active duty are eligible. Eligible general officers in the Air Reserve Component (ARC) (Air National
Guard [ANG] and Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC]) must be on extended active duty (EAD).

2.2. Background of Award. The Gray Eagle Award is presented annually to honor the US Air Force gen-
eral officer pilot with the longest period of continuous aviation service.

2.3. Purpose of Award. This award recognizes the long service, depth of experience, and broad aviation
knowledge of senior Air Force pilots. By honoring the pilot with the longest continuous aviation service,
the Air Force reinforces the camaraderie and heritage within the pilot fraternity, recognizes the distinct
accomplishments of Air Force pilots, and highlights the total force strength of the United States Air Force.
Senior pilots set an example for those who follow, and this award recognizes their leadership and achieve-
ments.

2.4. Description of the Award. The award consists of two elements: a permanent trophy on display at
Headquarters Air Force and a miniature replica presented to the recipient. The name of the winner will be
engraved on the permanent trophy.

2.5. Responsibilities.
   2.5.1. HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans and Requirements (HQ USAF/A3/5)
   administers the award. HQ USAF/A3/5 maintains the precedence list for prospective Gray Eagles
   according to eligibility criteria based on aviation service data (date of original rating) and advises the
   Chief of Staff when the award is to be transferred.
   2.5.2. HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower and Personnel (HQ USAF/A1) maintains person-
   nel data to determine eligible candidates.
   2.5.3. The Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) prepares a public release
   announcement as required.
   2.5.4. HQ USAF Air Force Protocol (HQ USAF/CVAP) maintains and updates the Gray Eagle Tro-
   phy on display at Headquarters Air Force and the miniature replica for presentation.
   2.5.5. HQ USAF Executive Review Secretariat (HQ USAF/CVAS) arranges presentation of the
   award as a Corona Top agenda item.

2.6. Eligibility Criteria. All active duty Air Force general officer line pilots are eligible. Longevity is
based on the date pilot wings were awarded (date of original rating). The general officer pilot on active
duty or in the ARC on EAD, holding the longest original rating date with at least one year of retainability
as of 15 June, not recalled and without a break in service, will be designated the Gray Eagle. A “break in
service” is a period of more than 12 months when the pilot transferred from active duty to the ARC or
from the ARC to active duty. If two or more pilots have the same original rating date, the senior officer
(based upon date of rank in current grade) will be designated the Gray Eagle.

                                 AIRFIELD OPERATIONS AWARDS

3.1. Introduction. This chapter provides procedural guidance for the US Air Force Airfield Management
(AM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) Awards Program; explains the Lt General Gordon A. Blake Aircraft
Save Award and Aircraft Assist Award, eligibility, and procedures for submissions; describes the annual
AM and ATC awards and nomination procedures. It specifies procedures to recognize personnel who
have made notable contributions to the AM or ATC fields. It provides for US Air Force participation in
the Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) awards competition. This award applies to all Air Force
activities that provide AM or ATC services. Air Force Recognition Ribbon Eligibility; award of this rib-
bon is authorized to recipients selected or announced as recipients of AF level special trophies and
awards. Named individuals who receive a functional AF level award managed by the functional area, who
participate in AF wide competition in that functional specialty are entitled to wear the Air Force Recogni-
tion Ribbon.

3.2. Lt General Gordon A. Blake Aircraft Save Award and Aircraft Award and Aircraft Assist
Award:
   3.2.1. Award Criteria. Aircraft “Save” Award is for any action taken by ATC or AM personnel that
   result in the safe recovery of an imperiled airborne aircraft or help given to an endangered aircraft on
   the ground. The performance must clearly extend beyond normal duty requirements, be professional,
   and cast no reasonable doubt that, without this action, probable damage would have resulted. If a
   nomination is not approved for a “Save,” then it will be considered for the Aircraft “Assist” Award.
   “Assist” Awards will be awarded to personnel using the “Save” criteria, except that the performance
   does not have to extend beyond normal duty requirements.
   3.2.2. Award Eligibility. All US Air Force air traffic controllers and airfield management personnel
   are eligible. Any other military or civilian performing ATC or AM duties in a US Air Force-operated
   or augmented facility, or in an ANG-unit facility, are eligible. Recognition under this program does
   not make individuals ineligible for awards under AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Awards and Decora-
   tions Program.
   3.2.3. Who May Nominate. Any person, other than the nominee, having knowledge of the individ-
   ual's actions may submit a nomination for this award.

        3.2.4.8. Narrative of events.
     3.2.5. The nomination narrative will contain factual and specific data and be a factual account of the
     actions to recover or aid the aircraft. Furnish enough detail for the board to evaluate the events or sit-
     uation. Avoid generalities, broad or vague terminology, locally used acronyms, contractions, abbrevi-
     ations, or restatements of normal duties. The narrative also must include specific actions or
     contributions of each individual.
     3.2.6. Include the following information in the nomination package:
        3.2.6.1. A certified tape and certified printed recording of the event. Send only that portion sup-
        porting the nomination. State in the commander’s letter if a tape recording was not available.

        ments from other controllers) supporting the nomination package.
     3.2.7. Send the original nomination package within 30 workdays to HQ AFFSA/A3A, 7919 Mid
     America Boulevard, Suite 304, Oklahoma City, OK 73135, or e-mail nominations to
     hqaffsa.a3a@tinker.af.mil. Send a copy to the parent MAJCOM OPR for air traffic services. The
     Operations Support Squadron Commander (or equivalent) signs the nomination package.
     3.2.8. “Save” Review Board. HQ AFFSA will convene a "Save" review board at least quarterly. The
     board will assess nomination packages and select "Save" award recipients. Board members will con-
     sist of officer and senior enlisted airfield operations personnel. The Director of Airfield Operations

     member. The award may also be given for “gallantry, intrepidity, unusual initiative, resourcefulness,
     and achievement of outstanding results with unusual presence of mind under combat or noncombat
     conditions.” Mr. Clarence H. Mackay, who was the head of the Postal and Telegraph Commercial
     Cable Companies at the time, established the award in 1912. The NAA sponsors the award. The tro-
     phy, which consists of a large silver cup on a mahogany base, remains in the custody of the National
     Air and Space museum, Smithsonian Institution. Award elements consist of a plaque, certificate and
     engraved presentation folder. The Chief of Staff, USAF makes the selection and presentation.
     7.2.4. General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy. The trophy is awarded for “the most out-

                                         WEATHER AWARDS

14.1. Introduction. This chapter implements the annual Air Force weather awards program administered
by the Headquarters US Air Force Director of Weather (HQ USAF/A3O-W). Final selections for these
awards are approved and announced by the HQ USAF/A3O-W.

14.2. Annual Weather Awards.
   14.2.1. Nomination Requirements. Each MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, Air Staff or Secretariat 2-letter
   office, Combatant Command, the Joint Staff, or agency possessing Air Force weather forces may sub-
   mit one nomination for any given award (except Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Award as
   noted in Table 14.3.). Awards are based solely on accomplishments directly related to the weather
   mission, to include the space weather mission, during the preceding calendar year. With the exception
   of the Air Reserve Component Weather Officer/Enlisted Force Member of the Year Awards, “whole
   person” accomplishments (e.g., self improvement, community service) do not apply.
       14.2.1.1. Eligibility. All active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, DoD civilian per-
       sonnel, organizations, and teams meeting the below award criteria are eligible for nomination.
       14.2.1.2. Individuals. To be eligible for an individual award, the member must have a core duty
       AF Specialty Code (AFSC) of 15WX (officers) or 1W0X1 (enlisted). Individuals may only be
       submitted for one award each year (e.g., a SNCO cannot be nominated for both the Air Force
       Weather SNCO of the Year and Air Force Weather Staff Enlisted Member of the Year). This rule
       does not apply to the Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, i.e., nominees for the Outstand-
       ing Technical Achievement Award (either as a team member or individual) remains eligible for an
       individual award. The organization to which the member was assigned on 31 December is respon-
       sible for award submission; however, award inputs should be solicited from the losing organiza-
       tion. In addition, the individual’s duty AFSC, rank, and/or primary duties for the majority (183
       days or more) of the calendar year determine the eligibility and award category. Air National
       Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel serving on Title 10 orders for the majority (183 days or
       more) of the calendar year may compete for any individual award for which they meet the award
       criteria; however, they are still limited to a single individual award nomination.
       14.2.1.3. Teams. A team is defined as two or more persons, typically not more than ten, organized
       for a specific purpose during a limited timeframe (i.e., not a standing group, squadron, flight, divi-
       sion, branch, section, or equivalent). At least one member of the team must have a core duty AFSC
       of 15WX (officer) or 1W0X1 (enlisted). Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel
       serving on Title 10 orders for the majority (183 days or more) of the calendar year may compete
       for any team award for which they meet the award criteria.
       14.2.1.4. Organizations. Organizations may only be nominated for one award each year (note:
       this does not preclude squadron-level organizations from nominating a subordinate organization
       for the flight-level award).
       14.2.1.5. Format. Use AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, for each nomination. Nomina-
       tions will be in bullet format, front side only, and will focus on actions and impacts directly related

        rity Program Management. Soft copies may be forwarded via SIPRNET to af.xoowp@af.penta-
        gon.smil.mil.
        14.2.2.2. HQ AF/A3O-W will serve as the president of the weather awards board and will have
        final approval of all selectees. The board will normally consist of four 3-person panels (enlisted,
        officer/civilian, Reserve Component, and team/organization), each headed by a Colonel.
        14.2.2.3. As appropriate, HQ USAF/A3O-W will announce award winners to MAJCOM vice
        commanders, SAF and HQ USAF 2-letter offices, combatant/unified command J3s, FOA and
        DRU commanders, and commanders of the award winner’s unit on or about 1 April. If AF/
        A3O-W or a designated representative cannot present the awards, they will be forwarded through
        appropriate command channels for presentation.
        14.2.2.4. Unit commanders will provide award winners with a copy of the HQ USAF/A3O-W
        announcement message to retain as proof of earning an award. Units must forward an 8” x 10”
        head and shoulders color print of individual award winners in service dress (or civilian equivalent

                        AIR FORCE INFORMATION OPERATIONS AWARDS

23.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes guidelines of the annual Air Force Information Operations
(IO) Awards Program (AFIOAP) for active duty, civilian and Air Reserve Components (ARC) adminis-
tered by the Headquarters United States Air Force Division of Information Operations (HQ USAF/
A3O-CI). The annual AFIOAP conveys the highest honors available to Air Force Information Operations
professionals and provides an opportunity each year to recognize the active duty Air Force, Air Reserve
Components (ARC) and civilians who have made significant contributions to Information Operations
functions and missions. As defined in AFDD 2-5, Information Operations, the three IO capabilities—
influence operations, electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations—while separate and
distinct, when linked, can achieve operationally important IO effects.
     23.1.1. Influence operations are focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of leaders,
     groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect behaviors, protect
     operations, communicate commander’s intent, and project accurate information to achieve desired
     effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing behavior or a change in
     the adversary’s decision cycle, which aligns with the commander’s objectives. The military capabili-
     ties of influence operations are psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC),
     operations security (OPSEC), counterintelligence (CI) operations, counterpropaganda operations and
     public affairs (PA) operations.
     23.1.2. Network warfare operations are the integrated planning, employment, and assessment of mil-
     itary capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital network por-
     tion of the battle space. Network warfare operations are conducted in the information domain through
     the combination of hardware, software, data, and human interaction. Networks in this context are
     defined as any collection of systems transmitting information. Examples include, but are not limited
     to, radio nets, satellite links, tactical digital information links (TADIL), telemetry, digital track files,
     telecommunications, and wireless communications networks and systems. The operational activities
     of network warfare operations are network attack (NetA), network defense (NetD) and network war-
     fare support (NS).
     23.1.3. Electronic warfare operations are the integrated planning, employment, and assessment of
     military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the electro- magnetic domain in support of oper-
     ational objectives. Electronic warfare operates across the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio,
     visible, infrared, microwave, directed energy, and all other frequencies. It is responsible for coordina-
     tion and deconfliction of all friendly uses of the spectrum (air, land, sea, and space) as well as attack-
     ing and denying enemy uses. For this reason it is a historically important coordinating element in all
     operations, especially as current and future friendly uses of the electromagnetic spectrum multiply.
     The military capabilities of electronic warfare operations are electronic attack, electronic protection,
     and electronic warfare support.

23.2. Eligibility Criteria. Military officer nominees for the AFIOAP awards must have one of the fol-
lowing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC): 11XX, 12XX, 13XX, 14NX, 16XX, 21RX, 31PX, 33SX,
35PX, 42PX, 42SX, 51JX, 61SxB, 62EX or 71SX. Enlisted nominees may have any AFSC in support of
IO capabilities. Civilian nominees may be from any Federal Government General Schedule (GS) or Gen-
eral Grade (GG) series in support of IO capabilities (if nominees have been moved into National Security
AFI36-2807_460SWSUP_I 10 APRIL 2008                                                                       73


Personnel System (NSPS), the NSPS classification structure of corresponding career groups, pay sched-
ules, pay bands and occupational codes should be used for the nomination). Nominees for the contributor
awards may have any AFSC/civilian series in support of IO capabilities.
   23.2.1. Military personnel must not have undergone judicial, non-judicial (Uniform Code of Military
   Justice [UCMJ]; AFI 51-202, Non-Judicial Punishment Guide) or negative administrative actions
   (AFI 36-2907, Air Force Unfavorable Information File (UIF), during the nomination period. If a nom-
   inee undergoes such an action after nomination, but before the selection board meets, the selection
   board will not consider the nominee for that award cycle. Military personnel must meet the minimum
   physical fitness standards set forth in AFI 10-248, Fitness Program. Nominating authorities must
   immediately notify HQ USAF/A3O-CI of any adverse actions affecting the nominee’s eligibility.
   23.2.2. Civilian personnel must not have received any actual or pending adverse administrative action
   for the nomination period and must not have received an overall performance rating of “acceptable.”
   DoD plans to phase organizations into NSPS incrementally over the next few years. If you have been
   moved into NSPS, the NSPS classification structure of corresponding career groups, pay schedules,
   pay bands and occupational codes should be used for the nomination.

23.3. Award Categories. The AFIOAP consists of 16 award categories that seek to acknowledge the IO
force – officer, enlisted, and civilian. The active duty military, civilians and air reserve components (ARC
– made up of the USAF Reserves and Air National Guard), and contributors fall into two levels. The con-
tributor award category is designed for personnel who do not meet the eligibility criteria in para 23.2., but
whose work contributes to accomplishing IO capabilities. Table 23.1., AFIOAP Award Categories, iden-
tifies DoD components and award categories for the AFIOAP.
   23.3.1. Level I recognizes members of the Numbered Air Force (NAF) and above (this includes
   MAJCOMS), including the Field Operating Agency (FOA), Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), United
   States personnel serving in Joint/NATO units and units with theater-level or national-level missions.
   23.3.2. Level II recognizes individuals from units below NAF, including wings, groups, squadrons;
   information warfare flights, etc. are also eligible for this award.

                                     Attachment 3 (Added-460SW)

                             (MILITARY) – EVALUATION GUIDELINES
A3.1. (Added-460SW) Selection: Selection will be based on a combination of the AF IMT 1206 (25
points) and the personal board interview (15 points).
A3.2. (Added-460SW) Written Evaluation (AF IMT 1206).
     A3.2.1. (Added-460SW) Effective evaluation of the AF IMT 1206 requires a detailed thought pro-
     cess; it’s challenging to review nomination packages and determine who are the “Best of the Best.”
     Each board member must remember, it’s not the writer, it’s the accomplishment of the nominee which
     makes the difference. Strong emphasis must be on initiative, achievement, and impact, not writing
     style.
     A3.2.2. (Added-460SW) When evaluating an AF IMT 1206, the individual’s quarterly write-up can-
     not exceed 15 lines not including the three category headings (30 lines including the headings for
     annual). Any combination of lines can be used, however each category must have a minimum of two
     lines. The total possible points that can be awarded are 40 (25 points for the written package and 15
     points for the board). There are only three approved categories (listed below) that will be scored.
     Additionally, nomination submissions in excess of the 15-line limit (27 for annual) will not be scored.
     Each line will be evaluated on its own merit. Board members have the opportunity to award maximum
     points to each section and can score each category using whole or half point increments. Board mem-
     bers must break all ties and cannot award points beyond the maximum points allocated for each cate-
     gory.
        A3.2.2.1. (Added-460SW) Leadership and Job Performance: (maximum points – 15).
        A3.2.2.2. (Added-460SW) Significant Self-Improvement: (maximum points – 5).
        A3.2.2.3. (Added-460SW) Base/Community Involvement: (maximum points – 5).
A3.3. (Added-460SW) Nomination Headings.
     A3.3.1. (Added-460SW) Leadership and Job Performance. The individual’s primary duty accom-
     plishments are the most important element of the awards nomination package. This is the most diffi-
     cult section to score, because everyone does an outstanding job in his or her area of expertise. Below
     are guidelines to assist board members in differentiating the impact on the mission and leadership
     role. (Maximum points – 15).
        A3.3.1.1. (Added-460SW) Innovative methods/programs developed, designed, implemented,
        and impact.
        A3.3.1.2. (Added-460SW) Process Improvement – cost saving, percentage improved or reduced.
        A3.3.1.3. (Added-460SW) Superior leadership or management skills and accomplishments.
        A3.3.1.4. (Added-460SW) Quantification and Qualification of results.
        A3.3.1.5. (Added-460SW) Key additional duties with significant impact.
        A3.3.1.6. (Added-460SW) Wing/company/command-level working group, committee chair/
        member, project officer.
AFI36-2807_460SWSUP_I 10 APRIL 2008                                                                93


     A3.3.1.7. (Added-460SW) Higher HQ, service unique, or DoD involvement (i.e. tests site, pro-
     gram, equipment, etc.).
     A3.3.1.8. (Added-460SW) Wing/company/command-level and higher awards (both individual
     and unit).
  A3.3.2. (Added-460SW) Significant Self-Improvement. The primary focus of this section is the
  individual’s professional and personal development and how it benefits the respective service. The
  key factors to this category are: individual commitment level and personal sacrifice. You can judge
  this by answering the following questions. How much time was expended? How much effort was
  involved? Was the achievement done on duty or during off-duty time? (Maximum points – 5).
     A3.3.2.1. (Added-460SW) Off-duty Education- College (in-residence, on-line, correspondence
     classes, etc.).
     A3.3.2.2. (Added-460SW) Professional Military Education (specific progress, attendance or
     completion).
     A3.3.2.3. (Added-460SW) Upgrade Training (CDCs, formal training courses, etc.).
     A3.3.2.4. (Added-460SW) Advanced career field or Military Occupational Specialty training.
     A3.3.2.5. (Added-460SW) Readiness training.
     A3.3.2.6. (Added-460SW) Conference or symposiums related to job or career field/specialty
     (how nominee used information to improve process, mission impact, etc.).
  A3.3.3. (Added-460SW) Base and Community Involvement. This section rounds out the whole
  person concept. Unit and base activities/support should be weighed more heavily on community
  involvement because they directly impact Team Buckley and the surrounding community. Again the
  individual’s commitment level and personal sacrifice are the key factors in evaluating this section.
  How much time and effort was involved? What was the amount of time committed to the achievement
  and the frequency? Did the member participate or lead the effort? (Maximum points – 5).
     A3.3.3.1. (Added-460SW) Involvement in professional organizations.
     A3.3.3.2. (Added-460SW) Key leadership position on executive council coupled by the achieve-
     ment or results.
     A3.3.3.3. (Added-460SW) Color/Honor Guard and sustained participation.
     A3.3.3.4. (Added-460SW) Leadership position or role in community.
     A3.3.3.5. (Added-460SW) Special Olympics, Boy Scouts, Big Brother/Sister, etc. (Number of
     hrs, frequency, etc.).
     A3.3.3.6. (Added-460SW) Coaching sporting teams (squadron intramural teams, adult or youth
     programs, etc.).
     A3.3.3.7. (Added-460SW) Participating in major community ceremonies such as unit member
     retirement, POW/MIA vigil, retreat, marched in community parade while in uniform (i.e., Vet-
     eran’s Day and Fourth of July).
     A3.3.3.8. (Added-460SW) Base Sponsored Programs.
     A3.3.3.9. (Added-460SW) Quarterly/Annual Awards Committee.

A3.4. (Added-460SW) Personal Interview.
     A3.4.1. (Added-460SW) The primary purpose of the face-to-face board is to ensure nominees’ dress
     and appearance, military bearing, oral expression, and articulation of responses. Additionally, the
     interview will assist nominees in positively representing Team Buckley at subsequent higher head-
     quarters boards. This is a very subjective area for board members to evaluate and you must baseline
     your judgment against military standards. Since this section of the awards process has limited points
     available, the use of whole, half or quarter point increments are permitted. (Maximum total points –
     15).
     A3.4.2. (Added-460SW) Dress and Appearance: (5 points).
        A3.4.2.1. (Added-460SW) Uniform: cleaned, pressed, and proper fitting.

        A3.4.2.3. (Added-460SW) Jewelry: not more than three rings, correct earrings, no visible neck-
        lace, etc.
        A3.4.2.4. (Added-460SW) Decorations: ribbons in proper order, clean/serviceable condition.
        A3.4.2.5. (Added-460SW) Hair: appropriate style, length, color, approved ornamentation.
     A3.4.3. (Added-460SW) Military Bearing: (5 points).
        A3.4.3.1. (Added-460SW) Room entry: appropriate facing movements.
        A3.4.3.2. (Added-460SW) Reporting: appropriate introduction.
        A3.4.3.3. (Added-460SW) Posture.

regards to preparing board questions. The board president will task each of the board members with a spe-
cific category (see below for categories). Board members are to prepare three questions (2 primary and 1
alternate) for their respective tasked board category. Additionally, be cognizant of the fact that there may
be nominees from other or all services: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard.
A3.5. (Added-460SW) Board Guidelines.
     A3.5.1. (Added-460SW) Questions will be opinionated, thought provoking, and designed to assess
     the nominee’s ability to organize their thoughts and articulate a response. Questions will come from
     some or all of the following areas:
AFI36-2807_460SWSUP_I 10 APRIL 2008                                                                     95


       A3.5.1.1. (Added-460SW) Current National/World Events. General knowledge required
       with emphasis on nominee’s opinionated response; general knowledge of current world events
       and their opinions regarding them (for example: Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, Global War on
       Terrorism, Iran, Korea, future of Palestinian/Israeli relations, etc.).
       A3.5.1.2. (Added-460SW) Unit/Individual Accomplishments and/or Leadership Chal-
       lenges. Prepare questions to evaluate the nominee’s knowledge, involvement and impact on their
       personal and/or unit's success/accomplishments--how their accomplishments/leadership impacted
       the successes of their unit (this is an excellent opportunity to gather background information on
       the nominee). The AF IMT 1206 is a great resource for this. Leadership Challenges: Scenario
       based questions on how the nominee would react/respond in handling specific leadership situa-
       tions (prepare scenarios based on the nominee’s rank and level of responsibility).
       A3.5.1.3. (Added-460SW) Military Customs, Courtesies, and Service/Enlisted Heritage.
       General knowledge required with emphasis on nominee’s opinionated response (Note: Nominees
       may be from each of the services: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard; prepare
       basic questions that are knowledgeable across each branch of service; it is recommended that the
       board members of the same service as the nominee prepare questions for use by the other board
       members that are from different services).
NOTE: When required, the board president will facilitate open discussion to resolve any disparities that
could skew the scoring process. Resolution is required when the ranking order is inconsistent with a win-
ner based on total points (i.e., Warrior Jones has the most total points but two of the three board members
have another nominee ranked as their number 1).
   A3.5.2. (Added-460SW) The board president should use the board checklist outlined in Attachment
   5 (Added) to help facilitate a productive, professional board.

                              (CIVILIAN) - EVALUATION GUIDELINES
A4.1. (Added-460SW) Selection: Selection will be based on the AF IMT 1206 with the four headings
worth up to 35 points.
A4.2. (Added-460SW) Written Evaluation (AF IMT 1206).
     A4.2.1. (Added-460SW) Effective evaluation of the AF IMT 1206 requires a detailed thought pro-
     cess; it’s challenging to review nomination packages and determine who are the “Best of the Best.”
     Each board member must remember, “It’s not the writer, it’s the accomplishment of the nominee
     which makes the difference.” Strong emphasis must be on initiative, achievement, and impact not
     writing style.
     A4.2.2. (Added-460SW) When evaluating an AF IMT 1206, the individual’s quarterly write-up can-
     not exceed 15 lines not including the headings (30 lines including headings for annual). The total pos-
     sible points that can be awarded are 35. Additionally, nomination submissions in excess of 15-line
     limit (26 for annual) will not be scored. Each line will be evaluated on it’s own merit. Board members
     have the opportunity to award maximum points to each section and can score each category using
     whole or half point increments. Board members must break all ties and cannot award points beyond
     the maximum points allocated for each category.
A4.3. (Added-460SW) Nomination Headings for Non-Supervisory Categories.
     A4.3.1. (Added-460SW) Job Accomplishments, Efficiency, and Productivity: The individual’s pri-
     mary duty accomplishments are the most important element of the awards nomination package. (Max-
     imum - 15 points).
     A4.3.2. (Added-460SW) Demonstrated Leadership Qualities and Initiatives: (Maximum - 10 points).
     A4.3.3. (Added-460SW) Self Improvement and Development: (Maximum - 5 points).

     A4.4.4. (Added-460SW) Communicates and Promotes a Collaborative Environment: (Maximum - 5
     points).
