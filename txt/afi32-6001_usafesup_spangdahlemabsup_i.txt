                                            Chapter 2

                                     POLICY – GENERAL

2.1. Family Housing (FH) Policy Overview. Rely on the community first to provide adequate
and affordable FH. When a shortage of housing exists in the community, as determined by the
HRMA, provide adequate government housing, giving priority to personnel who must live on the
installation for military necessity. Use 98 percent as a goal for measuring occupancy of existing
assets and determine management actions when occupancy fails to meet that goal. Mandatory
housing is allowed only in foreign OCONUS locations under certain conditions (paragraph
4.7). Note: The terms dependent and family member are synonymous.
2.2. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). The SOFA between the United States and foreign
governments takes precedence over AF housing policy.
2.3. Equal Opportunity in Housing. Provide FH to eligible personnel of all Services without
regard to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, handicap or national origin.
2.4. Leasing and Subleasing. Leasing or subleasing of FH is not authorized (Comptroller
General (CG) Decision B-140917 and 39 CG Decision 401).
2.5. Independent Duty (ID) Personnel. The Air Force provides housing for ID personnel on
the same basis as other active duty military personnel (Priority 2). Installations plan and program
adequate housing to support active duty military families; therefore, it is critical to ensure
accurate ID populations are included in the manpower and requirements data provided in the
HRMA.
2.6. Support Agreements. A host-tenant support agreement may be established between Air
Force commands, organizations, units or elements and between an AF organization and another
Military Service (Interservice Support Agreement) or another federal agency (Interagency
Support Agreement). The Commander may authorize personnel covered in the interservice or
interagency support agreement (ISA) to live in Air Force-controlled housing on the same basis as
AF members. Follow procedures in AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures and DoD
Instruction (DoDI) 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental Support, for agreements with
non-AF Services and agencies. The Air Force Office of Regional Issues (HQ USAF/A5XX) is
the approval authority for agreements with another country.
2.7. Air Force Standardized Housing Brochure. Provide an installation-specific housing
brochure to housing residents upon assignment. Brief residents of their responsibility for such
routine maintenance, minor repair, operation and housekeeping typically expected of tenants in
similar community housing. See paragraph 6.6 for resident responsibilities to be briefed at the
initial, preterm and final inspections, responsibilities for routine M&R during occupancy and for
departure cleaning. See the following AFC- ESA website for format and content of the
Brochure.
http://www.afcesa.af.mil/userdocuments/publications/miscellaneous/ceo/ceok/housingbroch
uretemplate.pdf.
2.8. Resident Liability. Military and civilian residents are held liable for loss and damage to
their assigned FH unit, including equipment, furnishings, grounds and exterior facilities in their
area of responsibility caused by the abuse or negligence of the member, dependents, guests and
 16                    AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


pets, and for failure to clean an assigned unit satisfactorily upon termination (10 U.S.C. 2775 and
DoD Regulation (DoDR) 7000.14).
   2.8.1. At the time of assignment, inform residents of the FH unit replacement cost,
   recommend renters insurance and explain that when liability is determined, residents are
   required to pay for damages (paragraph 6.6.2).
   2.8.2. Include a resident liability clause in every housing maintenance contract that requires
   the contractor to report suspected resident abuse or negligence when observed.
   2.8.3. The Housing Flight makes the initial determination whether or not the resident is
   responsible for the abuse or negligence, informs the resident of their liability and ensures the
   cost of damage is collected.
   2.8.4. Liability is determined in accordance with (IAW) 10 U.S.C. 2775 and AFMAN 23-
   220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. AFMAN 23-220 requires the Air Force to
   investigate and report damages or losses to government-owned housing of $500 or more. The
   Commander may, however, initiate an ROS for damages or losses under $500 as appropriate
   for the circumstances.
   2.8.5. The ROS process may be disregarded when the value is less than $500 and the
   member is willing to pay for the damage. If the resident does not pay voluntarily, the
   Housing Flight requests a Report of Survey (ROS).
   2.8.6. With approval of the Housing Flight, the resident may repair the damage, pay a
   commercial contractor to repair the damage or allow the housing maintenance contractor to
   repair the damage and reimburse the government. In any case, the repair must have
   government approval before the inspector clears the member from FH.
   2.8.7. For abandoned units, arrange for a commercial contractor to clean and repair occupant
   damages and seek reimbursement from the member using DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment
   Authorization.
   2.8.8. Authority to deduct the cost of FH damage from the civilian employee pay is in DoDR
   7000.14, Financial Management Regulations, Chapter 8.
   2.8.9. Credit money collected for loss, damage to or cleaning FH to the installation MFH
   Operations and Maintenance (O&M) account. The Housing Flight monitors collection of
   damage assessments.
2.9. Insurance and Reimbursement Claims Against the Government. The government does
not provide personal property or liability insurance for residents. Recommend to residents that
they secure adequate insurance coverage for their needs. The installation legal office considers
claims for reimbursement of personal property at a depreciated amount when FH is damaged
through no fault of the resident. Advise the resident to seek further assistance from the
installation Judge Advocate (JA), if specialized advice is required.
2.10. Privately Owned Firearms. Residents must comply with AFI 31-101, The Air Force
Installation Security Program (FOUO) and other installation firearms policy.
2.11. Social Visits. FH units are appropriated for use as single-family dwellings and may not be
jointly occupied by more than one family. If defined as a dependent (Attachment 1), a relative
of the member or spouse is not considered a social visitor, regardless of the length of stay.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                               17


   2.11.1. Bonafide social visits of 30 days or less do not constitute joint assignment of FH.
   2.11.2. Social visits of military personnel assigned to the installation and civilians residing
   outside the commuting area are limited to 30 days, and those residing within the commuting
   area are limited to 2 days. The Commander may authorize extension to the 30 days.
   Personnel authorized BAH or LQA who visit more than 30 days forfeit BAH and LQA.
2.12. Live-in Childcare Provider (Nanny): FH residents may employ a live-in childcare
provider with approval of the Commander. In coordination with the installation JA and Security
Forces (SF), the Housing Flight develops a standardized installation template for members to use
in requesting a live-in child- care provider. The Housing Flight forwards requests meeting the
following criteria to the Commander for approval:
   2.12.1. Resident has dependent child, infant through high school age, residing in household.
   2.12.2. Nanny’s family status and relationship to member are identified.
   2.12.3. Nanny will reside in FH, unaccompanied.
   2.12.4. Private bedroom is available for nanny IAW this AFI and adherence to Table 4.3.
   2.12.5. Request meets installation the JA legal requirements for federal, state and local
   domestic employment laws and contracts, host nation provisions and SF security
   requirements for background checks, base entry and access to facilities. NOTE: Approval of
   a live-in childcare provider does not imply entitlement to benefits or privileges to which
   nonfamily members are not otherwise entitled nor does approval represent a FH bedroom
   requirement.
2.13. Commercial Activity in Family Housing (FH). Limited commercial activity that can be
properly carried out from a FH unit is allowed. Commercial activity is defined as a business
enterprise conducted for profit by family members assigned to a FH unit (DoDM 4165.63).
   2.13.1. Activities may involve direct sales of products, minor repair service on small items,
   incidental services, tutoring and limited manufacture of items.
   2.13.2. Sale of specific brand name merchandise not available in military exchanges is not
   construed as competition with installation officially sanctioned commerce.
   2.13.3. The member submits a written request to conduct commercial activity in assigned
   FH to the Housing Flight Chief. The Housing Flight Chief forwards request to the
   Commander for approval. Approval is required before business start-up.
   2.13.4. The following policies apply:
       2.13.4.1. Commercial activity may not be authorized or continued at the expense of
       community tranquility, safety or the installation mission.
       2.13.4.2. Local government licensing requirements, agreements, host nation business
       practices and advertising practices are taken into account as each request is considered.
       The member is responsible for obtaining necessary licenses.
   2.13.5. Childcare in FH units is a unique category of commercial activity and is governed by
   AFI 34-276, Family Child Care Programs (paragraph 2.17).
 18                    AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   2.13.6. The resident may request minor self-help modifications to FH unit to facilitate
   commercial activity. If approved, the resident follows self-help guidelines, complies with
   electrical and fire safety codes, pays for the modification and restores the FH unit to its
   original configuration upon departing the installation.
   2.13.7. DoDR 5500.7, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), applies to soliciting from personnel
   junior in rank or grade. Family member employment in FH is authorized if the family
   member complies with this AFI and other Service regulations prohibiting solicited sales to
   subordinates. The prohibition against door-to-door solicitation, in person or via printed
   material, applies (DoDD 1344.7, Personnel Commercial Solicitation on DoD installations).
   2.13.8. Advise residents to obtain personal liability insurance, to cover the risk of legal
   actions from customers and damage to government property, since residents conducting a
   private business in FH could be held personally liable for loss or damage.
2.14. Resident Responsibility for Grounds. FH residents are responsible for maintaining
grounds for their exclusive use extending from the footprint of the structure to the border of
common areas. Exclusive use is defined as the area within a natural boundary (playground, tree
line, sidewalk, driveway, fence, common area boundary such as a park, picnic area, flower
garden, and so forth) or halfway to adjoining residence. Provide information in the installation-
specific housing brochure for grounds care unique to the installation and area.
   2.14.1. The MAJCOM Commander may approve a waiver for the government to provide
   partial or complete grounds care when one of the following criteria is met. Approval
   authority in this AFI applies to non-GOQs only and may not be delegated below the
   MAJCOM Civil Engineer. For GOQ grounds maintenance waivers, see AFI 32-6003.
       2.14.1.1. The residence is prominently located and makes a unique contribution to the
       appearance of the installation.
       2.14.1.2. The area for the exclusive use of the resident is extremely large (more than ½
       acre). Waiver provides government-furnished grounds maintenance beyond the ½ acre
       surrounding the home. For ease of grounds maintenance and overall appearance, the
       Housing Flight Chief and resident jointly determine the location and layout of the ½ acre
       for which the resident is responsible.
       2.14.1.3. Areas with unique landscaping, extra large trees or shrubbery, or trees requiring
       professional service or specialized equipment.
2.15. Self-Help Program. The Air Force supports the Self-Help Program to foster pride of
ownership in FH. This program allows residents to accomplish minor work in their FH unit to
benefit their living conditions and can reduce maintenance costs to the government. Housing
funds support the FH Self-Help Program, and the BCE and Housing Flight jointly establish
guidance to operate the program (AF Pamphlet 32-1098, Base Civil Engineer Self-Help Guide,
and paragraph 11.11).
   2.15.1. Residents submit AF IMT 332, BCE Work Request, to request minor modifications
   to the housing unit and surrounding grounds and may request government-furnished
   materials on the AF IMT 332.
   2.15.2. When AF IMT 332 requests grounds work and digging is required, an AF IMT 103,
   Base Civil Engineer Work Clearance Request, must be approved before starting work.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                           19


   2.15.3. The housing inspector or respective shop craftsman inspects self-help projects, and
   the Housing Flight maintains Self-Help Program records on file and in ACES-HM. Self-help
   improvements may be donated by the resident and accepted by the Air Force when
   workmanship and aesthetics meet acceptable construction standards. Self-help work must
   not be used to increase the square footage of the unit by constructing additions or enclosing
   and weather proofing existing exterior porches, carports, patios or decks, and so forth.
   Inform the resident that FH unit must be returned to the original configuration before
   departing the installation unless the government or incoming resident accepts project.
   Advise resident of requirement to comply with the installation-specific housing brochure for
   grounds care unique to the installation and area.
2.16. Self-Help Store. The Housing Flight Chief coordinates the self-help store operations with
the BCE or provides for a contractor-operated store if housing maintenance is contracted.
   2.16.1. The self-help store makes available to housing residents a list of stocked housing
   items, customer training and guidance on completing basic tasks and instructions for using
   tools.
   2.16.2. Self-help stores may provide hand tools and lawn equipment on a loaner basis but
   may not provide materials for installation of in-ground lawn sprinklers to FH residents.
2.17. Self-Help Work in FH to Support the Family Child Care Program. In most instances,
modifications to FH dwelling units supporting the installation Family Child Care Program are
accomplished using donated self-help labor and materials. When clear evidence shows the
Family Child Care Program is unable to provide adequate childcare because of the high cost of
home daycare modifications and the installation mission could be affected, the Commander may
authorize government-funded labor and materials to support required FH modifications
(paragraph 2.13.5, AFI 34-276 and AF Pamphlet 32-1098).
2.18. Flags in Family Housing (FH). At the Commander’s discretion, FH M&R funds may be
used to purchase and install United States (American) flags. Make flags available through the
installation Self-Help Store.
2.19. Lawn Irrigation Systems. To reduce irrigation requirements in arid and semiarid
climates, use xeriscape principles to the maximum extent practical and as comparable to local
community housing.
   2.19.1. Lawn irrigation systems may be provided in (1) any yard size, regardless of rank,
   where the average annual rainfall is less than 20 inches as defined by the Air Force Combat
   Climatology Center (AFCCC) (Attachment 2 and Air Force Family Housing Guide) or (2)
   in any yard ½ acre or greater (lot size less the footprint of the unit). Note: For GOQs only,
   approval is SAF/IEI.
   2.19.2. In installing irrigation systems, do not create a condition that violates Executive
   Order 13148, Greening the Government Through Leadership in Environmental Management
   and Guidance for Presidential Memorandum of Environmentally and Economically
   Beneficial Landscape Practices on Federal Landscaped Grounds, 60 Federal Register 40837.
2.20. Key and Essential (K&E), Command and Special Command Positions
(SCP). MAJCOM approval authority is required to hold FH units vacant for more than 90 days.
Refer to AFI 32-6003 for guidance on general officers and SCPs.
20                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


  2.20.1. MAJCOM commanders may require K&E personnel, including incumbents of
  command positions, to reside on the installation as a condition of employment. MAJCOM
  and installation commanders should strictly limit K&E positions to those necessary to reside
  on the installation to perform their mission.
  2.20.1. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Key and Essential Personnel are: 52 FW/CC– Bldg 6001,
  52 FW Command Chief– Bldg 400B, 52 FW Vice Commander - Bldg 6002, 52d Operations
  Group Commander - Bldg 6000, 52d Munitions Maintenance Group Commander - Bldg
  400A, 52d Maintenance Group Commander- Bldg 6003, 52d Civil Engineer Squadron
  Commander- Bldg 6004, 52d Medical Group Commander - Bldg 6005, 52 MSG/CC - Bldg
  6006.
  2.20.2. The Commander may designate specific FH units for personnel in K&E, SCP and
  Command positions who reside on the installation as a matter of military necessity.
  Commanders may assign a member, other than the intended occupant, to a designated
  housing unit. Assigned members acknowledge, in writing, they may be required to relocate at
  government expense to another on-base or off-base housing compatible with their grade and
  bedroom requirement when the FH is required by designated incumbent.
  2.20.3. K&E and Command housing may be held vacant for 90 days pending the arrival of
  incumbent.
  2.20.4. The Commander establishes a K&E position only when there is a compelling need
  for a member to live on base. For example, incumbent is required to respond to continual
  operational requirements or emergencies and off-base residency would adversely impact the
  installation readiness, safety and security or health and welfare of the base population. The
  Commander identifies K&E positions in an installation supplement to this instruction.
     2.20.4.1. Do not designate a specific FH unit for every incumbent of a K&E position;
     instead, reserve certain areas or groups of houses for K&E personnel.
     2.20.4.2. When housing is not immediately available identify incumbents of K&E
     positions in ACES-HM, which places them at the top of the appropriate waiting list. This
     includes the freeze zone, but does not displace members with a firm housing
     commitment.
     2.20.4.3. The Commander may waive the requirement for an incumbent of a designated
     position to reside on the installation under the following conditions:
         2.20.4.3.1. Adequate FH is not or will not be available to meet incumbent’s family
         size and composition, or housing is geographically separated from the installation and
         is the only suitable housing available.
         2.20.4.3.2. The incumbent owns or is purchasing housing in the local community at
         the time of assignment to the K&E position. Incumbents with this waiver who
         subsequently apply for government housing are placed on the waiting list, compete
         with other members in their grade and bedroom category and are not given priority
         assignment.
  2.20.5. Command positions are commanders and vice commanders of MAJCOMs,
  numbered Air Forces, centers, wings, groups and their deputies and command chief master
  sergeants (CCM) of MAJCOMs, numbered Air Forces, centers, wings and installations.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                                   21


   MAJCOM commanders may authorize additional command positions and designate specific
   housing units. Authority may not be delegated below the MAJCOM Civil Engineer.
2.21. Unaccompanied Personnel in Designated Position. When a member assigned to a
Command or K&E position is single or not accompanied by family members and there are no
other on-base facilities, such as visiting quarters (VQ), FH may be diverted to UH. Use FH funds
to maintain FH diverted to UH. Diverted FH must comply with congressional M&R limits.
Update ACES to reflect the diversion and assign member to UH (AFI 32-6005).
2.22. Unaccompanied Members in Housing with Dependents Residing Elsewhere. Under
certain conditions, members with dependents residing elsewhere may occupy housing and
receive BAH at the with-dependent rate.
   2.22.1. A member may occupy UH or other government housing that does not exceed
   minimum standards (Table 2.1) for the member’s grade without dependents and still be
   eligible to receive BAH at the with-dependent rate if (a) member is unaccompanied and (b)
   family members are not residing in adequate government housing elsewhere (DoD Financial
   Management Regulation (FMR), 260301C).
   2.22.2. The following applies only to personnel designated as K&E. All others are ineligible
   for this exception: If the member occupies UH or other government housing which exceed
   the unaccompanied minimum standard for member’s grade, BAH is terminated. If the
   occupied housing is the only housing available and (a) housing is not suitable for joint
   occupancy or (b) housing is suitable for joint occupancy and jointly occupied with another
   member of the appropriate grade permanently assigned to the duty station, BAH may not be
   terminated.
       2.22.2.1. AF policy is to discourage the use of government-owned FH units as temporary
       UH. FH units or other housing temporarily designated as UH are considered adequate for
       joint occupancy if they have at least two private bedrooms, two separate full bathrooms,
       with a total net living area at least equivalent to the total net living area the joint residents
       would each be entitled to if it were permanent UH. Members in grades O-1 to O-10, W-1
       to W-5 and GS-10 and above must have access to a living room, kitchen and dining area
       (not necessarily private) as shown in Table 2.1.
       2.22.2.2. Regarding clause (b) in paragraph 2.22.2, the housing must actually be jointly
       occupied, although such housing may be singularly occupied for no longer than 30 days
       to accommodate a change if one of the joint residents departs permanent change of
       station (PCS). SAF/IE may approve waivers to this policy to relieve hardship
       circumstances (other than financial).
   2.22.3. This provision applies to all locations and to FH units or other government housing
   temporarily designated (diverted) as UH.
   2.22.4. Assign unaccompanied members to housing that meet minimum adequacy standards
   for their grade, when possible.

occupied, do not pay BAH.
2.23. Prestige Family Housing (FH) and Command Chief Master Sergeants (CCM).
   2.23.1. Designate all E9 housing as prestige housing, categorized as follows (Table 4.2 and
   Table 4.3):
       2.23.1.1. Air Force E-9 CCMs, and equivalent members from other Services residing on
       Air Force installations and joint bases managed by the Air Force, position listed on
       CMSAF-approved list; specific prestige unit designated; four-bedroom requirement; 10
       percent size increase applies (paragraph 2.23.2).
       2.23.1.2. E-9 K&E; Commander may designate specific prestige housing unit; four-
       bedroom requirement.
       2.23.1.3. All other E-9s; prestige housing; three- or four-bedroom requirement; based on
       family size and composition.
   2.23.2. All prestige housing must meet standards in the Air Force Family Housing Guide for
   Planning, Programming, Design and Construction. For new/replacement construction, units
   designated for CCMs (only those approved by the CMSAF) may be increased by an
   additional 10 percent of the largest sized E-9 house at the installation, not to exceed the
   programming benchmark size of new/replacement construction (1940 net square feet
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                             23


   (NSF)/2410 gross square feet (GSF)) (Air Force Family Housing Planning Guide for
   Planning, Programming, Design and Construction).
   2.23.3. Commanders must carefully review and validate designated E-9 positions. The
   HRMA determines maximum on-base prestige housing requirements. Since CCMs are
   K&E, assignment priority is the same as other K&E personnel. Identify prestige housing in
   ACES by changing the designation to “Chief Prestige” and maintain a separate waiting list.
   2.23.4. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) is the approval authority for
   any changes to CCM positions at the MAJCOM, wing, number AF, joint command and
   center, including equivalent members from other Services residing on Air Force installations
   and joint bases managed by the Air Force. See CMSAF-approved list at the AF Townhall
   website (https://www.airforcehousing.hq.af.mil/). Submit request for additional prestige
   housing units through the MAJCOM Civil Engineer to HQ USAF/A7CH. Include the
   following justification:
            Title of position
            Normal grade for position
            Present incumbent of position
            Identification of unit proposed for such designation
            Reason to establish prestige FH requirement
            Impact if not approved
2.24. Unit Moves and Base Closures. Give equal consideration for available housing at the
gaining installation to all eligible DoD personnel identified for PCS reassignment during a unit
move. It is essential to provide members advance notice of housing available at the gaining
installation so they can make suitable arrangements for their families. Public notification of
housing availability promotes morale and efficiency of personnel, whether advance or
incremental staff. Due to time-phasing activities of unit moves (especially multiple units),
commanders of the losing and gaining installations usually negotiate the effective merger date of
waiting lists to ensure equity for all concerned and the shortest possible waiting lists. Send
unresolved issues to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer for resolution and to HQ USAF/A7CH for
final determination, if necessary. The following procedures apply:
   2.24.1. Losing Commanders:
       2.24.1.1. Identify personnel selected for PCS reassignment with the unit.
       2.24.1.2. Submit list of eligible personnel to be considered for FH at the gaining
       installation. Arrange list from losing installation, considered the advance application, by
       grade category and effective date of housing application. Send list to the gaining
       installation at least 45 days before the effective date of the unit move.
       2.24.1.3. Submit proposed K&E personnel list to the gaining installation commander.
       2.24.1.4. If required, enter into host-tenant negotiations at the earliest practical date
       before the unit move (paragraph 2.6).
   2.24.2. Gaining Commanders:
       2.24.2.1. Merge incoming unit personnel list with existing FH waiting lists.
 24                    AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


       2.24.2.2. Evaluate impact of the unit move on existing waiting lists and revise housing
       assignment forecasts.
       2.24.2.3. If applicable, enter into host-tenant negotiations with the incoming unit
       commander.
       2.24.2.4. If adequate FH is unavailable, make other arrangements to house incoming
       personnel.
       2.24.2.5. Provide effective housing services to all personnel, including expanded housing
       referral services, as necessary.
   2.24.3. Honor commitments for housing assignments at the gaining installation, issued
   before the waiting lists were merged.
   2.24.4. Merge the final personnel list of the incoming unit with the gaining base waiting lists
   at least 30 days before the scheduled arrival of the incoming advance party. If the incoming
   unit personnel strength is revised before the effective date of the unit move, adjust the
   merged waiting lists, accordingly. Merge the waiting lists on a pro rata basis, as follows:
       2.24.4.1. Merge the list from losing base A (300), with the waiting list of gaining base B
       (100), as follows: B-A-A-A-B-A-A-A and so forth. Do not bump members in a freeze
       status on the gaining installations waiting list.
   2.24.5. Post the merged waiting lists in the Housing Flight for public view by incoming units
   and by the gaining installation.
   2.24.6. Send a welcome package and provide forecasted waiting times to incoming
   personnel. Use an ACES-generated or locally produced DD Form 1747, Status of Housing
   Availability.
   2.24.7. Give incoming K&E personnel priority housing assignment but do not displace
   members on the waiting list who have a firm commitment for housing.
2.25. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Transition Personnel. Move members and
their families on a scheduled basis with continual coordination among all functional installation
activities. Close FH units consistent with the capability to provide essential support and services.
Current FH residents who are members of the BRAC team placing the base in caretaker status
may send their dependents to the next duty station in advance of their departure. The following
conditions apply:
   2.25.1. Assign housing to unaccompanied family members at the gaining installation under
   normal priority and procedures. The effective date of application is the walk-in date of the
   family member.
   2.25.2. The sponsor’s projected arrival date to gaining installation is within 90 days.
   2.25.3. The qualifying family member presents a duly executed Power of Attorney (POA)
   with authorization to conduct housing business, PCS orders and a letter signed by the losing
   Commander certifying the member is delayed due to assignment to a transition closure team.
   2.25.4. The family member’s decisions on personal preference options, bedroom and
   housing acceptance are final and may not be overturned by the sponsor.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                              25


2.26. Government-Owned Carpet. Installed carpet, including pad, is considered an alternative
floor finish and an integral part of the FH unit. Professionally clean government-installed carpet,
as needed, typically during change of occupancy, IAW the most current engineering technical
letter (ETL) and manufacturer instructions to preserve the quality and life of the carpet.
   2.26.1. When carpet is authorized, install carpet in living areas, except kitchen, bathroom,
   powder room, patio, porch and areas exposed to weather. Avoid installing carpet at
   entrances and heavy-traffic areas. To minimize damage to flooring and subflooring, glue-
   down installation is not allowed.
   2.26.2. Maintain the following historical information in the Housing Flight for each carpet
   installation:
       2.26.2.1. Location (FH address, building number and rooms).
       2.26.2.2. Name of carpet manufacturer, pattern and color.
       2.26.2.3. Manufacturer certification that carpet conforms to the most recent ETL Air
       Force Carpet Standard. ETLs are available at the following AFCESA website:
       http://www.afcesa.af.mil/library/etl.asp?Category=Engineering%20Technical%20L
       etters
       2.26.2.4. Date of installation.
       2.26.2.5. Method of installation and type of pad used.
       2.26.2.6. Certification of disposal and certification that new carpet meets AF standards.
   2.26.3. Purchase quality carpet with a minimum 7-year life expectancy, meeting AF
   standards in the Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design, and
   Construction and the most recent ETL. Before purchase, the BCE certifies the carpet meets
   AF carpet standards.
   2.26.4. Selected carpet must be a neutral color, such as beige, taupe or off-white in a light to
   medium shade that provides a flexible background that can integrate with the decor of
   successive occupants. Do not use pure whites or dark shades. Use solid colors or muted
   tone-on-tone tweeds.
   2.26.5. When replacing carpet in less than 7 years, the Commander or delegated
   representative certifies the carpet is no longer serviceable and requires replacement, and
   replacement carpet meets AF standards (paragraph 1.6.9.10 and AFI 32-6003).
2.27. Automated Civil Engineer System-Housing Management (ACES-HM) and
Automated Housing Referral Network (AHRN). ACES-HM is the Air Force Civil Engineer
standard management software for managing family and unaccompanied housing. Use data
extracted from ACES-HM to validate the IFHMP and FH Military Construction (MILCON)
projects, identify and monitor surplus housing and develop management initiatives. ACES-HM
is the primary tool used to plan, advocate, program, design and execute FH and UH
requirements. AHRN is the single DoD repository for rental housing property. Do not fund or
use other information systems when the functions exist in ACES and AHRN and do not
duplicate AHRN functions in ACES.
   2.27.1. Reporting and data extraction (mining) occur at every level of command and the
   assumption is that data in ACES-HM is accurate and reliable. It is critical that housing staffs
 26                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   at all locations use ACES-HM exclusively to record, manage, monitor and track the
   following:
      2.27.1.1. FH applicants, waiting lists, change of occupancy maintenance (COM), offers,
      declinations, projections and assignments into and out of government-controlled housing.
      2.27.1.2. Inspection schedules, inspection results and M&R of FH units.
      2.27.1.3. Drayage and storage, authorizations and obligations.
      2.27.1.4. Type, total number and status of FH facilities; including surplus units
      determined by the most current HRMA, units identified as inadequate by type based on
      the Condition Assessment Matrix (CAM) score from the latest HCP, inactive and
      diverted units.
   2.27.2. Except at locations where AHRN is deployed use ACES for community housing
   referral and relocation. At deployed locations, use AHRN for managing housing referral and
   relocation programs. At foreign OCONUS locations only, record and maintain member
   (community) leases in ACES.
   2.27.3. Develop a quality assurance (QA) program to promote data integrity and employ best
   practices to ensure timely and accurate information is maintained in ACES-HM. A
   responsive QA program is required to enable accurate occupancy metrics, validate HRMA,
   HCP, IFHMP, justify funding, develop management initiatives and to reconcile BAH with
   FSOs.
   2.27.4. The ACES generated MFH Occupancy and Utilization Report is the AF tool for
   determining the utilization FH facilities, providing justification for funding, managing
   change of occupancy timelines, and supporting construction, demolition and renovation of
   assets. Installations and MAJCOMs accomplish reporting requirements in accordance with
   the latest AF/A7CA guidance.
      2.27.4.1. Installations with traditional FH accomplish the ACES generated MFH
      Occupancy and Utilization Report quarterly, inclusive of 01 Oct - 31 Dec (1st quarter),
      01 Jan - 31 Mar (2nd quarter), 01 Apr - 30 Jun (3rd quarter) and 01 Jul - 30 Sep (4th
      quarter) and forward to their MAJCOM.
      2.27.4.2. MAJCOMs review installation quarterly reports to validate type, total number
      and status of FH facilities, including surplus units determined by the most current
      HRMA, units identified as inadequate, by type, based on CAM scores from the latest
      HCP, inactive and diverted units and change of occupancy timelines.
      2.27.4.3. MAJCOMs forward the installation reports to HQ USAF/A7CA by the 5th of
      Feb, May, Aug and Nov of each calendar year.
   2.27.5. Coordinate day-to-day ACES operations with communications squadrons
   (installation network control centers) and provide notification to the 754 Electronics Systems
   Group (ELSG), Combat System Support Help Desk, to facilitate reconciliation of slow
   response times and connectivity issues. The 754 ELSG Help Desk website is
   https://ceds.ssg.gunter.af.mil/login.asp.
2.28. Education Leave of Absence Program (ELAP):
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                              27


   2.28.1. Members enrolled in ELAP may retain FH while enrolled in the ELAP program on a
   space available basis, but must pay a rental charge equal to BAH at the member’s current
   grade, beginning the date the ELAP contract is signed. The Housing Flight computes the
   rental rate, prepares and sends the paperwork to finance. The member is responsible for
   arranging rental payments with the FSO. ELAP members may apply for waiver to rental
   payments on same basis as other hardship cases (10 U.S.C. 708).
   2.28.2. To the extent possible do not displace ELAP enrollees from FH except to house
   K&E personnel. The member may retain housing while enrolled in ELAP, even though there
   is a waiting list for the type and bedroom category of the house occupied.
2.29. Environmental Hazard Disclosure. Fully disclose to FH residents the following
environmental hazards, either upon assignment, delivery to residence or by making available in
public access areas, as appropriate. Refer residents who report potential environmental-related
health issues to their health care provider. Request the Bioenvironmental Engineer determine
requirements for a follow-up health risk assessment. Coordinate development and periodic
update of the installation fact sheets with the BCE and Bioenvironmental Engineering. See
www.epa.gov for ordering brochures and extended information.
   2.29.1. Asbestos. Upon assignment, provide resident an installation letter or fact sheet about
   the potential risk of asbestos exposure, either locally developed or adapted from information
   on the EPA website. Inform residents of common elements of housing, particularly older
   housing, that contain asbestos (for example, floor tiles and adhesives, furnace ductwork,
   roofing shingles and siding) and the potential for exposure to asbestos fibers when items are
   cut, sanded or scraped.
   2.29.2. Lead and Lead-Based Paint (LBP). Upon assignment, provide resident the EPA
   pamphlet, “Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home.” Include an installation-specific
   information paper or letter containing lead sampling performed by the installation and how to
   access sampling results for their FH unit or unit type. Maintain a signed disclosure form in
   resident file.
   2.29.3. Mold. Upon assignment, provide resident the EPA publication, A Brief Guide to
   Mold, Moisture and Your Home, and make the guide available to all residents in an
   appropriate public area. Additionally, provide a current installation-specific fact sheet
   including the preventive measures in paragraphs 2.29.3.1–2.29.3.6 to residents in coastal
   areas and other locations with high humidity, in housing with a history of water damage and
   in housing where construction design has proven susceptible to mold growth.
       2.29.3.1. Immediately on FH resident notification of mold, a housing inspector and a
       maintenance service provider jointly conduct a visual inspection of the unit to identify
       mold growth and water leaks on wall surfaces and in building systems (HVAC,
       ductwork, roof, windows, and so forth) and potential safety risks (electrical shock and
       structural failure). If indicated by the inspection, determine habitability of the unit, and
       schedule a comprehensive inspection and repair according to severity of the problem.
       Keep the resident fully informed of inspection results and remediation plans.
       2.29.3.2. If mold is located in multiple areas or is so extensive (more than 10 square feet)
       that remediation or repair cannot be accomplished in the service provider emergency
28                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


     response time- frame, immediately relocate resident to temporary lodging until
     assessment is complete.
     2.29.3.3. Refer residents reporting mold-related health concerns to their health care
     provider for an evaluation. If requested by the health care provider to support medical
     diagnosis and treatment, request Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) conduct an
     appropriate health risk assessment.
     2.29.3.4. Based on recommendation from a health care provider or as required by the
     scope of the repair, relocate resident from temporary lodging to another adequate house.
     2.29.3.5. For minor mold and mildew or condensation on ceilings, walls and windows,
     request service provider measure indoor humidity and advise resident on how to keep
     humidity low (below 60 percent).
     2.29.3.6. Recommend the following mold preventive measures to FH residents, modified
     as appropriate for the installation, but under no circumstances require a resident reporting
     mold sensitivity to clean mold from their FH unit. In high humidity locations,
     periodically publish preventive measures in the installation newspaper:
              • Dry condensation from affected areas
              • Increase air circulation by using a household fan, kitchen
                vent hood exhaust while cooking and bathroom exhaust
                when shower is in use
              • Minimize dust accumulation throughout the house and
                clean mildew from visible surfaces using a detergent and
                water or mild household cleaner, wearing ordinary
                household rubber gloves
              • Routinely empty water from the air conditioner drip pan
              • Report recurring leaks and persistent mold, mildew and moisture to the
              Housing Flight or maintenance service provider
  2.29.4. Radon. Upon assignment, provide resident with the EPA publication, A Citizen’s
  Guide to Radon, The Guide to protecting Yourself and Your Family From Radon, and
  summary results from any installation radon testing. EPA and the Surgeon General
  recommend testing all homes below the third floor level for radon. Consider furnishing
  simple radon test kits in the Self-Help Store.

                                           Chapter 3

                            ELIGIBILITY AND APPLICATIONS

3.1. Eligibility of Military Members. Members of all Military Services who are commissioned
officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel on active duty and eligible for BAH at the with-
dependent rate, except military-married-to-military (mil-to-mil), are eligible for FH when
accompanied by a dependent or will be accompanied by a dependent within 30 days except
dependent college student. In OCONUS areas, personnel are eligible for FH if they are serving
an accompanied tour and are accompanied or will be joined by authorized command-sponsored
dependents within 30 days. Note: The terms dependent and family member are synonymous.
   3.1.1. Mil-to-mil Members. Mil-to-mil members are authorized FH when jointly assigned to
   the installation. In OCONUS areas, both members must be serving an accompanied tour in
   the area.
   3.1.2. Mil-to-mil parents Separated with Joint Custody of Common Dependents. Only the
   member receiving with-dependent BAH is authorized housing. When physical custody is
   divided equally between the mil-to-mil parents, only the member receiving with dependant
   rate BAH is assigned FH (DoDM 4165.63). If the child will be absent from the FH household
   for more than 30 days, the member must have a Commander-approved waiver to retain FH
   pending return of dependent at a specified date.
   3.1.3. Single Military Members. Single members are authorized FH if receiving with-
   dependent BAH and the dependent shares the household. A military member separated from
   a civilian spouse, with shared custody of a common dependent, must have physical
   (controlling) custody (referred to as custodial custody) of dependent child to be eligible for
   FH (Attachment 1). If the child will be absent from the FH household for more than 30
   days, the member must have a Commander-approved waiver to retain FH pending return of
   dependent at a specified date.
   3.1.4. A single pregnant member may apply for housing 60 days before the expected
   delivery date. A physician statement is required to certify pregnancy and anticipated delivery
   date. The member may be assigned housing when authorized with-dependent BAH (DoDM
   4165.63). If the installation diverts excess housing to UH, the member may occupy the unit
   up to 60 days before the anticipated delivery date. Update ACES to reflect the diversion.
   Use FH funds to maintain housing when diverted to UH. When the member is authorized
   with-dependent BAH, reestablish the unit as FH. Before housing assignment in OCONUS
   areas, the member must provide evidence of application for command sponsorship and tour
   extension as an accompanied member.
   3.1.5. A member with pending marriage may apply for housing 60 days before the marriage.
   A written statement by the member of intent to marry and the date of the event accompanies
   the application and member provides proof of marriage before housing assignment. In
   OCONUS areas, the member must be serving an accompanied tour and have command
   sponsorship for dependent before assignment to FH. The member must provide proof of
   command sponsorship at OCONUS locations before housing assignment.
3.2. Eligibility of Civilian Personnel. Civilians are eligible to reside in FH, when meeting one
of the following criteria. See Chapter 5 for housing civilian personnel:
 30                       AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


      3.2.1. In CONUS and OCONUS, when civilian is K&E and required to live on base as a
      condition of employment (5 U.S.C. 5911, 5 U.S.C. 5912, OMB Circular A-45).
      3.2.2. In OCONUS when appropriate and adequate housing, support services and facilities
      do not exist, are not readily available within the private community or may not be used
      without restrictions (DoD Directive 1400.6).
      3.2.3. In OCONUS, when housing is excess to the needs of the military personnel assigned,
      or those attached to the installation or in the area (5 U.S.C. 5912).
      3.2.4. (DELETED)
      3.2.5. If surplus FH exists at the installation.

Application for Assignment to Housing, and provides PCS orders. ANG and Reserve
members provide active duty orders. If applying online at the Air Force Portal (secure) or
through ACES, members provide orders via FAX, electronic transmission or postal service to the
gaining installation Housing Flight. Personnel acting on behalf of a military member must also
provide a duly executed POA. The effective date of application is the date members depart their

   remarks section of the application. Members applying at the Housing Flight provide
   documentation with the housing application. Members applying online provide information
   on the advance application, print a confirmation copy and present the online application and
   supporting documentation to the gaining Housing Flight upon arrival. The Housing Flight
   requires a physician statement to confirm pregnancy and a written statement from the
   military personnel flight (MPF) to confirm selection for promotion.
       3.3.1.1. Advanced Application. Members ordered to active duty or PCS to a new
       location may submit advance applications. The effective date of advance applications is
       the date the applicant departs the losing installation (including members with TDY
       enroute) or the date ordered to active duty. The effective date of application may not
       predate the date of entry on active duty.
       3.3.1.2. Walk-in Applications. The effective date for a member who walks into the
       gaining installation Housing Flight is as follows:
           3.3.1.2.1. If within 30 days of arrival, the application date will be the departure date
           from the losing installation.
           3.3.1.2.2. If more than 30 days after arrival, the application date will be the date of
           the walk-in.
           3.3.1.2.3. If the date of application is the walk-in date and dependents have not
           arrived on the installation or arrival is more than 30 days; the application date will be
           the date member’s dependents arrive on the installation.
   3.3.2. Mil-to-Mil personnel assigned to the same duty station may apply for FH before
   approval of joint spouse assignment when one member arrives before the other.
   3.3.3. A family member, with a POA duly executed by the member, may apply for and be
   assigned housing at the gaining installation when the member departs an accompanied tour
   and performs temporary duty (TDY) enroute to the PCS location. When the military member
   is attending Officer Training School, the family member may accept enlisted housing if
   available, but will be required to move into officer housing after the newly commissioned
   officer arrives at the installation. The move will be at member’s expense.

one of the following circumstances:
   3.4.1. Member is notified (if member knows date) of impending PCS and has less than 6
   months remaining on station, or until retirement or administrative separation, except for
   reasons of military necessity or to relieve a hardship. Paragraph 3.4.3 does not apply to this

   gaining installation is the date member departs the losing CONUS installation.
   3.5.2. PCS from Long Tour In OCONUS to CONUS. The advance application date for FH
   at the gaining installation is the date member departs the losing installation. If the member
   elects a consecutive OCONUS tour, due to base closure or drawdown, the date of estimated
   return from overseas (DEROS) changes. If the transfer is within 30 months of the date
   member departed CONUS or date member arrived in theater, the advance application date at
   the gaining installation is the date of departure from the CONUS losing installation or arrival
   date in theater, whichever is later. Confirm date departed CONUS via PCS orders.
   3.5.3. Transfer Within or Between OCONUS Theaters Before Completing Tour. Advance
   applications from members involuntarily transferred before completing their OCONUS tour

   installation waiting list. The following rules apply:
       3.5.3.1. The effective date of application is the date of departure from the first losing
       installation. If member submitted no application to the second losing installation, the
       effective date for the gaining installation is the date the member departed the first losing
       installation, assuming the member was then eligible for FH; otherwise, the effective
       application date is the date of eligibility for FH.
       3.5.3.2. Maximum credit may not exceed authorized tour length at the gaining
       installation.
       3.5.3.3. The transfer must occur before the last 6 months of member’s current tour.

AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                          35


     spent on the UDR tour at the losing installation and limit credit to the normal UDR tour
     length.

     3.6.1.3. Family members relocating to other than home-basing or follow-on assignment
     location.
  3.6.2. Procedures:
     3.6.2.1. When member applies for FY within 30 days of returning from a UDR tour, add
     member to the waiting list effective the first day of the arrival month member entered the
     UDR without bypassing members in the freeze zone.
     3.6.2.2. When member is authorized home basing or a follow-on assignment and has
     departed the installation or is at the UDR location, a family member with a duly executed
     POA may apply for and occupy government housing in CONUS and OCONUS in
     member’s absence.
         3.6.2.2.1. The effective date of the application is the date the family member applies
         as a walk-in or online applicant. If the family member has not received a housing
         assignment when the member completes and returns from the UDR tour, the
         application effective date is adjusted to include, but may not exceed, the UDR tour
         length.
         3.6.2.2.2. Do not give short tour credit to mil-to-mil members when both return from
         a joint remote tour of duty.
         3.6.2.2.3. Date of rank (DOR) is adjusted to reflect UDR credit for eligible senior
         officer applicants. NOTE: The SOFA between the United States and foreign
         governments takes precedence over AF housing policy. Members should determine
         SOFA restrictions before commitment to any action that might leave family members
         unaccompanied. In some countries, family members may not be allowed to remain in
         country when the military member is no longer assigned to the installation. Caution

     location at government expense.
     3.6.3.3. Family members relocating to other than home-basing or follow-on assignment
     location.

                            OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES

4.1. Waiting Lists. The Housing Flight maintains separate waiting lists in ACES by grade,
bedroom requirement and type of housing requested (Table 4.1, Table 4.2 and Table 4.3).
4.2. Prioritizing Waiting Lists. Use the following priorities to determine placement on the
waiting list. Commanders may approve other than the following priority placement on a case-by-
case hardship basis.
   4.2.1. Priority 1. Members and civilians assigned to SCP, K&E positions and Command
   positions. Personnel with Commander-approved hardships, after SCP, K&E and Command
   positions (AFI 32-6003).
   4.2.2. Priority 2.
       4.2.2.1. Eligible members and equivalent civilians (in OCONUS areas) who are assigned
       or attached to the installation for duty, or assigned to another installation served by the
       Housing Flight and housing support is authorized by an ISA or Letter of Agreement
       (LOA).
       4.2.2.2. Members of all Services assigned ID to the housing market area with no housing
       support available from their parent Service.
       4.2.2.3. Unaccompanied dependents of members serving a UDR tour meeting
       requirements in paragraph 3.6.
       4.2.2.4. Public Health Service, U.S. Coast Guard and other non-DoD federal agency
       members receiving a housing allowance.
       4.2.2.5. ARC Director.
   4.2.3. Priority 3. All other members and civilians eligible for FH but not assigned or
   attached to the installation.
   4.2.4. Priority 4. Unaccompanied dependents of members (except members on a UDR tour),
   foreign liaison and SAT personnel.
4.3. Managing Waiting Lists. The DoD premise is each family member (dependent, exclusive
of spouse), is assigned a bedroom if existing housing inventory permits; otherwise, determine
housing requirement by grade, family size and composition, but do not place a member on more
than one waiting list. Display a current waiting list in the Housing Flight for public viewing, as
well as other locations accessible at other than normal duty hours.
   4.3.1. Determine appropriate bedroom entitlement based on the member’s grade and family
   composition (Table 4.1, Table 4.2 and Table 4.3). Use the table that provides the most
   bedrooms unless the member voluntarily accepts less.
   4.3.1. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Families will be housed IAW AFI 32-6001, Table 4.2, based
   on grade, with the exception of 5-bedroom units. Due to limited quantities for Junior and
   Senior Enlisted members, individuals will automatically be placed on the 4-bedroom waiting
   list, unless family size and composition meet the 5-bedroom requirements. Members will be
   briefed upon arrival. Members will be placed on the 5-bedroom waiting list within the first
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                          37


  30 days of arrival, while maintaining the same effective date. (Members who choose to
  change after this date, will assume a new walk-in date). Spangdahlem does not have any 5-
  bedroom officer units available.
  4.3.2. Members may voluntarily apply for and be assigned FH that has one bedroom less
  than their entitlement, if such housing exists in their grade category.
     4.3.2.1. No more than two dependent children may be assigned to a bedroom unless the
     Commander certifies in writing one bedroom can accommodate more (DoDM 4165.63).
     Members who voluntarily occupy housing with fewer bedrooms than their entitlement
     may apply for larger housing immediately after assignment. The application date will be
     as a walk-in or the original effective date if the member applied within 30 days of PCS
     arrival. The member pays for a subsequent move into larger housing.
  4.3.3. Members occupying FH and gaining an entitlement within 12 months, such as an
  increase in number of dependents, maturation of children or promotion, may apply for
  housing and be placed on the waiting list. The effective date of application is when the
  member walks into the Housing Flight. Housing is not assigned until the event occurs unless
  the waiting list is exhausted or the installation has adequate excess housing. The member
  pays for the move except as provided for in paragraph 11.10.1.1.
  4.3.4. Members on the waiting list should notify the Housing Flight when there is a change
  in their housing entitlement, including promotion, demotion, divorce, remarriage, gain in
  dependents, dependents no longer residing with member or member no longer residing with
  dependents. When category of housing or bedroom entitlement changes, the member may
  transfer to a new waiting list using the same date of application from which the waiting list
  member transferred.
  4.3.5. Except for the assignment of K&E personnel and hardship cases, the top 10 percent of
  each waiting list is protected from bumping (freeze zone).
  4.3.6. A mil-to-mil member assigned to the installation may remain on the waiting list for up
  to 3 months awaiting approval of joint spouse assignment, but must be removed from the
  waiting list if the joint spouse does not join the member at the gaining installation
  (paragraph 3.3.2).
  4.3.7. Members accepting a written commitment for assignment to housing are removed
  from the waiting list and the commitment is honored.
  4.3.8. Maintain senior and general officer (O-6 to O-10) waiting lists in the following order
  using the date of rank as the effective date of application in ACES:
          Grade
          Date of Rank (DOR)
          Length of service
          Date of birth
  4.3.9. Maintain prestige housing (E-9) in the following order:
           Grade
           Date of Rank (DOR)
           Length of service

           Date of birth



  4.3.10. Maintain other grades, including field grade (O-4 to O-5), company grade (O-1 to O-
  3 and W-1 to W- 4), senior NCO (E-7 to E-8) and enlisted (E-1 to E-6), in the following
  order:
           Priority
           Effective date of application
           Grade

           (DOR)
           Length of
           service
           Date of birth
  4.3.11. Consider community housing as the primary source of housing for a FH applicant
  with more dependents than can be suitably housed in available on-base housing using Table
  4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis for a K&E member when the
  local community cannot support the housing requirement. For K&E personnel, the
  Commander may consider temporarily converting two adjoining housing units into one large
  unit or approving a waiver to allow more than two children to share a bedroom.
     4.3.11.1. Members on the waiting list in the same category that are eligible for the next
     higher, then lower, bedroom requirement.
     4.3.11.2. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower category, which are
     eligible for the same bedroom requirements.
     4.3.11.3. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower, category and
     bedroom requirements.
     4.3.11.4. Other members according to priorities in paragraph 4.2.
  4.3.12. Exhausted Waiting List. When a waiting list for a specific bedroom requirement
  within a category of housing is exhausted and there are no eligible applicants, the projected
  vacancy is offered to other members according to the priorities below. The most urgent
  housing need determines whether the vacancy is offered to a lower or higher category:
     4.3.12.1. Members on the waiting list in the same category who are eligible for the next
     higher, then lower, bedroom requirement.
     4.3.12.2. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower category, who are
     eligible for the same bedroom requirements.
     4.3.12.3. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower, category and
     bedroom requirements.
     4.3.12.4. Other members according to priorities in paragraph 4.2.

NOTE:
1. The terms dependent and family member are synonymous. See Attachment 1 for dependent,

2. Assign one bedroom to member or member with spouse. Dependent family members
married to each other (dependent parents of member or member’s spouse) are entitled to one
bedroom.
3. If inventory permits, assign one child per bedroom.
4. No child may share a bedroom with parents.
5. No more than two children may share a bedroom, except with commander approval
(Paragraphs 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.11).
6. A child 6 years or older may not share a bedroom with a child of the opposite sex.
7. Children over 10 years old may not share a bedroom.
4.4. Housing Availability. Within 2-3 workdays of receiving an advance application for
housing, forward ACES-generated DD Form 1747 or locally produced fact sheet to the member
outlining the housing status at the gaining base. Commanders may incorporate procedures into
the installation in-and-out processing process to make sure applicants promptly report to the
Housing Flight, a requirement also stated on members PCS orders.
4.5. Assignment to Family Housing (FH). Do not use or assign FH identified on real property
records as temporary housing. Use ACES and the ACES-generated AF IMT 1326, Change of
Occupancy Report, to record and track offers, refusals and assignments. Offer the first available
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                             41


uncommitted house to the first eligible member on the waiting list and physically present at the
installation. If reasonable attempts fail to contact the member, make the offer to the next
member on the waiting list. The assignment is complete when the member accepts keys for the
housing unit. Unless the installation has excess housing (see Attachment 1 for definition), do
not assign FH to members with less than 6 months retainability at the installation. Do not assign
housing until the member is present for duty and is accompanied or will be joined by family
members within 30 days (dependent college students excepted) at the installation, except for
families of members on UDR assignment and base closure transition personnel and family
members authorized by paragraph 3.3.3. Make offer and obtain acceptance in writing.
   4.5.1. Give member a minimum 30-day advance notice of assignment to FH to allow time to
   notify landlord of their intent to move. If a 30-day notice is not possible because of a short-
   notice PCS assignment of current occupant, consider the following options, depending on
   local conditions:
       4.5.1.1. Hold the unit vacant up to 30 days for the first member on the waiting list who is
       physically present at the installation and has accepted the housing.
       4.5.1.2. Offer a unit to applicants on the waiting list, in succession, until the unit is
       accepted.
   4.5.2. Members may exercise a turndown option for any reason and a turndown is assessed.
   Bypass members on the waiting list who do not accept the offer for reasons beyond their
   control (fulfill a lease commitment or when given a short notice of housing availability) and
   do not assess a turndown. For members under lease, do not bypass more than 1 year or the
   term of the lease, whichever occurs first. This bypassing provision does not apply to personal
   situations, such as a home sale. To ensure compliance and maintain program integrity, the
   Housing Flight Chief must review documentation to support bypassing member.
       4.5.2.1. Except for incumbents of K&E positions, personnel with approved hardships
       and personnel on TLA, members may exercise their option to turn down a FH unit. A
       member is given 1 duty day to accept or decline the unit. Apply the following rules to
       turndown options:
           4.5.2.1.1. Offer the unit to the next member on the waiting list.
           4.5.2.1.2. Do not remove members from the waiting list when exercising their
           turndown option for the first time.
           4.5.2.1.3. Remove members from the waiting list when they refuse housing the
           second time and do not allow them to reapply for 90 days unless the waiting list is
           exhausted.
   4.5.3. Members who relocate from one on-base FH unit to another at the same installation
   must complete the move within 5 duty days.
   4.5.4. Record assignments in ACES and on printed version of ACES-generated AF IMT
   1326 and complete the following applicable forms at the time of occupancy and maintain in
   the resident housing folder:
            AF IMT 227, Quarters Condition Inspection Report
            AF IMT 228, Furnishings Custody Receipt and Condition Report
 42                    AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


            AF IMT 3505, Condition of Occupancy for Military Family Housing
            AF IMT 3506, Customer Initial and Final Evaluation of Quarters Inspection
            (voluntary by member)
4.6. Assignment Priorities. Assign when member has at least 6 months retainability at the
installation. Assign eligible members and their dependents from the top of the waiting list (freeze
zone) in descending order to adequate housing according to the following priorities:
   4.6.1. Personnel in Designated Positions. Give precedence to incumbents of SCPs,
   Command and K&E positions and place at the top of the waiting list including the freeze
   zone without displacing members with a firm housing commitment (paragraph 2.20).
   4.6.2. Personnel With Approved Hardship. With written approval from the Commander,
   assign housing as an out-of-turn assignment for hardship conditions. Assign member to the
   next uncommitted unit in the appropriate grade and bedroom category to satisfy the
   requirement and do not allow a turndown option. Only the Commander or delegated
   representative may approve hardship requests (paragraph 1.6.9.2).
   4.6.3. Members Assigned or Attached for Duty at the Installation. This priority includes
   eligible personnel assigned to units, organizations and detachments or any Service personnel
   such as recruiters and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), who are:
       4.6.3.1. Located on or attached to the installation for housing support.
       4.6.3.2. Located in the vicinity or within commuting distance of the installation, when an
       ISA includes housing support with the host installation. NOTE: When an AF
       installation provides housing support to another Service, AF housing policy takes
       precedence over other Service policy.
       4.6.3.3. ID Member assigned duty away from a military area where the parent Service
       cannot reasonably provide support facilities (such as housing). The installation with FH
       nearest the ID site provides FH, unless another installation within commuting distance
       (either 60 minutes or 20 miles) consents to a transfer of the responsibility.
4.7. Foreign OCONUS Mandatory Assignments. AF policy is to rely on local communities
first to provide adequate housing; however, installation commanders at foreign OCONUS
locations only may require personnel to live in on-base housing for force protection and mission
essential purposes. To avoid underutilizing government-controlled housing, the Commander may
also institute mandatory assignments for a 6-month period for the following housing categories:
   4.7.1. Long-Term Leased Units. If mandatory assignments do not achieve the AF occupancy
   goal of 98 percent within 6 months, renegotiate the lease based on current housing
   requirements and divest underutilized units through attrition.
   4.7.2. Government Housing Provided by Host Nation. Review historical occupancy rates
   and determine an appropriate occupancy rate based on current housing requirements. If
   mandatory assignment does not achieve the revised occupancy rate within 6 months, develop
   a strategy to divest underutilized housing.
4.8. Personal Preference Options. When a wide variance in style, type, location, age or design
of adequate housing exists, the Commander may permit personal preference options for the type
of FH member desires. Offer members housing consistent with their recorded preference. Offer
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                            43


members expressing no housing preference any house that becomes available for assignment
consistent with their grade and family composition. Guidance follows for this option:
4.8. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Personal Preference Options. Options are Spangdahlem and
Bitburg housing.
   4.8.1. The Housing Flight Chief recommends type and extent of personal preference options
   for Commander approval.
   4.8.2. Record approved options in a base supplement to this AFI.
   4.8.3. Members may exercise this option when they apply for FH or when they arrive at the
   installation and may change their preference at any time. Although a preference may not be
   changed in lieu of a turndown, members with an assessed turndown may change their options
   before being offered a second FH unit.
   4.8.4. Administer personal preference options within existing waiting list policies and do not
   establish a separate waiting list to accommodate this provision. Update ACES with approved
   options and maintain option preferences on each member in ACES. Members with a
   preference remain on the waiting list and are bypassed until a FH unit meeting their
   preference is available. Members exercising this option are not notified of other available
   housing, except members receiving TLA are notified because they are required to accept
   available adequate housing or forfeit their TLA.
   4.8.5. The Commander should consider discontinuing personal preference options when
   occupancy rates drop below the AF goal of 98 percent, except if the low occupancy rate is
   related to assignment to surplus housing.

                                              Chapter 5

                             HOUSING CIVILIAN PERSONNEL

5.1. Authority. Commanders may provide housing to eligible civilian employees when one of
the following criteria is met:
   5.1.1. When civilian employees are K&E and are required to live on base as a condition of
   employment (5 U.S.C. 5911, 5 U.S.C. 5912 and OMB Circular A-45) and the position is
   identified in a base supplement to this AFI.
   5.1.2. In OCONUS areas when appropriate and adequate housing, support services and
   facilities do not exist, are not readily available in the local community or may not be used
   without restrictions (DoDD 1400.6).
   5.1.3. When housing is excess to the needs of military personnel assigned or attached to the
   installation or to an adjacent installation (5 U.S.C. 5911).
5.2. Eligibility. Establish procedures with the local civilian personnel flight (CPF) to verify
civilian employee eligibility. Except for K&E civilians, occupancy of FH is limited to 5
consecutive years at any location. When both spouses are DoD employees at the same or
adjacent installations and both are eligible for FH, they jointly decide whose eligibility to use but
are not eligible for FH at both installations. Refer to Table 5.1 for a comparison of military and
civilian grades.
5.3. Pro Rata Distribution:
   5.3.1. Pro rata distribution is based on total population of eligible military and civilian
   personnel, without regard to housing categories or size of the units (number of bedrooms)
   required. Count civilians residing in housing regardless of how long they have resided in
   housing. However, do not count civilians as eligible if they have terminated housing as a
   result of the 5-year rule or if they have been served notice of termination as a result of the 5-
   year rule but are in housing pending relocation. Use the following formula for computing the
   pro rata share:
                         Eligible Civilians                × Housing Assets = Pro rata Share
                  Total Eligible (Military and Civilian)
   5.3.2. To determine the number of housing assets exclude FH units designated for SCP,
   command and K&E positions and exclude the incumbents from the total personnel count.
5.4. Termination. When there is a waiting list, issue 60-day mandatory termination notices to
civilians who have occupied housing for over 5 years (except K&E personnel). When local
community housing is adequate and sufficient to house civilians, at the Commander’s discretion,
issue termination notices to civilians who have occupied FH 5 years or longer. When directed,
the move is at government expense.
5.5. Rental Charges. See 11.8 for reimbursement of the MFH account (AFI 65-601, Section
21E).
   5.5.1. CONUS (includes Alaska, Hawaii and US territories). At CONUS locations, where
   eligible civilian employees are not authorized an LQA funded with APF:
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                            45


       5.5.1.1. Eligible civilian employees, who are offered and elect to occupy government-
       managed housing (includes leased housing), must pay a monthly rental charge based on a
       fair market rental rate.
       5.5.1.2. The fair market rental rates include heat, electricity, fuel, furniture and other
       services. See OMB Circular A-45 for specific processes to determine fair market value.
       If assigned government-managed housing, the rental charge is a reimbursement to the FH
       account (AFI 65-601, Section 21E).
   5.5.2. OCONUS (See the defined terms “eligible civilian employee” and “DoD-sponsored
   civilian employee”):
       5.5.2.1. At OCONUS locations, where eligible civilian employees are authorized LQA
       funded with APF, and who are offered and elect to occupy government-managed housing
       are not authorized to continue to receive LQA. No further charges are required from the
       civilian employee or their agency.
       5.5.2.2. At OCONUS locations, where eligible civilian employees are not authorized
       LQA funded with APF, and who are offered and elect to occupy government-managed
       housing, must pay a monthly rental charge based on the established LQA rate of the
       equivalent grade. If assigned government-managed housing, the rental charge is a
       reimbursement to the MFH account (AFI 65-601, Section 21E).
       5.5.2.3. At OCONUS locations, a DoD-sponsored civilian employee offered and
       assigned government- managed housing must pay a rental charge based on the LQA rate
       of equivalent DoD civilian employee. If assigned government-managed housing, the
       rental charge is a reimbursement to the MFH account (AFI 65-601, Section 21E).
5.6. Household Goods (HHG) Storage. Unless authorized and funded by the employing
organization, do not authorize government-paid HHG storage incidental to civilians occupying
government housing.

   and assessed a fair market rental charge.
   5.7.2. In OCONUS areas, ARC employees in the positions listed in Table 5.1 may be
   assigned to FH without rental charge. All other ARC full-time personnel pay a rental charge
   equal to the LQA of a DoD civilian employee of equivalent grade.

                                          Chapter 6

                            RETENTION AND TERMINATION

6.1. Retention of Assigned Housing. The Air Force intent is that eligible members keep
housing for the duration of their tour at the installation unless there are reasons that justify
reassignment or termination. Requests to retain FH are submitted in writing with supporting
documentation to the Commander through the Housing Flight Chief. If the Commander has
delegated approval authority, the Housing Flight Chief may approve retention requests.
Disapproval authority is the responsibility of the Commander, but may be delegated to mission
support or equivalent level group commander (paragraph 1.6.9). Members and their families
are usually allowed to retain FH for longer than normal occupancy periods under the following
conditions:
   6.1.1. Member in Missing Status. Dependent of a member who is officially reported in
   missing status (includes members who are captured, interned and involuntarily detained
   foreign OCONUS) are permitted to retain housing for up to 12 months. The member’s BAH
   is forfeited during occupancy of dependent.
   6.1.2. Member Incarcerated (Jailed or Imprisoned). Dependents may request to retain
   housing when the member is entitled to BAH/OHA during the period of incarceration. The
   Commander determines approval and the retention period.
   6.1.3. TDY. A member may retain housing at the home station while on TDY for duty or
   training.
   6.1.4. PCS With TDY En Route (does not apply to OCONUS areas). Member may retain
   housing during period of a TDY while attending Service or training school (PCS) for a
   period of 1 year or less until dependents commence travel on member’s PCS orders.
   6.1.5. PCS From CONUS to Accompanied OCONUS Tour. If concurrent travel of
   dependents is disapproved and the anticipated travel delay for dependents is less than 20
   weeks, dependents may retain housing for 20 weeks after member departs. NOTE: Member
   must agree to serve an accompanied tour and apply for command sponsorship for dependents
   to travel to the new duty station.
   6.1.6. Transfer to Hospital. A hospitalized member may retain FH for the period of
   hospitalization or a period agreed on by the Commander, the Installation Surgeon General
   and Housing Flight Chief.
   6.1.7. Member Dies While on Active Duty. Dependents of a member who dies on active
   duty, who occupy adequate FH other than on a rental basis, on the date of the member’s
   death, may retain housing without charge for a period of 365 days (37 U.S.C. 403).
       6.1.7.1. The Commander may extend occupancy beyond 365 days on a case-by-case
       basis, but dependents must pay a rental charge equal to the equivalent BAH of member.
   6.1.8. Completion of School Term. Commanders may approve retention of housing for
   dependent to complete a school term for student to graduate or if student would lose credit if
   required to withdraw or transfer (paragraph 6.3.8).
 50                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   6.1.9. Dependents Unable to Accompany Sponsor Due to Medical or School Delay.
   Dependents denied travel to an accompanied foreign OCONUS area due to lack of medical
   or school facilities in the foreign OCONUS location may retain FH for a period determined
   by the Commander. Member requests approval on AF IMT 1466, Family Member’s
   Medical and Education Clearance for Travel.
   6.1.10. Educational Leave of Absence Program (ELAP). While enrolled in ELAP members
   may retain FH on a space available basis (paragraph 2.28).
   6.1.11. Unaccompanied Families. Dependents of member assigned to a UDR, home-basing
   tour or follow-on assignment who occupy government FH including leased units when the
   sponsor departs, may retain housing until the sponsor returns or reports to the next PDS.
   Commanders may approve extended retention when the sponsor extends their UDR tour. FH
   is terminated within 60 days of member’s return from the UDR location. This provision
   includes mil-to-mil members with no dependents. The Commander may also encourage
   residents to retain FH for the duration of the sponsor’s UDR tour.
6.2. Retention for Hardships. Commanders may approve a written request for housing
retention to relieve hardship (defined in Attachment 1).
   6.2.1. Commanders may permit members or dependents to retain FH based on hardship for
   periods shown in Table 6.1 and may extend the periods on a case-by-case basis. The
   occupant must pay rent as stated in Table 6.1. This does not apply to transition assistance
   benefit. As provided in 10 U.S.C. 1147, transition benefits may not continue more than 365
   days after the date of separation.

6.3. Termination of Family Housing (FH). Military members may voluntarily terminate FH
for any reason after completing a mandatory 1-year tenancy. Members terminating FH give the
Housing Flight at least 40 days notice and must terminate occupancy of FH under the following
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                           51


circumstances. Refer to Chapter 11 for moves funded by the government and moves for which
the member is responsible:
   6.3.1. Waiver to Mandatory Residency. Commanders may waive the 1-year mandatory
   residency requirement when in the best interest of the Air Force or when a hardship exists.
   Waiver approval may be delegated to the BCE or Housing Flight Chief. Disapproval may be
   delegated to mission support or equivalent level group commander (paragraph 1.6).
   6.3.2. PCS. A member who receives PCS orders to another installation must terminate
   housing before departing, except those with authorized retention.
   6.3.3. Enlisted Member Commissioned as an Officer. An enlisted member who accepts a
   commission and active duty, with no interruption of active Military Service, relocates to
   officer housing unless the member has less than 6 months retainability at the installation.
   Move will be at government expense.
   6.3.4. Commissioned Officer Who Remains on Active Duty in Enlisted Status. A
   commissioned officer who is separated and re-enlists or who assumes an enlisted grade
   relocates to enlisted housing unless the member has less than 6 months retainability at the
   installation. Move will be at government expense.
   6.3.5. Family Separation. When a member no longer lives with dependents or dependents
   no longer live with the member, the member must terminate housing within 30 days from
   date of separation. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR,
   U5630B, and paragraph 11.7).
   6.3.6. Adverse Conduct or Behavior. Commanders may require a member to terminate FH
   with 30 days notice when member or dependent’s conduct or behavior is contrary to accepted
   standards or adverse to military discipline. Fully document and retain the termination notice
   on file for a minimum of 1 year. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable
   (JFTR, U5630B).
      6.3.6.1. When the member fails to comply with the AF family child care policies, the
      Commander may terminate the member’s housing privileges. Move is at government
      expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR, U5630B).
   6.3.7. Destruction or Abuse of Property. Commanders may terminate FH with a 30-day
   notice when the member or dependents are responsible for willful, malicious or negligent
   abuse or destruction of property. Fully document and retain termination on file for a
   minimum of 1 year. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR,
   U5630B).
   6.3.8. Separation or Retirement. A member who is separating or retiring must terminate
   housing no later than the date of separation or retirement from active duty. The Housing
   Flight Chief (with delegated approval authority) may approve retention of 60 days to relieve
   a hardship that occurs after member applies for separation or retirement when conditions are
   beyond their control (provision in paragraph 6.1.8 excepted). MAJCOM approval is
   required for extensions beyond the 60 days. Separated and retired members must pay a daily
   rental charge equal to one-thirtieth of the combined BAH or OHA. Rental fees may not be
   waived.

   6.3.9. Death of Qualifying Dependent or Military Spouse. Members terminate FH within 90
   days following the death of a military spouse or a family member who qualified them for
   BAH at the with-dependent rate. The Commander may approve retention beyond the 90
   days.
6.4. Termination Procedures. Members should give at least 40 days advance notice of intent
to terminate FH upon PCS, separation or retirement. The following procedures apply:
   6.4.1. The occupant provides one copy of PCS, separation, retirement, or other orders to
   housing management.
   6.4.2. Use ACES to manage terminations, generate AF Form 594, Application to Start,
   Stop or Change Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) or Dependency Redetermination,
   establish required inspections and track results. AF IMT 1326 documents termination
   milestones, which enables monthly reconciliation of ACES data.
   6.4.3. When the occupant has met clearance requirements and settled property accounts
   promptly relieve the resident of responsibility and terminate the housing assignment.
   6.4.4. Prepare AF Form 594 to notify the FSO of a change in housing status. The member's
   BAH or OHA is reinstated upon satisfactorily clearing FH or physical departure from the
   PDS, whichever occurs first. Failure to provide appropriate advance notice of termination of
   housing may affect member’s BAH start date (DoDR 7000.14, Volume 7A, Chapter 26,
   Table 26-6, Date to Start BAH - Members w/Dependents).
   6.4.5. DoD Civilians. Issue a dated and signed clearance document as evidence of housing
   termination. Provide one copy of the termination document to the FSO and the servicing
   CPF, as appropriate.
6.5. Involuntary Relocation Between Housing Units. When involuntary relocations are
required to complete emergency repairs and major renovation projects, the Commander directs
residents to relocate to other FH or to community housing. Unless compelling circumstances
exist, do not involuntarily relocate residents for redesignation or redistribution of FH. Instead,
redistribute housing vacated by normal attrition. When occupants are directed to relocate, offer
the next available uncommitted unit appropriate for their grade and family size and no turndown
option is allowed. The move is at government expense (paragraph 11.10).
6.6. Family Housing (FH) Inspections. The three inspections associated with the occupancy of
FH are the initial, pretermination and final. The member and a housing inspector jointly perform
inspections. The inspector and the occupant sign and retain a copy of AF IMT 227 and AF IMT
228 if government-owned furniture is provided. Accomplish inspections as follows:
   6.6.1. Initial Inspection. Perform the initial inspection in the housing unit, when possible, at
   time of occupancy or as soon as possible thereafter. Record the condition of the FH unit,
   furnishings, equipment, appliances and grounds on AF IMT 227, and AF IMT 228 if
   applicable, according to instructions on the reverse of the form. Advise new residents that if
   the condition of the housing unit, appliances, equipment and government furnishings differ
   from the entries recorded on the AF IMT 227, the resident must submit the discrepancies in
   writing to the Housing Flight within 15 days of the move-in date to preclude an assumption
   of occupant damage. Complete AF IMT 3505 during the initial inspection. Brief residents on
   issues, such as, but not limited to:
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                           53


          - Installation housing brochure (provide copy)
          - Appliances and mechanical systems
          - Minor M&R, such as changing light bulbs, replacing heat/air
          conditioner (AC) filters, securing door stops, replacing sink stoppers,
          cleaning stove burners, plunging toilets/sinks and basic insect control
          - Cleaning standards (reverse of AF IMT 227)
          - Grounds care
          - Self-Help Program and Self-Help Store
          - Refuse and recycle
          - Telephone numbers for emergencies and local services
          - Environmental hazards, as applicable (lead-based paint, mold, asbestos, radon)
  6.6.2. Pretermination Inspection. Perform the pretermination inspection 30-45 days before
  the resident vacates FH to facilitate scheduling COM and other repairs. Compare the
  condition of the unit to the initial inspection recorded on AF IMT 227. Inform terminating
  residents of their responsibilities for damaged or missing property and how to make
  restitution. If the resident does not agree to repair or reimburse for occupant damage or if
  damage is over $500, request an ROS. The ROS process may be disregarded when the value
  is less than $500 and the member is willing to pay for the damage (paragraph 2.8).
  6.6.3. Final Inspection. The purpose of the final inspection is to clear the member of
  responsibility for the unit.
     6.6.3.1. Use standardized cleaning requirements for all residents and make sure the
     resident accomplishes DoD-mandated cleaning listed on the reverse of AF IMT 227
     (DoDM 4165-63).
     6.6.3.2. The government performs final cleaning of portions of the FH unit scheduled to
     be repaired or replaced and required cleaning not included on the reverse of AF IMT 227.
     The government also performs final cleaning of FH units in geographical locations where
     TLA is authorized to reduce TLA for departing members. See AFI 65-601, Volume I,
     Budget Guidance and Procedures (Chapter 21) and AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation
     Symbols and Budget Codes, for turnover maintenance, cleaning and clearing FH units
     when occupants change.
     6.6.3.3. Schedule a reinspection of a failed final inspection at the earliest mutually
     agreed date to prevent disrupting the member’s scheduled departure. Do not identify new
     inspection items except obvious defects for which the member is responsible that have
     occurred since the most recent inspection.
     6.6.3.4. Arrange for a commercial contractor to clean and repair occupant damages in
     abandoned units and seek reimbursement from the member using DD Form 139, Pay
     Adjustment Authorization.
  6.6.4. Self-Help Work. When authorized self-help work is performed, occupants are
  responsible for returning the unit and surrounding grounds to the original configuration,
  unless housing management approves transfer of the self-help project to the next occupant.
 54                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   Residents may donate and the AF may accept self-help improvements when workmanship
   and aesthetics meet acceptable construction standards.
6.7. Customer Evaluations. Provide each customer with an AF IMT 3506 or locally developed
comment form to measure customer service. Request customers evaluate the service they
received during the inspection process and return the form to the Housing Flight. The Housing
Flight Chief uses the feedback to improve the inspection processes.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                              55

   7.1.1. Adequate housing is required within a commuting distance of either 60 minutes or 20
   miles of the installation.
   7.1.2. DoD personnel are entitled to an equal opportunity to reside in housing free from
   discriminatory practices. When a resident reports circumstances that appear suspicious of
   illegal discrimination, the Housing Flight Chief immediately initiates a review in cooperation
   with installation and community agencies (Attachment 3).
7.2. Housing Services. Offer complete referral services and a full range of relocation assistance
and monitor community housing referral and relocation activities to make sure they provide
needed services, they are free from discrimination and provide equal opportunity and treatment

                                           Chapter 8

                  PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR (M&R)

8.1. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Standards. Maintain FH units according to AF
standards in The Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and
Construction. The BCE and Housing Flight Chief ensure AF standards through routine
preventive maintenance programs, accomplishing M&R according to accepted engineering
practices, experience and manufacturer recommendations and by fostering an attitude of home
ownership among residents.
   8.1.1. Inform residents to promptly notify the service provider when the FH structure,
   equipment or fixture is defective, broken, damaged or malfunctioning, and that they must
   allow entry into the housing unit for necessary repairs. Schedule routine work in occupied
   units with minimum disruption to occupants.
   8.1.2. The service provider completes urgent or emergency work within a time period
   consistent with the degree of urgency and schedules nonemergency and routine work in the
   most economical and efficient manner. Maintenance personnel must also take proper
   precautions to protect the resident’s personal property and leave the worksite clean and
   orderly. To reduce disruption to the occupant, accomplish maintenance tasks during COM,
   when possible.
   8.1.3. Identify requirements to improve or replace FH units, infrastructure, playgrounds and
   other common grounds in the housing area IAW HCP priorities and accomplish the work
   IAW AFI 32-6002 and program guidance letters. Inspect playgrounds annually and maintain
   according to standards in the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Publication No.
   325, Handbook for Public Play- ground Safety.
8.2. Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM). COM is minor M&R required to make the
FH unit ready for the next occupant. Identify repairs during the pretermination and final
inspection. Since COM costs are excluded from the $20,000 M&R limitation in FH (non-
GOQs), limit COM repairs to minor M&R, carpet and drapery cleaning and replacement, floor
refinishing, interior painting and replacing filters. Maintain COM maintenance start and stop
dates in ACES to ensure accuracy of the ACES-generated FH Occupancy and Utilization Report.
8.3. Maintenance and Repair (M&R). The following are examples of minor and major M&R
when performed during COM:
   8.3.1. Minor M&R:
            Interior painting
            Floor and wall repair
            Restoring ceiling and wall finishes
            Electrical and plumbing fixture repair
            Landscaping and planting trees and shrubs
   8.3.2. Major M&R:
            Restoration or replacement of structural members in the original locations, such as
            repairing or replacing foundation, roof, exterior structure or wall, exterior painting,
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                                  61


             interior partition, electrical, plumbing, heating ventilations and air conditioning.

8.4. Minor Alterations. Minor alteration is construction or improvement (new) work typically
performed in support of an M&R project and funded with FH M&R funds (P-722). However,
some circumstances may warrant use of minor alteration without repair. Minor alteration work
installs or constructs systems, or features that do not currently exist or changes systems, features
or spaces that already exist. Use this authority for interior and exterior work consistent with AF
standards. Do not use this authority to increase the size of any unit or increase the number of
rooms in any unit.
   8.4.1. Replacement of functioning or serviceable material, system or component systems
   before the end of their useful life is classified as minor alteration. Replacement of failed or
   unserviceable materials, systems or components with contemporary standard components or
   materials, consistent with local standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle
   analysis. Replacement of failed or unserviceable materials, systems or components with an
   upgraded material, component or system that exceeds contemporary standards or local
   standards is classified as minor alteration. Anti-Terrorism/ Force Protection (AT/FP)
   requirements supported by documented vulnerability assessments are excluded from minor
   alteration cost limits (AFI 32-6002).
   8.4.2. Examples of minor alteration work are:
             Installing new planting areas or borders which are not currently installed.
             Replacing carpet with wood flooring or tile (even if the carpet is due for
             replacement).
             Replacing laminate countertop with an upgraded surface such as Corian or
             granite.
             Installing new outlets and/or lighting which is not currently installed.
             Replacing window air conditioning unit with ducted system.
8.5. Maintenance of Common Areas. The installation maintains grounds in common areas of
FH. For individual units, installation responsibility is limited to erosion control, tree surgery,
screening and overall attractiveness except for units with an approved waiver (paragraph
2.14.1). Use low maintenance shrubbery and hedges that do not require trimming.
8.6. Maintenance of Government-Installed Carpet. Clean government-installed carpet, as
needed, IAW the AFCEE carpet guide, the most current ETL and manufacturer instructions to
preserve the quality and life of the carpet (www.afcesa.af.mil) (paragraph 2.26).

                        FAMILY HOUSING (FH) REQUIREMENTS

9.1. Air Force Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). The AF FHMP provides a corporate,
requirements-based housing investment strategy that integrates and prioritizes traditional
construction and O&M funding with private sector financing in a single road map. The road
map identifies the most cost-effective investment option for each installation (use of privatization
authorities or traditional MILCON) to meet its FH requirements consistent with congressional
and OSD constraints and directives (USAF Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming,
Design, and Construction).
9.2. Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA). DoD requires the local
community to be the first source for satisfying housing requirements of military families. DoD
requires Military Services to determine requirements based on a thorough analysis of the local
community’s ability to house military families. To meet this requirement, the AF uses the
HRMA. The HRMA assesses the type and amount of community housing, including privatized
housing on and off base, that satisfies DoD suitability criteria. Housing constructed with
appropriated funds or privatization authorities can be used to meet housing demand not satisfied
by the local community. The HRMA should be conducted every 3 years.
9.3. Housing Community Profile (HCP). The HCP provides a long-range plan for planning,
programming, design and construction of improvements, replacement and privatized FH. The
HCP is key to the Whole-House/Whole Neighborhood Program. It is the justification for housing
design projects submitted to HQ USAF/A7CH by the installation/MAJCOM. The AF has
completed HCPs for all installations with a housing inventory. Updates are accomplished
approximately every 3 years, depending on the installation mission requirement. The HCP
provides assessments of FH current conditions, describes actions and associated costs to update
FH to modern standards and determines the best investment decision (improvement or
replacement) for each installation.
9.4. Installation Family Housing Master Plan (IFHMP). The IFHMP incorporates data from
the HRMA and HCP and adjusts the HCP data to reflect the beginning of the Fiscal Year
Defense Planning (FYDP). This adjustment assumes projects programmed in years prior to the
beginning of the FYDP are complete and future investment funding requirements start with the
beginning of the FYDP. The IFHMP also documents the O&M funding requirements including
operations, utilities, leases, privatization support costs and sustainment costs, including real
property maintenance activities (RPMA) and real property maintenance by contract (RPMC).
All of the O&M costs, except RPMC, are based on actual housing accounting records. The
sustainment RPMC costs are estimated by the real property maintenance (RPM) model. The
RPM model uses results of the Condition Assessment Matrix (CAM) inspections conducted to
support the HCP to predict the timing and cost of major repair/replacement for housing
components and infrastructure and community systems.
9.5. Economic Analysis (EA). An EA is required for:
   9.5.1. New FH construction and replacement projects.
   9.5.2. FH support facility construction projects with a total cost of over $2,000,000.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                         63


   9.5.3. Improvement projects when the most expensive unit exceeds $50,000 ($60,000 for
   accessible handicapped units) multiplied by the local area cost factor, except foreign
   OCONUS locations. In foreign OCONUS locations, installations may not apply the area cost
   factor to increase the cost limit (AFI 32-6002).
   9.5.4. Prepare the EA IAW AFMAN 32-1089, Air Force Military Construction and Family
   Housing Economic Analysis Guide.
       9.5.4.1. Initiate the EA as early as practical during the project planning process and
       update when significant developments occur that would invalidate or significantly alter
       the conclusions. Document the EA to allow for complete replication, including costs
       traceable to their most basic input and unit of measure.
       9.5.4.2. Military Construction Project Data (DD Forms 1391), which are sent to OSD
       and Congress, must contain a summary of the EA results for the applicable project.
       9.5.4.3. The installation prepares and the MAJCOM certifies the EA. The methodology
       provides for cooperative analysis between the installation BCE and financial manager
       (FM), MAJCOM Civil Engineer and FM and HQ USAF/A7C and SAF/FM, and assures
       selection of the most cost-effective alternative.
9.6. Standards for Family Housing (FH). The goal of the Air Force is to provide its members
with the highest possible quality housing within legal limits. Congress has removed size
standards for FH, including GOQ (AFI 32-6002). Room sizes are specified in the Air Force
Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and Construction.
9.7. Equitable Use of Housing Assets. Because changes in housing requirements reflect
changes to the base mission, force structure, population distribution and availability of
community housing, Commanders must (each January) reevaluate the distribution of existing FH
among categories in Table 4.1 to ensure equitable allocation (paragraphs 1.6.4 and 1.8.17).
9.8. Temporary Redistribution. The Commander considers temporary redistribution of FH
when an imbalance exists but circumstances do not warrant permanent redistribution and change
of property records. Do not use temporary redistribution when permanent redistribution is
clearly warranted.
   9.8.1. The Housing Flight Chief compares current distribution of FH assets with
   requirements using ACES-HM occupancy data and submits recommendations to the
   Commander.
   9.8.2. Consider the following to determine the need for temporary redistribution:
       9.8.2.1. Housing requirements within each category, by number of bedrooms, including
       current, projected and programmable changes.
       9.8.2.2. Recent or projected mission changes.
       9.8.2.3. Approved and programmed new construction for government, privatized and
       community housing.
       9.8.2.4. Separation of officer and enlisted family areas.
       9.8.2.5. Imbalance of waiting times among categories.
 64                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   9.8.3. Make sure ACES reflects temporarily redistributed units by changing the current
   designation.
9.9. Permanent Redistribution: Permanently redistribute FH units in ACES and on real
property records to align units with requirements when evaluation shows a significant change in
the following conditions (paragraph 1.6.9.7):
   9.9.1. Base mission.
   9.9.2. Base population.
   9.9.3. Availability of government, privatized and community housing.
   9.9.4. Continued temporary redistribution to maintain equity among categories.
9.10. Conversions (Permanent Change in Use) and Diversions (Temporary Change in
use). Do not permanently convert FH identified on real property records without prior approval
of SAF/IEI. Use AF IMT 123, Request for Changed Use of Real Property, to track approval
of conversions of family housing (AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities).
   9.10.1. Converting FH to Other Uses. FH units determined to be surplus to installation
   requirements based on the current HRMA may be converted to other uses. Only convert units
   considered adequate based on the current HCP CAM score. Units considered inadequate due
   to functional suitability deficiencies, but otherwise adequate, may be converted. Follow
   guidance in AFI 32-9002 to request conversions and include information outlined in
   Attachment 4 to justify the conversion.
       9.10.1.1. Conversions require AF real property records to be changed; therefore,
       determine the source of funds for conversion, follow-on maintenance, utilities, repair and
       construction work.
       9.10.1.2. Follow AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and
       Recreation (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS), for funding
       conversions to MWR and NAF activities. As part of the conversion, units must meet
       standards necessary for the end-state use and yield at least a C-2 Installation Readiness
       Report rating. Appropriated funds are used for conversions to VQs. NAF pays for
       conversions to TLFs. FH funds may not be used to pay for any conversion costs.
       Conversion projects must be funded within existing MAJCOM Total Obligation
       Authority. After conversion, make sure FH funds are not charged for utilities services to
       these facilities.
       9.10.1.3. If FH units are removed from the FH property records as a conversion, the
       appropriate base O&M account pays for the M&R of the converted unit.
       9.10.1.4. For surplus housing identified in the IFHMP, request permanent conversion.
       Exception: Housing for unaccompanied K&E personnel may be diverted.
   9.10.2. Diverting FH to Other Uses. Divert FH units to non-FH use only when the
   requirement will not exceed 3 years. Show the date diverted and nature of the temporary use
   in ACES. If the expected use is more than 3 years, request permanent conversion. The
   MAJCOM Civil Engineer may approve diversions for UH only for up to 3 years and may
   delegate this authority to installation commanders. HQ USAF/A7C is the approval authority
   for all other diversions. Charge O&M costs to the FH account for units diverted to any non-
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                         65


   FH use (including UH), as long as FH unit is kept on FH property records. Do not divert
   surplus units.
       9.10.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The USAFE Civil Engineer hereby delegates to installation
       commanders the authority to approve diversions of non-surplus housing units to
       unaccompanied housing (UH) to assign Command or Key and Essential personnel who
       are single, or not accompanied by family members, when there are no other available on-
       base facilities, such as visiting quarters (VQ). A copy of each approval obtained from
       installation commander indicating facility / unit number, start and stop date is to be
       provided to HQ USAFE A7AH. Any other non-surplus diversions for housing units must
       be fully justified and submitted to HQ USAFE A7AH for approval by HQ USAFE A7.
9.11. Surplus Housing. Units excess to the FH requirement determined by the HRMA are
considered surplus to the installation requirement. For identified surplus housing units the
installation must develop a disposal plan using a methodical and phased approach to reduce and
consolidate FH. Include government-owned and leased and Section 801 housing.
   9.11.1. Identify surplus housing by unit type and neighborhood. Consider economic
   investment, condition (dispose of worst first based on CAM score), location, size and
   occupancy. Also, consider the community environment by reducing density and maintaining
   neighborhood continuity. Houses on the Historical Register and those eligible to be
   registered may be declared surplus.
   9.11.2. Bases must actively manage surplus unit inventory to ensure proper accountability.
   Annotate surplus units in the ACES-HM.
   9.11.3. Foreign OCONUS bases follow appropriate guidelines for disposal of FH as
   stipulated in the SOFA and other host-nation governing documents.
   9.11.4. Only two categories of surplus housing (adequate and inadequate) are possible
   (based on the CAM score) and disposition will vary for each category.
   9.11.5. OSD guidance defines the occupancy requirements necessary to retain surplus
   housing. Use a 3-year average occupancy rate (100 minus the vacancy rate as calculated by
   ACES) to determine the average occupancy rate. Calculate twice per year (1 April and 1
   October) for the previous 3 years to account for seasonal variations. When historical ACES-
   HM data is not available, supplement with manual data.
   9.11.6. Surplus housing units are not eligible to receive programmed MILCON or
   programmed RPMC funds.
       9.11.6.1. Bases will receive no funding beyond RPMA for maintenance of surplus
       housing. M&R expenditures are limited to $3,800 per unit per fiscal year (FY). HQ
       USAF/A7C must approve per-unit expenditures in excess of this amount.
       9.11.6.2. MAJCOMs and installations track M&R costs for their surplus housing units.
       9.11.6.3. Send request to waive the $3,800 per-unit limit to HQ USAF/A7CH. Include:
          9.11.6.3.1. Unit description and type, unit address and year of construction or most
          recent whole house renovation, general construction and location.
          9.11.6.3.2. Indicate if the unit is surplus-adequate or surplus-inadequate and
          programmed disposal date.
 66                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


          9.11.6.3.3. Description of M&R requirements that warrant supplemental funding and
          justification for repairs exceeding the $3,800 limit (storm damage, excessive wear,
          etc.) and an estimate of total costs for the entire year. Include a detailed M&R
          estimate sufficient to identify individual components of the work. State the required
          start date for the M&R work and an estimated performance period.
          9.11.6.3.4. State whether the work is routine or emergency and impact if waiver is
          not approved.
       9.11.6.4. Use MFH O&M funding to perform RPMC level work on surplus units under
       emergency conditions only (affecting life, health and safety), and when no other options
       exist to relocate families into adequate housing.
       9.11.6.5. Adequate surplus housing may be retained as long as the 3-year average
       occupancy rate is at least 97 percent.
   9.11.7. MAJCOMs report progress to HQ USAF/A7CH quarterly (1 January, April, July,
   October) on disposing surplus FH and removing units from AF Real Property records.
       9.11.7.1. Track the following information: total housing inventory to include AF owned,
       privatized, leased and Section 801 leased units.
       9.11.7.2. Provide occupancy rate twice per year (April and October).
       9.11.7.3. Track the number of adequate and inadequate surplus units and the number of
       units removed from the real property records.
       9.11.7.4. Report FH units as surplus until the disposal action is complete and information
       is updated in ACES-RP (Real Property).
9.12. Disposal/Divestiture. MAJCOMs should have a program for disposal/divestiture of
surplus units (defined in the HRMA), inadequate units replaced via MILCON construction, or
units conveyed as part of a privatization initiative in the FHMP. MAJCOM Civil Engineers
request approval from HQ USAF/A7C for all MFH disposals/divestitures on a by-unit basis. See
Attachment 5 for requirements for approval of disposals/divestitures.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                           67


                                         Chapter 10

                           FAMILY HOUSING (FH) LEASING

10.1. Leasing Authority and Criteria. Congress authorized leasing of FH under 10 U.S.C.
2828 as a temporary measure to provide housing until permanent housing becomes available or
the local community can provide sufficient adequate and affordable housing. Specific criteria
and conditions for domestic and foreign leasing of FH units are in paragraph 10.3 and 10.4,
respectively. The authority vested in the Secretary of the Air Force to execute FH leases is
redelegated to Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA), IAW Secretary of the Air Force Order
(SAFO) 715.4, 25 July 2002 and SAF/IEI memorandum, 13 May 2003. Leasing programs are
administered at all levels within the criteria and cost limitations established by law.
   10.1.1. Policy. The Domestic Housing Leasing Program allows the AF to lease existing
   privately owned housing in the United States, Puerto Rico and Guam for assignment as
   government controlled housing to eligible members and DoD civilian employees. The
   Foreign Housing Leasing Program allows the AF to lease existing privately owned housing
   or privately owned build-to-lease (BTL) housing, which is constructed specifically for
   assignment to eligible members and DoD civilian employees. Leased units are assigned and
   operated as adequate government-controlled housing.
   10.1.2. Rental Rates. For domestic leased housing, military members forfeit BAH upon
   occupancy. See paragraph 5.5, and Tables 3.1 and 5.2 for CONUS and OCONUS civilian
   employee eligibility and rental rates.
   10.1.3. Approval Authority. Although the Congress authorized FH leasing under Title 10
   U.S.C. 2828, they retained approval authority for high-cost leases and BTL projects.
       10.1.3.1. Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and
       Environment (ODUSD(I&E)) allocates lease points (leasing authority) among the
       Services and other agencies subject to statutory provisions and considerations of
       legislative intent. ODUSD(I&E) also issues annual cost limits per leased unit for
       domestic and foreign leases, which reflect the national median housing cost adjustments
       to the previous year adjusted domestic lease cost limits, and Consumer Price Index
       adjustments to foreign lease cost limits based on the unadjusted limits established in 10
       U.S.C. 2828. Services must further adjust lease limits in foreign counties for currency
       fluctuation.
       10.1.3.2. USACE is the executive agent for domestic leasing. The Commander,
       USACE, provides a service to locate, negotiate and execute domestic housing leases.
       10.1.3.3. HQ USAF/A7CH establishes management procedures, controls and reporting
       requirements associated with the housing leasing program and allocates FH lease points
       to MAJCOMs (one point equals one leased unit). HQ USAF/A7CH also:
          10.1.3.3.1. Provides lease points to the MAJCOM for authorized units for domestic
          and foreign leases for regular cost leases.
          10.1.3.3.2. Validates the requirement and provides lease points (authority) to the
          MAJCOM for high-cost leases.
 68                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


          10.1.3.3.3. For each new or renewal foreign high-cost lease, provides a 21-day
          congressional notification to appropriate congressional committees through the Office
          of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management and Comptroller)
          (SAF/FM) following coordination with AFRPA and approval by SAF/IEI. If
          Congress requires no additional information, the MAJCOM may finalize the lease at
          the expiration of the 21 calendar days. For domestic high-cost leases, HQ
          USAF/A7CH provides quarterly notification to Congress after the lease contract has
          been executed and certifies that less expensive housing units are not available.
          10.1.3.3.4. Coordinates leasing actions with AFRPA. (SAF/IEI delegated approval
          authority to AFRPA for regular cost leases.)
      10.1.3.4. MAJCOMs manage the leasing program within their command, determine
      requirements, develop justification, comply with statutory and administrative limitations,
      negotiate and execute leases in foreign counties within authority of host nation
      agreements and plan and program for O&M of Section 801 and BTL housing.
      10.1.3.5. Installations determine requirements for leased housing and manage leases in
      their area of responsibility.
10.2. Leasing Program Administration and Approval. Use the following process to request
authority to lease housing:
   10.2.1. The Housing Flight, AFRS and Air Force Office of Assession and Training Schools
   (AFOATS) identify all lease requirements to the MAJCOM, regardless of cost.
      10.2.1.1. Apply programming benchmark size for government-owned housing to leased
      housing. If adequate leased housing within the programming benchmark size cannot be
      located, the MAJCOM certifies the unavailability and forwards a request to exceed the
      limitations to HQ USAF/A7CH for approval. Refer to AFI 32-6002 for policies and
      criteria for programming, planning and acquiring leased units.
   10.2.2. The MAJCOM validates the lease requirement, identifies the funding source and
   forwards a request for lease authority (points) to HQ USAF/A7CH, who forwards request to
   AFRPA.
   10.2.3. HQ USAF/A7CH certifies the lease requirement, availability of points (authority)
   and funds, issues the required number of lease points to the MAJCOM, coordinates the
   request with other Air Staff agencies and assigns the points against the installation lease
   inventory. For foreign OCONUS high-cost leases, HQ USAF/A7CH first issues a 21-day
   notification package to Congress.
   10.2.4. The MAJCOM authorizes their real estate function to execute the lease contracts,
   following guidance in AFI 32-9001.
   10.2.5. Refer to paragraph 10.5 for the foreign Build-to-Lease Program.
   10.2.6. MAJCOMs with highly fluctuating requirements for leased housing, such as AFRS
   and AFOATS, have the option to request a block of lease points for domestic, regular cost
   leases only. If HQ USAF/A7CH approves the request, the MAJCOM provides a quarterly
   update of all leases, including lease identification number, city, state, rank of occupant,
   annual lease cost and estimated annual utility cost.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                           69


10.3. Domestic Leasing. FH may be leased in CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam
when a shortage of adequate housing exists at or near the installation. A lease contract may not
be executed for more than 5 years (usually a 1-year contract with 4 option years). The total
annual lease cost may not exceed the statutory limits and the number of leases may not exceed
the number of lease points authorized by HQ USAF/A7CH. A government-authorized agent
must identify housing units to be leased and the request must include certification that less
expensive adequate housing was not available for lease. Even if the total lease cost is higher
than member’s BAH, approval requirements in paragraph 10.2 must still be met. At least one
criterion below must be met:
   10.3.1. The requirement to lease is temporary.
   10.3.2. Leasing is more cost-effective than construction or acquisition of new housing. To
   compare costs prepare an economic analysis IAW AFMAN 32-1089.
   10.3.3. FH is required for personnel attending Service schools on PCS orders.
   10.3.4. Construction of FH at the installation is authorized by law, but has not been
   completed.
   10.3.5. A MILCON authorization bill that includes a request to construct FH is pending
   congressional authorization.
   10.3.6. Housing is required in locations with housing deficits and is used only until
   government housing programs or the local economy can provide sufficient housing at a
   reasonable cost within BAH rates.
   10.3.7. Fluctuating requirement where no base support is available.
10.4. Foreign Leasing. Housing units may be leased in foreign locations for DoD military and
civilian personnel and incumbents of SCPs in countries where excessive housing costs would
cause an undue hardship or in countries that prohibit leasing to individuals. Apply criteria in
paragraph 10.3 and the following policy:
   10.4.1. A lease for FH units in foreign countries may not exceed 10 years. Leases are
   renewed annually, and the cost is paid from the appropriations of the renewal year.
   10.4.2. When leasing 25 or more housing units perform an EA to determine the most
   effective method to obtain housing. Accomplish the EA IAW OMB Circular A-94, Discount
   Rates to be Used in Evaluating Time-Distributed Costs and Benefit, DoDI 7041.3, Economic
   Analysis for Decision Making, and AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis.
   10.4.3. Limit make-ready repairs, alterations and additions to work necessary to provide
   adequate living accommodations. Make-ready work is also limited to once during the life of
   the lease and the cost may not exceed 25 percent of the first year annual rent without
   authority from SAF/IE (DoD Manual 4165.63).
   10.4.4. Follow guidance in paragraph 10.2 for coordinating congressional notification.
   Include the following items in the lease justification package and maintain a complete record
   of the documentation for 5 years after the lease expires.
       10.4.4.1. Location of the lease by city and country.
       10.4.4.2. Identify designated position of the occupant.
 70                    AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


       10.4.4.3. Size of unit based on family size and grade of occupant.
       10.4.4.4. Annual cost, including lease, utilities and maintenance.
       10.4.4.5. Cost of community housing compared to the housing allowance of occupant
       (OHA, plus utilities).
       10.4.4.6. Certification that government housing is not available.
       10.4.4.7. Certification that the lease is temporary.
       10.4.4.8. Funding source.
   10.4.5. Foreign leases may be obtained through the Department of State (DoS) housing
   pools in areas where military facilities are not readily available, where there is a shortage of
   adequate housing in the area, where member is assigned to duty, and the DoS housing pool is
   the most cost-effective means of providing housing. Reimburse DoS for housing and related
   services furnished under the agreement; however, leases obtained through the DoS are
   considered regular leases and not a high-cost lease. Obtain lease points from HQ
   USAF/A7CH before executing DoS lease agreements (paragraph 10.2.2).
10.5. Foreign Build-to-Lease (BTL) Housing. BTL housing is congressionally approved and
includes leasing groups (typically 100 to 400 or more units) of existing privately owned units or
built-to-lease units for military members and eligible DoD civilians when adequate housing is
not readily available. The BTL Program allows housing to be built specifically for leasing to the
Air Force. A BTL contract may not exceed 10 years, and the annual cost for each year is paid
from appropriations for that year. If leased housing is required beyond the initial 10 years,
another agreement is negotiated. Before entering into the second agreement, as with the first, a
21-day congressional notification is required with complete justification including an economic
analysis. MAJCOMs:
   10.5.1. By memorandum, notify HQ USAF/A7CH and AFRPA of intent to pursue a BTL
   project, including scope and composition, and provide justification for proposed acquisition.
   The requirement must be supported by a HRMA not more than 3 years old.
   10.5.2. After approval by HQ USAF/A7CH develop a draft Request for Proposal (RFP),
   coordinate with the MAJCOM Civil Engineer, JA, FM, and forward two copies to HQ
   USAF/A7CH for review and coordination with SAF/GCN.
   10.5.3. After approval by HQ USAF/A7CH finalize and issue the RFP and complete the
   evaluation and selection process.
   10.5.4. Prepare the final project proposal, including the EA, contract drawings and
   specifications and a cover memorandum verifying MAJCOM Civil Engineer/JA/FM
   coordination and forwards to HQ USAF/A7CH and AFRPA for final review. HQ
   USAF/A7CH coordinates the proposal through HQ USAF/A7C, SAF/GCN, SAF/FMC and
   SAF/IE for approval to forward the proposal to the appropriate congressional committees for

                                        Chapter 11

                              FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

11.1. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Military personnel with dependents, as defined in
37 U.S.C. 401, are entitled to receive BAH, except when they and their dependents (or their
dependents only) occupy adequate government housing. Refer to AFI 32-6005 for housing
unaccompanied personnel and BAH eligibility.
   11.1.1. The Housing Flight prepares an ACES-generated AF Form 594 annotating the date
   and address of the housing being assigned or terminated, and forwards the AF Form 594 to
   the FSO for processing. The FSO determines dependency and BAH entitlement and enters
   required changes on the AF Form 594.
   11.1.2. BAH will commence when the member departs the losing installation pursuant to
   valid PCS orders, regardless of whether the assignment to housing has been officially
   terminated (CG Decision B-213560, 3 Apr 84).
   11.1.3. When mil-to-mil members are assigned to FH on the same or adjacent installations
   prepare an AF Form 594 for each member and send to FSO for processing. When one
   member arrives on station before the other and is eligible for housing based on other
   dependents, BAH terminates upon arrival of that member. BAH for the member arriving
   later terminates upon arrival. If one mil-to-mil member departs the installation before the
   other and one remains in housing, prepare AF Form 594s, identify the date each member
   departs and forward to FSO for processing as the member departs.
   11.1.4. For Army, Navy and Marine Corps members, the Housing flight prepares a DD Form
   137, Application for BAH for Members with Dependents, to notify their FSO of FH
   assignment or termination. Send the DD Form 137 with a DD Form 114, Military Pay
   Order, to the appropriate service FSO. Keep one copy of these forms in suspense pending
   acknowledgment of receipt from the Service FSO.
   11.1.5. The effective date of assignment to government FH is the date the member or
   designated representative assumes responsibility or accepts keys for the housing unit,
   whichever occurs first.
   11.1.6. FH accepted and occupied by the member or dependents is considered adequate
   housing according to grade and family size requirements.
   11.1.7. Quarterly, the FSO initiates the BAH reconciliation with Housing to ensure members
   assigned to FH are receiving housing allowances appropriately.
      11.1.7.1. AFCESA provides ACES data to DFAS to compare with pay records. DFAS
      provides the FSO with discrepancies between the ACES data and pay records on a
      Family Quarters Verification report. FSO provides this report to the Housing Flight.
      11.1.7.2. Within 5 business days, the Housing Flight investigates the discrepancies and
      provides a copy of the original AF IMT 594 and transmittal to the FSO. If no AF IMT
      594 exists in the housing records, the Housing Flight provides a new AF IMT 594 to the
      FSO showing the original assignment date. The Housing Flight Chief assists with any
      further action required resulting from the discrepancies.

      11.1.7.3. The Housing Flight verifies that civilian personnel assigned to FH are either
      paying rental charges or forfeiting LQA, as specified in Chapter 5, Housing Civilian
      Personnel.
   11.1.8. When FH is not furnished for dependents, a member may occupy single-type UH
   that is at or below minimum standards for members without dependents without affecting
   their option to receive BAH at the higher rate, based on previous duty station. Housing
   exceeding the minimum standards must be (a) the only housing available, (b) not suitable for
   joint occupancy or (c) jointly occupied with other members permanently assigned to the PDS
   in order not to affect the members BAH. For example, a student could live in a dorm room
   and continue to draw the higher BAH rate as long as the above criteria are met. Dorm rooms
   normally would not exceed minimum standards (paragraph 2.22).
   11.1.9. Members are reimbursed from the installation O&M funds for lodging expenses
   exceeding BAH rates when they are temporarily displaced from FH for the convenience of
   the government (programmed renovations, upgrades and emergency repairs) (Comptroller
   General decisions B-213293 and B-225205; and AFI 34-206, Air Force Lodging Program).
      11.1.9.1. The member claims housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement on
      Standard Form (SF) 1164, Claims for Reimbursement for Reimbursement for
      Expenditures on Official Business.
      11.1.9.2. Residents may claim housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement for (1)
      the number of days lodged in TLF and off-base contract quarters, and (2) up to the
      maximum allowable lodging rate for that locale IAW Joint Federal Travel Regulation
      (JFTR), for the number of days lodged in off-base noncontract quarters.
11.2. Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). Housing management sends a written notice to the
servicing CPF to start or stop LQA when civilian employees are assigned to or terminate
government housing. Civilian employees occupying FH do not receive LQA payment
(paragraph 5.5).
11.3. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). Members in PCS status are authorized to
receive TLA upon arrival and departure in OCONUS areas.
   11.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Housing Managers are tasked with effective OCONUS TLA
   management and must ensure TLA costs are paid only for the time it is necessary for the
   member and/or dependents to occupy tempoary lodging when they first arrive at, or
   immediately before they depart, the installation. Reference Joint Federal Travel Regulation,
   Volume I and USAFEI 65-104_IP, Providing Temporary Lodging Allowance in USECOM.
      11.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE Housing offices will ensure TLA briefings are
      provided to all newcomers within two workdays after arrival [USAFEI 65-104, para 4.f
      (1)] and provide written guidance advising members of their entitlements and
      reimbursement procedures.
      11.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) If a service member refuses to occupy available
      government-controlled quarters, TLA is terminated the first date Furnishings
      Management Office (FMO) can deliver loaner furnishings based on the date quarters are
      available. Likewise if a service member chooses to initiate a rental contract for a home
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                           73


       that is not readily available, TLA may be terminated if the Housing Manager determines
       a sufficient number of adequate homes are available for immediate occupancy.
       11.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) If government-controlled quarters are not available, service
       members must maintain a documented aggressive search for permanent housing. Within
       the first 10 days, the service member should view a minimum of two houses. During the
       subsequent 10-day increments, the service member should view at least an additional five
       listings. If permanent housing has not been secured, necessitating a third 10-day
       increment, the service member must meet with a Housing Management Specialist or
       Housing Manager to justify additional TLA claims. Under normal circumstances, TLA
       extensions will not be allowed when referral listings are available within a service
       member's bedroom entitlement, Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) ceiling, and
       acceptable commuting distance as determined by the Housing Manager. Personal
       preference issues such as pets, furniture limitations, school districts, etc. are not
       justification for an extension beyond 30 days.
       11.3.1.4. (Added-USAFE) When circumstances beyond the member’s control require a
       TLA extension beyond 30-days, the service member will be required to submit a written
       request for extension. The Base Civil Engineer is the approval/disapproval authority for
       extensions.
       11.3.1.5. (Added-USAFE) USAFE Housing offices will ensure members are aware of
       the requirement to have a current lease on file with the housing office throughout their
       tour.
11.4. Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE)— An allowance to partially offset the added living
expenses incurred in CONUS by members and dependents when occupying temporary lodging
incident to PCS.
11.5. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA). For
OCONUS areas only, individuals moving into community housing may be eligible for OHA and
MIHA. Specific circumstances, conditions and requirements of OHA or MIHA are identified in
the JFTR.
11.6. Dislocation Allowance (DLA). The FSO authorizes DLA for expenses incurred in
relocating the member’s household on a PCS move, moves ordered for the government’s
convenience, or incident to an evacuation. This allowance is in addition to all other allowances
authorized in the JFTR and may be paid in advance.
11.7. Partial Dislocation Allowance (PDLA). Members of all Services are entitled to a PDLA
when ordered to occupy or vacate family-type housing (37 U.S.C. 407(c) and JFTR, U5630B).
PDLA is authorized on an AF IMT 150, Drayage/Storage Authorization--Government
Quarters, in conjunction with a local move but is not authorized without an approved local
move. Do not pay PDLA when member is ordered to occupy or vacate housing that is not
provided by the government (U.S.C. 37, Section 407(f)).
   11.7.1. PDLA must be paid to a member ordered to occupy or vacate government family-
   type housing due to privatization, renovation or for any other reason for the convenience of
   the government other than a PCS.
 74                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   11.7.2. PDLA is not authorized for local moves from FH upon separation or retirement,
   incident to PCS, for member’s convenience (including promotion and change in family size
   or bedroom requirements), if voluntarily initiated by the member pending divorce or family
   separation; or due to member’s misconduct. PDLA is also not paid in conjunction with a
   local move when member is ordered out of FH because of family separation or divorce
   (11.10.1.3).
   11.7.3. See Table 11.1 for further guidance on PDLA eligibility.
11.8. Reimbursement to the Housing Account. For FH, the rental charge is a reimbursement
to the MFH account (AFI 65-601, Section 21E).
   11.8.1. All Services (including Air Force) and agencies, including U.S. Coast Guard, U.S.
   Public Health Service, AAFES and banks, must reimburse the FH account when their
   Appropriated and Non- appropriated Fund civilian employees live in government-owned or
   government-leased housing.
   11.8.2. The Housing Flight coordinates billing and collection procedures with the
   appropriate FSO. Sponsor organizations reimburse the housing account monthly. For
   civilians not entitled to a housing allowance, collect rent locally using a DD Form 1131,
   Cash Collection Voucher (paragraph 5.5).
11.9. Disconnection and Reinstallation Charges. Reimburse member for telephone and cable
reconnection fees when local moves are government-directed and member is not entitled to
PDLA. Members are entitled to reimbursement to restore the same service they had at their
previous residence, and there is no limit to the number of disconnection and reinstallation
reimbursements. Do not authorize reimbursement for disconnection and reinstallation when
member is evicted by the government.
11.10. Local Drayage and Household Goods (HHG) Storage. Personnel directed to move
into, between and from government housing are entitled to a local HHG move and HHG storage
at government expense, as authorized by JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 5, part D, paragraph U5355,
section B. The Housing Flight must stay updated with and consistently apply JFTR policy. The
Housing Flight Chief, in coordination with the local traffic management office (TMO) or Joint
Personal Property Shipping Office, budgets and controls local drayage and storage funds (P-
3400) (AF IMT 406, Miscellaneous Reimbursement Obligation Document, and AF IMT 616,
Fund Cite Authorization (FCA). Employ ACES to track and reconcile these drayage and storage
funds. Local drayage and HHG storage is authorized on ACES-generated AF IMT 150. Moves
to, from or between FH units for the convenience of the member or family are not authorized at
government expense.
   11.10.1. Local Drayage. The following are government-paid moves:
       11.10.1.1. Local moves from community housing to government-owned, -leased and
       privatized housing are paid on a one-time basis after PCS. Subsequent moves from FH to
       community housing or from community housing to government housing are paid only
       when directed by the Commander, except the Housing Flight Chief may authorize a local
       move from one unit on base to another to prevent more than two dependent children from
       sharing a bedroom.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                         75


     11.10.1.2. Local moves to vacate government housing scheduled for major repair or
     renovation.
     11.10.1.3. Local moves from government-owned and -leased housing resulting from
     family separation or divorce are paid when member no longer lives with dependents or
     dependents no longer live with member (paragraph 6.3.5).
     11.10.1.4. An Armed Forces member who relocates from, or whose dependent relocates
     from, leased or rented private housing, by reason of a foreclosure action against the
     landlord is authorized a short distance move (P.L.110-289; 37 U.S.C. § 406). The
     following provisions apply:
         11.10.1.4.1. This provision does not apply if the member or dependent is the
         homeowner.
         11.10.1.4.2. The move is to another dwelling from which the member is to commute
         daily to the PDS (or to a location where the dependent resides).
         11.10.1.4.3. Before using this authority, encourage member to exhaust remedies
         available under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C., Appendix 531) and
         state law.
         11.10.1.4.4. Members requesting a government-funded local move submit a written
         request to the Housing Management Office with justification to include lease,
         termination notice from the foreclosing company, financial institution or other legal
         authority requiring the member or dependent to vacate the property, and other related
         documentation.
         11.10.1.4.5. Members should be advised to contact the installation JA office to seek
         advice concerning their rights and responsibilities under the terms of the lease.
         Remind members that their housing allowances will be terminated upon moving into
         government-managed housing.
         11.10.1.4.6. Housing Management should develop local procedures to coordinate
         with the installation JA to validate member’s documentation and to verify the
         member is being forced to move because of a foreclosure action.
  11.10.2. Nontemporary Storage (NTS) of Household Goods (HHG). A member is
  authorized NTS of HHG excess to needs while occupying government-managed and
  privatized housing. The member sends a request for nontemporary storage (NTS) to the
  Housing Management Office and attaches an inventory of items to be stored. In considering
  requests for NTS of HHGs, Housing Asset Managers perform the following management
  controls:
     11.10.2.1. Brief newly assigned members on NTS authority and that residents must
     request NTS within 30 days after housing assignment. The Housing Management Office
     may extend the 30-day period as circumstances warrant. The member should consult the
     JFTR Appendix A (definition of household goods) for clarification of items that are
     prohibited for government storage.
     11.10.2.2. NTS authority excludes furnishings acquired after move-in. NTS is not
     authorized for member voluntarily vacating government-managed or privatized housing
     for personal convenience.
 76                     AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


      11.10.2.3. The Housing Asset Manager approves those items determined to be
      impractical or unsuitable for use in the housing unit assigned. Generally, impractical or
      unsuitable furnishings are items that are unusable due to design configuration or
      insufficient space in the housing unit; for example, oversized beds, sofas, bookcases and
      books, dinette sets, china cabinets (and associated china and crystal), and clothing
      required only in another climate. Items not appropriate for NTS under this paragraph are
      accessory household items, such as vacuum cleaners and other minor appliances and
      machinery (i.e., table and chain saws and craft equipment), trashcans, vehicles and
      vehicle parts, building material, suitcases, commonly used clothing, linens, small rugs,
      toys and other miscellaneous small items. Major appliances may be stored if like items
      are government- provided.
      11.10.2.4. A member may request a dockside release of a partial inventory of HHG and
      ship the rest. Since there is no authority for a member to open boxes, sort and remove
      contents, extra charges will be assessed. The member coordinates financial arrangements
      for extra charges with the NTS agent.
      11.10.2.5. At CONUS locations, reassess the need for continued NTS when member
      moves into larger FH (move between units).
      11.10.2.6. Include a reminder on out-processing checklists for the member to remove
      NTS upon departure from the installation.
      11.10.2.7. Unless authorized and funded by the CPF, disapprove requests from DoD
      civilians for storage of HHG incidental to occupying government-managed or privatized
      housing.
   11.10.3. See Table 11.1, for further guidance on drayage and NTS eligibility.

Government-Ordered/Directed Move. In the context of JFTR U5355, the word “order” means a Government-funded
move, which is also referred to as a Government-directed move. The AF Form 150, Drayage/Storage Authorization -
Government Quarters, is the vehicle by which the move is authorized. These moves may be voluntary, but are always in
the best interest of the Government.
Voluntary Move: A move solely for the convenience of the member and initiated by and paid for by the member.

                                           Chapter 12

                               MOBILE HOME PARKS (MHP)

12.1. Authority and Guidance: The AF does not consider mobile homes to be suitable
permanent party housing and does not purchase or maintain mobile homes. Installations may
retain MHPs, but may not build new parks or program for major improvements to existing parks
and must annually evaluate the need for existing MHPs. The cost of M&R is computed as rental
charges to residents (paragraph 12.8). For MHP standards, see Air Force Family Housing
Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and Construction.
   12.1.1. Safety Inspections. The installation BCE, safety office and medical personnel are
   responsible for safety inspections of mobile homes and spaces annually.
   12.1.2. Utility Connections (Electric, Gas, Oil, Water and Sewer). The installation BCE and
   mobile home carrier, if included in a contracted moving service, connect and disconnect
   utilities. The owner provides all materials, which must comply with installation safety
   criteria and standards for utility connections. The installation BCE inspects the connection
   work to ensure proper connections are made; corrections are at owner’s expense.
   12.1.3. Other services provided for MHPs include:
            Management
            Refuse collection and disposal
            Entomology (exterior grounds only)
            Street cleaning
            Snow removal
            M&R of streets, parking areas, mobile home pads, community facilities, government-
            owned storage sheds and common recreational areas
   12.1.4. Housing management maintains records of MHP business activities, and makes
   available for periodic audit. Records include:
       12.1.4.1. Licenses (original AF IMT 1505, License to Occupy Mobile Home Space)
       and notices of extension, revocation and termination.
       12.1.4.2. Transactions of rental, utility and service charges, billed and collected.
       12.1.4.3. Proof of mobile home ownership (copy of mortgage document, payment book,
       payment coupon, bill of sale or title of the unit).
12.2. Resident Responsibilities. MHP resident responsibilities are similar to FH residents, with
unique exceptions. MHP owners must:
   12.2.1. Before space acceptance, determine if the available park space can accommodate
   their mobile home, pay charges for adapting their mobile home to the available space and
   provide materials for utility connections.
   12.2.2. Move their mobile home to the MHP, provide and install skirting, ground anchors
   and tie-down straps to protect the mobile home, awning, storage sheds and other accessories
   from high winds. A BCE-approved work clearance request (AF IMT 103) is required before
   installing ground anchors and tie downs, and ground anchors must meet state and local code.
 80                    AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   12.2.3. Equip their mobile home with single station, local alarm, residential-type smoke
   detectors before moving in. A smoke detector will be installed in each sleeping area and
   between the bedroom area and the rest of the mobile home. Detectors must comply with
   National Fire Protection Association Standards. Inspect smoke detectors as a part of the
   initial inspection to make sure they are operational. Carbon monoxide detectors are also
   required for mobile homes using fossil fuel systems.
   12.2.4. Maintain their mobile home and spaces in good condition consistent with policies
   established by the Commander; within 30 days of occupying the mobile home space, provide
   additional screening or landscaping to frames and wheels; store privately owned materials
   and equipment inside the mobile home or in storage sheds, which may or may not be
   provided by the government. Mobile home additions and accessories are subject to approval
   by the installation BCE or authorized representative, before they are installed.
12.3. Eligibility. MHPs are for use by military families assigned to the installation and to units
attached to the installation for housing support. Unaccompanied members may be assigned only
when no members with dependents are on the MHP waiting list. Sharing and subletting are not
authorized.
12.4. Safety Requirements. Mobile homes must meet the minimum state and local health,
safety and aesthetic standards established by the Commander.
12.5. Application and Assignment. Mobile home spaces and waiting lists are managed in
ACES. Members may be placed on the waiting list pending purchase of a mobile home.
However, a member at the top of the list unable to accept an offered space is moved to the
bottom of the list. A member unable to accept assignment of a space for the second time is
removed from the list for 90 days. Unless first on the waiting list, in-place purchase of a mobile
home does not automatically allow the purchaser to retain that space. Housing management
coordinates with members ahead of the purchaser on the waiting list to allow the mobile home to
remain in place. Rental mobile homes are not permitted in base MHPs.
   12.5.1. Commanders may grant and revoke licenses (AF IMT 1505) to use mobile home
   spaces or may delegate authority to housing flight chiefs. The term of a license is typically
   four years, but may need to be adjusted in the event park closure is programmed.
   12.5.2. A license establishes mobile home owner responsibilities and rights while occupying
   a MHP space. A license to occupy a MHP space may not be issued to a single military
   member who owns the mobile home with any other person. Housing management prepares
   the license for signature of the Commander or designee and the mobile home owner and
   maintains the original license for the duration of occupancy.
   12.5.3. A government-funded move of a mobile home to the PCS location (private property,
   leased space or another government-owned MHP) is authorized in conjunction with a PCS
   move (JFTR, Part 1). Generally, after initial arrival and setup, movement of a mobile home
   to or from a government-owned MHP within the area of the gaining installation is at no cost
   to the government. However, members ordered by the Commander to vacate the MHP are
   entitled to a government-paid move to the local vicinity (JFTR, U5530, Local Moves).
12.6. Retention. Personnel may retain their MHP space under the same conditions established
for FH (paragraph 6.1). Members must notify housing management when their mobile home
will be unoccupied for more than 2 weeks.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                           81


12.7. Termination. Housing management uses FH terminations procedures (paragraph 6.2).
The Housing Flight Chief establishes procedures to ensure collection of departing MHP resident
unpaid monthly charges. Housing management notifies the FSO to collect monthly charges and
verifies that all indebtedness has been paid before signing the member’s base clearance. A copy
of the DD Form 139 may serve as evidence of payment.
12.8. MHP Closure. The MAJCOM and Commander make the determination to close a MHP.
   12.8.1. When the Commander announces closure of the MHP but has not ordered residents
   to vacate, a government funded move of mobile homes is authorized only in conjunction with
   PCS, retirement and separation orders to the next PDS, home of selection (HOS), home of
   record (HOR) or the local community in lieu of a HHG shipment. When the Commander
   issues the notice to close the MHP, members may sell mobile homes in place until the order
   to vacate is issued. New owners are entitled to a government-funded local move when the
   order to vacate is issued.
   12.8.2. Once the Commander orders residents to vacate the MHP by a specified date,
   members are authorized reimbursement for moving or are authorized a government-procured
   (locally issued and funded orders) move of their mobile home to an off-base location in the
   PDS vicinity. The member must own the mobile home when it is moved but is not required
   to occupy the mobile home after the move. If the member is ordered into government
   housing at the local PDS, a government-funded move of HHG into government housing is
   authorized (simultaneously or within a given period of time). The Commander determines a
   reasonable distance the mobile home can be moved based on local geographic conditions.
   Members subsequently receiving PCS, retirement or separation orders are authorized
   applicable weight allowance for HHG shipment to the next PDS, HOS or HOR.
   12.8.3. In-place sales of mobiles are not allowed after the Commander issues the order to
   vacate. Send request for waiver to this provision, with full justification, to HQ USAF/A7CH
   for approval. New owners are required to sign a statement they fully understand they are not
   entitled to a government-funded local move and they are obligated to relocate the mobile
   home before closure of the MHP.
12.9. Financial Administration. The Air Force recovers construction, improvement, M&R,
operations and utilities costs from MHP residents through space rental fees. For audit purposes,
the BCE keeps records of construction and improvements costs until the AF deactivates the
MHP. The BCE also retains records for amortizing costs until disposal of the park.
   12.9.1. In coordination with the resources flight, reassess rental fees annually based on MHP
   operating costs for management, M&R, alterations, utilities and refuse collection. Members
   pay MHP rental fees by payroll deduction.
   12.9.2. Establish a rental fee to amortize the cost of construction and improvements over a
   25-year period. The amortization period begins with completion of construction. To
   determine the rental fee, add any improvement cost to the initial MHP construction cost,
   divide by 300 months (25 years) and then by the number of spaces in the park. The
   requirement to amortize construction cost and subsequent improvements expires at the end of
   the 25-year period regardless of the occupancy rate or the amount of rent collected. When
   deactivating a MHP, do not adjust the rent of remaining residents.
 82                  AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   12.9.3. Calculate O&M charges for the following FY, based on the actual cumulative cost
   for the prior FY O& M costs. (Include services such as street cleaning, snow removal and
   refuse collection, as applicable). Assign a pro rata share of the costs to each MHP space.
   Use available contract rates for the new FY for service collection under Element of
   Expense/Investment Code (EEIC) 721.22, Management, 533XX.
   12.9.4. Management costs (EEIC 721.11, Management-Government Dwellings), assume that
   50 percent less management effort is required for a mobile home space than for an FH unit.
   Use the following example to compute management costs for a MHP.
           The number of FH units = 1,000
           The number of MHP spaces = 100
           The annual total management cost = $190,000
           $190,000/12 months = $15,388
           $15,388/1,100 (FH units + MHP spaces) = $14.39 per month
           $14.39 X .50 = $7.19 per month management cost
   12.9.5. Charges for utilities provided by the Air Force are usually based on individually
   metered or measured consumption. When not metered, residents pay a pro rata share of the
   total costs for utilities provided to the MHP.

                                          Attachment 3
              PROCESSING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS

A3.1. Detecting Potential Discrimination. Refusing to show, rent, lease or sell suitable
housing to potential residents may establish the basis for a potential complaint of housing
discrimination. Language that expresses or conveys discrimination or suggests discriminatory
policy is considered an act or incident of discrimination. Promptly report every incident of
potential housing discrimination to the Housing Flight Chief for action, and follow the
investigative procedures in this chapter.
A3.2. Initial Inquiry Into Complaint. Within 3 workdays after receiving a complaint of
discrimination, the Housing Flight Chief or housing representative initiates an inquiry. The
inquiry may be informal, but must be detailed enough to determine if discrimination may exist,
as defined in Attachment 1, Terms.
   A3.2.1. Interview the complainant promptly and document details of the circumstances
   surrounding the alleged discriminatory act.
   A3.2.2. Notify the BCE and Commander immediately.
   A3.2.3. If the complaint concerns a change in availability of a vacancy (such as just rented)
   and the Housing Flight receives notice soon after the alleged act, immediately determine
   whether there is an actual vacancy. The Commander may authorize the use of two or more
   verifiers. The housing representative may telephone or visit the agent and without referring
   to the complaint, try to verify the vacancy without alerting the agent that a complaint has
   been received.
   A3.2.4. To allow prospective tenants to decide if they wish to look at the facility in question,
   advise them that the Housing Flight has received a complaint of discrimination against the
   agent or facility, but that the inquiry has not yet been completed.
   A3.2.5. Advise the complainant of the following:
A3.2.5.1. Procedures set forth in this instruction.
       A3.2.5.2. Their right to take further actions through Housing and Urban Development
       (HUD), Department of Justice (DOJ), or local or state agencies during or after the AF
       inquiry and without regard to AF results. If the complainant files a complaint with
       another agency and the AF inquiry is incomplete, do not delay the AF investigation
       pending the outcome of the other investigation. Even if the complainant declines to
       submit HUD Form 903, Housing Discrimination Complaint, the Commander is still
       responsible for conducting the inquiry and for taking whatever action is required.
   A3.2.6. Document actions and submit the results of the preliminary inquiry, including
   complete documentation, to the Commander to make a determination of discrimination.
   A3.2.7. If the inquiry validates the complaint and the complainant concurs, the Commander
   sends the complaint, with supporting documents to HUD using HUD Form 903, and an
   information copy to DOJ.
   A3.2.8. Assist the complainant, as follows:
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                              101


       A3.2.8.1. Complete HUD Form 903 in seven signed, dated and notarized copies.
       (Recommend a housing staff member be a licensed notary public.) Summarize the
       incident in the summary of events on HUD Form 903, and include that statement as part
       of the file sent by the Commander.
       A3.2.8.2. Coordinate with the base legal office to advise the complainant on:
           A3.2.8.2.1. How the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 apply
           and the limitations in the current situation.
           A3.2.8.2.2. The complainant’s right to file the complaint directly with HUD or DOJ,
           or to bring a private civil action in the proper local, state or Federal court.
           A3.2.8.2.3. Legal assistance available at the installation.
       A3.2.8.3. Options for obtaining suitable housing. If after a reasonable amount of time,
       the complainant cannot find adequate housing because of discriminatory practices in the
       community, the Commander may approve the priority assignment to FH. As a last resort,
       a humanitarian reassignment action may be appropriate, but must be fully justified as
       required by AFI 36-2706, Military Equal Opportunity and Treatment Program. A
       statement from the Commander that FH is not available must support the request for
       reassignment.
A3.3. Selecting and Using Verifiers. The Commander may authorize the use of verifiers to
investigate the complaint, as necessary. Do not use verifiers solely to determine practices and
behaviors of an agent outside the allegations of the current complaint. The following procedures
apply:
   A3.3.1. Verify a vacancy as soon as possible after the discrimination is alleged.
   A3.3.2. Use volunteer verifiers, if possible, from the base social actions office and
   Command Chief Master Sergeant. Do not use housing management personnel except in an
   unusual situation.
   A3.3.3. Verifiers determine what characteristic (race, color, religion, sex, national origin or
   familial status) is the suspected basis for unequal treatment or for declining rental or sales to
   the complainant.
       A3.3.3.1. Use verifiers with the same basic characteristics as the complainant, except the
       characteristics that are identified in the complaint.
       A3.3.3.2. Use two verifiers, one that possesses similar characteristics to the complainant.
A3.4. Instructions to Verifiers. The Housing Flight explains the policy and procedures of
Equal Opportunity in community housing and housing referral programs and emphasizes that the
verifiers:
   A3.4.1. Obtain information about the operating policies, practices and procedures of the
   agent or facility that can be used to determine the validity of the complaint.
   A3.4.2. Do not make any verbal or written contract for the apartment, pay any money or
   express a commitment for facility. Instead, verifiers may say that the property does not meet
   their needs or they are looking for less expensive or larger housing. At the time of the visit,
   the verifier must make it clear to the agent they are not interested in the facility.
 102                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   A3.4.3. Know the family composition, pets and housing requirements of the complainant, so
   they can ask for identical requirements.
   A3.4.4. Obtain the following information, if possible, for inclusion in the inquiry.
       A3.4.4.1. Facility. Which facility was available; did it meet the complainant’s
       requirements; rental amount; deposit required; are children and pets allowed; is
       application required; time lag between the application and move in date; minority
       families or minority singles in the facility; presence or absence of a vacancy sign; and
       other appropriate information.
       A3.4.4.2. Prospective Tenant. Qualifications requirements (such as credit rating, salary,
       marital status, race, children, deposit, written application), including all steps from initial
       inquiry to moving in. Verifier’s opinion about whether the manager’s subjective
       impression of the applicant would play a part in the decision to rent an apartment?
   A3.4.5. The verifier completes statement immediately after the verification visit, and it must
   be accurate, objective and detailed. Include the following:
       A3.4.5.1. Date, time of visit, name and position of person contacted. Include any other
       pertinent information obtained during the visit such as length of time employed at facility
       and race of person contacted.
       A3.4.5.2. In reconstructing the conversation, write in the first person (I and we). Use
       direct quotes if possible, and give the full name of the person being quoted, and the
       persons to whom they are speaking. Do not use the pronouns, he, she or they to refer to
       persons quoted.
       A3.4.5.3. Verifier signs and dates the statement, gives full name, address and telephone
       number (duty and home), and provides race or other self-characteristics relevant to the
       complaint.
A3.5. Notice of an Informal Hearing. With three workdays of receiving the inquiry report
initially substantiating the complaint, but before final determination of validity, the Commander
sends a written notice to the agent of the facility. A representative of the Commander delivers the
notice to the agent personally, or the notice is sent to the agent by certified mail with return
receipt. Note: This notice explains the specific nature of the discrimination complaint and states
that the agent has a right to:
   A3.5.1. Request a hearing with the Commander and to appear personally at the hearing.
   A3.5.2. Be represented by an attorney.
   A3.5.3. Present evidence and call witnesses on his or her behalf. NOTE: After receiving
   the notice, the agent has 5 workdays to request a hearing. If the Commander receives no
   request within that time, the right to a hearing is considered waived.
A3.6. Conducting Informal Hearing. The Commander will hold this hearing at a convenient
location.
   A3.6.1. The agent, the agent’s attorney, the complainant, the complainant’s attorney, the
   equal opportunity officer, housing management representative, JA or other designated
   persons may attend.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                             103


   A3.6.2. A summary of the hearing is prepared and placed in the complaint file. The
   summary should include who attended, location of hearing, and a summary of discussion.
A3.7. Disclosure of Information. Give copies of HUD Form 903 and other pertinent
statements required for HUD or DOJ action to the agent or agent’s attorney. The AF must not
damage any potential HUD or DOJ investigation by disclosing facts before other enforcement
agencies begin their procedures.
A3.8. Legal Review. Request a legal review for content and completeness after the inquiry and
informal hearing (if applicable), but before the Commander makes a final determination of
complaint validity. Place a statement in the file, signed by the installation JA performing the
review, that the review was conducted. The statement must include:
   A3.8.1. Explanatory remarks, including comments about the facts and evidence presented.
   A3.8.2. Information about other pending complaints from private parties against the same
   facility or agent.
   A3.8.3. Comments regarding how state, federal, local or foreign country civil rights
   legislation applies to the case.
A3.9. Installation Commander Determination. The Commander alone must render the
determination of discrimination, and is responsible for imposing restrictive sanctions if
complaint is validated. This responsibility may not be delegated. The Commander’s decision
must be based on a full and impartial review of facts weighed against this instruction. The
Commander has the option to make further inquiry or to close the case. If the case is closed, the
steps to take vary, depending on whether the complaint was or was not validated.
A3.10. Making a Further Inquiry. If the Commander requires more information, or further
inquiry, an AF officer is appointed from outside the Housing Flight to make a formal inquiry or
investigation, as the situation warrants. If the officer is not an attorney, the JA, EEO office and
housing representative are available to advise and assist.
A3.11. Closing the Case:
   A3.11.1. If the Commander determines that the inquiry did not validate the complaint, the
   case is closed, and:
       A3.11.1.1. The Commander advises the complainant in writing of:
           A3.11.1.1.1. Actions taken and their right to proceed with further action (submit a
           complaint to HUD and/or DOJ, or to initiate a civil action).
           A3.11.1.1.2. Availability of legal assistance from the installation JA or other legal
           counsel in pursuing a civil action.
       A3.11.1.2. The Housing Flight discontinues the action described in paragraph A3.2.4
       and prepares a summary of the case for the report file.
           A3.11.1.2.1. The summary outlines the practices that gave rise to the complaint,
           actions and results of the inquiry, action of Commander to obtain relief, as well as a
           commitment from the agent of the facility about future practices.
           A3.11.1.2.2. The case file also includes the statement, completed by the complainant:
           I (am)(am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by the Commander in my behalf to
104                  AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


         achieve satisfactory resolution of my off-base housing discrimination complaint. If
         the complainant is not satisfied with actions or results, so state in the file.
      A3.11.1.3. If an informal hearing was offered, the Commander notifies the agent by
      command correspondence of the inquiry results. This notification should emphasize that
      DoD and AF policy must ensure equal opportunity in community housing.
      A3.11.1.4. The Commander sends the report to the MAJCOM and other agencies as
      explained in paragraph A3.12.
  A3.11.2. If the inquiry validates the discrimination complaint, and the Commander
  determines the discriminatory act conflicts with DoD or AF policy, the following actions
  must be taken:
      A3.11.2.1. Impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and all properties represented
      by the agent for a minimum of 180 days or until other specific requirements in
      paragraph A3.15 are met.
         A3.11.2.1.1. Also, impose restrictive sanctions when an alleged discriminatory act is
         investigated and substantiated, even without a written complaint.
         A3.11.2.1.2. Do not withhold restrictive sanctions pending investigation of another
         agency (HUD or DOJ).
         A3.11.2.1.3. To ensure program credibility, impose restrictive sanctions promptly
         and correctly once a complaint is substantiated.
      A3.11.2.2. Take the following steps in imposing restrictive sanctions:
         A3.11.2.2.1. If the facility is listed with the Housing Flight, remove the listing from
         the files.
         A3.11.2.2.2. Impose sanctions against all facilities owned or operated by the agent on
         the date of notification.
         A3.11.2.2.3. Revise the restrictive sanctions list to include the facility. Prepare the
         restrictive sanctions list on official letterhead stationery and send to the Commander
         for signature.
         A3.11.2.2.4. The Commander informs the agent, by command correspondence, that
         restrictive sanctions have been imposed and the reasons why, explains the nature and
         minimum length of the restrictions and outlines what action is required to remove the
         restrictive sanctions. The notice is personally delivered to the agent by a
         representative of the Commander or is sent by certified mail with a return receipt
         requested.
         A3.11.2.2.5. Personnel seeking housing in the community are given a copy of the
         restrictive sanctions list, informed they may not rent, lease, purchase or reside in any
         of the facilities listed, and sign a statement verifying they received the list.
         A3.11.2.2.6. The Housing Flight sends the restrictive sanction list to the public
         affairs officer to incorporate into the appropriate internal information program.
      A3.11.2.3. The Commander informs the complainant in writing of all actions taken, and
      that the complaint receives continuing base attention. If appropriate, send a copy of this
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                            105


       notice to agencies where the complaint file is being sent and repeat complainant’s right to
       pursue remedies in civil court. If the complainant has not been suitably housed, the
       Commander emphasizes continuing assistance of the Housing Flight.
       A3.11.2.4. The Commander develops a cover memorandum, analyzing the:
          A3.11.2.4.1. Impact of restrictive sanctions on the facility, DoD personnel and their
          dependents and the community-housing program.
          A3.11.2.4.2. The number of facility units involved (if available).
          A3.11.2.4.3. The base efforts in locating housing for the complainant.
          A3.11.2.4.4. Other relevant considerations.
       A3.11.2.5. The Commander requires the following statement be completed by the
       complainant and placed in the case file: I (am)(am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by
       the Commander in my behalf to achieve satisfactory resolution of my off-base housing
       discrimination complaint. If the complainant is not satisfied, document the reasons in the
       case file.
       A3.11.2.6. The Commander sends the complaint as outlined in paragraphs A3.12.
A3.12. Submitting the Report. Timely submission of the complaint report is extremely
important. Complete the inquiry or investigation and administrative actions within 35 calendar
days after the complaint is received.
   A3.12.1. Interim Report. If an inquiry requires more than 35 days, the Commander sends an
   interim report to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer
       A3.12.1.1. The interim report may be in narrative format, with details presented in
       chronological order, or it may be sent as a case file.
       A3.12.1.2. The MAJCOM monitors the action taken on the complaint to make sure
       correct procedures are followed in the investigation, the base is responding affirmatively
       to the complaint, and the base expedites the process.
   A3.12.2. Unsubstantiated Complaints. If the complaint is not validated by the investigation,
   the Commander sends a copy of the case file to the MAJCOM for information and review.
       A3.12.2.1. As a minimum, include a chronology of events, a copy of the complaint; the
       inquiry report; all of the supporting documents; the legal review; the Commander’s
       memorandum; the complainant’s statement; and any other correspondence regarding the
       complaint, including the interim report (if any).
       A3.12.2.2. Maintain files at the installation and MAJCOM for at least 24 months.
       Typically, unsubstantiated complaints are not forwarded to HQ USAF/A7CH.
   A3.12.3. Substantiated Complaints. If the complaint is validated, the Commander sends five
   copies of the complete files to the MAJCOM.
       A3.12.3.1. As a minimum, the file includes a chronology of events, complaint, inquiry
       report, supporting documents, informal hearing correspondence and summary, legal
       review, Commander’s memorandum, complainant’s statement, correspondence about the
       complaint and an interim report (if any).
 106                    AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


       A3.12.3.2.   Within 20 days of the date the case is forwarded from the installation, the
       MAJCOM        reviews and sends four copies of substantiated case files and pertinent
       MAJCOM        correspondence and a MAJCOM legal review, to HQ USAF/A7CH. If
       necessary,   the MAJCOM promptly returns the case to the installation for corrective
       action.
       A3.12.3.3. HQ USAF/A7CH sends a copy to HQ USAF/JA for review and
       determination of legal sufficiency. Complaints found legally sufficient by HQ USAF/JA
       are processed according to DoDI 1100.16.
A3.13. Related Complaints:
   A3.13.1. When the Housing Flight Chief receives more than one complaint against the same
   agent or facility, the complaints may be consolidated for the purpose of the inquiry, legal
   review, Commander’s memorandum, and forwarding action. However, the consolidated case
   file should include a separate HUD Form 903 for each complainant.
   A3.13.2. When the Housing Flight Chief receives a second complaint against the same agent
   or facility after finalizing an unsubstantiated complaint report, a new investigation must be
   initiated.
   A3.13.3. When housing management receives a complaint against an agent or facility
   already under restrictive sanctions, the Commander:
       A3.13.3.1. Sends a summary of the facts about the new complaint to the MAJCOM, an
       analysis of the extent to which it and related information affects the prior report and
       supporting documentation.
       A3.13.3.2. Sends the complaint to other agencies, as required.
       A3.13.3.3. Informs the complainant of the action taken on the prior complaint, plus any
       ongoing action related to the current complaint.
A3.14. Follow-Up Action. After the report and attachments are sent, the Commander takes the
following actions:
   A3.14.1. Coordinates the investigation and case processing with HUD, DOJ and state or
   local representatives.
   A3.14.2. Regularly follows up with HUD area or regional office on the status until HUD
   resolves or closes the complaint.
   A3.14.3. Informs the complainant about information received and action being taken by
   HUD or DOJ.
   A3.14.4. Make sure DoD personnel comply with the restrictive sanctions imposed on the
   facility or agent.
       A3.14.4.1. Military personnel moving or changing their place of residence in the
       commuting area of the installation are prohibited from entering into a rental, purchase or
       lease arrangement with an agent of a facility under restrictive sanctions.
       A3.14.4.2. Restrictive sanctions do not apply to DoD personnel who are residing in a
       facility at the time the restrictive sanction is imposed, or who wish to renew or extend a
       rental or lease agreement begun before the restrictive sanctions were imposed.
AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009                                              107


       A3.14.4.3. Relocation of a military tenant within a restricted facility is prohibited
              without the written approval of the Commander.
   A3.14.5. Establish procedures to ensure DoD personnel are informed about current
   restrictive sanctions, and establish controls to determine where a member finally locates
   housing. If a military member takes residency in a restricted facility, contrary to instructions,
   the Commander takes administrative or appropriate disciplinary action.
   A3.14.6. As a minimum, publish a current list of facilities on restrictive sanction in the base
   bulletin and newspaper when there has been an addition, deletion, or change to the list. Also,
   publicize the list through other appropriate media, such as newcomer briefings and
   commander calls.
A3.15. Removing Restrictive Sanctions:
   A3.15.1. Remove restrictive sanctions under the following circumstances.
       A3.15.1.1. Upon request, HQ USAF/A7CH may approve a waiver to lift the restrictive
       sanctions before the 180-calendar day limit for unusual or exceptional circumstances. For
       example, the discriminatory act was a single action of the manager but the owner has a
       nondiscriminatory rental policy, has forbidden the discriminatory practice or has replaced
       the agent. Submit the request to waive the 180-day calendar day limit through the
       MAJCOM to HQ USAF/A7CH, and:
           A3.15.1.1.1. Outline the agent’s action to correct the situation.
           A3.15.1.1.2. Provide the agent’s commitment, in writing, to stop further
           discrimination.
A3.15.1.1.3. Outline the agent’s affirmative action to ensure nondiscriminatory policy in the
future.
           A3.15.1.1.4. Provide other supporting data, such as the number of minorities
           currently residing in the facilities and the number of units.
           A3.15.1.1.5. Describe the positive result on the civilian and military communities if
           restrictive sanctions are removed before the 180-calendar day minimum ends.
       A3.15.1.2. When the 180-calendar day period ends, remove restrictive sanctions if the
       agent provides a written assurance of future nondiscrimination policy to the Housing
       Flight. As determined locally, the agent or base official may initiate the assurance, but the
       Commander’s decision to remove the restrictive sanctions must be supported by the
       written assurance.
   A3.15.2. The Commander informs the Housing Flight Chief, social actions officer, public
   affairs officer and the agent, in writing, when the facility is removed from the restrictive
   sanctions list.
A3.16. Processing Inquiries Under the Privacy Act (PA) and Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA). Process PA and FOIA requests for information as outlined in DoDR 5400.7/AF
Supplement, AF FOIA Program, or AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, as applicable.
A3.17. Complaints Made Outside the United States. Upon receiving a complaint of
discrimination, the Housing Flight:

   A3.17.1. Consults with the JA to determine if the Status of Forces Agreement or other host
   nation or local laws, conflict with actions outlined in this AFI.
   A3.17.2. Takes action outlined in this AFI, except a HUD Form 903 is not required. Do not
   send complaints from outside the United States to HUD or DOJ. Inform the complainant that
   the fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1968 do not apply outside
   the United States.
   A3.17.3. Determines, with JA counsel, how to pursue the discrimination complaint, based on
   laws of the host nation.
A3.18. Referring Complaints to Other Agencies:
   A3.18.1. If the complainant requests the complaint and supporting documents be sent to
   HUD for action under the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Commander sends the original
   complaint and the HUD Form 903 to Fair Housing, HUD, Washington DC 20410-9000.
       A3.18.1.1. Forward the HUD Form 903 to HUD at the time the complainant reports the
       incident to a housing representative. To take action, HUD must receive the complaint
       within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. To ensure meeting the 180-day
       requirement, send the complaint to HUD before initiating the preliminary inquiry and
       subsequent procedures.
       A3.18.1.2. Recommend the Commander also send a copy of the complaint to the local
       HUD regional office, but state in the transmittal memorandum that the complaint is being
       sent to HUD headquarters and other agencies for action or information.
   A3.18.2. When forwarding a complaint to HUD, send an information copy of the complaint
   and the investigative report to the DOJ, Civil Rights Division, Washington, DC 20530-2001.
   At the request of the complainant, also send an action copy to DOJ, including a
   memorandum that informs DOJ of other agencies to which the report was submitted.
   A3.18.3. If allowed by the Commander or if the complainant requests, send an information
   copy of the complaint report to state and local agencies in the US and in OCONUS locations
   that take legal action on housing discrimination complaints. Summarize the discrimination in
   a cover memorandum, and list all agencies to which the report was submitted.

   A5.2.2. MAJCOMs provide a copy of the request submitted to AFRPA/RE.
   A5.2.3. To convey Capehart Housing units, AF must obtain a release from the lease-interest
   owned by USAF Housing, Inc. Release of these leases requires concurrence of the
   corporation. SAF/GCN processes the release with the corporation. HQ USAF/A7C requests
   SAF/GCN assistance in gaining release from the leases when Capehart units are identified
   for conveyance as part of privatization. MAJCOMs provides the following information to
   support this requirement:
            Lease number
            Lease term beginning date
            Name of the lessee (Capehart project owner)
            Name of the county (or other government unit) where the lease was recorded

   USAF/A7C must notify SAF/IEI and USAF Housing, Inc. of approval to demolish Capehart
   and Wherry units.
 112                   AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


   A5.3.2. The number of units to be demolished is identified for a MILCON project on DD
   Form 1391, Military Construction Project Data, (specific units are not identified).
   However, HQ AF has no visibility for which units are inadequate or surplus (or both), or
   whether the units are owned by USAF Housing, Inc, (Capehart and Wherry) and require
   SAF/IEI notification.
   A5.3.3. Upon authorization of a MILCON project that includes disposal of family housing
   units, HQ USAF/A7C approval is required, on a by unit basis, for all units to be disposed of
   as part of a project. Upon approval for disposal, HQ USAF/A7C will make the appropriate
   notification to SAF/IEI. MAJCOMs provide the following information along with the
   completed AF IMT 300 for HQ USAF/A7C approval.
            Identify units surplus to the installation requirement as indicated by the most recent
            HRMA and HCP

            McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act Screening (checklist) Cultural and
            Historic assessments, as needed
            Walking Shield Program considerations, where appropriate
   A5.3.4. Unlike privatization, the AF is not required to obtain a release from the lease-interest
   owned by USAF Housing, Inc for housing units disposed of as a result of a MILCON project
   since the AF will retain control of the land. The corporation and SAF/GCN do not support
   pursuing the release of the lease-interest.
A5.4. Demolition of Surplus MFH with O&M Funding.
   A5.4.1. Identify and program requirements for demolishing FH units in the IFHMP.
   Demolition not identified through conveyance in privatization or through a MILCON project
   can be included in the MFH O&M Financial Plan (RPMC project list) data call for the
   appropriate fiscal year. Identify requirements not anticipated or not programmed in the
   IFHMP in the annual Financial Plan (RPMC project list) data call.
   A5.4.2. In addition to a DD Form 1391, MAJCOMs provide the following information along
   with the completed AF IMT 300, for HQ USAF/A7C approval.
            Identify units surplus to installation requirement as indicated by the HRMA
            and HCP. Identify whether each unit is adequate or inadequate as indicated

            Walking Shield Program considerations, where appropriate
   A5.4.3. Unlike privatization, the AF is not required to obtain a release from the lease-interest
   owned by USAF, Inc for FH units disposed of as a result of an O&M project since the AF
   will retain control of the land. The corporation and SAF/GCN do not support pursuing the
   release of the lease-interest.
A5.5. Conversion of Family Housing (FH) Units to Other Uses.
   A5.5.1. Conversions of FH units for other uses require SAF/IEI approval.
   A5.5.2. FH units determined to be surplus to the installation based on the current HRMA
   may be converted to other uses. Only units considered adequate based on the HCP CAM
   may be converted. Units considered inadequate due to functional suitability deficiencies, but
   otherwise in adequate condition, may be converted (AFI 32-9002). To justify conversion,
   include information identified in Attachment 4.
   A5.5.3. Surplus FH units may not be diverted (temporarily converted).
A5.6. Divestiture of MFH Units Via Conveyance to Host Nation
   A5.6.1. Methods. Only four methods are authorized for divesting MFH units in foreign
   OCONUS locations: Permanent conversion, demolition, lease termination and conveyance
   to host nation. Any other method requires approval of HQ USAF/A7CH.
   A5.6.2. Permanent Conversion.       Follow guidelines in Attachment 4 for permanently
   converting MFH units.
   A5.6.3. Demolition. MFH units may be demolished as part of a MILCON project or as a
   separately identified RPMC project.
   A5.6.4. Early Lease Termination. Early termination of leased housing units reduces the
   period of commitment in the lease agreement and may result in a financial penalty. Submit
   waiver requests for early termination, including a full justification and cost benefit analysis,
   to HQ USAF/A7CH for approval.
   A5.6.5. Conveyance to Host Nation: Units identified for conveyance to the host nation will
   be considered divested when (a) the last occupant moves out, and (b) the host nation has been
   notified of the desire to transfer. Code units pending transfer inactive in ACES.

DEFINITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS Attachment 6 (Cont’d) AF IMT 1327
REDISTRIBUTION OF HOUSING

Use ACES-generated AF IMT 1327 to determine distribution and redistribution of FH. ACES
uses a standardized mathematical model to analyze redistribution of FH requirements (minus
Key and Essential housing). NOTE: Make sure all Key and Essential, Command and SCP
occupants are identified in ACES. Calculations are for adequate government-controlled
housing (government-owned and government-leased housing.
CALCULATIONS: There are six steps to complete the redistribution analysis:
   1. Establish housing requirements and assets
   2. Establish Key and Essential personnel
   3. Compute revised housing requirement minus Key and Essential assets
   4. Compare recommended distribution
   5. Compare recommended distribution to present distribution
   6. Obtain approval to change to distribution or retention of existing redistribution
I. WAITING LIST. ACES enters number of personnel on waiting lists for adequate FH in
appropriate columns for each grade category. Eligible personnel on waiting lists are counted
in their specific grade category and bedroom size, whether or not they elected to accept one
bedroom less.
II. ELIGIBLE OCCUPYING QUARTERS. ACES will enter the number of current residents
(eligible personnel), by grade category and bedroom size in appropriate columns. ACES
includes all personnel in the unit for which they are eligible, regardless of the unit they currently
occupy. The intent is to determine the actual eligibility requirement.
III. TOTAL REQUIREMENTS. ACES adds Waiting List and Eligible Occupying Quarters
columns, by grade category and bedroom size, to calculate total requirements.
IV. HOUSING ASSETS. ACES enters total available adequate government controlled
housing assets at the installation. Inadequate Housing assets are not included.
V. PERCENTAGE OF BEDROOM REQUIREMENTS. ACES calculates the percentage of
total housing requirement (expressed as a decimal, carried out to four decimal points) for each
grade category and bedroom requirement. The sum of all decimals in each category must
equal 1,000.
VI. KEY & ESSENTIAL SET ASSIDES. ACES enters the number of residents with the
Out Of Turn Code set to Key and Essential, Command Position or Special Command
Position on the Status tab of member’s record.
VII. REVISED HOUSING ASSETS. ACES subtracts the K&E in section VI from actual
housing assets in Section IV.
120                  AFI32-6001_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 27 MAY 2009


VIII. REVISED RQMTS & PERCENT OF TOTAL. The new total and percentage are
calculated, minus Key and Essential.
IX. DISTRIBUTION W/O KEY AND ESSENTIAL SET ASIDES. The revised housing
assets in Section VII are multiplied by the decimals developed in section VIII, then rounded
off to the nearest whole number.
X. ANALYTICAL REDISTRIBUTION. The Key and Essential in Section IV are added to
the numbers arrived at in Section IX. This section represents the distribution of all
government controlled housing assets based on equal housing opportunity, regardless of grade
category (except Key and Essential).
XI. EXISTING APPROVED DISTRIBUTION. The current distribution in ACES of all
government controlled housing.
XII. DISTIBUTION CHANGES REQUIRED. The difference between the analytical
distribution in Section X and the existing ACES distribution in section XI. A positive number
indicates that the category and bedroom size require additional assets. A negative number
indicates that the category and bedroom size have underutilized assets.
XIII. REAL PROPERTY DESIGNATION OF HOUSING. The permanent grade designation
of the government-controlled housing assets.
