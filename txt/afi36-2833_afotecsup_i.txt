       representatives’ travel (per diem is not authorized).
       19.3.2. If OSA is unable to support the required missions on the specified day(s), the
       Chief of Safety issues funded invitational orders (for travel only) and purchases round-
       trip commercial tickets between Boston MA and Washington DC for up to seven
       members of the Kolligian family to ensure they are appropriately represented at the
       presentation ceremony.
