                                BOARD PRESIDENT’S GUIDE

The purpose of this guide is to assist you as the Board President in ensuring the board runs
smoothly and professionally and the nominees feel good about having had quality evaluations.

A7.1. Ensure you know the ranks, names and units of your fellow board members.

A7.2. Ensure the nominees ranks and names are written on the score sheets that are provided in
your board's packages.

A7.3. Explain the criteria for review of the packages and ensure each Board Member:

     A7.3.1. Focuses on the information listed on the AF IMT 1206, Nomination for Award, and
     scores each package accordingly.

     A7.3.2. Recognizes that the quantity of information provided on the AF IMT 1206 is not and
     should not be the determing factor.

     A7.3.3. Remembers that the quality of information provided on the AF IMT 1206, for the
     period being considered, is the most significant discriminator and of extreme importance.

     A7.3.4. Is reminded that in order to be fair and consistent in their scoring, they MUST set
     aside all prejudices and evaluate the packages in accordance with the guidelines as provided
     in MAFBI 36-2802, Wing and Team Maxwel-Gunter Quarterly and Annual Recognition
     Programs.

     A7.3.5. Provides an honest, objective and unbiased review/evaluation of all nominations;
     continuing the integrity and credibility our program is noted for.

A7.4. Ensure all Board Members score each nominee or package and provide you with their
total score.

A7.5. Ensure you use the Board President Master Score Sheet to consolidate the information
provided by each board member.

A7.6. Once they have provided you with their scores, have them pass their score sheets to you
for review and pass them to your Board Recorder so the scores can be entered onto the master
score sheet.

A7.7. Upon completion of the entire evaluation process, remind the board members not to
discuss their scores with each other or anyone else until after the winners are announced by the
42 ABW/CC.

A7.8. Thank each board member for their participation and efforts in making our recognition
program a meaningful and successful one.
MAXWELLAFBI 36-2802           4 JANUARY 2008                                               21

A7.9. Ensure all items used or pertaining the the board (score sheets, packages, pencils,
calculators, etc.) are returned to the Recognition Program Monitor, 42 ABW/CCCA, for filing or
future use.
