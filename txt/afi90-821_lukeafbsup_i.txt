              Supplement 1, 4 March 2011


This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-8,
Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Program. It describes the Air Force Hazard
Communication (HAZCOM) Program that puts into effect the requirements of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200
for the Air Force. All records created as a result of this publication must be maintained and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://webrims.amc.af.mil.

Unless otherwise noted, the guidance and procedures outlined in this AFI apply to all U.S. Air
Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals, and indirect hire foreign
employees at Air Force installations within the United States, its territories, and in foreign
countries, and geographically separated units (GSU). Additionally, this AFI applies to the Air
Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units (DRU) and field operating
agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations. Government-owned, contractor-operated

                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Purpose. Hazardous chemicals are found in virtually every Air Force operation, including
aircraft and missile maintenance, civil engineering, transportation, supply, medical, and support
functions. This AFI is intended to minimize the incidence of chemically induced occupational
illnesses and injuries in the workplace by establishing guidance for training employees on the
health and physical hazards associated with, and proper preventive measures to be taken when,
using or handling hazardous chemicals in work area/shop(s). This program is commonly referred
to as the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program, and is not to be confused with other
separate and distinct entities such as Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
(HAZWOPER) and the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Management Program (HMMP).
HAZCOM is a performance-based program with separate training requirements and successful
implementation can only be measured by evaluating worker awareness of work area/shop
hazards.
1.2. Scope.
   1.2.1. This AFI provides the requirements for an effective Air Force HAZCOM Program for
   those work area/shop(s) that have workers that handle or use hazardous chemicals. All
   employees that work in an environment where any chemical is known to be present in such a
   manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable
   emergency, will be provided information about the hazardous chemicals to which they are
   exposed. This information shall be provided by means of a hazard communication program,
   including but not limited to material safety data sheets (MSDSs), labels, and other forms of
   warning, and information [e.g. AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Material
   Request/Authorization Forms, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) shop survey letters] and
   training.
   1.2.2. This AFI applies to:
       1.2.2.1. All U.S. Air Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals,
       and indirect-hire foreign employees at Air Force installations within the Continental
       United States (CONUS), or its territories, GOCOs, GSUs, and in foreign countries as
       established in accordance with the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
       1.2.2.2. The Air Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units
       (DRU) and field operating agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations.
       1.2.2.3. All Air Force military and civilian personnel who use, handle, or may be
       potentially exposed to chemical hazards while working under a contractor or working in
       contractor facilities. Where feasible, Air Force personnel may be included in the
       contractor’s Federal compliant hazard communication program. The Air Force retains
       ultimate responsibility for Air Force personnel participation and oversight.
6                                                AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


       1.2.2.4. Contractor employees who are employed at Air Force-owned or operated
       facilities when authorized by the Contracting Officer in coordination with BE with the
       following exceptions:
          1.2.2.4.1. This AFI does not excuse contractors, as stipulated in their specific
          contracts, from their compliance obligations under OSHA’s Federal HAZCOM
          regulation or any applicable State and local requirements.
          1.2.2.4.2. Contractors are required to train their own employees in accordance with
          Federal HAZCOM and any applicable State and local requirements. Contractors are
          not authorized to use the AF HAZCOM Program for this purpose.
    1.2.3. The Federal HAZCOM Standard has primacy over state programs at Air Force
    installations even if the state has an OSHA-approved state program.
    1.2.4. Materials exempted from this standard are listed under the Hazard Communication
    Program description contained in Para. 2.2.
    1.2.5. In work operations such as warehousing where employees only handle chemicals in
    sealed containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use, this instruction
    applies to these operations only as follows:
       1.2.5.1. Supervisors will ensure labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals
       are not removed or defaced.
       1.2.5.2. MSDSs received with incoming shipments of sealed containers will be
       maintained, and employees will have access to the MSDSs. If hazardous chemicals
       received do not have MSDSs, they will be obtained as soon as possible.
       1.2.5.3. Supervisors will train employees on the hazards of the chemicals in their work
       area/shop, and to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of a
       hazardous chemical from a sealed container.
    1.2.6. (Added-LUKEAFB) All workers, or their designated representatives, may obtain
    further information on the Air Force Hazard Communication Program (AFHCP), the Luke
    AFB Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) program, the Hazard Communication Standard
    (HCS), applicable Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and chemical information lists by
    contacting Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) at 6-7521.
    1.2.7. (Added-LUKEAFB) Terms Defined. See 29 CFR 1910.1200(c) for definition of
    terms. Others not included therein follow.
       1.2.7.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) Bypass Material.           Material going directly to the user
       rather than to a supply receiving function.
       1.2.7.2. (Added-LUKEAFB) Enterprise Environmental, Safety, and Occupational
       Health Management Information System (EESOH-MIS). This automated system is being
       used to manage and track hazardous materials (HAZMAT) usage and inventory.
       EESOH-MIS has replaced the Air Force Environmental Management Information
       System (AF-EMIS) previously used on Luke AFB.
       1.2.7.3. (Added-LUKEAFB) Workplace. An establishment, jobsite, or project at one
       geographical location containing one or more work areas. For this instruction, the
       workplace is defined as all facilities located within the boundaries of Luke AFB.

                        HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction. AF HAZCOM program requirements apply to any chemical hazard, except
as stated in Para. 2.2 below, known to be present in work area/shop(s) in such a manner
employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.
2.2. Materials Exempt from the AF HAZCOM Program. AF HAZCOM program
requirements do not apply to the following.
   2.2.1. Hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA).
   2.2.2. Hazardous substances subject to a remedial action or removal action under the
   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
   2.2.3. Tobacco or tobacco products.
   2.2.4. Wood or wood products that will not be processed.
   2.2.5. Articles. An article is a manufactured item other than fluid or particle: (1) which is
   formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; (2) which has end-use function(s)
   dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) which under
   normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or
   trace amounts of hazardous chemicals [as determined under 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)], and does
   not pose a physical hazard or health risk to employees.
   2.2.6. Food or alcoholic beverages.
   2.2.7. Drugs in final form [such as non-prescription and prescription, dry pelletized drugs,
   e.g., pills or caplets].
   2.2.8. Cosmetics.
   2.2.9. Consumer products in normal consumer use such as vehicle propane tanks, copier
   toner, etc (i.e., material usage in the workplace is for the purpose intended by the chemical
   manufacturer or importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and frequency of
   exposure which is not greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be
   experienced by consumers when used for the purpose intended).
      2.2.9.1. Whether consumer product materials are subject to the AF HAZCOM program
      and require training requires a case-by-case judgment by the supervisor in consultation
      with BE. For example:
          2.2.9.1.1. Personnel who use window cleaner fluid to clean infrequently will not
          require this training; however, maintenance personnel using the same window cleaner
          daily will require training.
          2.2.9.1.2. Patrons using automotive cleaners at the auto skills center will not require
          training; however, auto skills center employees and LRS transportation personnel
          using the same cleaner as part of their job will require training.
   2.2.10. Nuisance particulates such as copier toner.

   2.2.11. Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.
   2.2.12. Biological hazards.
   2.2.13. Munitions as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.
2.3. Installation Written Hazard Communication Program. Each Air Force installation
whose employees will potentially be exposed to hazardous materials not exempted as described
in Para. 2.2 must create a written hazard communication program to support work area/shop
implementation of the HAZCOM program. The written program must include installation-
specific procedures to meet the HAZCOM program requirements and specifically, will include:
   2.3.1. How MSDSs are accessible to employees (see Para. 2.5).
   2.3.2. Container labeling procedures and requirements (see Para. 2.6).
   2.3.3. Training requirements and procedures (see Para. 2.7).
   2.3.4. Chemical inventory requirements (see Para. 2.8).
   2.3.5. Procedures for informing employees regarding hazards of non-routine tasks and
   unlabeled pipes (see Para. 2.9).
   2.3.6. Procedures for determining the hazard of a chemical (See Para. 2.4; applies to only
   work area/shops which produce hazardous chemicals).
2.4. Hazard Determination: The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the
supplier or manufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air
Force activity controlling the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an
MSDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The Air Force activity producing the chemical will include
hazard determination procedures in their written program, and ensure their personnel are trained
on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations, the producing
organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the MSDS to AFIOH.
   2.4.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) Workplace supervisors are responsible for determining whether
   the type and quantity of HAZMAT used in the workplace qualifies the item to be exempted
   as a “consumer use” item, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(6). As necessary, BE
   will assist supervisors in making this determination.
   2.4.2. (Added-LUKEAFB) Consumer Product Determinations. To ensure that consumer
   use determinations are made appropriately, ask the following questions to guide making this
   determination.
       2.4.2.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) What information established the chemical as a consumer
       product?
       2.4.2.2. (Added-LUKEAFB) What is/are the hazardous chemical(s) present in the
       product to which employees were exposed?
       2.4.2.3. (Added-LUKEAFB) What is/are the concentration(s) of the hazardous
       chemical(s) present?
       2.4.2.4. (Added-LUKEAFB) Was the product included in the hazardous chemical
       inventory?
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                          17


       2.4.2.5. (Added-LUKEAFB) What is the duration of use of the product, i.e., for what
       period of time did the employees use the chemical during the work shift and work week?
       2.4.2.6. (Added-LUKEAFB) Did it greatly exceed normal or expected use by a
       consumer?
       2.4.2.7. (Added-LUKEAFB) Was the frequency of employee use significantly greater
       than that of a normal consumer?
       2.4.2.8. (Added-LUKEAFB) How was the product used and in what amounts?
       2.4.2.9. (Added-LUKEAFB) Was the product used in the workplace for the purpose
       intended by the manufacturer?
       2.4.2.10. (Added-LUKEAFB) Is the chemical used for/on a weapon system (i.e.
       aircraft, aircraft ground equipment, munitions, support equipment)?
       2.4.2.11. (Added-LUKEAFB) Is it a Technical Order requirement?
       2.4.2.12. (Added-LUKEAFB) Is        it   required   for   your   industrial/maintenance
       process(es)?
2.5. Material Safety Data Sheets. Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by
the chemical manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health
hazards, routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid
procedures, and control measures of the listed hazardous chemicals. The MSDS shall be
prepared to be consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) requirements. OCONUS locations will
maintain documents consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g). If a document consistent with 29
CFR 1910.1200(g) cannot be obtained from the OCONUS supplier, a document meeting the
intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) is acceptable.
   2.5.1. An MSDS must be immediately accessible (in either paper or electronic format) for
   every item on the work area/shop-specific hazardous chemical inventory. The MSDS on file
   must match the manufacturer and part number/trade name of the material on-hand. In
   addition, the MSDS preparation date must be consistent with the date/lot of any material on-
   hand. If a new MSDS is received, but the old material is still on-hand, the MSDS, which
   matched the old material, must be retained.
   2.5.2. MSDSs may be obtained from several sources. These include, but are not limited to,
   the chemical manufacturer or supplier, installation or unit HAZMART, DoD HMIRS on-line
   or CD-ROM, or through the ESOH-MIS. If the MSDS is not available from these sources,
   the BE Flight may be contacted for further assistance.
   2.5.3. Access to MSDSs in the work area/shops will be provided as follows:
       2.5.3.1. All workers on all shifts must know how to obtain an MSDS, and have
       unrestricted direct access to MSDSs for their work area/shop during all shifts.
       2.5.3.2. MSDSs may be maintained in the work area/shops in paper or electronic version.
       OSHA does not specifically prohibit any form of access as long as "no barriers to
       immediate employee access" are created.
       2.5.3.3. The location of MSDSs and/or means of access for any work area/shop will be
       determined locally. The supervisor should consider how long it would take for a worker
 18                                              AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


      to obtain an MSDS if it were needed to respond to a spill or if a worker was accidentally
      splashed with a hazardous chemical.
      2.5.3.4. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS
      access must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted. The back-up
      system may include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at
      another non-impacted location, telephone, fax, or access through a nearby HAZMART or
      BE Flight. Local judgment must be used to determine an adequate back-up system on a
      case-by-case basis.
      2.5.3.5. BE or other qualified personnel will provide explanations or interpretations of
      the MSDS to supervisors and affected workers, as requested, for routine training and
      planning, and will be available during emergency situations to assist in interpretation of
      MSDSs.
      2.5.3.6. Where personnel must travel between work area/shops during a work shift (e.g.,
      their work is carried out at more than one geographical location such as flight line
      operations), the MSDS may be kept at the primary work area/shop facility. In this
      situation, the supervisor shall ensure that personnel can immediately obtain the required
      information in an emergency.
   2.5.4. Ensure any proprietary formulary and/or trade secret information in an MSDS is
   protected and used only as a management tool for exposure and incident prevention or health
   hazard education. During the acquisition process, the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) will
   discuss trade-secret limitations with the work area/shop supervisor; however, supervisors
   using materials with trade-secret information are encouraged to be familiar with requirements
   and restrictions listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(i). When requesting proprietary information, the
   BEE may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding a manufacturer’s
   proprietary information; consult with Legal Services in non-disclosure criteria are not clear.
2.6. Labels and Other Forms of Warning.
   2.6.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR
   1910.1200(f), and DoDI 6050.5-H, DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System.
      2.6.1.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) Addresses of the same manufacture may vary due to
      multiple manufacturing and distribution locations.
   2.6.2. It is the responsibility of chemical manufacturers, importers and commercial
   distributors to label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the OSHA’s Federal
   HAZCOM standard. Accordingly, chemical containers entering the installation through the
   supply system or through local purchase should already be labeled. Supply receiving and
   HAZMARTs will ensure incoming containers are properly labeled. Supply receiving and
   HAZMARTS will submit an item discrepancy report to identify any containers received
   without proper labeling from the manufacturer.
   2.6.3. Materials exempted from HAZCOM labeling requirements are described as follows
   [See 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) if additional details are desired]:
      2.6.3.1. Any pesticide as such term is defined in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
      Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                          19


     2.6.3.2. Any chemical substance or mixture as such terms are defined in the Toxic
     Substances Control Act (TSCA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
     2.6.3.3. Any food, food additive, color additive, drug, cosmetic, or medical or veterinary
     device or product, including materials intended for use as ingredients in such products
     (e.g., flavors and fragrances), as such terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and
     Cosmetic Act.
     2.6.3.4. Any distilled spirits (beverage alcohols), wine, or malt beverage intended for
     non-industrial use, as such terms are defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,
     and regulations issued under that Act, when subject to the labeling requirements of that
     Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
     and Firearms.
     2.6.3.5. Any consumer product or hazardous substance as those terms are defined in the
     Consumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act respectively, when
     subject to a consumer product safety standard or labeling requirement of those Acts, or
     regulations issued under those Acts by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
     2.6.3.6. Agricultural or vegetable seed treated with pesticides and labeled in accordance
     with the Federal Seed Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the
     Department of Agriculture.
  2.6.4. Supervisors will ensure labels on containers of hazardous chemicals used in their work
  area/shop meet HAZCOM requirements, remain affixed to their containers, and are not
  obliterated or covered. At minimum, the following information will appear on container
  labels [refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200(f)(6) for alternate means]:
     2.6.4.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) in the container.
     2.6.4.2. Appropriate hazard warnings that include information about the specific physical
     and health hazard(s), including target organ effects of the chemical(s) in the container.
     This may be accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or pictures.
     2.6.4.3. (Added-LUKEAFB) Supervisors will ensure materials not labeled will use the
     example label in Attachment 7 or an equivalent.
     2.6.4.4. (Added-LUKEAFB) Supervisors will ensure all immediate use containers are
     labeled as permanent containers.
  2.6.5. Installation HAZMARTs may affix other labels to containers for locally determined
  purposes. If the HAZMART label duplicates the Federal HAZCOM standard requirements,
  the original label may be covered. If the HAZMART label does not duplicate the
  information required by the Federal HAZCOM standard, information on the original label
  must remain legible.
  2.6.6. Transfer of chemicals between containers.
     2.6.6.1. If an employee transfers a chemical from a labeled container (for example, a 55-
     gallon drum) into a portable container for the immediate use of the same employee who
     made the transfer, then the portable container does not need to be labeled according to
     HAZCOM requirements. Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be
     under the control of and used only by the person who transfers it from a labeled container
 20                                               AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


      and only within the work shift in which it is transferred. If the employee cannot maintain
      full control over the chemical or departs the work area/shop, and if there is residual
      material left in the portable container, this material shall either be disposed of under
      applicable local disposal regulations, returned to its original container, or labeled in
      accordance with applicable regulations.
      2.6.6.2. If a chemical is transferred from a labeled container into a portable container at a
      central distribution point, such as the installation or unit HAZMART, for use by other
      employees, then the portable container must be labeled by the HAZMART in accordance
      with HAZCOM requirements.
2.7. Employee Information and Training. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for
ensuring all workers are properly trained on the chemical hazards in their work area/shop.
   2.7.1. Purpose. Supervisors and employees who handle, use, or are potentially exposed to
   hazardous materials in the course of official Air Force duties must be provided training on
   the AF HAZCOM program, including training to address work area/shop-specific hazards
   prior to the use of hazardous chemicals. Supervisors will ensure the appropriate functionals
   (i.e., PH, BE, base safety office, and fire department) review and approve the shop specific
   hazard training program for technical accuracy and completeness prior to implementation in
   the work area/shop. Contract supervisors and contractors shall be trained according to their
   specific contract provisions.
   2.7.2. Hazard Communication Training. Workers will be provided HAZCOM training prior
   to working with a material that could potentially create a health hazard, and when work
   area/shop conditions or hazardous materials change.
      2.7.2.1. Initial Training. Workers will receive comprehensive HAZCOM training from
      their supervisors at the time of their initial assignment in a work area/shop. This training,
      at a minimum, will include the following:
          2.7.2.1.1. Identification of operations or processes in the work area/shop where
          hazardous chemicals are present or used, and the complete list of hazardous material
          used in association with work area/shop processes.
          2.7.2.1.2. Identification of relevant hazard categories associated with each chemical
          used (e.g., flammability, carcinogenicity, etc.) or the individual chemical hazards;
          including, but not limited to, those with specific regulatory requirements (e.g.,
          asbestos, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, formaldehyde, and lead).
          2.7.2.1.3. The location and contents of the work area/shop-specific written hazard
          communication program.
          2.7.2.1.4. Proper labeling of hazardous materials.
          2.7.2.1.5. How to access and read MSDSs.
          2.7.2.1.6. Controls (engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal
          protective equipment) workers must use to minimize or eliminate exposure to
          hazardous chemicals specific to a task (e.g., the specific respirator for a specific spray
          painting process). Supervisors shall refer to the installation BE work area/shop
          survey reports for specific control requirements.
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                            21


          2.7.2.1.7. Emergency procedures, such as recognition of a spill or accidental
          chemical release (e.g., visual, odor, alarm) and escape procedures to include the
          locations of emergency eye wash stations, showers, and monitoring capabilities.
          2.7.2.1.8. Chemical hazards associated with non-routine tasks (e.g., solvent tank
          change-out every three months).
      2.7.2.2. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is
      required when either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical
      is introduced. The training shall include all elements described in Para. 2.7.2.
      Supervisors may use the AF Form 3952 or BE special survey letters as sources of
      information to meet this training requirement. When workers change work area/shops
      either by assigned duties or location, work area/shop-specific training as described in
      Para. 2.7.2.1 will be re-accomplished only to the extent needed to cover changes in
      working conditions and potential exposures.
      2.7.2.3. (Added-LUKEAFB) Document introduction of new chemicals/hazards to shop
      on supplemental training log in Tab I. An example of a training log has been provided,
      see Attachment 8.
   2.7.3. Activities Not Co-located. Air Force employees assigned to non-co-located activities,
   such as GOCO facilities, will be trained as GSUs (see Para. 2.7) or they may participate in
   that GOCO’s or other Services’ hazard communication training program, as long as the
   training meets the requirements of the Federal HAZCOM standard.
   2.7.4. Documentation of Hazard Communication Training. While the Federal HAZCOM
   standard does not require documentation of worker training, the Air Force, in accordance
   with AFI 91-301, as a good management practice, requires work area/shop supervisors to
   document both worker initial and supplemental hazard communication training on AF Form
   55 or in CAMS or in ESOH-MIS. This record should also include external HAZCOM
   training provided to AF supervisors and employees from contractor organizations where
   applicable.
   2.7.5. Determining the Effectiveness of Hazard Communication Training. HAZCOM is a
   performance-based standard. Therefore, the effectiveness of worker training will be
   measured by assessing worker knowledge of basic hazard communication concepts to
   include, but not be limited to:
      2.7.5.1. What processes and chemicals present hazards in their work area/shop and the
      nature of the hazard.
      2.7.5.2. How to access MSDSs for any chemical they use.
      2.7.5.3. How to find information on an MSDS.
      2.7.5.4. How to interpret the hazard symbols or wording on hazard labels and what
      precautions (e.g., engineering controls, personal protective equipment, etc.) they must use
      when working with hazardous chemicals.
2.8. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
   2.8.1. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of the
   hazardous chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for
 22                                              AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


   the work area/shop as a whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work
   area/shop). The identity that is used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory.
   Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained in the ESOH-MIS.
   2.8.2. The inventory is a fundamental building block for a HAZCOM program and the
   nature of the chemicals on the inventory in a work area/shop will determine the scope of the
   hazard communication program and training requirements appropriate for that work
   area/shop. NOTE: IAW AFI 32-7086, the IHMP, through the AF Form 3952 authorization
   process, controls which hazardous chemicals can be used in each work area/shop on an
   installation.
   2.8.3. (Added-LUKEAFB) The EESOH-MIS AUL will be used for the work center
   chemical inventory. This listing must be kept current and must reflect a complete and
   accurate inventory of all HAZMAT used in the work area.
2.9. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   2.9.1. Non-routine tasks are:
      2.9.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area/shop’s normal activities but performed
      infrequently, for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent.
      2.9.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
      (AFSC) or job series.
   2.9.2. Supervisors will ensure work area/shop operating instructions (OI), specific task lists,
   and Job Safety Analyses (JSAs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards,
   and controls, for the infrequent tasks covered under Para. 2.9.1. OIs do not need to be
   prepared if technical orders (TO) or other official documents adequately describe these tasks
   and associated hazards and controls. Supervisors will ensure workers review these
   procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.
   2.9.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
   the gaining activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to
   beginning the activity:
      2.9.3.1. The initial HAZCOM training described in Para. 2.7.2.1 for workers not
      previously trained.
      2.9.3.2. Work area/shop-specific training, as necessary, on work area/shop-specific
      chemical hazards and associated controls.
   2.9.4. (Added-LUKEAFB) The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the
   worker’s formal supervisor describing the training conducted. The individual’s AF Form 55
   (or electronic equivalent) should be updated upon receipt of the notification.
      2.9.4.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) The initial Federal Hazard Communication Training
      Program (FHCTP) for workers not previously trained. Attachment 6 will be used by
      supervisors to train their employees as necessary.
      2.9.4.2. (Added-LUKEAFB) Supplemental training, as necessary, on specific chemical
      hazards which will be used or will be at the jobsite.
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                            23


       2.9.4.3. (Added-LUKEAFB) Measures the worker can take to reduce the risk of
       exposure at the jobsite and steps already instituted to reduce the risk (e.g., ventilation
       system).
       2.9.4.4. (Added-LUKEAFB) The location of the MSDS for chemicals present.
       2.9.4.5. (Added-LUKEAFB) The information contained on the labels.
2.10. Contractors in AF Work Area/Shop(s). When an Air Force work area/shop uses
hazardous chemicals in a way that contractor employees (e.g., a painting contractor working in
an industrial shop) may be exposed, then the work area/shop written hazard communication
program and access to MSDSs must be provided to the contractors in accordance with 29 CFR
1910.1200(e)(2). The contractor is responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM
information for assessments of contractor employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM
program.
   2.10.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) The Air Force requesting activity quality assurance evaluator
   (QAE) or quality assurance personnel (QAP), per AFI 21-101, will advise work area
   supervisors and Air Force employees monitoring the performance of contractors of
   hazardous chemicals introduced by the contractor. The contractor is required to submit
   information on the use of HAZMAT according to FAR clause 52.223-3.
2.11. Forms Prescribed. Air Force Form 55 (AF55), Employee Safety and Health Record;
Air Force Form 3952 (AF3952), Chemical/Hazardous Material Request/Authorization Form

Chemical—Any element, chemical compound or mixture of elements, or compounds.
Chemical Manufacturer—An employer with a work area where chemical(s) are produced for
use or distribution.
Container—Any bag, barrel, bottle, box, can, cylinder, drum, reaction vessel, storage tank, or
the like that contains a hazardous chemical. For purposes of this standard, pipes or piping
systems and engines, fuel tanks, or other operating systems in a vehicle are not considered to be
containers.
ESOH-MIS—An AF approved automated system to store and maintain all information
associated with environment, safety, and occupational health surveillance data and work
area/shop requirements.
Employee—A worker who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals under normal operating
conditions or in foreseeable emergencies. Office workers who encounter hazardous chemicals
only in non-routine, isolated instances are not covered.
Exposure—The intensity, frequency, and length of time personnel are subjected to a hazard.
Hazard Warning—Any words, pictures, symbols, or combination thereof appearing on a label
or other appropriate form of warning which convey the specific physical and health hazard(s),
including target organ effects, of the chemical(s) in the container(s).
HAZMART—As the customer service desk for the IHMP, it is the only entity on an installation
authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT. At a minimum, a HAZMART is a facility or
location where customers can receive support for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMATs
are managed and tracked. A HAZMART is intended to be the primary location on an installation
where LRS personnel stock, store, issue, and distribute HAZMAT. Each installation must have
at least one primary HAZMART established by, and accountable to the LRS Commander. The
HMMP team may designate additional unit-controlled supply activities as HAZMARTs
performing all the functions of the primary HAZMART. The HAZMART responsibilities

             SAMPLE WORK AREA SPECIFIC HAZCOM TRAINING PLAN

               Squadron HAZCOM POC:
                 Flight HAZCOM POC:
             Work Area HAZCOM POC:

A4.1. This document provides supervisory personnel with the training requirements for the
Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) program for all personnel assigned to this work area. Upon
completion of this training, personnel must have their AF Form 55 (or electronic equivalent)
updated to reflect such training.
A4.2. Overview: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued the
Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) which eventually became Title 29, CFR, 1910.1200,
Hazard Communication. It states that every individual has the right to know what hazards are
faced on the job, and how to be protected against them. AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication,
outlines the Air Force Hazard Communication Program (HAZCOM).
A4.3. The goal of the Hazard Communication Program is to reduce the incidence of
occupational illness and injury caused by exposure to hazardous chemicals in the workplace.
A4.3.1. A MSDS contains nine major sections (some MSDSs may have additional sections).
The sections are divided as follows: Material Identification, Ingredients and Hazards, Physical
Data, Fire and Explosion Data, Reactivity Data, Health Hazard Data, Spill and Disposal Methods,
Special Protection Information, and Comments Section. All companies do not follow this
standard format.
A4.3.1.1. Section I contains the material identification and general information like company
name, address, material name with synonyms, and an emergency phone number.
A4.3.1.2. Section II lists all hazardous ingredients in the chemical mixture. Many chemical
materials are mixtures. Not only does this section list the ingredients, but also states the
percentages of each ingredient found in the total mixture. For example, acetic acid may contain
two ingredients, water and acetic acid, where water makes up 72% of the mixture and 28% is
acetic acid. This accounts for 100% of the mixture (72 + 28). Knowing percentages is helpful
when an air sample is accomplished to determine the airborne concentration of the hazard.
A4.3.1.3. Section III contains physical data. Physical data is characterized by appearance, odor,
a boiling point, freezing point, vapor pressure, solubility, and specific gravity. The important
data in this section are vapor pressure, and boiling point. For instance, methylene chloride has a
boiling point of 39oC (102oF) and has a high vapor pressure. Because of these physical
properties, an employee should be aware that this material must be stored in a cool, vented, and
flame free environment.
A4.3.1.4. Section IV provides data on fire and explosion information such as what type of fire
extinguishing media to use and whether or not any toxic vapors are released during a fire. If so,
it states the personal protective measures fire fighters should use. It is important that this section
be reviewed prior to using the chemical.
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                                   35


A4.3.1.5. Section V provides reactivity data. This section simply describes “what can be stored
with what”. An example is storing acids with bases. You would not want to store sodium
hydroxide (lye) in the same cabinet with sulfuric acid (battery acid). If one of those containers
broke, it would react vigorously, neutralize your chemicals, and produce hydrogen gas. It could
produce a dangerous situation.
A4.3.1.6. Section VI contains health hazard information, emergency and first aid procedures.
The data found in this section describe the route of entry (e.g., skin, eyes, respiratory) and the
target organs or systems (e.g., liver, lungs, central nervous system) and first aid procedures.
A4.3.1.7. Section VII provides information on the proper disposal of the material. This section
tells you how to neutralize a chemical spill, how to dispose of the material, and who to contact if
a spill occurs.
A4.3.1.8. Section VIII provides important information on specific personal protective equipment
such as respiratory protection, rubber boots, or eye goggles. It also provides information on the
necessity for engineering controls such as a ventilation system.
A4.3.1.9. Section IX is used for any additional comments the manufacturer deems necessary for
the user. The key is educating the user on the product to prevent injury or illness.
A4.4. A listing of all hazardous chemicals is provided as part of the HAZCOM Program. The
actual chemicals are stored in ___________________________________________.
A4.4.1. The HAZCOM program requires the use of warning labels that contain the name and
identity of the chemical, and appropriate hazard warnings.
A4.4.2. Labels on containers that leave the work area must contain the name and address of the
responsible party. The warning label is often your first source of information about chemical
hazards. The name and identity on the label can be used to find the right MSDS, where you will
find additional information.
A4.5. Workcenter HAZCOM Binder MSDS provide the physical and health risks of each
hazardous chemical along with the signs and symptoms of overexposure and the method of
determining the presence or release of a hazardous material in the work area. Employees should
review MSDSs and applicable AF Form 3952s during shop specific HAZCOM training.
A4.6. Work area personnel reduce or prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals by using
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and by being familiar with the signs and
symptoms of exposure to the materials they are working with. Three basic methods for
controlling chemical hazards are engineering controls, personal protective equipment, and
administrative controls.
A4.6.1. Engineering controls include substitution, isolation, general ventilation, and local
exhaust ventilation. Substitution applies when a chemical, process, or piece of equipment with
fewer hazards can replace an existing one. Isolation refers to using an enclosure, barrier, or a
safe distance to separate workers from the exposure hazard. Common examples of this are
machine enclosures, enclosed control rooms, and splash guards. General ventilation is mixing an
airborne hazard with fresh air to reduce exposure levels. This only applies when hazards have
low toxicity and mix readily with air. Some examples of general ventilation are fans and vents.
Local exhaust ventilation captures an airborne hazard as it is released and takes it out of the work
area to eliminate the exposure.

A4.6.2. Prioritizing how we control exposures is accomplished by looking at the source, path
and receiver. Controlling the receiver is least desirable, but most often used. PPE is the most
common means of protecting an individual against exposures (physical and health hazards).
Some examples of PPE include gloves, aprons, eye and face protection, and respirators. To
protect you, the PPE must be matched to the specific hazard. For example, cloth gloves are
useless for protection against a corrosive liquid. PPE is useless unless you wear it. Proper fit,
correct use, and routine inspection are essential.
A4.6.3. Administrative controls include documentation, information, and training in safe work
practices, good housekeeping, and most of all, monitoring. This applies to personnel and
equipment. The HAZCOM Program is an effective administrative control to ensure workers are
informed on the work area hazards.
A4.7. Steps taken to reduce exposure. Steps are described in Bioenvironmental Engineering
routine and special surveillance reports, located in Tab G of the HAZCOM binder. The reports
address engineering, administrative, and PPE health hazard controls to reduce the risk of
exposure to all workers. Additionally, all personnel are provided HAZCOM training and are
always discussing potential situations as well as how to best deal with such situations.
A4.8. Work area personnel do/do not (circle appropriate word) use large quantities of hazardous
materials. Most spills are cleaned up on the spot by following the HAZMAT Spill Cleanup
Procedures which are reviewed prior to working with any chemical. An emergency eyewash is
available in ______________________ for accidental contact and/or a emergency shower is
available in _____________________. Immediately after flushing the exposed area for 15
minutes, personnel involved will be taken for further evaluation to the Luke Clinic or an off-base
urgent care facility (if the Luke Clinic is unavailable). Additionally, work area personnel receive
training on responding to HAZMAT spills (see 56 FW OPLAN 705). If, at any time, there is a
spill which is beyond our capabilities, work area personnel will evacuate the building and call the
Fire Department for assistance.

                        INITIAL FEDERAL HAZCOM TRAINING
Figure A6.1. Assessing Chemical Hazards
Scope of the rule
The hazard communication standard requires chemical manufacturers, distributors or importers
to assess the hazards of chemicals which they produce, distribute, or import.
The hazard communication standard is based on the premise that chemicals have inherent
characteristics that pose potential hazards, and workers have the right to know what those
potential hazards are. All employers must provide information to their employees about the
hazardous chemicals to which they are exposed. They do this by means of a hazard
communication program, labels and other forms of warning, material safety data sheets, and
information and training.
Only chemical manufacturers and importers are required to perform hazard determinations on all
chemicals they produce or import, although distributors and employers may also choose to do so.
Hazard determination procedures must be in writing and made available, upon request, to
employees, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and OSHA.
Appendix C in the standard is provided as a guide for use when assessing appropriate hazard
evaluation procedures.

Application

                                 The hazard communication rule applies to any chemical which
                                 is known to be present in the workplace in such a manner that
                                 employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or
                                 in a foreseeable emergency.


The phrase "known to be present" is essential to the scope of the standard. If a hazardous
chemical is known to be present by the chemical manufacturer or the employer, it is covered by
the standard. This includes chemicals to which employees may be exposed during normal
operations or in a foreseeable emergency. This means that even though an employer was not
responsible for the manufacture of the hazardous chemical, the employer (USAF) has the
responsibility for conveying hazards to his/her employees.

For example, the standard applies in the following situations: if employees are exposed to
chemicals brought onto a multi-employer worksite by other employer(s) or if service personnel
are exposed to natural gas during furnace repair. An employer whose employees are exposed to
chemicals "known to be present" must include in their hazard communication program
information concerning the hazards of those chemicals.

Employee. - Employees, such as office workers or bank tellers who encounter hazardous
chemicals only in non-routine, isolated instances are not covered. For example, an office worker

who occasionally changes the toner in a copying machine would not be covered by the standard.
However, an employee who operates a copying machine as part of her/his work duties would be
covered by the provisions of the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS).

The standard applies to:

Any chemical that employees may be exposed to under normal conditions in the workplace or in
a foreseeable emergency.

The terminology "exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency"
excludes substances for which the hazardous chemical is inextricably bound or is not readily
available, and, therefore, presents no potential for exposure. Foreseeable emergency does not
include employee exposures in the event of an accidental fire, but does include equipment failure,
rupture of containers, or failure of control equipment which could result in an uncontrolled
release.

Products exempt from coverage by the HCS

      Any hazardous waste as defined by the Solid Waste Disposal Act;
      Any hazardous substance defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
       Compensation and Liability ACT (CERCLA) when the hazardous substance is the focus
       of remedial or removal action being conducted under CERCLA;
      Tobacco or tobacco products;
      Wood or wood products, including lumber which will not be processed, where the
       chemical manufacturer or importer can establish that the only hazard they pose to
       employees is the potential for flammability or combustibility (wood or wood products
       which have been treated with a hazardous chemical covered by this standard, and wood
       which may be subsequently sawed or cut, generating dust, are not exempted);
      Articles. By definition, a manufactured item is exempted as an article if "under normal
       conditions of use it does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or trace
       amounts of a hazardous chemical...and does not pose a physical hazard or health risk to
       employees";
      Food or alcoholic beverages which are sold, used, or prepared in a retail establishment
       (such as a grocery store, restaurant, or drinking place), and foods intended for personal
       consumption by employees while in the workplace;
      Any drug, as that term is defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, when it is
       in solid, final form for direct administration to the patient (e.g., tablets or pills); drugs
       which are packaged by the chemical manufacturer for sale to consumers in a retail
       establishment (e.g., over-the-counter drugs); and drugs intended for personal
       consumption by employees while in the workplace (e.g., first aid supplies);
      Cosmetics which are packaged for sale to consumers in a retail establishment, and
       cosmetics intended for personal consumption by employees while in the workplace;
      Any consumer product or hazardous substance, as those terms are defined in the
       Consumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act respectively, where
       the employer can show that it is used in the workplace for the purpose intended by the
       chemical manufacturer or importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                               41


       frequency of exposure which is not greater than the range of exposures that could
       reasonably be experienced by consumers when used for the purpose intended;
      Nuisance particulates where the chemical manufacturer or importer can establish that
       they do not pose any physical or health hazard covered under this section;
      Ionizing and nonionizing radiation; and,
      Biological hazards.

Responsibilities

Requirements for chemical manufacturers, distributors, and importers are different than those for
employers who only use manufactured chemicals.

Employer responsibilities include:

      assessing the hazards of chemicals,
      container labeling,
      material safety data sheet development, maintenance and use,
      information and training, and
      development of a written hazard communication plan

Throughout the rest of the course, pay special attention to those areas you've listed as inadequate.
You may gain some good ideas about how to improve those areas.

Assessing the hazards

The quality of a hazard communication program is largely dependent upon the ability of the
manufacturer to adequately and accurately determine the hazards posed by the chemicals they
manufacture. Although manufacturers, importers, and employers evaluating chemicals are not
required to follow any specific methods for determining hazards, they must be able to
demonstrate that they have adequately ascertained the hazards of the chemicals they produce
according to the following criteria:

      Carcinogenicity: Evidence that a chemical is carcinogenic is established by the National
       Toxicology Program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, OSHA Standards,
       and all available scientific data.
      Human data: Where available, epidemiological studies and case reports of adverse
       health effects must be considered in the evaluation of the chemical.
      Animal data: Since human evidence of health effects in exposed populations is generally
       not available for most chemicals produced or used in the workplace, toxilogical testing in
       animal populations is usually required to predict health effects.
      Adequacy of data: To establish sufficient basis for findings which determine hazards,
       they must be from studies designed and conducted according to established scientific
       principles, and which report statistically significant conclusions regarding health effects.
       In vitro (in an artificial environment outside the living organism) studies alone generally
       do not form the basis for a definitive finding of hazard.

      Reporting data: Chemical manufacturers, importers, or employers may report the results
       of other scientifically valid studies which tend to refute the findings of hazard.

Additional requirements for determining the hazards chemical mixtures used in the workplace
are further outlined in 29 CFR 1910.1200 (d)(5).

Material safety data sheets (MSDS)

Chemical manufacturers and importers must obtain and develop a material safety data sheet for
each hazardous chemical they produce or import.

USAF industrial shops must maintain and use a material safety data sheet in the workplace for
each hazardous chemical they use. We will cover the MSDS in depth later in the course. If you're
familiar with the MSDS, you'll agree that they are not exactly everyone's favorite reading, but
they are extremely important for a number of reasons.

The Material Data Safety Sheet contains a wealth of information to protect employees in the
workplace. For instance, you're given information about the nature of the chemical. You're also
told what personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear when working with a hazardous chemical.
You'll receive procedures to use if an unexpected spill occurs or if there is some kind of
emergency as a result of exposure to a hazardous chemical. The MSDS may also serve as an
excellent "course outline" when training specific HAZCOM procedures. Be sure you don't
minimize the importance of the information given on the MSDS -- it may save your life some
day!

Warning Labels

The containers used by manufacturers for hazardous chemicals are called primary containers.
Chemical manufacturers must develop appropriate labels that provide hazard warning
information, and they, as well as distributors and importers must make sure each primary
container of hazardous chemicals leaving the workplace is properly labeled, tagged or marked
with the:

      Name of the manufacturer;
      Name of the hazardous chemical; and
      Appropriate warning hazard

When the employer transfers a hazardous chemical from the manufacturer's primary container to
another container, they create a secondary container. The secondary container might be a coffee
can, glass jar, or other container. The employer must make sure their secondary container labels
indicate the:

      Common name of the hazardous chemical; and
      Appropriate warning hazard

Information and training
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                                  43


Education is the beginning of safety, and that certainly applies to hazard communication. It's
critically important that employers educate their employees on the:

      physical and health hazards of chemicals used in their work area,
      hazard communication rule requirements,
      availability and location of the written program, and
      the importance of the training subjects below.

Employees should be thoroughly trained on how to:

      reference the chemical list of hazards,
      use material data safety sheets,
      use protective practices including PPE,
      recognize a release of chemicals, and
      detect overexposure to chemicals

Written plan

The shop supervisor must develop, implement, and maintain a written hazard communication
plan that contains a list of the hazardous chemicals being used in the workplace, assigns
responsibilities, and describes procedures for:

      labeling containers,
      maintaining and using material safety data sheets, and
      information and training
      pipe labeling
      non-routine task procedures
      contractor procedures

ANALYZING THE WORKPLACE
INTRODUCTION

Now that you have reviewed the scope of the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) and
employer responsibilities, it's time to get down to business. The first task is to determine what
chemicals you have in your workplace. It's important for the person conducting the initial
assessment to be familiar with the definition and characteristics of "hazardous chemicals," so
let's take a look.

What are hazardous chemicals?

For the purposes of the hazard communication standard, a hazardous chemical may be defined as
"Any chemical which is a physical or health hazard."

Physical hazards - are chemical reactions that could result in a fire, explosion, and/or toxic gas
release which cause physical trauma if chemicals are handled or stored improperly.
 44                                                AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


Health hazards - are health effects (illness or disease) caused directly by the chemicals
themselves, not an injury resulting from a reaction. All chemical materials can cause health
problems under the wrong conditions.
Forms of Hazardous Chemicals
You might think that the chemicals which apply to the rule are those in liquid, gas or particulate
form. But, the standard's definition of "chemical" is much broader than that which is commonly
used. In a HAZCOM program chemicals which apply may exist in one of many forms:
Dusts - are finely divided particles. Example - wood dust.
Fumes - are even smaller particles usually formed when solid metal is heated and vaporized, and
then condenses as tiny particles.
Fibers - are similar to dusts but are of an elongated shape. Examples - asbestos and fiberglass.
Mists - are liquid droplets that have been sprayed into the atmosphere.
Vapors - are gases formed when liquid evaporates.
Gases - are substances that are normally airborne at room temperature. A vapor is the gaseous
phase of a substance which is a normally a liquid or solid at room temperature.
Solids - such as metal, treated wood, plastic.
Liquids - the most common form in the workplace.
Chemical effects
The effects chemicals have on the various organs of the human body depend on several
important factors:
1. The form of the chemical : Is the chemical a solid, liquid, or gas?
2. How the chemical contacts the body: Is the chemical ingested, inhaled, absorbed, or injected?
3. The amount, or dose, the body receives. How much chemical makes its way into the body?
4. How toxic the chemical is. How poisonous is the chemical?
Routes of Entry
Another important task when assessing the workplace for chemical hazards is determine the
route(s) of entry the chemicals may take. If we know the route(s) of entry, we can then
determine appropriate engineering and management controls to eliminate or reduce the exposure.
The four common routes of entry are:
1. Ingestion Do we eat or drink it?

2. Inhalation Do we breath it in?

3. Absorption Does it pass through the skin, eyes or other membranes?

4. Injection Does it enter through a puncture or cut?
We'll be talking more about the physical characteristics, routes of entry, and toxicity of
hazardous chemicals later in the MSDS module.
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                               45


Assessing and analyzing the workplace for chemical hazards
There's a simple two step process for assessing and analyzing the workplace for chemical
hazards:
1. Assess the workplace to see which hazardous chemicals are currently being used. Do this by
conducting a walk around inspection and checking records. Each shop must have a shop
inventory in your HazCom binder. With chemical list in hand, insure a MSDS exists for each
chemical in preparation for the next step.
2. With each MSDS analyze the hazards presented by each chemical in the workplace. The
MSDS is your primary tool to determine the physical and health hazards, routes of entry, toxicity,
and other information about each chemical in your workplace.
Once you identify and know the nature of the hazards of each chemical, it becomes important to
control those hazards by eliminating or reducing those hazards using a systematic approach.
Chemical Hazard Control Strategies
Hazardous materials can be used safely in workplaces if adequate control strategies are used to
prevent exposure to those chemicals. Control strategies include any device, procedure, piece of
equipment, system, etc., that is used to keep hazardous chemicals from contacting workers at
harmful levels. To eliminate or reduce exposure to hazardous chemicals, an effective protocol
called the "Hierarchy of Controls" has been developed. When Bioenvironmental Engineering
determines during a workplace assessment that exposure to harmful levels of hazardous
chemicals is present, they will eliminate or reduce that exposure using the following strategies in
the following order:
Engineering Controls. Redesign, replace, substitute chemicals, machinery, equipment to
eliminate or reduce the chemical hazard itself. Engineering controls are most effective when the
hazard is eliminated or reduced to levels that do not require the use of management controls that
are dependent on appropriate behaviors for their success. This strategy seeks to control the
hazard at the source by using such methods as total enclosure or substitution of a safer chemical.
It also attempts to control the hazardous chemicals along the path by using such measures as
ventilation. Engineering controls, alone, may not be effective if they can be defeated. Usually,
it's best to develop and implement management controls in addition to engineering controls to
help ensure long term effectiveness.
Management Controls. These controls reduce exposure to a hazard by developing and
implementing safe work procedures, schedules and the use PPE. These changes reduce the
duration, frequency, and severity of exposure to the chemical hazard. Management controls do
not eliminate or reduce the chemical hazard, itself, but only the exposure to the chemical hazard.
The use of PPE is probably the most common management control strategy, and in many cases is
a mandatory requirement when working with hazardous chemicals. The worker uses protective
equipment to set up a barrier between worker and hazard. Once again, the chemical hazard is
neither eliminated nor reduced, and a high reliance is placed on appropriate use of PPE for this
strategy to be successful. The primary focus of these kind of control strategies is to incorporate
safer work practices through written safety policies, rules, supervision and training.
CONTAINER LABELING
INTRODUCTION
 46                                                AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


Container labeling can be a very effective method to communicate the physical and health
hazards of chemicals used in the workplace. The information on a container label will vary
depending on what type of container it is and how it is used. We'll discuss the various labeling
requirements in this module.
In-plant containers of hazardous chemicals must be labeled, tagged, or marked with the identity
of the material and appropriate hazard warnings. Chemical manufacturers, importers, and
distributors are required to ensure that every container of hazardous chemicals they ship is
appropriately labeled with such information and with the name and address of the producer or
other responsible party. Personnel purchasing chemicals can rely on the labels provided by their
suppliers. If the material is subsequently transferred by the employer from a labeled container to
another container, the employer will have to label that container unless it is subject to the
portable container exemption described below.
We'll take a look at the labeling requirements for each of the four types of containers referred to
in the hazard communication standard:

      Primary (also called original containers)
      Secondary (also called unlabeled containers)
      Stationary containers
      Portable containers

Primary (Manufacturer) container labeling

                                  Most containers you receive directly from the manufacturer or
                                  purchase from a distributor are called primary containers. The
                                  chemical manufacturer, importer, or distributor must ensure that
                                  each container of hazardous chemicals leaving the workplace is
                                  labeled, tagged or marked with three elements of information:

                                         Identity of the hazardous chemical(s);
                                         Appropriate hazard warnings, including target organ
                                          effects of the hazardous chemical; and
                                         Name and address of the chemical manufacturer,
                                          importer, or other responsible party.


Labeling with the above information on these containers is usually adequate in communicating
the hazards of the chemical.

The label is intended to be an immediate visual reminder of the hazards of a chemical. It is not
necessary, however, that every hazard presented by a chemical be listed on the label. The
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is used for this purpose. Manufacturers, importers, and
distributors will have to assess the evidence regarding the product's hazards and must consider
exposures under normal conditions of use or in foreseeable emergencies when evaluating what
hazards are listed on the label. This is not to say that only acute hazards are to be listed on the
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                              47


label, or that well-substantiated hazards should be left off the label because they appear on the
data sheet.
It's important to understand that the hazard warning must convey the particular physical and
health hazards of the chemical, including target organ effects. Employees exposed to health
hazards must be apprised of both changes in body functions and the signs and symptoms that
may occur to signal those changes. Statements such as "Hazardous if Inhaled," "Caution,"
"Danger," are precautionary statements and are not to be considered appropriate hazard warnings.
If, when inhaled, a chemical causes lung damage, then the appropriate warning is "lung damage,"
not inhalation.
A label may not be shipped separately, even prior to shipment of the hazardous chemical, since
to do so defeats the purpose of providing an immediate hazard warning. Mailing labels directly
to purchasers by-passes employees involved in transporting and handling the hazardous chemical.
Labeling solid materials
Remember, in an early module we said the hazardous chemicals under the HAZCOM program
include solids. For solid metal (such as a steel beam or a metal casting), solid wood, or plastic
items that are not exempted as articles due to their downstream use, or shipments of whole grain,
the required label may be transmitted to the customer at the time of the initial shipment, and need
not be included with subsequent shipments to the same employer unless the information on the
label changes.
The label may be transmitted with the initial shipment itself, or with the material safety data
sheet that is to be provided prior to or at the time of the first shipment. This exception to
requiring labels on every container of hazardous chemicals is only for the solid material itself,
and does not apply to hazardous chemicals used in conjunction with, or known to be present with,
the material and to which employees handling the items in transit may be exposed (for example,
cutting fluids or pesticides in grains). For example, treated lumber is covered since the lumber is
not completely cured at the time of shipment and the hazardous chemical will, to a varying
degree, off gas during shipment and be available for exposure to employees.


Secondary (Employer) container labeling

Most workplaces use the primary containers they purchase to store and
use chemicals. However, they also use their own containers such as
coffee pots, drums, plastic jugs, and spray bottles to store and use
smaller quantities of chemicals they purchase. In this course, we use the
term "secondary" container to distinguish it from the manufacturer's
primary container. These containers may also be called employer
containers.
Generally, shop supervisors must make sure that each secondary container of hazardous
chemicals in the workplace is labeled, tagged or marked with at least the following information:
      Identity of the hazardous chemical(s) contained therein; and,
      Appropriate hazard warnings, or words, pictures, and/or symbols which provide at least
       general information regarding the hazards of the chemicals, and which, in conjunction
 48                                               AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


       with the other information (an MSDS) will provide employees with the specific
       information regarding the physical and health hazards of the hazardous chemical.

The chemical identity may be common or trade name (“Black Magic Formula”), or a chemical
name (1,1,1,-trichloroethane). The hazard warning is a brief statement of the hazardous effects
of the chemical (“flammable,” “causes lung damage”). Labels frequently contain other
information, such as precautionary measures (“do not use near open flame”), but this information
is provided voluntarily and is not required by the rule. Labels must be legible, and prominently
displayed. There are no specific requirements for size or color, or any specified text.


                                    Alternative labeling methods

                                    Here's an example of an alternative labeling system designed
                                    by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) that
                                    uses color, numbers and other information to convey the
                                    hazards of the chemical. More information.

The hazard communication standard recognizes the use of alternative shop labeling systems such
as the HMIS (Hazardous Materials Information System), NFPA, and others which may be used
in industry. These systems rely on numerical and/or alphabetic codes to convey hazards and are
generally non-specific. OSHA has permitted these types of in-plant labeling systems to be used
when an employer's overall HCS program is proven to be effective despite the potential absence
of target organ information on container labels. Under these circumstances, the employer should
assure - through more intensified training - that its employees are fully aware of the hazards of
the chemicals used. Additionally, employers must ensure that their training program instructs
employees on how to use and understand the alternative labeling systems so that employees are
aware of the effects (including target organ effects) of the hazardous chemicals to which they are
potentially exposed.
Employers using alternative labeling systems must ensure that their employees are aware of all
information required to be conveyed under the HCS. ESOH personnel will make a shop-specific
determination of the effectiveness of the complete program when an inspection is conducted.
Any employer who relies on one of these types of alternative labeling systems, instead of using
labels containing complete health effects information will - in any enforcement action alleging
the inadequacy of the labeling system - bear the burden of establishing that it has achieved a
level of employee awareness which equals or exceeds that which would have been achieved if
the employer had used labels containing complete health effects information.
The key to evaluating the effectiveness of any alternative labeling method is to determine
whether employees can correlate the visual warning on the in-plant container with the applicable
chemical and its appropriate hazard warnings. The alternative labeling system must also be
readily accessible to all employees in their work area throughout each work shift. For purposes
of this provision, the term "other such written materials" does not include material safety data
sheets used in lieu of labels.
Stationary process container labeling
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                                49




                         Stationary process containers are...well...stationary! Storage tanks are
                         good examples. The employer may use signs, placards, process sheets,
                         batch tickets, operating procedures, or other written materials in lieu of
                         affixing labels to individual stationary process containers, as long as the
                         alternative method identifies the containers to which it is applicable and
                         conveys the information required on secondary containers. The written
                         materials must be readily accessible to the employees in their work area
                         throughout each work shift.




Portable container labeling

Portable containers are used to transfer hazardous chemicals from labeled
containers, and are intended only for the immediate use of the employee
who performs the transfer. The employer is not required to label portable
containers under OSHA regulations. However, portable containers used
on Luke AFB will be labeled as permanent containers. For purposes of
this section, drugs which are dispensed by a pharmacy to a health care
provider for direct administration to a patient are exempted from
labeling.




Other important labeling requirements

Labels are useless unless they accurately communicate the hazards of their associated chemicals.
It's important to keep labels in good condition at all times. The employer must not remove or
deface existing labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals, unless the container is
immediately marked with the required information.
The employer must ensure that labels or other forms of warning are:
      legible, in English,
      prominently displayed on the container, or
      readily available in the work area throughout each work shift
Employers having employees who speak other languages may add the information in their
language to the material presented, as long as the information is presented in English as well.
MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS (MSDS)

INTRODUCTION

The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is used to communicate chemical hazard information
from the manufacturer to the employee. This is the information needed to inform and train
employees on the safe use of hazardous chemicals. The employer is required to have an MSDS
for each hazardous chemical product they use. This module will examine the MSDS and the
requirements for maintaining an effective MSDS system. So, let's get going.

Who must have them?

      Chemical manufacturers and importers must obtain or develop a material safety data
       sheet for each hazardous chemical they produce or import.
      Shop supervisor must have a material safety data sheet in the workplace for each
       hazardous chemical which they use.

The MSDS form

Let's take a look at the MSDS form, itself. Some of the terms in each section link to additional
information. You can check out the glossary for general information on terms you may not be
familiar with. I'll detail important points related to each MSDS section and then show you an
example that illustrates those points. So, let's start the review.

Each material safety data sheet must be in English (although the employer may maintain copies
in other languages as well), and must contain at least the following information:

The name, address and telephone number of the chemical manufacturer, importer, employer or
other responsible party preparing or distributing the material safety data sheet, who can provide
additional information on the hazardous chemical and appropriate emergency procedures, if
necessary.

The English language requirement was included to prevent importers of chemicals from
supplying MSDSs in a foreign language. This requirement, however, does not prevent a
chemical manufacturer/employer from translating MSDSs from English into foreign languages,
in order to assist non-English speaking employees with training comprehension and hazard
recognition.

                           HEALTH EFFECTS AND FIRST AID
INHALATION:

      ACUTE EXPOSURE - Dust may cause mild respiratory irritation with sore throat and
       coughing.
      CHRONIC EXPOSURE - No data available.
      FIRST AID - Remove from exposure area to fresh air immediately. If breathing has
       stopped, perform artificial respiration. Keep person warm and at rest. Treat
       symptomatically and supportively. Get medical attention immediately.

SKIN CONTACT:

      ACUTE EXPOSURE - Dust and liquid may cause mild irritation and redness.
       Concentrations up to 0.2%, may elicit an immediate skin reaction varying from erythema
       to a non-immunologic contact urticaria in some persons.
      CHRONIC EXPOSURE - Repeated application to human skin produced moderate
       irritation.
      FIRST AID - Remove contaminated clothing and shoes immediately. Wash affected area
       with soap or mild detergent and large amounts of water until no evidence of chemical
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                               55



       remains (approximately 15-20 minutes). Get medical attention immediately.


EYE CONTACT:IRRITANT.

      ACUTE EXPOSURE- Dust may cause strong irritation and redness.
      CHRONIC EXPOSURE- Repeated or prolonged contact with irritants may cause
       conjunctivitis.

   FIRST AID - Wash eyes immediately with large amounts of water or normal saline,
occasionally lifting upper and lower lids, until no evidence of chemical remains (approximately
15-20 minutes). Get medical attention immediately.


INGESTION:

      ACUTE EXPOSURE - Large doses may cause sore throat, gastric pain, nausea,
       vomiting, and possible allergic reactions. A 67 kg man ingested 50 gm without ill effects.
      CHRONIC EXPOSURE - A daily intake of 4-6 grams produced no toxic effects outside
       of gastric irritation. Larger doses may have systemic effects similar to salicylates and
       may include disturbances in acid base balance, tremor and convulsions.
      FIRST AID - Treat symptomatically and supportively. Get medical attention
       immediately. If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to prevent aspiration.

ANTIDOTE: No specific antidote. Treat symptomatically and supportively.




      Any generally applicable precautions for safe handling and use which are known to the
       chemical manufacturer, importer or employer preparing the material safety data sheet,

If no relevant information is found for any given category on the material safety data sheet, the
chemical manufacturer, importer or employer preparing the material safety data sheet must mark
it to indicate that no applicable information was found.

MSDS Management

Here are some more important requirements manufacturers, importers and distributors must
meet:

The manufacturer or importer must:

      Prepare one MSDS that applies to all similar mixtures where complex mixtures have
       similar hazards and contents (i.e. the chemical ingredients are essentially the same, but
       the specific composition varies from mixture to mixture),
      When preparing the material safety data sheet, ensure that the information recorded
       accurately reflects the scientific evidence used in making the hazard determination.
      When aware of any significant new information regarding the hazards of a chemical, or
       ways to protect against the hazards, this new information, add it to the material safety
       data sheet within three months.
      If the chemical is not currently being produced or imported, add any new information to
       the material safety data sheet before the chemical is introduced into the workplace again.
      Provide an appropriate material safety data sheet with the initial shipment, with the first
       shipment after a material safety data sheet is updated, and as requested by the employer
       or distributor;
      Provide material safety data sheets with the shipped containers or send them to the
       distributor or employer prior to or at the time of the shipment;

Distributors must:
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                                59


      Ensure that material safety data sheets, and updated information, are provided to other
       distributors and employers with their initial shipment and with the first shipment after a
       material safety data sheet is updated;
      Either provide material safety data sheets with the shipped containers, or send them to the
       other distributor or employer prior to or at the time of the shipment;
      Retail distributor selling hazardous chemicals to employers having a commercial account
       -- provide a material safety data sheet to such employers upon request, and must post a
       sign or otherwise inform them that a material safety data sheet is available. If an
       employer without a commercial account purchases a hazardous chemical from a retail
       distributor not required to have material safety data sheets on file (i.e., the retail
       distributor does not have commercial accounts and does not use the materials), the retail
       distributor must provide the employer, upon request, with the name, address, and
       telephone number of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or distributor from which a
       material safety data sheet can be obtained. Chemical manufacturers, importers, and
       distributors need not provide material safety data sheets to retail distributors that have
       informed them that the retail distributor does not sell the product to commercial accounts
       or open the sealed container to use it in their own workplaces.
      Wholesale distributor selling hazardous chemicals to employers over-the-counter --
       provide material safety data sheets upon the request of the employer at the time of the
       over-the-counter purchase, and post a sign or otherwise inform such employers that a
       material safety data sheet is available.
      Distributors and employers who in good faith choose to rely upon the MSDSs provided to
       them by the chemical manufacturer/importer assume no responsibility for the content and
       accuracy of the MSDSs.

What about employer responsibilities?

Employers/shop supervisors must obtain a MSDS from the chemical manufacturer or importer as
soon as possible if the material safety data sheet is not provided with a shipment that has been
labeled as a hazardous chemical.

Shop supervisors must maintain in the workplace copies of the required material safety data
sheets for each hazardous chemical, and must ensure that they are readily accessible during each
work shift to employees when they are in their work area(s). (Electronic access, microfiche, and
other alternatives to maintaining paper copies of the material safety data sheets are permitted as
long as no barriers to immediate employee access in each workplace are created by such
options.)

Where employees must travel between workplaces during a workshift, i.e., their work is carried
out at more than one geographical location, the material safety data sheets may be kept at the
primary workplace facility. In this situation, the employer must ensure that employees can
immediately obtain the required information in an emergency.

Employees who work at more than one site during the work shift must be able to obtain MSDS
information immediately in an emergency. MSDSs may be kept at the primary workplace
facility, as long as the employer has a representative available at all times to ensure ready access
 60                                               AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


to this information. This is the only situation in which an employer is allowed to transmit hazard
information via voice communication. The employer must address in the written hazard
communication program how MSDS information will be conveyed to remote worksites.


Material safety data sheets may be kept in any form, including
operating procedures, and may be designed to cover groups of
hazardous chemicals in a work area where it may be more appropriate
to address the hazards of a process rather than individual hazardous
chemicals.




However, the shop supervisors must ensure that in all cases the required information is provided
for each hazardous chemical, and is readily accessible during each work shift to employees when
they are in in their work area(s). Usually, MSDSs will be kept at the "Right to Know" station in
a centralized location where most of the work is being accomplished. Along with the MSDSs,
there must be a list of chemicals with an effective reference system to help the employee quickly
locate a specific MSDS.

HAZCOM INFORMATION AND TRAINING

INTRODUCTION

Education is the beginning point for developing and maintaining a world-class HAZCOM
program. This module focuses on communicating information about training employees how to
work safely while being exposed to chemical hazards. This module also discusses basic
employer responsibilities for effectively communicating the HAZCOM to employees.


                             The "Prime Directive"

                             shop supervisors must provide employees with information and
                             training on hazardous chemicals in their work area at the time of
                             their initial assignment, and whenever a new physical or health
                             hazard employees have not previously been trained on is
                             introduced into their work area. Information and training may be
                             designed to cover categories of hazards (e.g., flammability,
                             carcinogenicity) or specific chemicals. Chemical-specific
                             information must always be available through labels and material
                             safety data sheets.


Information
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                              61


Employees must be informed of:

      The requirements of the hazard communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200 and AFI
       90-821)
      Any operations in their work area where hazardous chemicals are present, and
      The location and availability of the written hazard communication program,
       including the required list(s) of hazardous chemicals, and material safety data sheets
       required by this section.

Training

Employee training must include at least:

      Methods and observations that may be used to detect the presence or release of a
       hazardous chemical in the work area (such as monitoring conducted by the employer,
       continuous monitoring devices, visual appearance or odor of hazardous chemicals when
       being released, etc.);
      The physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the work area;
       Training need not be conducted on each specific chemical found in the workplace, but
       may be conducted by categories of hazard (e.g., carcinogens, sensitizers, acutely toxic
       agents) that are or may be encountered by an employee during the course of his duties.
      The measures employees can take to protect themselves from these hazards, including
       specific procedures the employer has implemented to protect employees from exposure to
       hazardous chemicals, such as appropriate work practices, emergency procedures, and
       personal protective equipment to be used;
      The details of the hazard communication program developed by the employer,
       including an explanation of the labeling system and the material safety data sheet, and
       how employees can obtain and use the appropriate hazard information.

According to the above, a shop supervisors has a responsibility to evaluate an employee's level
of knowledge with regard to the hazards in the workplace, their familiarity with the requirements
of the standard, and the hazard communication program.

When do you train HAZCOM?

It's important to understand that employees must be trained at the time they are assigned to work
with a hazardous chemical. The intent of this provision is to have information prior to exposure
to prevent the occurrence of adverse health effects. Of course, this intent cannot be met if
training is delayed until a later date.

Also, training requirements are not satisfied solely by giving employees the MSDS to read. An
employer's training program is to be a forum for explaining the who, what, where, why and when
(the education) to employees of the the hazards of the chemicals in their work area, but also how
(the training) to work safely using safe procedures as required by the hazard communication
program. This can be accomplished in many ways, including:
 62                                               AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


      Classroom instruction
      Interactive video
      Hands-on demonstration


Of the methods listed, hands-on demonstration training is preferred
because the evaluation of knowledge and skills is inherent in the training
process. Regardless of the training method, all employees should have an
opportunity to ask questions to ensure that they understand the information
presented to them. Furthermore, the training must be comprehensible. If
employees receive job instructions in a language other than English, then
the HAZCOM training and information will also need to be conducted in
that foreign language.


And, here's a subtle, but important point to remember: Additional training is to be done
whenever a new physical or health hazard is introduced into the work area, not a new chemical.
Here's a couple of examples that help to understand this requirement:

Example 1. If a new solvent is brought into the workplace, and it has hazards similar to existing
chemicals for which training has already been conducted, then no new training is required.
However, as with initial training, and in keeping with the intent of the standard, the employer
must:

      make employees specifically aware which hazard category (i.e., corrosive, irritant, etc.)
       the solvent falls within.
      make the substance-specific data sheet available, and
      properly label the new product.

Example 2. If the newly introduced solvent is a suspect carcinogen, and there has never been a
carcinogenic hazard in the workplace before, then new training for carcinogenic hazards must be
conducted for employees in those work areas where employees will be exposed.


What about retraining new hires?

It is not necessary that the employer retrain each new hire if that
employee has received prior training by a past employer, an
employee union, or any other entity. General information, such as
the rudiments of the HCS could be expected to remain with an
employee from one position to another. The employer, however,
maintains the responsibility and is held accountable to ensure
that their employees are adequately trained and are equipped with
the knowledge and information necessary to conduct their jobs
safely.
AFI90-821_LUKEAFBSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                                    63


Remember, it is likely that additional training will be needed since employees must know the
specifics of their new employers' programs such as where the MSDSs are located, details of the
employer's shop labeling system, and the hazards of new chemicals to which they will be
exposed.


                         Training at multi-employer worksites

                         The training requirements also apply if the employer becomes aware via
                         the multi-employer worksite provision of exposures of his/her
                         employees to hazards for which they have not been previously trained.




Training temporary employees

Training temporary employees is a responsibility that is shared between the temporary agency
and the host employer.

      The host-employer holds the primary responsibility for training since the host employer
       uses or produces chemicals, creates and controls the hazards, and is, therefore, best suited
       to inform employees of the chemical hazards specific to the workplace environment.
      The temporary agency, in turn, maintains a continuing relationship with its employees,
       and would be, at a minimum, expected to inform employees of the requirements of the
       standard.

Contracts between the temporary agency and the host-employer should be examined to
determine if they clearly set out the training responsibilities of both parties, in order to ensure
that the employers have complied with all requirements of the regulation.

How extensive should training be?

A frequently overlooked portion of the training provisions is that dealing with emergency
procedures. Training is expected to be proportional to the hazards of the workplace. If a
chemical is very hazardous, more information would be expected to be provided on the MSDS.
Therefore, the training for emergency procedures, including information about the characteristics
of the chemical and precautions to be taken, would need to be more extensive.

                          In situations where employees are expected to moderate or control the
                          impact of the emergency in a manner similar to an emergency
                          responder, training under 1910.120 would be required. Employers who
                          fall under the scope of HAZWOPER must have either a written
                          emergency response plan or an emergency action plan. If employers
                          expect their own employees to respond to a potential emergency
                          involving a hazardous substance, then the employer must create an
                          emergency response plan and the employees must be trained to perform
                          the duties expected.



HAZWOPER does not cover response to incidental spills that do not have the potential for
becoming an emergency. Training for responding to such incidental spills would be under the
hazard communication standard and would include, at a minimum, leak and spill cleanup
procedures and the use of appropriate PPE.
