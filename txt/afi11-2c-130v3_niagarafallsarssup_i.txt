                                            Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618 Air Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center) (618 AOC
(TACC)), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air and
Space Operations Centers (AOCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Command Center, Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) Command Center, theater Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC),
Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air
Missions Division, Office of Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (CVAM), Unit Command
Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG),
Contingency Response Elements (CRE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are
action agents for the MAF commander with execution authority (operational control) over
mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The pilot in
command will execute missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last
known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to MAJCOM instruction, for procedures and
   requirements. (E.g. AMCI 11-208 for AMC aircraft)
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/A3OO) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
       2.2.1.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Local Missions. Operational control is held
       by the respective 914th or 107th OG/CC and delegated through the respective 328th or
       136th AS Operations Supervisor for daily mission accomplishment.
       2.2.1.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. ANG/AMC Missions.
       Execution authority (OPCON) is held by the appropriate agency (ANG Readiness Center,
       TACC, etc.). Crews will contact them with any mission related issues. Crews will contact
       107th AW/OG or designated representative regarding issues or changes to the TDY. All
       contact information will be located in the mission binders.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights,
on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. An unqualified pilot may not be designated as PIC. A non-mission ready (NMR)
pilot may be designated as PIC, provided the delinquent events causing the NMR are not
performed on that flight (or the portion of that flight for which the NMR pilot is designated as
PIC).PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC‘s judgment, an emergency
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                25


   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, transition
   training) after obtaining approval from the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC‘s behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required due to insufficient fuel or enroute or terminal weather
   conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, enroute, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/Airfield Suitability and
   Restrictions Report (ASRR), is suitable. The agent will also consult DOD 4500.54G, the
   Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) on SIPR and consult the Threat Working Group (TWG). If
   the alternate becomes unsuitable while enroute, coordinate with the C2 agent for other
   suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent
   will alert customs and all appropriate ground service agencies to prepare for arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations Without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data (arrival, departure, and
   advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency by any means available (preference in the
   following order: DSN, HF, Iridium Phone, and Combat Track II (CTII)). For critical C2
   communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications
   are the primary method.
   2.5.3. Enroute Reporting.
26                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


     2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency, as
     required:
         2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
         2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3, 4 or 5.
         2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 45min prior to landing,
         to update arrival time and provide AF Form 3858, Aeromedical Evacuation Mission
         Offload Message information.
         2.5.3.1.4. Uncoordinated aircraft interceptions via the most expeditious means
         available, after complying with guidance in the flight information handbook. When
         an airborne report is not accomplished, PICs must directly notify 618 AOC (TACC)
         upon landing. In all cases ensure local C2 and Intel agencies are informed.
     2.5.3.2. Continental Unites States (CONUS). Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions
     are not required; however, the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting
     requirements.
     2.5.3.3. Outside Continental Unites States (OCONUS). MAJCOM C2 agencies will
     specify increased reporting procedures through a communications plan in the OPLAN,
     OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in
     accordance with the communications plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (HF-
     Automatic Link Establishment (HF-ALE), CTII).
  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible.
  Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. ―Thirty Minute‖ Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
  C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
  (ETB).
  2.5.6. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties, the flight managers
  (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aircrews. The PIC must contact their Flight Manager prior to
  each IFM sortie. For critical C2 communications, voice communications are the primary
  method. EXCEPTION: For AFRC/ANG missions using IFM, AFRC/ANG will provide C2.
     2.5.6.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase ―Pass to Hilda‖ to ATC position
     reports. Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in the aircrew flimsy for C2
     phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after exhausting normal
     communication methods.
  2.5.7. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of access to the
  worldwide C2 network.
  2.5.8. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
  transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
  2.5.9. Iridium Phone. Iridium phones may be used for communications between aircrews
  and command and control agencies when beyond-line of sight C2 is required and other line
  of sight communications, HF or SAT-2000 do not provide proper security or timeliness. For
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            27


   more information, refer to AMC Iridium Satellite Phone CONOPS for Aircrews,
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a33/A33O/.
      2.5.9.1. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
      2.5.9.2. Turn off Iridium phones during takeoff, approach, and landing.
   2.5.10. Combat Track II. CTII provides two-way, beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS), secure
   communication text messaging between multiple ground and airborne nodes. It also provides
   in-flight following via automatic Global Position System (GPS) position reports displayed on
   standard digital navigation charts, when installed on the aircraft.
      2.5.10.1. Employment. The aircraft equipment will be turned on during preflight/engine
      start and remain configured to transmit and receive at all times until aircraft power down
      upon mission completion.
      2.5.10.2. Home Station. CTII units at home station are intended for training use only.
      Unless specifically designated by the C2 agency do not deploy with home station
      equipment.
      2.5.10.3. Operational Missions. For operational missions, CTII will be provided at stage
      locations or deployed locations for missions requiring the capability. Every effort should
      be made to return the equipment to the stage location. Equipment stationed at a deployed
      location stays at that location as units rotate through.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to
   perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should appoint a MC for
   special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate
   any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24
   hours prior to mission execution.
      2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
      designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an airdrop, or
      tactical airland operation. For AMC-tasked missions the planning agency is 618 AOC
      (TACC). For theater airlift missions with more than one airlift unit involved, the theater
      AOC shall designate a central planning agency responsible for coordinating the entire
      mission with all involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead planning agency will
      designate an MC. The MC will be a rated (normally field grade) officer qualified in the
      type mission.
      2.6.1.2. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
      2.6.1.3. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
      will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
      rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures. The MC will provide controlling
      agency and all non-collocated PICs anticipated delays or mission changes.

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.1. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR)107 AW only. The 107th Niagara Falls local area is defined as a
350nm radius from the Niagara Falls ARS. This radius is only applicable to the CONUS.
Aircrews wishing to exceed the 350nm radius need prior approval from the 107th OG/CC. This
information is located on a Memorandum for Record signed by the 107th OG/CC and can be
found in the 107th OGV Administration procedures binder in the 107th Standardization and
Evaluations office.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1 below
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types. EXCEPTION: Crew
complement for specialized missions (e.g. Aerial Spray, Ski, and MAFFS) is addressed in the
Addendas covering those missions
3.2. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR)NOTE (2)                    Missions without a Navigator. Navigators are
desired, but not required to fly on local proficiency flights to designated training bases. However,
consideration should be given to en-route and destination weather when determining the
requirement to operate without a Navigator. 107th AW only: The Aircraft Commander may
request permission from the OG/CC to accomplish transition work at any other airport within the
107th Niagara Falls local training area, without a Navigator provided no full stop landings with
engine shutdown are planned.
   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for a local training flight is an aircraft
   commander, MPD pilot/copilot, flight engineer, and loadmaster. When a mission requires
   more than one aircrew member at a position, the SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor
   and NMR crewmember meet mission requirements.
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
   basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
   (MR) IAW AFI 11-2C-130V1, C-130 Aircrew Training. EXCEPTION: A NMR
   crewmember may augment provided the event(s) they are NMR in are not going to be
   performed on that flight. SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the full FDP. The
   MAJCOM/A3/DO may augment aircrews while the flight is underway. (see paragraph
   3.11, Aircrew Management, for more on CDT/FDP.)

 Notes:
 (1) The PIC maintains ultimate responsibility of overall conduct of the mission.
 However, qualified aircrew in the seats when the PIC is not at the controls maintain
 responsibility for the actions they take. Transfer of pilot-in-command duties
 between qualified ACs will be briefed to the crew.
 (2) Sq/CCs may authorize training/FCF/OCF flights without a navigator when not
 required for mission accomplishment. Units will establish procedures regarding the
 use of navigators on proficiency trainers. Formal Training Units (FTUs) will
 establish procedures regarding the use of navigators on all training missions.
- Navigators are required for training mission conducted below 3000 ft AGL outside
  of radar control.
- Navigators are not required when conducting Day/Night (unaided) LZ operations in
  the local area.
 (3) Two loadmasters may be required, at the unit commander‘s discretion,
 depending on mission complexity.
 (4) Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another qualified crewmember are
 required if more than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried (except during unit
 moves or contingencies). Both crewmembers must remain in the cargo
 compartment, one forward and one aft for takeoffs and landings, or as required by
 the tactical situation.
 (5) Only one loadmaster is required for tactical missions (up to 13,999 feet MSL)
 if:
- Using only one paratroop door for personnel or door bundle drops (less than 100
  lbs);
- Non-static line personnel are dropped from the ramp and door;
- Dropping only simulated airdrop training bundles (SATBs);
- A no-drop (dry pass) is planned and ground time is sufficient to permit on-load or
  offload by one loadmaster
- Dropping a single CDS container unilaterally using manual gate cut procedures

  3.2.3. An additional flight engineer or scanner may be used for basic or augmented crews in
  those units without loadmaster Unit Manning Document (UMD) authorizations, provided no
  more than 30 passengers are carried or cargo exceeds 500-lbs (100-lbs maximum per single
  item) or requires special handling in accordance with AFMAN 24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP
  PUB 505/MCO P4030.19I/DLAI 4145.3, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air
  Shipments, 1 Septebmer 2009. ANG/AFRC units may use an additional flight engineer
  provided these provisions are met.
  3.2.4. Tactical Airlift Formation Lead Requirements.
     3.2.4.1. Definitions:
         3.2.4.1.1. Flight Lead crew: consists of a pilot and navigator who are either flight
         lead qualified or are receiving lead upgrade training from an instructor of like crew
         position. Can accomplish mission commander duties and can lead 2 or more aircraft.
         3.2.4.1.2. Element Lead crew: consists of a pilot and navigator who are either
         element lead qualified or are receiving element lead upgrade training from an
         instructor of like crew position. Can lead a 2-ship or perform element lead duties in a
         multiple element formation.
         3.2.4.1.3. Deputy Lead crew: a flight lead crew that is ready to assume formation
         lead duties if the formation lead aborts. A deputy lead is required for formations
         greater than 4 aircraft. Deputy lead may fly as the number 2 aircraft in the first
         element or may fly as second element lead as long as no other aircraft occupies the
         number 2 position. EXCEPTION: IMC airdrops consisting of 3 or more aircraft
         always require a deputy lead AWADS crew.
         3.2.4.1.4. AWADS crew: consists of a pilot and navigator who are either AWADS
         qualified or are receiving AWADS upgrade training from an instructor of like crew
         position.
         3.2.4.1.5. An Element consists of 2 aircraft. A Flight consists of 3 or 4 aircraft.
     3.2.4.2. Unilateral training Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) - no special
     requirements.
     3.2.4.3. Unilateral training IMC.
         3.2.4.3.1. Single-element formations. An element lead crew is required or one
         instructor pilot is required in the formation (any position). For IMC airdrops, an
         AWADS crew is required in the formation lead position.
         3.2.4.3.2. Multiple-element formation. A flight lead crew or instructor pilot is
         required in the formation lead and deputy lead (if required) positions and in each
         flight lead position. Element lead positions require a flight lead crew, element lead
         crew or instructor pilot. If deputy lead or an element lead aborts after station time,
         any crew can assume their position with the concurrence of the mission commander.
         Any crew can fly the last ship of a formation even if it is a deputy lead or element
         lead position. For IMC airdrops, the deputy lead crew and every crew in a flight lead
 32                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


           position must also be an AWADS crew. EXCEPTION: Multiple-element formation
           consisting of two aircraft (one in the flight lead and one in the element lead positions)
           may use single-element formation crew complement criteria specified in paragraph
           3.2.4.3.1.
       3.2.4.4. Other than unilateral (IMC and VMC). A flight lead crew is required in the
       formation lead and deputy lead positions (single element formations only require an
       element lead crew). Element lead positions require a flight lead or element lead crew.
       Any crew can fly the last ship of a formation even if it is a deputy or element lead
       position. For IMC airdrops, every flight lead required crew must also be an AWADS
       crew.
   3.2.5. NVG Aircrew Complements. An NVG crew will consist of an NVG certified
   crewmember in each of the primary crew positions (a crewmember in upgrade supervised by
   a qualified instructor meets this requirement). However, the pilots, navigator, and engineer
   may use NVGs even if the loadmaster is not NVG certified. Loadmasters may use NVGs
   even if the pilots, navigator, or engineer are not NVG certified.
   3.2.6. Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) Aircrew Complement. JPADS/I-CDS crews
   consist of JPADS XL certified basic airdrop crew and a PADS Operator (PO). Navigators
   can serve as a primary crew member and PO on C-130E/H aircraft. The PO does not have to
   be MDS qualified but must be a rated airdrop qualified officer. It is essential the PO receive a
   thorough briefing prior to performing duties on aircraft other than their primary MDS.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification
training, to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Officer Course (restricted AF Form 8,
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or Senior Officer Familiarization (no AF Form 8) may
   occupy a primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI 11-
   401 for procedures and requirements governing senior leader flying.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Officer Course will log ―FP/FN‖ for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Officer Familiarization will log ―OP/ON‖ for
   Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781. Refer to AFI 11-401 for passenger
   restrictions.
3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining
currency or qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall augment the PIC for missions over 16 hours FDP and designate those
   additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The PIC shall brief the aircrew on the
   plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.2. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF Form
   8) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board.
       3.4.2.1. A non-current but qualified pilot under direct IP supervision may fly with
       passengers on board.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             33


       3.4.2.2. See paragraph 9.1.3 for additional training restrictions.
   3.4.3. An AWADS or IMC airdrop qualified AC will be in the seat during IMC personnel
   airdrops.
   3.4.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) An Instructor Pilot is required in the right seat
   anytime an MPD pilot occupies the left seat.
3.5. Navigators. SQ/CCs or deployed MCs may generate aircrews without a navigator when
weather, enroute navigation (RNAV) capability, or mission requirements allow. SQ/CC may
include two navigators on aircrews assigned to complex missions. A non-current or unqualified
navigator may serve as a primary aircrew member on any mission when supervised by a
qualified instructor.   The SQ/CC or MC will publish procedures for navigators to
enplane/deplane on proficiency trainers.
   3.5.1. An AWADS or IMC airdrop qualified navigator will be in the seat during IMC
   personnel airdrops.
   3.5.2. Grid Navigator Requirement. SQ/CC shall include a grid-qualified navigator on
   aircrews tasked to fly north of 65°N latitude, south of 70°S latitude, or in airspace where
   FLIP enroute charts indicate compass indications may be erratic or depict airways, tracks, or
   navigational aids as oriented to true or grid north (i.e. Canadian Northern Airspace).
   EXCEPTIONS: 1) Flights within Alaskan airspace; 2) Flights on published airways using
   magnetic references (destination and alternates must have published magnetic instrument
   approaches) 3) Aircraft equipped with two or more operable independent navigational
   systems.
3.6. Flight Engineers, and Loadmasters. A non-current or unqualified flight engineer or
loadmaster may serve as a primary aircrew member on any mission when supervised by a
qualified instructor.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and enroute C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once
   enroute, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
   Reduce FDP when the autopilot fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot
   fails after departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best course of action to
   preclude further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include
   diverting to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and
   comply with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
       when the autopilot is inoperative). All tactical events will be accomplished within the
       first 12 hours of the FDP. Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO
       may extend to augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO
       shall augment basic crew to extend FDP).
          3.7.1.1.1. When extended enroute ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
          weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
34                    AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


        augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
        long as:
            3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
            the first takeoff of the day.
            3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
            rest enroute.
            3.7.1.1.1.3. FDP may be further limited for crews in Individual Protective
            Equipment (IPE) such as the Aircrew Chemical Biological, Radiological, Nuclear
            (ACBRN) due to heightened ORM concerns. Aircrews members in IPE may
            experience a degradation in flight duty performance due to increased fatigue and
            restrictions in situational awareness. Aircraft commanders must work closely
            with command and control personnel to ensure appropriate CDT and FDP are
            established when mission segments require IPE.See Chapter 10 for additional
            guidance.
        3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
        authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
        mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned enroute
        delays. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to exercise this option.
     3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 18 hours
     (16 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). All transition or tactical events will be
     accomplished within the first 12 hours of the FDP. SQ/CC need only augment the pilot
     portion of the aircrew when the autopilot is inoperative.
     3.7.1.3. Maximum FDP for nuclear airlift missions is IAW AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift
     Operations.
     3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.5. Training, Tactical, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), and
     Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs) FDP:
        3.7.1.5.1. Maximum FDP for training, tactical, and FCF/ACF missions is 16 hours
        (12 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
        3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
        events, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. ANG and AFRC crews may perform all mission-related events on
            local training missions provided their time from start of Crew Duty Time
            (CDT)/FDP does not exceed 16 hours.
               3.7.1.5.2.1.1. CDT and FDP include both military duty and civilian work.
               CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first duty period
               (military or civilian).
        3.7.1.5.3. Crews may fly/deposition to home station or a deployed staging base
        following training (do not exceed 12 hours when the autopilot is inoperative).
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                         35


   3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
   combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
   mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
   duties for other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
   Maximum CDT is 18+00 hours for a basic aircrew and 20+00 hours for an augmented
   aircrew.
   3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
   SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
   flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
   member early. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
      3.7.3.1. Crews may self-alert with C2 concurrence prior to entering crew rest. The PIC
      must coordinate approval for the self-alert time before entering crew rest. Begin
      CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
          3.7.3.1.1. C2 approval authority is 618 AOC (TACC) for AMC and AMC-gained
          missions.
      3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) Time. IAW AFI 11-401, MAF aircrew members
   may travel as MEP (not required for the mission being flown but required for follow-on
   missions). MEP will not be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not
   accrue OFDA credit. Crewmembers may travel as MEP for a maximum of 24 hours.
   OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to travel as MEP in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      traveling in MEP status, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at time of
      first official duty or report time for flight in MEP status).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may travel in MEP status after performing primary crew
      duties, for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day
   begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Following use,
   crewmember will be considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon.
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program. (See also paragraph 5.31).
36                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  3.9.1. AMC/A3 will establish policy for implementation of the Fatigue Countermeasures
  (CM) Management Program and ensure compliance with its provisions, and AMC/SG will
  provide clinical oversight, guidance and materials for fatigue CM education and mitigation.
  3.9.2. OG/CCs will ensure Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs include use
  of the basic fatigue countermeasures found in the AvORM worksheet. Both the manual and
  automated ―MAF Mission Aviation ORM Worksheet‖ incorporate a fatigue CM risk
  assessment model. They are available on the AMC/A3V website under the ―Pubs‖ tab,
  ―Operational Risk Management (ORM)‖ section, and will be used by all three tiers of
  mission planners, as well as aircrew during the mission execution phase.
  3.9.3. Flight surgeons or Aerospace/Operational Physiologists will use the AMC-approved
  (lead command) fatigue CM training CDs and pamphlets provided by AMC/SGP to educate
  their operational fliers in venues such as clinic visits, flight physicals, Safety Down Days,
  pre-deployment briefings, readiness training, Commanders‘ Calls, First-Term Airmen
  Courses, base orientations and safety meetings.
  3.9.4. The primary fatigue CM available to aircrew members is appropriate management of
  their sleep/rest cycles. Secondary CM include smart scheduling procedures aimed at
  managing those cycles, strategic inflight and/or ground napping techniques, and proper diet
  and exercise.
  3.9.5. An additional fatigue CM tool available to aircrew is the No-Go Pill. The occasional
  use of a No-Go Pill by MAF aircrew to improve sleep quality and/or adjust circadian rhythm
  sleep/wake cycles is voluntary. Each individual aircrew member will, with the aid of their
  home station flight surgeon, determine how/if to implement the use of No-Go Pills as a
  fatigue CM.
  3.9.6. The following directives concerning the use of No-Go Pills are as important and
  unbreakable as the ―12 hour bottle to throttle‖ restriction for alcohol consumption:
     3.9.6.1. Aircrew members on flight orders will not use No-Go Pills in flight.
     3.9.6.2. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for any No-Go Pill they wish to
     use for operational purposes and document using MAF No-Go Pill Form 1, Ground
     Testing of No-Go Pills. In order to avoid possible drug interactions, aircrew members
     will inform the flight surgeon of any over-the-counter medications and/or nutritional
     supplements they are taking. During ground testing, aircrew members will be DNIF on
     an AF Form 1042 for the minimum ‗DNIF‘ periods prescribed in paragraph 3.9.6.4.
     After ground testing of a particular No-Go Pill, the flight surgeon will complete the
     bottom half of the Form 1 and a ―return to fly‖ AF Form 1042. Successful ground testing
     of a particular No-Go Pill establishes clearance to use it operationally.
     3.9.6.3. Aircrew members may obtain NoGo Pills from any USAF or other authorized
     flight surgeon while at home station or off-station while TDY/deployed. Off-
     station/deployed flight surgeons can verify individual aircrew ground testing results via
     the ―MAF Aircrew Medication Ground Test Card‖ all MAF aircrew members are
     required to carry.
     3.9.6.4. In no case will an individual perform aircrew duties while under the effects of
     No-Go Pills. Individuals will use the mission report or legal for alert time to determine
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            37


     the latest time to take a No-Go Pill. No-Go medications can affect individuals very
     differently. To comply with the ―no aircrew duties while under the effects‖ restriction, it
     is the responsibility of each individual aircrew member to be aware of their own
     minimum ‗DNIF‘ period for any No-Go Pill they use, based on their ground trial results
     and/or previous experiences. The following are the minimum ‗DNIF‘ periods (no AF
     Form 1042 required) after consuming a No-Go Pill:
        3.9.6.4.1. Sonata (Zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum ‗DNIF‘
        3.9.6.4.2. Ambien (Zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum ‗DNIF‘
        3.9.6.4.3. Restoril (Temazepam, Class IV Controlled Substance) – 12 hours
        minimum ‗DNIF‘
     3.9.6.5. Aircrew members will consider the following examples of missions prone to
     causing fatigue and/or sleep disruptions in their decision to use a No-Go Pill:
        3.9.6.5.1. Home station night launch missions with 2000-0530L show times and
        greater than four hours‘ duration.
        3.9.6.5.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal (i.e., quiet, air-conditioned,
        darkened) sleeping environment.
        3.9.6.5.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.6.5.4. Rotating or stair-stepped flying schedules with greater than 6-hour flight
        time duration.
        3.9.6.5.5. Missions that run consistently near a 12 to 14 hour duty day.
     3.9.6.6. The MAF‘s worldwide mobility mission makes accountability for this program
     challenging; therefore, the following are aircrew member responsibilities:
        3.9.6.6.1. Aircrew members will not operate heavy equipment during the minimum
        ‗DNIF‘ period for each No-Go Pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.6.4.
        3.9.6.6.2. Aircrew members will not take No-Go Pills within 12 hours of consuming
        alcohol, as their combined use unpredictably increases the effects of both.
        3.9.6.6.3. Aircrew members will limit use of Ambien (Zolpidem) and Restoril
        (Temazepam) to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in
        a 60-day period. Flight surgeons should prescribe 60 days‘ worth of medication (20
        pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew member, unless clinically inadvisable.
        3.9.6.6.4. Aircrew members will limit use of Sonata (Zaleplon) to a maximum of 10
        consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a 60-day period. Flight surgeons
        should prescribe 60 days‘ worth of medication (28 pills) if requested by the aircrew
        member, unless clinically inadvisable.
        3.9.6.6.5. If an aircrew member uses Sonata in combination with either of the other
        types of No-Go Pills, the seven consecutive days and 20-days in a 60 day period
        restrictions apply (overrides the 10 consecutive days and 28 days in a 60-day period
        for Sonata).
 38                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


          3.9.6.6.6. Aircrew members may consume more than one No-Go Pill in a 24-hour
          period, if operationally necessary. A second No-Go Pill of the same or different type
          will not be consumed while in the minimum ‗DNIF‘ period for the previous pill.
          3.9.6.6.7. The ―MAF No-Go Pill Usage/Refill Form‖ will be used to document No-
          Go Pill use and refill authorization, and placed in the aircrew member‘s medical
          record. Non-duty station flight surgeons will forward the form to the aircrew
          member‘s home station aerospace medicine clinic to be placed in their medical
          record. Flight surgeons will immediately discuss any concerns about an aircrew
          member‘s use of No-Go Pills with the individual‘s commander if any question of
          misuse arises.
          3.9.6.6.8. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will
          follow PRP notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills.
3.10. Crew Rest/Enroute Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter aircrew members into pre-
   departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time. Aircrew members may perform
   limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the first 12 hours of pre-departure
   crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest.
   Do not manifest aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest.
   EXCEPTION: AFRC, ANG, and AETC in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate
   supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/Enroute Crew Rest. The minimum enroute crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
      shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
      members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
      rest period after they complete official duties.
      3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
      flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
      load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/Enroute Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
   16 hours (nuclear airlift missions will be IAW AFI 11-299) ground time between engine
   shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
      3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
          3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
          the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
          to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
          duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 16 hours ground time.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                           39


     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with enroute ground
     times longer than 16 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
     cumulative effects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the enroute ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve requests to
  delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission
  allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for
  disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A AFRC, and ANG).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Crew Chief Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed crew
  chief or MEP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. The PIC shall ensure the crew
  chief has sufficient time in each 24-hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI
  21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
  3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
  criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
  or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
  3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
  parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
  accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
     3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
     the departing aircrew‘s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest
     location‘s Prime Knight function.
     3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
     C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
     POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
     rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
     3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
     clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
     advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
     reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
 40                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+15 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
   hour for reporting and 2+15 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations may
   increase or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish
   self-alert procedures for local training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
       alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
       may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
       cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
       agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. TO 1C-130A-9, Cargo
       Loading Manual, Chapter 6), C2 agents may alert loadmasters up to 2 hours before
       normal alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent must notify
       the loadmaster before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the loadmaster more than 1
       hour before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the loadmaster‘s show
       time.
       3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
       is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
       aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
       3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
       3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
       aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
       coordinate with controlling C2 agency or the 618 AOC (TACC). 618 AOC (TACC) is
       the approval authority for AMC and AMC-gained missions. With C2 approval, the PIC
       may elect to self-alert on operational missions at locations with a C2 agency. Crews will
       coordinate alert times with appropriate C2 agents to avoid FDP limitations that result
       from unexpected changes in the mission.
       3.11.1.6. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Alerting Procedures.
       Minimum show times for local training missions are 2+30 for Pilot proficiency missions,
       2+30 for off-station missions departing KIAG, and 3+30 for tactical missions. Earlier
       show times may be required based on unique mission requirements. 136th AS Squadron
       Operations Officer may designate earlier show times. If an earlier report time is required,
       crewmembers will be notified by a 136th AS scheduler.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew‘s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
       agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
       alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               41


       12 hours when in MEP status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept
       more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as
       necessary to fly in MEP status to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time
       (FSRT).
       3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
       during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
       the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
       from the time of notification.
       3.11.2.4. If the mission cannot depart within 4+00 hours of any scheduled takeoff, the
       PIC may continue the mission after a thorough re-evaluation of all ORM factors. The
       controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept a takeoff outside of the 4 hour
       window. The PIC will coordinate with C2 to continue the mission or enter crew rest and
       establish a legal for alert time.
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. Only MAJCOM C2 shall task units for ALFA, BRAVO,
CHARLIE standby force duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to
provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest
and follow aircraft generation procedures in paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch.
SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may
extend this period for contingencies. By the completion of an alert period, launch, release, or re-
enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local
procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be
   placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest.
   Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. Close and lock the crew entrance
   door with a lock or other controllable device, which will prevent entry without damage to the
   door or lock. The aircrew preflight portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked
 42                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   on alert, and launched by another crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard
   procedure but may be accomplished on a case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew
   representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and
   control and the controlling agency are notified when uncocking and recocking generated
   aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest.
   Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while
   performing pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-
   flight).
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if
   required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews or enter them into 12 hours crew rest
   for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a
   12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be
   able to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12
   hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
       3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
       computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation
Eligibility, AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly.
   3.15.1. Formation interfly. Aircraft are authorized to interfly in the same formation provided
   a thorough mission brief is conducted between all participants and any local/command
   procedures are discussed.
   3.15.2. Crewmember/aircraft interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs
   or equivalent to permit the exchange or substitution of aircrew members/aircraft between
   mobility units to accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to specific operations,
   exercises, or special circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration
   such as unit conversion to another model design series (MDS). Participating aircrews will
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            43


   use guidelines established by the host command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
   EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements.
       3.15.2.1. Associate units. All associate units will act IAW their association agreement.
          3.15.2.1.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 914/107 AW personnel may inter-fly
          for training and operational missions. Refer to 914 and 107 AW Inter-fly agreement
          Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
       3.15.2.2. Approvals:
          3.15.2.2.1. AFRC. AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit
          OG/CCs for active duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly.
          Units utilizing this authority will inform AFRC/A3V.
          3.15.2.2.2. ANG. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing Commanders
          for active duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG to
          ANG interfly.
          3.15.2.2.3. Interfly does not apply to the formal attachment of aircrew members
          flying with AFRC/ANG units for the sole purpose of continuation training. Formal
          attachment of aircrew members will be IAW AFI 11-401 and the AFRC/ANG
          Supplement AFI 11-401.
       3.15.2.3. Requirements
          3.15.2.3.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS variant as
          well as unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission unless
          under the direct supervision of an instructor.
          3.15.2.3.2. Each affected OG/CC who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
          concur with interfly proposal.
          3.15.2.3.3. MDS conversion training. Units may request an interfly agreement for
          duration of their conversion. OG/CCs will forward interfly requests to individual
          OG/CCs for approval. Requests will include as a minimum a list of affected units,
          duration of the agreement, and purpose.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208 Tanker/Airlift Operations. PICs will ensure
personnel traveling in this status are properly authorized. Crewmembers qualified in mobility
aircraft are authorized MEP status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of
mobility operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to
accompany the normal crew compliment are allowed MEP status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air

       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive.
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CCs may authorize MEP status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for MEPs.
   3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an MEP aircrew-related duties for which the MEP is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. MEPs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization.
3.18. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight attendants may fly as
primary crewmembers on designated C-130 missions. They fall under the authority of the PIC,
or MC (if assigned), throughout the mission. An egress briefing will be given to the flight
attendants prior to the first mission leg.

                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document;
include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A
PIC who accepts an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent
operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with
degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the
   governing directive of waiver request to include volume, chapter, or paragraph. Initiate
   waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through
 46                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   channels to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background
   information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.
   Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency.
       4.3.2.1. The 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units
       flying 618 AOC (TACC)-directed missions (includes Operational Readiness Inspections).
       The MEL waiver authority has been delegated to AMC/A3V. Contact HQ AMC/A3V
       through 618 AOC (TACC).
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. COMAFFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization. NGB/A3 delegates waiver
   authority to the unit OG/CC.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting Engineering
   Dispositions. Most EDs allow maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted
   status; dispositions of this nature do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew
   operations require MEL waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior
       to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority.
       The waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue. NOTE: Deviations from the flight
       manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are
listed by number installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements are defined by Home
Station Departure/Main Operating Base (MOB) (Column A) and enroute (Column B). An
asterisk (*) in the Required column indicates the number required is situation dependent; refer to
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              47


the Remarks/ Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification. Aircraft commanders will
determine if the asterisk (*) applies. Lead command/MAJCOMs will designate MOBs as
required. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews will consider Little Rock AFB as a MOB. PACAF
and PACAF-gained aircrews will consider Yokota AB and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson as
MOBs. Aircrews transiting a MOB on the retrograde portion of a mission may treat a MOB as an
enroute location. For example, a C-130 transiting Little Rock AFB enroute to Lajes AB will use
Column A. However, when transiting Little Rock AFB enroute to home station (de-positioning)
use Column B. Column B requirements will not normally be waived when transiting a MOB on a
de-positioning leg. Local training missions, to include off-station trainers and JA/ATTs, fall
under Column B. Asterisk items marked ―Shall be repaired at the next repair capable facility‖ for
column B are required for local training operations.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
       4.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: A Red X discrepancy must be downgraded
       through maintenance channels prior to flight. MEL waiver may still be required. This
       condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers unless stipulated otherwise by
       the waiver. The priority is to move the airplane to a repair capable facility. PICs must
       coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair capability exists at the destination.
       One-time flights may include enroute stops only when necessary to recover the airplane.
       Example: An airplane departs on a gear-down flight from Djibouti IAP and requires an
       enroute fuel stop (Cairo) before landing at the nearest repair capable facility, Sigonella
       NAS.
           4.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the
           nearest (shortest enroute time) repair capable base.
           4.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the
           nearest repair capable facility.
       4.5.1.2. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
           4.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
           scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate
           item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
           determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action
           with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
           4.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile,
           not just the next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an enroute station with
           repair capability, after engine start the FE discovers the #1 engine anti-ice is
           inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next leg. However, because
           the mission spans several days and repair capability does not exist at the scheduled
           enroute stops, the PIC elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.
4.6. C-130 MEL. This MEL lists the minimum equipment and systems to launch the aircraft
under routine operations. The MEL does not include all equipment or systems essential to
airworthiness. The MEL is not intended to promote continued operation of the aircraft for an
indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. Due to the various configurations of C-
  48                       AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


130s, the number in the ―Installed‖ column is a representation of the majority of the aircraft. If
your series requirement is different than the number shown, there is no waiver requirement for
the number installed.

4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).
4.8. Navigation Systems.
   4.8.1. For flights in Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace in the
   North Atlantic Region or the routes connecting Composite Hawaii to Mainland US Route
   System, the following fully operable navigation systems are considered the minimum
   necessary to permit compliance.
       4.8.1.1. SCNS aircraft. Fully operational SCNS, to include the navigator‘s IDCU and
       either the pilot or copilot‘s IDCU.
 58                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       4.8.1.2. Compass systems. When two systems are installed, both should be operational.
       If one system fails, refer to the flight manual to determine what other equipment is
       affected.
   4.8.2. For flights on all other Category I routes, the PIC determines the minimum
   navigational capability required to safely accomplish the mission. Consider the following:
   length and route of flight, weather, and experience and proficiency of the crew.
   4.8.3. Equipment listed in DOD FLIP AP/2, Area Planning Europe-Africa-Middle East for
   permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory. Loss of any component before track entry
   requires return to a station with maintenance capability or re-filing via specified routes.
4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Consider gear down flight only after the PIC
exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
   4.9.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in TO 1C-130xx-1-1, C-130 Performance
   Manual, assume gear retraction intiated three seconds after takeoff. For gear down
   operations, drag index must be applied using the Effect of Variant Configurations On
   Climbout Flight Path charts. PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable assurance that
   they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance to include enroute stops and
   alternates.
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with MAJCOM
   STAN/EVAL or OG/OGV.
4.10. Minimum Equipment for NVG Operations. The following equipment is required for
NVG operations (in addition to the equipment listed above):
   4.10.1. Pilot's Radar Altimeter.
   4.10.2. SCNS with a minimum of one GPS or INS must be operational for low-level flights
   flown using NVG enroute altitudes.
       4.10.2.1. If no GPS or INS is operational, climb to MSA. EXCEPTION: Wingmen may
       fly in-trail at NVG en-route altitudes as long as a GPS or INS is operational in the lead
       aircraft.

                               OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions and deviations specified in the
flight manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be
added to the checklists (in pencil). Currency of notes is a crewmember‘s responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM/A3V and the AFMC Flight Manual Manager are the
   checklist insert approval authorities. Send checklist inserts to MAJCOM/A3V, who will in
   turn coordinate with AFMC for approval. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs
   shall approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
       5.1.1.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) In-flight Reference Guides. In-flight
       reference guides are intended to be a quick reference for aircrews. The contents are from
       selected portions of flight manuals and regulations and do not replace the amplified
       procedures set forth in those directives. The issuing OGV is the point of contact and
       approval authority for guides issued
   5.1.2. Abbreviated checklists items that do not apply to the unit‘s aircraft or mission may be
   lined out in pencil.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots and the flight engineer shall be in their seats during flight. One
of the pilots may be out of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both
pilots in their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty
station during non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). Only one
pilot, or the flight engineer, may be absent from their duty station at a time. Notify the PIC prior
to departing assigned primary duty station.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight; the total number of persons permitted is limited to the number
of seats with operable seat belts and oxygen. Passengers and observers will not be permitted
access to primary crew positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all takeoffs and landings during:
       5.4.1.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance. EXCEPTION:
       Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) trained pilots may perform takeoffs and landings
       during aircraft emergencies.
       5.4.1.2. Airlift of nuclear weapons.
       5.4.1.3. Max effort operations or landings with unimproved airfield operations. Only IPs
       or ACs under the direct supervision of an instructor pilot may conduct maximum effort or
       substandard airfield operations from the right seat.
       5.4.1.4. Situations when in the opinion of the PIC, marginal conditions exist.
 60                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   5.4.2. Unless the pilot in the other seat is a certified AC or higher, Pilots In Command (PIC)
   with less than 100 hours Primary Assigned Hours (PAH) hours since AC certification will
   make all takeoffs and landings under any of the following conditions:
       5.4.2.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 4000 (3/4 SM visibility).
       5.4.2.2. RCR less than 12.
       5.4.2.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.
   5.4.3. Copilot/MPD Takeoff/Landing Policy:
       5.4.3.1. INSTM/QUAL. MPD trained pilots may takeoff or land from either seat if an
       AC occupies the other seat. Copilots identified for AC upgrade may takeoff and land
       from the left seat only if an IP provides direct supervision from the right seat.
       5.4.3.2. MSN. Copilots/MPDs will not takeoff or land from the right seat when in
       formation. Copilots/MPDs in Mission Upgrade may occupy the left seat on formation
       departures/ recoveries, assaults, or substandard airfield operations with an IP in the right
       seat.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) the aircraft will
command configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) the aircraft will verify appropriate
limitations and acknowledge the command by repeating it. The landing gear will be operated by
the pilot in the right seat. The flaps will be operated by the PM.
5.6. Outside Observer Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing during taxi
operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Crewmembers will have
   seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   Loadmasters (or other crewmembers) required to be in the paratroop door at the scanning
   position will have a designated seat (other than the scanning seat) with a seat belt.
   5.7.2. All crewmembers will have seat belts fastened during takeoff and landing unless crew
   duties dictate otherwise. Fasten shoulder harness unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties or are in upgrade training to
   instructor or flight examiner are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a
   primary crew position; however, they will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
   5.7.3. Litter patients, actual or simulated, may remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
   5.7.4. Loadmasters (or other crewmembers) required to be positioned in paratroop door for
   take-off/landing/threat scanning will be restrained in a restraint harness as follows:
       5.7.4.1. Helmets will be worn and paratroop door armor will be installed.
       EXCEPTION: Paratroop door armor is not required on training missions.
       5.7.4.2. Route the restraint harness straps (NSN 1680-01-314-3184) depicted in TO
       13A1-1-1, Repair, Cleaning, Inspection, and Testing of Aircraft Safety Belts, Shoulder
       Harness, and Miscellaneous Personnel Restraint Equipment through the support braces
       forward and aft of the paratroop doors with a girth hitch and attach to the restraint harness
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               61


      riser quick disconnect fittings. Ensure the leg and chest straps are connected and attach
      the restraint harness lifeline to a floor/dual rail tie-down ring.
      5.7.4.3. When restraint harness straps are not available, 5000 lb tie-down straps may be
      used to secure the restraint harness. Route a tie-down strap around each of the support
      braces forward and aft of the paratroop doors and attach the hook to the restraint harness
      riser clip. If the restraint harness does not have the riser clips, route the hook end of the
      tie-down strap through each side of the harness in the area the riser clips should be
      positioned and attach the hook back into the strap.
      5.7.4.4. Attach the restraint harness lifeline to a dual rail tie-down ring directly under the
      paratroop door and adjust to limit vertical movement.
      5.7.4.5. The use of paratroop door seats on newer C-130 aircraft, locally manufactured
      seats or other commercially manufactured seats obtained for loadmaster comfort while
      performing threat scanning, including takeoffs and landings, are only authorized in
      conjunction with the restraint harness method outlined above.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations Movement on
the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
   5.8.1. NVG Lighting. During combat/contingency operations, the tactical situation may
   dictate the use of all, some, or none of the aircraft exterior lights as determined by the
   mission commander. Landing lights will be extended and ready for use prior to all landings.
   The tactical situation will dictate if the landing lights will be used during landing. Lights-out
   operations during peacetime will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3. Follow the exterior
   lighting guide in AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—C-130E/H, for all
   NVG training situations.
      5.8.1.1. Total lights-out operations are authorized with concurrence of the controlling
      agency in restricted airspace and warning areas.
   5.8.2. Cargo compartment lighting will be dictated by the situation and will be coordinated
   between the mission commander/PIC and loadmaster(s). During cargo compartment
   emergencies the loadmaster should discontinue NVG use and select full bright on the cargo
   compartment lights (situation permitting).
   5.8.3. Interior lighting will be set-up using NVIS compatible lighting for all NVG airland
   operations (C-130E/H and H-2 harness filter kit or Glendale Filter system (GFS) are also
   acceptable). Taping with NVG compatible chemical lights is not an acceptable lighting
   scheme for NVG airland operations. WARNING: NVGs adjust to the brightest source of
   light; for that reason, poor cockpit lighting discipline may prevent a successful transition to
   landing during IMC. Therefore, do not perform an instrument approach in IMC to an NVG
   landing without NVIS compatible flight deck lighting.
   5.8.4. Aircraft Preparation. For NVG enroute and airdrop operations, aircrews are allowed to
   tape incompatible lighting and use NVG compatible chemical glow sticks. Some techniques
   for taping are outlined in AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H. NVIS compatible lighting (including
   lighting harness) is required for all NVG airland operations.
      5.8.4.1. Loadmaster Aircraft Preparation. Taping of lights may be accomplished;
      however, no more than one layer of tape will be used.

5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Loadmasters will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
   5.9.3. Authorized electronic equipment, to include hand-held GPS, is listed on the
   Electromagnetic        Environmental       Effects      (E3)      website       at:
   https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-EN-AS-14
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will announce intentions for departures, arrivals, approaches, and
when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. The PM will make all advisory
calls except those designated for other crewmembers.
5.11. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR)Traffic Calls to Uncontrolled Airports. Within the BISON
LATN training area, traffic calls will be made when operating at altitudes below 2000 feet AGL
and within 5 nm.
   5.11.1. Takeoff. State ―GO‖ at refusal speed or takeoff speed, whichever is lower. Any
   crewmember noting a safety of flight malfunction before hearing ―GO‖ will state ―REJECT‖
   and a brief description of the malfunction (e.g., ―Reject, number two engine flameout.‖).
   5.11.2. Deviations:
       5.11.2.1. The PM will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed,
       or when the altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired, and no attempt is being made
       to correct the deviation.
       5.11.2.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in
       airspeed, or a potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF.
       Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be
       announced.
   5.11.3. Advisory calls: Refer to Table 5.1 through Table 5.4 for a listing of mandatory
   advisory calls, responses, and aircrew actions.

 NOTES:
 (1) With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
 environment at DA; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The pilot
 may continue to 100 HATh with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not
 descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference
 unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
 (2) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue (CAT I), or go-around.
 Respond with the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight
 throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
 (3) If the pilot flying has stated ―landing‖ then this call is not required.
 (4) Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.12.

5.12. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military
and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and
are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this
critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to
stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters and culminates in a decision point for
the approach. The stabilization point for precision approaches is at 1000 feet above Threshold
Elevation (THRE). For all other approaches (except tactical approaches), the stabilization point
is at 300 feet above THRE unless otherwise briefed by the PF. Tactical approaches will be
executed as briefed by the PF.
   5.12.1. The following criteria apply to all approaches:
       5.12.1.1. Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions.
       5.12.1.2. Sink rate is no greater than 1000fpm. Note: Under certain conditions (WX,
       Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs and Tactical Approaches may require greater than a
       1000 FPM descent rate. This increased sink rate will be briefed.
       5.12.1.3. All briefings are complete prior to beginning the approach. All checklists are
       complete and the aircraft is in landing configuration prior to the stabilization point for the
       approach unless contrary to T.O. guidance (i.e., during engine-out operations when
       landing is not assured).
       5.12.1.4. Aircraft is on the correct track.
       5.12.1.5. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track for
       instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
       5.12.1.6. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
       5.12.1.7. From the beginning of the approach until the stabilization point, anytime the
       aircraft is outside these parameters the PM will announce the deviation and the PF will
       take immediate corrective action.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             65


      5.12.1.8. At the briefed stabilization point, the PM will state the altitude (AGL) and
      announce ―stable‖ or ―go-around‖. Example: for a precision approach, PM states ―1000,
      stable‖.
      5.12.1.9. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as:
      5.12.1.9.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 kts from target
      5.12.1.9.2. Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees from target
          5.12.1.9.3. Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target
   5.12.2. For non-precision approaches, pilots should calculate a constant descent gradient
   profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-217V3, Supplemental Flight
   Information). This is considered the safest profile and should be used to the max extent
   possible. During a go-around, ensure descent below the MDA does not occur. If a VDP is
   not depicted on the IAP, do not calculate your own VDP without fully complying with the
   cautions stated in AFMAN 11-217V3.
   5.12.3. Descent Planning and Energy Management. Aircrews will ensure the aircraft is
   following the planned descent profile. All non-tactical descents should follow a normal
   descent profile IAW AFMAN 11-217 procedures and techniques in the absence of ATC or
   FLIP guidance. All tactical descents should follow published tactical procedures/profiles.
   When unforeseen interruptions alter the planned descent, immediately correct any deviations.
   It may be necessary to hold, request vectors, or take alternate actions in order to comply with
   the planned descent profile.
   5.12.4. Visual Transition. It is imperative for aircrews to review the airfield environment.
   Identify key features such as approach light type, airfield lighting, geographic
   layout/configuration of runways, taxiways, ramps, etc. To the max extent possible, this study
   will take place during the crew mission briefing and reviewed again prior to descent.
   5.12.5. Missed Approach/Go-Around. Aircrews will conduct a thorough briefing for
   anticipated missed approach/go-around scenarios. This briefing will include a discussion of
   specific crewmember duties.
   5.12.6. For FTUs only. FTUs will fully emphasize and train so as to ensure the final product
   complies with all aspects of stabilized approach criterion. However, the building block
   approach used to properly execute both tactical and non-tactical approach/landings for
   initial/upgrade training requires that instructors have the latitude to use their expertise and
   experience to deviate from stabilized approaches guidance. FTU instructors are expected to
   use good judgment, technique and latitude while developing student skills and therefore are
   relieved of strict compliance to the stabilized approach criterion during appropriate
   instructional scenarios.
5.13. Communications Policy. There is no confidentiality regarding recorded aircraft crew
communications.     Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high degree of cockpit
professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.13.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance are cleared prior
   to discussing classified information over interphone.
 66                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   5.13.2. Command Radios:
      5.13.2.1. The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls.
      5.13.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the command radio
      unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
      on the inbound and outbound legs.
      5.13.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
      update the crew when the primary radio changes.
      5.13.2.4. One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances; The navigator or
      communications systems operator (if applicable) will record the clearance instructions,
      monitor the read back, and ensure compliance with all instructions.
      5.13.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
      maximum extent possible. To monitor VHF guard, 121.5 must be tuned.
      5.13.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
      unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
5.14. Crew Resource Management (CRM)/Threat and Error Management.
   5.14.1. Threat and Error Management provides strategies and tactics to help crews target
   threats to safe flight operations and decreases the potential for crew error. External threats
   are events that occur outside the influence of the flight crew and require crew attention and
   management to maintain adequate safety margins. Internal threats are crew related and are
   factors that could lead to an error if not recognized and controlled.
   5.14.2. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of "Time Out" will:
      5.14.2.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
      5.14.2.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
      5.14.2.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
      established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
      with the developing conditions.
      5.14.2.4. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
      the following actions:
      5.14.2.5. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance.
      5.14.2.6. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
      5.14.2.7. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
      inputs relative to the stated concerns.
      5.14.2.8. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
      current course of action or direct a new course of action.
   5.14.3. Sterile Cockpit. With the exception of cruise flight, conversation below 18,000‘
   MSL will be limited to mission, departure, or approach essential items. Every effort will be
   made to accomplish briefings and appropriate checklists prior to top of descent (TOD).
   Sterile cockpit procedures also apply during taxi, low level, and air refueling operations.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             67


   5.14.4. Heads-up/Heads-down. Any crewmember that observes both pilots heads-down at
   the same time (other than heads-down instrument flying) shall alert the PF without delay.
   5.14.5. CRM Enhancement. PICs should conduct a CRM exercise on the first suitable
   segment of each mission. This will be done at level off on a non-interference basis with
   other mission requirements. Take the exercise to a logical conclusion and ensure crew
   communications and duties are appropriate. Suggested topics are rapid decompression,
   oceanic contingency operation, emergency divert or other MAJCOM or locally generated
   Special Interest Item (SII).
   5.14.6. Critical Action Coordination. Those actions that are flight critical/irreversible in
   nature and will be confirmed by two crew members. These actions include, but are not
   limited to, pulling the engine fire handle, moving a propeller condition lever to feather, and
   discharging agent. The crew member performing the action points to the affected
   switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew member (i.e.‖CONFIRM
   NUMBER ONE‖). The crew member confirming the action looks at the affected
   switch/handle and acknowledges (i.e.‖NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED‖).
5.15. Use of Automation.
   5.15.1. General Automation Procedures. There must be a clear understanding of the PF, the
   PM, and navigator duties at all times. Aircrews should use aircraft automation consistent
   with changing flight environments and aircraft capabilities. If the use of automation creates a
   loss of situational awareness or results in task saturation, shift to a less demanding level or
   disconnect the automation entirely and re-establish desired aircraft path and control. Both
   pilots are responsible for ensuring the aircraft is following the desired flight path.
   5.15.2. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of communication
   designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors between the PF, PM and
   the navigator. VVM consists of the following three step process:
       5.15.2.1. When making any changes in the AFCS, SCNS flight plan, and altitude alerter,
       the pilot/navigator making the entries will VERBALIZE the intended change.
          5.15.2.1.1. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director
          and autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible
          (e.g. ―Autopilot engaged ‖,―Altitude Hold‖, ―Nav-Capture‖, etc.). The PM will
          acknowledge the call.
       5.15.2.2. The other pilot or nav will VERIFY the change.
       5.15.2.3. All pilots and the nav will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected
       performance is achieved.
5.16. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized where there is no commercial service. Other
pets or animals are normally prohibited, but may be moved according to DOD 4515.13R.
5.17. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO or NAF/CC may authorize the dispensing
of alcoholic beverages.
5.18. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
68                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  5.18.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. For peace-time do not use runways
  less than 3,000 feet. Minimum runway width is 80 feet (60 feet for max effort). Minimum
  taxiway width is 30 feet. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive runway/taxiway width
  requirements.
  5.18.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Minimum runway length for normal
  takeoff is Critical Field Length or Minimum Field Length for Maximum Effort Take-Off for
  max effort operations. Minimum runway for normal landing is Landing Distance or Ground
  Roll plus 500 feet for max efforts. For peacetime, compute landing performance with two
  engines in reverse and two engines in ground idle.
     5.18.2.1. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will
     initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The
     decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
     5.18.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
     environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
     takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
     from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
     5.18.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
     computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or runway condition
     reading (RCR) for the cleared portion of the runway. A minimum of 40 feet either side of
     centerline should be cleared (30 feet for maximum effort operations). If 40 feet either
     side of centerline is not cleared (30 feet for max effort ops), compute takeoff data based
     on the uncleared portion.
     5.18.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or
     authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
     takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
     if needed.
  5.18.3. Arresting Cables.
     5.18.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
     recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew will contact the tower to
     have the cable inspected.
     5.18.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
     slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, Automated Terminal Information Service
     (ATIS), or ATC.
     5.18.3.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems with an eight-
     point cable tie-down system are installed. Operation over raised barrier cables with disc-
     type support (except donut supported BAK-12 cables restrained with eight point
     tiedowns) at high speeds may result in damage to the airplane.
  5.18.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
     5.18.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
     guidance. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            69


       5.18.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
       pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/ASRR before all
       off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions in GDSS
       Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless specifically delegated
       in this or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ
       AMC/A3AS. HQ AMC/A3V is the OPR for waivers to airfield restrictions.
       MAJCOM/A3/DO is the waiver authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is
       responsible for waiver compliance.
       5.18.4.3. For other than hard-surfaced runways or taxiways, the airfield must be listed in
       the ASRR as certified or have a current LZ survey.
   5.18.5. RCR Limitations. When RCR is not available, the PIC will refer to the flight manual
   for standard ICAO conversions based on general runway condition; be conservative when
   dealing with unknown conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs), unpaved runways).
   Normally, RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported
   low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the
   runway. The runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a
   reflective glare.
       5.18.5.1. RCR and RSC. The performance charts used to determine braking action are
       based on concrete runways. The RCR values for the following runway surfaces in Table
       5.5 are estimates based on operational experience and should be used only as a guide.
          5.18.5.1.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Runway/Taxiway Surface Conditions.
          Aircraft on local training sorties will not be operated when the Runway Condition
          Reading (RCR) on ramp, taxiway, or runway areas is reported to be less than RCR
          05.

Table 5.5. RCR Values.
TYPE SURFACE                           RCR (DRY)        RCR (WET)
Asphalt                                23               12
Aluminum Matting                       20               10
M8A1/With Anti-Skid (PSP)              20               8
Clay                                   16               5
Crushed Rock                           16               5
Sand                                   16               5
M8A1/Without Anti-Skid (PSP)           13               3

       5.18.5.2. Limit C-130 operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a
       covering of one inch. This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is
       equal to one inch of slush or water. Performance data where more than one inch of slush
       or water is present may not be accurate.
 70                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   5.18.6. Wind Limitations. All maximum effort operations must fall in the "recommended"
   area of charts (corrected for RCR) unless otherwise approved by OG/CC.
   5.18.7. Takeoff Speeds. If Vmeto is used for takeoff, climb until clear of the real or
   simulated obstacle at max effort obstacle clearance speed. If Vmca is used for takeoff, climb
   until clear of the real or simulated obstacle at Vmca + 10 knots.
      5.18.7.1. If obstacles are a factor, use Vmeto and max effort obstacle clearance speed
      without Vmca corrections. If unable to clear obstacles using Vmeto and maximum effort
      obstacle clearance speed, reduce aircraft gross weight or delay mission for more
      favorable conditions.
      5.18.7.2. The PIC will ultimately make the decision to use Vmeto or Vmca based on a
      consideration of all available data including: weather, runway length, Vmeto, Vr, Vmca,
      Vmcg, applicable airfield survey, and a review of hazards, obstructions, and terrain both
      laterally and along the climb out flight path. Peacetime restrictions: take-off at Vmca or
      Vmeto, whichever is greater unless obstacles are a factor. WARNING: Max effort
      operations at high altitude, gross weight, and temperatures are critical; climb angles as
      low as 2.5 degrees may prevent the aircraft from accelerating. Any further climb angle
      increase may result in the loss of airspeed and the onset of a pre-stall buffet.
   5.18.8. Anti-icing fluid. AMS 1428, Type II and IV anti-icing fluid is authorized for use in
   extreme climatic conditions. Due to the shearing properties of Type II/IV anti-icing fluid, it
   may be necessary to increase takeoff speed. When Type II/IV anti-icing fluid is used,
   increase takeoff speed to a minimum of 110 KIAS and make necessary distance corrections
   to performance data. Also reference paragraph 6.21.2
5.19. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.19.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, aircraft may taxi without
   marshallers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to
   ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction and the obstruction is
   permanent. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent obstruction, provided the
   aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and is not moving. Aerospace Ground
   Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent obstruction, provided it is parked
   entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as
   painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means.
      5.19.1.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction
      Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. The painted lines on
      the Niagara ARS parking ramp provide required wing tip clearance from all permanent
      obstructions and from C-130s parked in designated parking spots. Aircraft marshallers
      will be required when taxi lines are not visible or aircraft larger than a C-130 are parked
      in designated spots (to include C-130 stretch models); aircraft marshallers will be
      required.
   5.19.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            71


   provide marshalling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers,
   or a crewmember on interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) to act as an observer
   while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations, marshallers will have
   an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers are only required to have one illuminated
   wand. Observers will be in a position to see wing walkers at all times (through door or
   windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.19.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
   Crews should:
      5.19.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
      requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
      5.19.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
      5.19.3.3. Use low speed ground idle whenever possible.
      5.19.3.4. Where possible, avoid 180° turns. If it becomes necessary to accomplish a
      180° turn on a narrow runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a
      link taxiway or at a designated turn around pad.
      5.19.3.5. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an
      unprepared or un-swept surface. If unavoidable, leave the engine in idle (to the
      maximum extent possible) until the engine is over an improved surface.
   5.19.4. Reverse Taxi: The PIC shall coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals with the
   loadmaster and marshaller (when available). Before reverse taxiing, the loadmaster shall:
      5.19.4.1. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
      5.19.4.2. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12-inches above
      horizontal.
      5.19.4.3. Position on the aircraft ramp to direct reverse taxi and report any hazards.
      Provide timely interphone instructions on turns, distance remaining, conditions of the
      maneuvering area, and stopping point.
      5.19.4.4. Do not taxi or stop within 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing
      walker.
      5.19.4.5. During night reverse taxi operations without NVGs, the PIC and loadmaster
      will ensure the taxi area is sufficiently lighted.
   5.19.5. CAUTION: Prop Blast during ground operations is capable of causing extensive
   damage to other aircraft, flight line equipment, and airport facilities
   5.19.6. After landing and clearing the runway, and with approval of the PIC, the loadmaster
   may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches above horizontal
   to prepare for cargo off/onload provided equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secure in
   the cargo compartment.
5.20. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.20.1. Aircrews should consider burning down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight
   dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the PIC). Except in the case of an
 72                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of
   intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.20.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency may
   authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate
   recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide
   fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.20.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.20.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
   Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
   and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
      5.20.4.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Fuel Jettison Area. The preferred fuel
      jettison area for flights within the Niagara Falls local area is 5 NM off shore of Lake
      Ontario. Fuel jettison will be conducted at a minimum altitude of 20,000 MSL or highest
      altitude aircraft is capable of reaching and parallel with the lake shore. Pilots will
      determine if airspace is clear of traffic before jettisoning fuel
   5.20.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command
   immediately after landing (AMC Forms 97, AMC In-flight Emergency and Unusual
   Occurrence Worksheet). Submit AMC Forms 97 through the unit safety office to the
   MAJCOM with operational control of the mission. Document all pertinent information,
   including the following items:
      5.20.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
      5.20.5.2. Actual Duration.
      5.20.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.
      5.20.5.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
      5.20.5.5. Recovery Field.
      5.20.5.6. Runway Available.
      5.20.5.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.
      5.20.5.8. Outside air temperature.
      5.20.5.9. Wind direction and velocity.
      5.20.5.10. Jettison Amount.
      5.20.5.11. Reason for Jettison.
      5.20.5.12. Approval Authority.
5.21. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI 11-202V3, this AFI, and the applicable Dash 1.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             73


5.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.22.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
      5.22.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
      5.22.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
      only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
      pattern activity is prohibited.
      5.22.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
      Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
      required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
      5.22.1.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) and Avian
      Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) conditions are risk models and do not restrict
      operations. Bird Watch Conditions, which are restrictive, are determined by Airfield
      Management.
   5.22.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs,
   landings, and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the
   Phase II period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP AP and the IFR Supplement along
   with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
      5.22.2.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Establishment of Phase II of the BASH
      program. Phase II bird activity is normally 15 March – 15 May and 1 September – 1
      November due to large migratory waterfowl and birds on and in the vicinity of the
      airfield. Any changes to this schedule will be determined by the 914 AW/107 AW 91-212
      BASH plan. See FLIP Area Planning (AP) for specific locations.
      5.22.2.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Minimize flight below 3,000 feet AGL in
      areas designated in the FLIP AP during Phase II bird activity.
   5.22.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.22.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the enroute portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized CONUS bird
   migration patterns, PFPS software overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory
   System (AHAS) website is another source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites
   may be accessed through the AMC aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212,
   Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information.
   5.22.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews will land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
 74                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   make reliable damage assessments. The PIC should complete AF Form 853 and fax to
   nearest Air Force Flight Safety Office after landing.
   5.22.5. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Bird Strike Procedures. Whenever a bird strike has
   occurred or is suspected, accomplish the following:
       5.22.5.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) A Red Dash symbol will be made in the
       AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
       5.22.5.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Maintenance will make the appropriate
       airframe and engine inspection and clear the inspection write-up prior to releasing the
       aircraft for flight.
       5.22.5.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) In the absence of qualified maintenance
       personnel, the engineer will inspect and clear the write-up. The engineer will inspect the
       following:
           5.22.5.3.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Engine intake and exhausts.
           5.22.5.3.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Air-conditioning intake and exhausts.
           5.22.5.3.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Airframe.
       5.22.5.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) If an engine/air-conditioning pack has
       ingested a bird or there is airframe damage, a Red X entry will be made in AFTO Form
       781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
5.23. Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and Operational
Check Flights (OCFs). FCFs, ACFs, and OCFs will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1-1-300,
Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks, TO 1C-130E(H)-6CF-1,
Acceptance and/or Functional Check Procedures Manual, and AFI 21-101. Crews should only
perform tasks or functions contained in specific technical order guidance. If requested to perform
a non-standard function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.23.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101.
   5.23.2. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
   procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
   require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
   5.23.3. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance
   in local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check
   only those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
   5.23.4. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
   which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific
   conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
       5.23.4.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Niagara Falls FCF/OCF designated airspace
       is offshore Lake Ontario.
   5.23.5. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                           75


   5.23.6. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers.
   The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that
   specific FCF flight.
       5.23.6.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) A full FCF certified crew compliment is
       desired to conduct an FCF flight. The OG/CC can authorize a FCF with a partial FCF
       certified crew. As a minimum, the Aircraft Commander and Flight Engineer will be FCF
       certified. If a Copilot, Navigator, or Loadmaster has systems checks during the FCF, than
       those crewmembers will be FCF certified.
   5.23.7. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a
   combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are
   operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to ―VFR on Top‖ for the
   altitude phase of the flight.
   5.23.8. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the Maintenance Group Commander may
   subsequently release the aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the
   condition generating the FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
   5.23.9. Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks. Perform checks IAW the
   flight manual and maintenance technical orders. Prepare the aircraft with minimum fuel
   necessary to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will permit
   a safe return to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn on the anti-
   skid system. The FE will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned and ensure
   runway available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions without
   exceeding normal brake energy limits.
5.24. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209 and the appropriate MAJCOM
supplement.
5.24. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR)914 AW only. Aerial events will be performed IAW the 914
OG/OGV Operations Guide which meets the requirements of the AFRC CONOPS of AFI11-
246V6. Aircrews will fly the 914th Current Operations approved profile; additions or
modifications to the profile are not authorized.
5.25. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
5.26. Radar Altimeter.
   5.26.1. Any crewmember detecting the illumination of the radar altimeter Low Altitude
   Warning Light will immediately notify the pilot flying the aircraft. Terrain clearance and
   aircraft position must be verified.
   5.26.2. Before departure, set the radar altimeter for emergency return.
   5.26.3. The navigator and pilot will use the same radar altimeter setting unless briefed
   otherwise.
 76                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   5.26.4. Set the radar altimeter to the Height Above Threshold/Height Above Airport
   (HATh/HAA) during instrument approaches.
5.27. Buddy and Windmill Taxi Starts. Buddy and windmill taxi starts may be performed
when approved by the OG/CC or DIRMOBFOR. This authority may be delegated to the
squadron or MC when the unit is deployed. This authorization will not be construed to allow
repeated buddy or windmill starts at various scheduled enroute stops.          Nonessential
crewmembers and all passengers will be loaded after completion of a buddy or windmill taxi
start.
5.28. Reduced Power Operations (N/A for 3 Engine Operations). Pilots will normally use
reduced power for takeoffs provided refusal speed (Vr) is equal to or greater than takeoff speed.
Use normal takeoff power if Vr is less than takeoff speed.
   5.28.1. Reduced power operations for normal takeoffs and takeoffs from stop/touch-and-go
   landings will use a predicted torque corresponding to 900 degrees TIT not to exceed 19,600
   inch-pounds of torque. Power settings up to maximum power may be used during stop-and-
   go takeoffs to comply with training restrictions listed in this chapter.
   5.28.2. Reduced power operations should not exceed 932 degrees TIT for -7 engines or 970
   degrees TIT for -15 engines during cruise. Cruise at a constant KTAS (280 KTAS for -7
   engines and 300 KTAS for -15 engines), adjusting TIT at least every hour. For legs of 2
   hours or less consider cruising at 260 or 270 KTAS (280 or 290 for -15 engines). On short
   legs with cruise altitude under 10,000 MSL, KIAS should be limited to 210 or less. On
   missions that are not time critical consider flying at a TAS corresponding to 850 degrees TIT
   (900 degrees TIT for -15 engines) to preserve first stage turbine vanes. This reduction in TIT
   will decrease fuel consumption by approximately 4%, increase turbine life, decrease
   sulfidation corrosion by approximately 200%, and increase thermocouple life.
   5.28.3. Reduce power for formation takeoffs to a torque corresponding to maximum
   continuous power (970 degrees TIT for -15 engines). Formation leaders will brief takeoff
   torque when different series C-130 aircraft are in the same formation.
   5.28.4. Reduced power is not authorized for max effort takeoffs.
5.29. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities
through 618 AOC (TACC) or appropriate C2 agency.
5.30. Hand-held (HH) GPS for Laptops with Moving Map Display (MMD).
   5.30.1. The HH GPS and MMD are designed as a situational awareness tool. The pilot
   monitoring and navigators are designated the primary users of MMD. PICs may authorize
   other crewmembers to use the MMD to assist with situational awareness. FalconView is the
   only AMC approved software for MMD use.
   5.30.2. Aircrew members using MMD will immediately discontinue monitoring if safety of
   flight is inhibited or during any other situation the PIC determines it unsafe to use.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              77


   5.30.3. Do not use HH GPS/MMD for primary navigation. All chart and fixing requirements
   are still required. The hand-held GPS will not be used to update navigation equipment
   (SCNS/INS).
   5.30.4. Before using the HH GPS in-flight, aircrew members must receive training and
   aircraft must be capable of supporting the HH GPS equipment.
   5.30.5. Only GPS units approved for use with laptop computers will be used.
5.31. Aircrew Fatigue. It is the crewmember‘s responsibility to be properly rested for each
mission. However, if circumstances prevent this, no MAF/AMC crewmember should feel
pressured to fly when not properly rested. A crewmember who is fatigued will immediately
notify the PIC who will then contact the Stage Manager, 618 AOC (TACC), Home Station, or
appropriate Command and Control if unable to start or complete a mission safely. Declaring
―Safety of Flight‖ may be required in this situation.
5.32. Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). The Military Aviation Safety Action Program
is an anonymous, self-reporting system modeled after successful FAA/Airline programs to
encourage the voluntary reporting Operational issues and events. It is designed to provide a non-
punitive environment for the open reporting of safety concerns and information that might be
critical to identifying hazardous situations and precursors to accidents. These safety concerns
may be either observed or experienced by the submitter. The goal is to prevent mishaps by
addressing those unintentional errors, hazardous situations and events, or high-risk activities not
identified and/or correctable by other methods or through traditional safety reporting sources.
   5.32.1. The AMC ASAP website is accessible at www.safety-masap.com. The website is
   secure and identity-protected and allows individuals to submit ASAP reports from virtually
   any location. Username and Password can be obtained from the crewmember‘s Wing/Group
   Safety office. Crewmembers can contact the AMC ASAP program manager via email at
   amc.asap@scott.af.mil. The website also allows crewmembers to review previously entered
   reports and check resolution of submitted reports.
   5.32.2. If an ASAP submission is made within 24 hours of an event, the submission will
   protect the submitter from punitive/adverse action except in cases of willful disregard of
   regulations and procedures. The value in this 24 hour forgiveness policy for non-intentional
   events is the vastly increased incentive for crewmembers to submit ASAP reports.
5.33. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Prevention of Engine Over-torque and Over-torque
Guidance. Most over-torque occurrences can be prevented by observing proper crew resource
management, common sense, throttle control, and situational awareness. When applicable, use
the following guidelines in an effort to further reduce the potential for engine over-torques:
   5.33.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) When practical do not move the throttles any
   faster than torque increases.
   5.33.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Flight Engineers will call out torque settings in
   1,000 inch-pound increments anytime torque exceeds 15,000 inch-pounds.
   5.33.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Limit torque to a maximum of 18,000 in-lbs
   during local training sorties.
   5.33.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The flight engineer will state ―18,000‖ over
   interphone anytime torque reaches 18,000 in-lbs.
78                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  5.33.5. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Pilots should brief whether torque or TIT will be
  called during touch-and-go landings. As a guide, if predicted torque will exceed 15,000 in-
  lbs. the flight engineer should call out torque in 5,000 in-lbs. increments until 15,000 in-lbs.
  is reached. Otherwise TIT may be called out.
  5.33.6. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Over-Torque of T-56-15 Engines. Overtorques,
  regardless of duration will be recorded on AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and
  Work Document.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              79

   and after flight.
 80                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      6.2.6.1. Units will identify marking requirements for personal/professional equipment in
      their local supplement.
   6.2.7. Helmets and Oxygen Masks. (N/A for AE crewmembers). Crewmembers will carry a
   personal helmet:
      6.2.7.1. Anytime parachutes are required to be carried IAW AFI 11-2C-130V3 Addenda
      A.
      6.2.7.2. Whenever the aircrew requires helmet-mounted night vision goggles or flash-
      blindness devices (MIL-G and/or PLTZ goggles).
      6.2.7.3. When required for wear of the aircrew chemical defense ensemble.
      6.2.7.4. For unpressurized flight operations IAW AFI 11-202V3.
      6.2.7.5. When required to be mobile in the cargo compartment during airdrop operations.
   6.2.8. Flashlights. Each crewmember must carry an operable flashlight for night flights.
   6.2.9. A reflective belt or suitable substitute will be worn on flight lines during hours of
   darkness or periods of reduced visibility.
   6.2.10. Tool and Airdrop Kits. At least one engineer‘s and one loadmaster‘s tool kit will be
   on board for all missions. One loadmaster airdrop kit will also be aboard the aircraft for
   aerial delivery missions. Units will identify tool kit contents and inventory procedures in
   their local supplement. As a minimum, the flight engineer tool kit will contain the tools
   necessary to perform the emergency actions in section 3 of the flight manual and hostile
   environment repair procedures. One NVG aircraft preparation kit will be on board for NVG
   missions.
   6.2.11. Hostile Environment Repair Kit. One Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK) will
   be onboard for all OCONUS and contingency deployment missions. The HERK will not
   normally be onboard the aircraft for CONUS and non-contingency missions. Units will
   identify where the HERK will be stored on the aircraft in the local supplement to this AFI.
   The flight engineer will ensure the HERK is onboard and serviceable (sealed) during the
   aircraft preflight prior to departure. Additionally, the fight engineer will ensure one-each
   generator and starter pad is onboard the aircraft for missions requiring the HERK. The
   HERK will not be removed from the aircraft until mission completion, and then only by the
   owning unit.
      6.2.11.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The Hostile Environment Repair Tool Kits
      (HERTK), when required, will be stored in the left hand galley storage compartment
      labeled HERTK.
   6.2.12. NVGs. All crewmembers will carry and preflight their own NVGs prior to flight for
   missions using NVGs. If available, one spare set of NVGs will be carried per crew. Each
   crewmember will carry approved spare batteries for their own NVGs. The spare will also be
   preflighted by the PIC.
      6.2.12.1. Both Pilots will wear the same type NVGs.
6.3. Pre-Mission Actions.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                          81


  6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review theater-specific
  information necessary to successfully operate there. The review, at a minimum, should
  include AFI 11-202V3, AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H, and the following:
     6.3.1.1. Review tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.
     6.3.1.2. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, Virtual Risk Assessment (VRA), Country
     Risk Assessment (CRA), and FLIP. Obtain and carry this information if required.
     6.3.1.3. Review the DOD 4500.54-G, FCG for areas of operation (to include classified
     portion). Obtain necessary diplomatic clearances where required.
  6.3.2. Obtain required customs forms.
  6.3.3. Obtain worldwide FLIPs and sufficient communications security (COMSEC)
  materials for the duration of the mission.
  6.3.4. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight evaluations
  will remain current for all crewmembers throughout the TDY period.
  6.3.5. Ensure visas have been received, if required.
  6.3.6. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations, if available.
  6.3.7. Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period.
  6.3.8. Passenger Restrictions. Release space available seats to the maximum extent possible
  unless overriding safety, legal or security concerns prohibit space available travelers from
  flying on specific missions. The only passengers on missions transporting DVs will be those
  of the official party and those space available passengers authorized by the lead POC for the
  traveling party. Authorization must be approved 24 hours in advance.
     6.3.8.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
     PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
     passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). Coordinate with C2 agency
     to release available seats to the passenger terminal. PICs are encouraged to release
     maximum space available seats subject to the following restrictions:
         6.3.8.1.1. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency
         (typically a government agency other than DOD) is reimbursing DOD for use of the
         aircraft. Space available passengers on revenue missions must be approved 24 hours
         in advance by USAF/ CVAM, theater AMD or JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using
         agency contact officer through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper
         funding and reimbursement. Consult C2 to determine mission revenue status if in
         doubt. Congressional Delegations (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
         6.3.8.1.2. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally
         not be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express
         permission of HQ USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the
         aircraft, which may include positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary
         to move aircrew members or support personnel on White House support mission
         aircraft, the WHMO will be advised and permission obtained through the unit C2 and
         CVAM. On de-positioning legs space available passengers will usually be permitted
         if the aircraft is no longer required to maintain an upgraded security status.

           6.3.8.1.3. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
           being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable
           route, depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer
           releases seats, aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability
           for the passengers is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will
           ensure passengers understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to
           boarding.
       6.3.8.2. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will
       be downloaded prior to departure. Also, see paragraph 13.4.2.8.
       6.3.8.3. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers receive all required passenger
       briefings regardless of the category of passenger.
   6.3.9. Ensure the correct aircraft navigation database is loaded or will be carried, as
   appropriate.
   6.3.10. Consider any foreseeable safety risks and risk mitigation factors IAW ORM.
   6.3.11. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Aircrew Member Reporting Policies. All
   crewmembers will be ready to assume aircrew duties at scheduled show times. Crew
   members that are not able to fly their scheduled mission should inform their scheduling
   section or the Operations Supervisor as soon as possible.
       6.3.11.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107                 AW       only.    Upon     reporting
       crewmembers will sign in on the 136th AS ORM worksheet, or for AMC directed flights
       the AMC ORM worksheet. Both worksheets are located in the Mission Cans, which are
       located in the Airfield Management/Flamingo Lounge area/counter. Signing in signifies
       you are fit/ready for duty, are crew rested, have completed all personal requirements, and
       have completed all grounding items.
       6.3.11.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. For all tactical and off-
       station missions, crewmembers will report to the Airfield Management/Flamingo Lounge
       counter to receive an Ops Supervisor briefing at the scheduled briefing time, normally 5
       minutes after show time.
       6.3.11.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only.             Flight engineers and
       loadmasters who do not have pre-mission or preflight duties will attend the Ops
       Supervisor briefing.
       6.3.11.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 914 AW only. For all sorties, crewmembers
       will report to the Base Ops counter to receive an Ops Supervisor briefing at the scheduled
       show time.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry the publications
specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. Units may specify additional publications in their unit
supplement. When the crew includes two crewmembers in the same specialty, (i.e. two
loadmasters on airdrop missions) each will carry a checklist but otherwise only one set of
publications is required. Units may establish a process to provide these publications onboard the
aircraft in-lieu-of individuals carrying publications. This process will be described in the local
unit supplement. Reference AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program, for guidance on
electronic publications.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ
AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/ASRR for updates to
airfield operability, weight bearing capability and Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)
reviews. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8 for non-DOD published approach criteria.
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will
emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which
they will be flying. Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of
operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a
forward operating location (FOL), or enroute stop, and thereafter when significant developments
occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence office as soon
as practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs).

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.7. Global Decision Scheduling System Account. Pilots will obtain a GDSS account prior to
operating on IFM-planned sorties. Download aircrew departure papers using the GDSS account,
at locations without an AMC C2 presence. For operational missions, ensure GDSS account
passwords are active prior to departing home station.
   6.7.1. On receipt of the IFM package, Pilots will:
       6.7.1.1. Review IFM papers for accuracy. (Weather, NOTAMS, dips, times and routing)

       6.7.1.3. Report discrepancies immediately to the flight manager.
   6.7.2. The crew papers do not contain secure information from the ATO or SPINS. Flight
   managed missions clearly indicate that secure information such as tactical routings and
   threats must be reviewed prior to departure. Crews shall contact local Intel and Tactics prior
   to departure.
   6.7.3. Pilots are required to communicate with their flight manager or contracted dispatcher
   prior to departure on every flight managed mission.
6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
   6.8.1. Crewmembers will review FCIF, Volume 1, before all missions or ground aircrew
   duties, and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number, date, and
   crewmember's initials.
   6.8.1. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Flight Crew information File. Patriot Excalibur (PEX) will
   be the primary method used to update FCIF currency. If PEX is not available or a
   crewmember(s) cannot access their PEX account, they will review Part B of the FCIF(s)
   located in the FCIF library. When all Part B of the FCIF‘s have been reviewed, the
   crewmember(s) will then initial the flight orders and include the number of the last FCIF
   read.
       6.8.1.1. Electronic signatures or sign-off (e.g. PEX or GTIMS) may be used on FCIFs.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission enroute will receive an
   FCIF update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission.
   6.8.2. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR) All FCIF‘s will be available in paper copy at the FCIF
   library.
   6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
   FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials behind their name on the file
   copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders. This applies to all
   crewmembers if the electronic sign-in system is not working at show time.
6.9. Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB). Items in the FCB may include local procedures and policies
concerning equipment and personnel generally not found in any other publications.
6.10. Mission Kits. Carry mission kits on all operational missions. Publications and forms may

AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                          87


  6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
  mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
  special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
  activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
  hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
  manuals, and OPORD procedure.
  6.12.2. Pilot in Command Pre-Departure Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the
  operations briefing, including MAJCOM, NAF, unit SIIs, CRM, and ORM levels and
  mitigating factors. Brief crewmembers on the specific mission details if not previously
  accomplished. Use briefing guides contained in AFTTP 3-3. C-130E/H.
     6.12.2.1. Pilot in Command Enroute Briefing. In the enroute system, the PIC will ensure
     that an aircrew briefing is conducted prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum,
     brief crewmembers on specific mission details for that day's sortie(s), CRM, and the
     ORM level and mitigating factors for the mission. Complete this briefing prior to engine
     start.
     6.12.2.2. NVG Briefing Requirements. For missions conducting NVG operations crews
     will review and coordinate NVG failure procedures for all phases of the mission. Any
     crewmember who experiences NVG problems will inform the rest of the crew. During
     cargo compartment emergencies, return to normal lighting until the emergency is
     resolved. Discuss actions for Smoke and Fumes in the aircraft.
     6.12.2.3. For AMC Special Missions, aircrews shall be briefed using the Special Mission
     briefing guide prior to departing home station or the last station before reaching on-load
     location. The briefing is located under miscellaneous documents on the AMC/A3V
     website: https://private.amc.af.mil/A3/A3V/publications.aspx.
  6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SII
  peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
  Specialized briefings review formation tactics and procedures, and technical instructions for
  specialized equipment operations. All crewmembers should attend each briefing.
  Crewmembers may only be excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight duties by the
  PIC; however, the PIC will back brief all appropriate items. PICs will use AFTTP 3-3.C-
  130E/H briefing guides. If the briefing guide is not contained in AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H, then
  a MAJCOM approved briefing guide should be used.
  6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
  forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
  crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
     6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
     with the IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local
     takeoff weather data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will
     use 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)
     supporting the theater C2 agency) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and
     further updates.
 88                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
       information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
       their location secondary.
       6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
       weather flight, OWS, or 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, obtain weather through
       any means available prior to mission accomplishment.
       6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
       FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
       6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
       are not required.
   6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within or adjacent to an established buffer
   zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
   procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
   6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
   6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided
   for IFM sorties. The PIC, or designated representative, will contact the flight manager if
   there are discrepancies with the departure papers or to resolve any questions before signing
   the flight plan.
   6.12.8. Training Evaluation Briefing.            Before all training/evaluation missions,
   instructors/flight examiners will brief the crew on requirements/objectives for each student or
   examinee.
   6.12.9. Intelligence Briefings. Before operating in a combat environment, the crew will
   obtain a current intelligence briefing.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the ―REACH‖ call sign followed by
   the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number
   (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH"
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign ―Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP, Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared
   call signs when required.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              89


   6.13.5. Search and Rescue. On actual search, rescue, and recovery missions, use the call
   sign "Air Force Rescue" plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including enroute wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to
       618 AOC/XOCZF if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in
       direction or 25 knots in speed.
   6.15.2. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the
   following methods:
       6.15.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
       6.15.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude are verified for each
       waypoint.
       6.15.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
       6.15.2.4. If an error is discovered in the DAFIF database, immediately report it to your
       base System Support Representative (SSR). The SSR acts as a filter by determining if the
       issue is a DAFIF, FMS, or an AWE error and reports it to the appropriate agency. When
       away from home station, error information may be relayed via OGV or Squadron
       Stan/Eval by any standard means available (e-mail, satcom, DSN, etc.).
   6.15.3. The flight engineer will complete AF IMT 4064, C-130 Takeoff and Landing Data
   Card and AF IMT 4063, Pilot Information Card, as specified in Chapter 12. Pilots and
   copilots will use AF IMT 4063. A qualified pilot, or additional flight engineer, will cross-
   check the AF IMT 4063 for accuracy by using the performance manual or approved tabulated
   data. As a minimum, the person checking the data will:
       6.15.3.1. Verify gross weight independently from the AF IMT 4063.
       6.15.3.2. Cross-check air minimum control Vmca (one engine inop in ground effect),
       takeoff, and landing speeds.
       6.15.3.3. Review and compare the computed distances, ground roll, and climb gradient
       (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures.

6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight
Procedures, AFMAN 11-217V2, Visual Flight Rules, this chapter; and the appropriate
MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR), review the
following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate, NOTAMS,
GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. The PIC will provide the obstacle height,
distance, and gradient information necessary for performance computations to the flight
engineer. All performance data will be computed by the flight engineer and checked by a
qualified pilot or another flight engineer using TO 1C-130xx-1-1, T.O. 1C-130xx-1CL-1, or T.O.
1C-130xx-1CL-2.
   6.16.1. The order of priority for departure planning is:
       6.16.1.1. Aircraft is capable of making published climb restrictions with one engine
       inoperative,
       6.16.1.2. Use of current SDP for planned departure runway for all missions deemed
       ‗operational‘
       6.16.1.3. Subtract up to 48‘/NM from the published climb gradient for OEI,
       6.16.1.4. Use of a VFR departure as described in AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1/2,
       and paragraph 6.16.2
   6.16.2. VFR Departures. VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle clearance
   planning.
       6.16.2.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       procedure for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
       VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
       high terrain are avoided.
       6.16.2.2. IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V2 AMC and AMC-gained crews are
       specifically authorized to depart VFR without meeting IFR departure procedure
       restrictions along the planned departure route with one engine inoperative while adhering
       to the following:
          6.16.2.2.1. Utilize radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when practical, and
          ensure flight following by any available means (i.e. FSS or C2).
          6.16.2.2.2. Consider reducing aircraft gross weight and/or delaying the mission until
          environmental conditions improve.
          6.16.2.2.3. Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle planning/avoidance and
          must climb to the Minimum IFR Altitude as soon as practical.
          6.16.2.2.4. Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This includes (but
          not limited to) supervisors, ORM, aircraft flight manuals, and aircraft commander
          discretion.
          6.16.2.2.5. Operations IAW this authorization are to be used as the last resort when
          the mission justifies the increased risk.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                          91


     6.16.2.3. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
     ensuring all the following conditions are met:
        6.16.2.3.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
        departure route.
        6.16.2.3.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
        emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance.
        6.16.2.3.3. If unable to comply with any of the above conditions, download
        cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that are more favorable exist.
     6.16.2.4. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
     CONUS.
     6.16.2.5. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
     clearance or reaching the IFR MEA.
  6.16.3. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
  in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
     6.16.3.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
     6.16.3.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
     IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1). NOTE: Screen height requirements for
     departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
     departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
     height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
     when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
     (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
     appropriate authority.
        6.16.3.2.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP): Published on SDP.
        6.16.3.2.2. At non-joint-use USAF or USN bases, assume a zero foot runway end
        crossing height unless a higher altitude is published.
        6.16.3.2.3. All others: 35 feet unless published.
     6.16.3.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
     all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm to MSA will
     be used. NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE
     climb gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
     6.16.3.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
     obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI. For the purposes of OEI departure
     planning, An ‗operational‘ mission is defined as all missions that are not designated as
     training specific missions. A training mission may be considered ‗operational‘ if external
     users (e.g. cargo load training, JA/ATT, etc.) are scheduled as part of the training
     mission.
        6.16.3.4.1. Special Departure Procedure. SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape
        procedures intended only for emergency use when operationally necessary. They are
 92                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


          applicable after the loss of an engine and, where available, will be used for engine-out
          departure planning. Retrieve current SDPs from the SDP website (contact OGV for
          current username password). ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not currently listed may be
          requested through OGV NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. MAJCOM/A3V
          authorizes the use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 7 days after the analysis date.
          6.16.3.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
          is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
          ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
          available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
          gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
          gradients may be published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off
          Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment,
          the operations supervisor (or equivalent mission execution authority supervisor) may
          authorize the PIC to ensure the aircraft vertically clears all obstacles along the
          planned departure path OEI by subtracting up to 48‘/NM from the published (or
          standard) climb gradient or the use of the departure runway‘s SDP for OEI departure
          planning. For training missions the operations supervisor is the OG/CC or equivalent,
          delegated no lower than the Sq/DO. As execution authority on all 618 AOC (TACC)
          tasked missions, the 18 AF/CC has authorized the PIC to subtract the 48‘/NM.
          Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in obstacles (obstacles
          that require a climb gradient to an altitude of 200‘ or less above departure end of
          runway elevation) which should normally be published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR
          departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews must also ensure the aircraft can clear these
          obstacles. NOTE: If OEI obstacle clearance cannot be satisfied by one of the above
          methods, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
   6.16.4. Critical Field Length (CFL). Takeoff GW must never exceed that which would
   require CFL in excess of the runway available for a normal takeoff. In some cases, a
   minimum altitude is required at the published screen height.
   6.16.5. Gross Weight (GW). Ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the maximum GW,
   zero fuel weight, or center of gravity limitations specified in the aircraft flight manual. GW
   may be further restricted by operating conditions such as, icing, temperature, pressure
   altitude, runway length and slope, aerodrome weight bearing capacity, departure
   maneuvering, required climb gradients, and obstacles.
      6.16.5.1. Takeoff GW must not exceed that which would, in the event of an engine
      failure, lower the rate of climb to less than a 2.5 percent climb gradient (152-feet per
      NM).
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Use Table 6.3.

Table 6.3. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.
MISSION       VIS        REMARKS
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                93


 Operational 1000         When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000, the
             RVR          crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the runway has
                          dual RVR readouts (touchdown and rollout) and displays (minimum
               (305
                          RVR 1000 on both) and runway centerline lighting is operational. For
               meters)
                          any takeoff below 1600 RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.
 All others    1600       For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must
               RVR        read a minimum of 1600 on all.
               (488
               Meters)
 NOTES:
 If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
 mile (800 meters).
 When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility) a departure
 alternate is required (See paragraph 6.19.)

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, DOD 4500.54G FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the
mission load and performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in
the choice of alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they
meet the above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for lowest
   suitable approach (at departure aerodrome). If planning an ILS approach, Category I
   minimums will be used.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
       least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
       600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
       remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be
according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
 94                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
      available DOD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach;
      6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
      published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
      (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
      taking the published HAA or HATh and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
      as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
      with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet;
      6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
      for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not
   exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique
   geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
   The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
      6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
      and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
      6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
      minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
      precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
      precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
      minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
      considerations to a remote or island destination.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Turbulence. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.21.1.1. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain
      wave turbulence. Refer to AFI 11-203, Weather for Aircrews, for additional information
      on mountain wave turbulence.
      6.21.1.2. The C-130 is a category II aircraft for turbulence. AF produced turbulence
      products are based upon category II aircraft. If referencing other products or reports,
      crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what type
      of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of flight.
      Turbulence category charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency technical note
      AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological Techniques.
      6.21.1.3. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Icing. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            95


  NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002 states that freezing
  drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is equivalent to severe icing. When
  freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews will confirm with weather agencies what type (if
  any) icing is associated with the freezing fog.
     6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
     conditions of freezing drizzle except when aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
     IAW flight manual procedures.
     6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
     ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
     icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
         6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
         flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
         associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
         times.
         6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
         icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. Information on the removal
         and prevention of frozen precipitation is contained in AF T.O. 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing,
         De-Icing       and       Defrosting   of     Parked       Aircraft     available     at
         https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3of. Approved annual deicing/anti-icing holdover tables
         are available at the AFFSA/A3OT website: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3of. The
         holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use time,
         temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are exceeded and re-
         apply fluid if required.
         6.21.2.2.3. Ice Pellets. Tests have shown that ice pellets generally remain in the
         frozen state imbedded in Type IV anti-icing fluid, and are not absorbed by the fluid in
         the same manner as other forms of precipitation. Using current guidelines for
         determining anti-icing fluid failure, the presence of a contaminant not absorbed by the
         fluid (remaining imbedded) would be an indication that the fluid has failed. These
         imbedded ice pellets are generally not readily detectable by the human eye during
         pre-takeoff contamination check procedures. Therefore, strict adherence to ice pellet
         allowance times is required. Approved Ice Pellet Allowance Times are available at
         the HQ AFFSA/A3OF website: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3of.
         6.21.2.2.4. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure.
         6.21.2.2.5. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) De-icing Procedures. De-icing will be
         conducted on the west ramp, parking spots 1, 2, or 3. Command Post/Ops Sup will
         coordinate the following:
         6.21.2.2.6. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Clear as much snow and ice from the
         plane as safety permits using mechanical means before proceeding to the de-icing pit.
         6.21.2.2.7. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The      AFTER        LANDING         and
         ENGINE SHUTDOWN checklist will be accomplished after taxiing to the deice pits
         and prior to de-icing.

  6.21.3. Thunderstorms.
     6.21.3.1. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
     advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
     thunderstorms. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or
     cumulonimbus clouds. If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus
     clouds by at least 2000 feet, avoid them by at least:
        6.21.3.1.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level FL 230.
        6.21.3.1.2. 10 NMs below FL230.
        6.21.3.1.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations below FL230 provided the
        outside air temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude. Avoid gust fronts and
        winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm.
        6.21.3.1.4. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur up to 20NMs from any
        thunderstorms.    Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
        thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather for Aircrews.
     6.21.3.2. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should
     only be used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather.
     It will never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on
     ground-based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide
     avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
        6.21.3.2.1. Changing routing.
        6.21.3.2.2. Diverting to alternate.
        6.21.3.2.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
     6.21.3.3. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
     departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
        6.21.3.3.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
        6.21.3.3.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers
        6.21.3.3.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus
        5,000 feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level.
        6.21.3.3.4. Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are
        within 10NMs providing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as
        hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at
        the airport, and are not forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route
        of flight (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
  6.21.4. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
  strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
     6.21.4.1. Within 8C of freezing.
     6.21.4.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
     thunderstorm activity.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               97


   6.21.5. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
   flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
   weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.6. Temperature Corrections. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 and the Flight Information
   Handbook (FIH) Section D for temperature corrections.
   6.21.7. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk
Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as
part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM assessment
   for all missions and accomplished by all crewmembers prior to each flight.
   6.22.1. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 914th AW only. Aircrews will use the AMC ORM
   worksheet on all flights IAW AMCI 90-903, Aviation Operational Risk Management
   Program. The worksheet is located on E-Pubs.
   6.22.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Aircrews will use the 136 AS
   ORM worksheet on local flights and the AMC ORM worksheet on all AMC directed flights
   IAW AMCI 90-903, Aviation Operational Risk Management Program. Both are located on
   E-Pubs.
   6.22.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) On AMC ORM worksheets, TACC (or local
   Current Operations planners) will complete the Tier 1 calculation and forward to Current
   Operations. Current Operations will complete the Tier 2 ORM assessment and forward to the
   Operations Supervisor for Tier 3 completion. The PIC and Ops Sup will attempt to mitigate
   risk prior to seeking launch approval. Crews must use this tool prior to the first takeoff each
   day on cross country missions. When appropriate, deployed mission commanders have the
   authority to rearrange crew members in their formation due to experience or proficiency
   levels in order to reduce risk.
   6.22.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. 136 AS ORM worksheet
   completion.
       6.22.4.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Low Risk - Green (0-39
       points) Assessment. No additional approval required.
       6.22.4.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Medium Risk – Yellow (40-
       49 points) Assessment. Attempt to mitigate. Notify mission commander and Ops Sup.
       6.22.4.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Medium-High Risk (Orange)
       (50-59 points) Assessment. Attempt to mitigate. Notify the 136th AS Operations Officer
       or 107th Operations Group Commander.
       6.22.4.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. High Risk (Red) (60 or more
       points) Assessment. 136th AS Ops Officer or higher approval is required.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. Hazard Identification and Mitigation. After the entire crew is assembled at the aircraft,
the PIC will brief primary mission hazards facing the crew during takeoff and climb-out.
6.24. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
   6.24.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional/conditional release must be signed before flight. A
   maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the
   exceptional/conditional release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign
   the exceptional/conditional release. Ensure that the DD1896, DOD Fuel Identaplate, and
   AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.24.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
   crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained,
   coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is
   required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.24.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   paragraph 12.3.
6.25. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.25.1. APU Usage. For fuel conservation, minimize use of APU. Use ground power units
   when practical.
   6.25.2. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Flight engineers acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will
   comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and refueling job guide. Aircrews will only refuel in cases
   when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed.
   Crewmembers may augment maintenance refueling teams at enroute stops.
       6.25.2.1. Units will not refuel to a ―standard‖ ramp load. The aircraft will be refueled
       after the aircraft tail number is assigned and the exact mission-specific fuel requirement
       is known. The goal is to provide an accurate fuel requirement before refueling begins to
       prevent defueling or having a second refueling.
   6.25.3. Aircrew Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements.
       6.25.3.1. The aircrew dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
          6.25.3.1.1. Aircraft ground time exceeds 12 hours (72 hours provided the aircraft is
          sealed, not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).
          6.25.3.1.2. Another maintenance dash six preflight is performed.
       6.25.3.2. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or an aircraft not requiring a
       preflight, a thorough visual inspection will be performed.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                           99


        6.25.3.2.1. Same day, as referenced from TO 1C-130XX-1, is defined as the time
        period from 0001 to 2359 local.
     6.25.3.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Home Station Spare Aircraft Inspection and
     Sealing Procedures. Discrepancies discovered during the dash-one inspection that require
     maintenance action prior to flight will be cleared and the system/areas re-inspected by the
     flight engineer prior to certifying the completion of the dash one inspection. If minor
     maintenance is being performed and such maintenance does not invalidate any part of the
     dash one pre-flight; the engineer may certify the completion of the inspection prior to
     completion of maintenance action. The aircraft forms will clearly document all
     maintenance actions.
        6.25.3.3.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The flight engineer and loadmaster
        will complete their respective dash 1/9 preflight. The aircraft will be secured with a
        seal and an INFO NOTE entry will be placed in the Aircraft Form 781A,
        Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, stating: seal number, preflight
        completion date/time, LOX quantity, bleed air check time, and any areas not
        inspected.
        6.25.3.3.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The purpose of sealing an aircraft is to
        detect unauthorized entry. Documented entry control into the aircraft is vital to
        maintain the integrity of the -1/-9 preflight. The following tasks may be performed by
        maintenance without coordination and does not jeopardize the preflight as long as
        maintenance documents the AFTO 781A stating the reason for breaking the seal and
        reseals the aircraft.
            6.25.3.3.2.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Fuel/Defuel/Lox Servicing
            6.25.3.3.2.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Tire Servicing
            6.25.3.3.2.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Towing
            6.25.3.3.2.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Life                 Support      Equipment
            preposition
            6.25.3.3.2.5. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Aircraft Publications Update
            6.25.3.3.2.6. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Reconfiguration of aircraft.
            6.25.3.3.2.7. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Minor interior surface cleaning.
            6.25.3.3.2.8. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) IFF Mode 4 check
            6.25.3.3.2.9. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Mooring of aircraft.
        6.25.3.3.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Any task not listed above will require
        coordination through the respective Flight Engineer section. A Flight Engineer will
        recheck or perform any follow up inspection and then only the Flight Engineer can
        reseal the aircraft. This inspection will be documented with the new seal number. The
        engineer will ensure maintenance has completed all write-ups and ER (if required)
        6.25.3.3.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) If a preflighted aircraft seal is missing
        or documented entry does not meet the criteria of paragraphs 6.25.3.3.2.1 –
        6.25.3.3.2.9 then a new dash 1/9 preflight will need to be accomplished.
100                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         6.25.3.3.5. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The AS/CC or DO may direct
         preflight spares not be sealed to permit loading operations for mobility exercises,
         deployments, or other times when high aircraft generation rates are required.
  6.25.4. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.
      6.25.4.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
      for fire protection during engine start.
      6.25.4.2. A fireguard is required for all engine starts including the GTC/APU.           A
      crewmember or ground controller may act as fireguard.
  6.25.5. Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Runs.
      6.25.5.1. A mixture of aircrew and maintenance personnel will not normally accomplish
      engine runs. When an aircrew member is required to start or run up engines for
      maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply:
         6.25.5.1.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and
         preparations for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to:
         intake/exhaust inspections, access panel security servicing, and AFTO Form 781
         documentation.
         6.25.5.1.2. Use the pilot, flight engineer, and loadmaster checklists. Begin with the
         "cockpit checklist," and complete all appropriate checklists through the "before
         leaving the airplane" checklist.
         6.25.5.1.3. Only deviate from the flight crew checklist when maintenance requires
         less than four engines to be started.
         6.25.5.1.4. Operate symmetrical engines when power settings above ground idle are
         required.
         6.25.5.1.5. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) At Niagara Air Reserve Station,
         aircrews will use A or A3 taxiway for engine run / propulsion system checks for
         power settings above Ground Idle. Position the aircraft to avoid blowing debris
         toward the runway. Advise Niagara Falls Ground Control (121.7) prior to any run-up
         check of location and also of run-up termination.
  6.25.6. Towing. Aircrew members normally will not participate in towing operations. If
  required to occupy cockpit positions during towing operations conducted by personnel not
  familiar with C-130 towing procedures, the PIC will coordinate with the senior maintenance
  officer or superintendent to ensure the towing supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-
  USAF installations, the PIC must have approval from the airfield operations officer or
  manager prior to towing. The PIC will ensure the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on
  their duties and the associated hazards. Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as
  to the qualification of tow team personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to
  tow the aircraft until qualified Air Force personnel can be located. Under no circumstances
  will any crewmember act as the towing supervisor.
  6.25.7. Aircrew members are prohibited from climbing onto the upper fuselage or wing
  surfaces unless there is an operational necessity. When operational conditions dictate that
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                        101


   aircrew members must climb onto upper fuselage or wing surfaces, they will do so only when
   conditions are dry and high winds do not exist.
      6.25.7.1. Aircraft commanders will ensure no other personnel (excluding qualified
      ops/maintenance personnel) have access to, or be allowed to, climb onto the fuselage or
      wings.
6.26. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). Refer to Chapter 12 for
procedures.
6.27. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
   6.27.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) should oxygen be required (minimum 5 liters).
      6.27.1.1. Since the C-130 flight deck can accommodate more crewmembers than there
      are oxygen regulators, all C-130 aircraft will have three emergency passenger oxygen
      systems (EPOS), or protective breathing equipment (PBE) permanently pre-positioned on
      the aircraft. The EPOS/PBEs may be stored on the overhead storage rack when not
      required on the flight deck.
          6.27.1.1.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Emergency Escape Breathing Devices
          (EEBD). Each aircraft is equipped with six Emergency Escape Breathing Devices
          (EEBDs). Four in a green bag on the right side crew bunk near the Navigator station
          or forward side of F.S. 245, and two in the cargo compartment located at or near the
          left side litter stanchions at FS 330/430 and FS 625. Quick don mask and goggles
          with walk around bottles are the primary oxygen supplement for use when fighting
          aircraft fires or investigating sources of smoke and fumes. Secondary oxygen
          supplements will be the EEBDs.
      6.27.1.2. On missions carrying passengers/patients, one EPOS per passenger/patient will
      be available regardless of planned flight altitude. EPOS will be distributed or placed
      throughout the cabin/cargo area IAW AFI 11-2C-130V3 Addenda A.
      6.27.1.3. Do not remove the loadmaster's emergency equipment (cargo compartment
      quick dons/smoke masks) for use by flight deck crewmembers.
      6.27.1.4. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-202V3.
      6.27.1.5. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask with
      communication connected and readily available for use from before engine start until
      engine shutdown.
      6.27.1.6. Crewmembers that do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have
      an EPOS or PBE within arm's reach for flights above 10,000 feet.
      6.27.1.7. Normally, unpressurized flight will not be planned above 20,000 feet cabin
      altitude (except certain airdrop missions). Aircrews required to fly unpressurized
      missions above 20,000 will pre-breathe 100 percent oxygen in accordance with Chapter
      19.
   6.27.2. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than
   wing well life rafts will accommodate.
 102                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   6.27.3. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device. LPUs will be placed
   within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on overwater flights.
   Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs (if applicable) for overwater flights and will wear
   them on overwater missions below 2,000 feet. (EXCEPTION: LPUs need not be worn for
   takeoffs, landings, or approaches). Ensure the appropriate number and type of life preservers
   are aboard for overwater missions carrying children and infants.
   6.27.4. Parachutes:
       6.27.4.1. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp
       in-flight will be restrained by a safety harness, or wear a parachute.
       6.27.4.2. Either wear, or have prefit and prepositioned, parachutes and helmets during
       specified combat conditions IAW AFI 11-2C-130V3 Addenda A. Loadmasters will wear
       a restraining harness instead of a parachute during airdrops below 800 feet AGL or when
       performing duties near an open exit above 25,000 MSL.
   6.27.5. MA-1 Portable Oxygen Bottles.
       6.27.5.1. There are three types of A-21 regulators on MA-1 portable oxygen bottles,
       unmodified, modified and modified2. Except for fill times, operation of the bottles are
       identical. Refill valve type is determined by viewing the inside of the fill nozzle and/or
       identaplate as specified below:
           6.27.5.1.1. Unmodified: Refill valves have a push valve inside the nozzle resembling
           a standard tire valve stem.
           6.27.5.1.2. Modified: Refill valves have a brass plate/filter covering inside of the
           nozzle and no valve stem is visible.
           6.27.5.1.3. Modified2 (Fast Fill): Refill valves have a brass plate/filter covering
           inside of the nozzle and no valve stem is visible. Part number on the identaplate is
           one of the following: 9010A4, 9010A5, 3260007-0201, 3260007-0103.
       6.27.5.2. Ensure a minimum of two unmodified/modified2 bottles are installed on the
       aircraft, one in the cargo compartment and the other in the pilot position. Additional
       unmodified/modified2 bottles should be installed in the cargo compartment first.
           6.27.5.2.1. Home Station Departures. A waiver to the minimum number of required
           unmodified/modified2 bottles may be granted on a case-by-case basis. (see
           paragraph 4.3)
           6.27.5.2.2. Enroute   Departures.          Maintain     minimum        number     of
           unmodified/modified2. If unable, continue until reaching a location with replacement
           bottle(s).
6.28. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.29. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
   6.29.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 618 AOC (TACC)
   directed mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the
   aircrew will collect the required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             103


   station, which has such a function. The report will be submitted on AF Form 4075, Aircraft
   Load Data Worksheet.
6.30. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo. NOTE: Installed flares do not constitute hazardous cargo.
However, any additional loads of flares are not considered aircraft equipment and shall be
properly packaged and prepared IAW AFMAN 24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO
P4030.19I/DLAI 4145.3.
   6.30.1. AFMAN 24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO P4030.19I/DLAI 4145.3
   contains a description of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. PICs
   on AMC and AMC-gained aircraft are responsible for ensuring that all procedures contained
   in AFMAN 24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO P4030.19I/DLAI 4145.3 are
   complied with when airlifting hazardous cargo.
      6.30.1.1. MAJCOM Instructions (i.e. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous
      Materials) may be provided to crew members in order to consolidate and streamline the
      information from several hazardous material regulations. This does not preclude aircrew
      from the responsibility of the parent regulation.
      6.30.1.2. Procedures also apply to nuclear related cargo, toxic chemical ammunition,
      highly toxic substances, hazard division 1.1 through 1.3 explosives, and infectious
      substances (including biological and etiological materials). In addition, it applies to Class
      7 (Radioactive materials), which require a yellow III Label, and all other hazard classes
      or divisions, (except class 9 and other regulated material (ORM-D)) when shipped in
      quantities of 1,000 pounds (455 Kgs) or more aggregate weight.
   6.30.2. Flight Planning. Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing, the PIC will:
      6.30.2.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission identifier or flight number in the
      appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD 175, Military Flight
      Plan, and Other Information section of DD 1801, International Flight Plan, DOD. Refer
      to the DOD 4500.54G FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight
      when transporting hazardous materials cargo.
      6.30.2.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
      otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
      6.30.2.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
      remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material,
      DOD class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
      required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
      etc.).
      6.30.2.4. If estimated time enroute (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
      preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and

6.34. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor SCNS/GPS/INS
performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades
centerline accuracy to the controlling ARTCC. Use the following procedures for flight progress:
   6.34.1. Before an oceanic flight, plot the oceanic portion on an appropriate chart. Annotate
   the chart with the mission number and date. If practical, charts may be reused. Refer to
   Chapter 11 for chart requirements.
       6.34.1.1. Crews are to use only the MNPS oceanic checklist and the oceanic expanded
       checklist for oceanic crossings. Use of all locally generated oceanic checklists is
       prohibited. Where appropriate, units may augment the MNPS checklist with local
       supplements for items such as ATLRV, formation, and other unique mission
       requirements, but in no case may they substitute locally generated products for the MNPS
       checklist.       The         MNPS           checklists         is       located       at:
       https://www.notams.jcs.mil/dinsQueryWeb/ on the right side.

the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, OWSs, and USAF
weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical
station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at
Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 612 SPTS/WX at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ.
PACOM AOR contact 17 OWS at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI. The ATC system can
provide weather information to enroute aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Prior to the top of descent (TOD), the PIC will identify and discuss mitigation of
associated hazards to the penetration, approach, landing, and airfield. Before descent into
unfamiliar areas, pilots and navigators will review appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew
situational awareness of obstructions. Every effort will be made to accomplish briefings and
appropriate checklists prior to TOD. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other
than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the
initial descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR

AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               109


          6.41.1.1.8. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Crews may request
          respective OG/CC approval to accomplish transition work at Airfields other than
          those listed above.
      6.41.1.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
      approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft category. The C-130 is a category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed
   140 knots, the minimums for category "D" will be used.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an
   enroute descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
      6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
          6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
          meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
      6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
          6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
          required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
          rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
          add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
          which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900
          feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
          minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
          visibility.
      6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½ SM
      or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway approach
      lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs,
      PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
      6.42.3.4. Variable visibility/ceiling reports. If variable visibilities/ceilings are reported,
      pilots may use the greatest value reported. If it is subsequently determined that weather
      is below minimums for the approach, comply with paragraph 6.42.10. Do not attempt
      further approaches until the lowest visibility/ceiling reported is at/above approach
      minimums.
   6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
      6.42.4.1. If full flight instrumentation is not available and operational, aircraft are limited
      to a DA/MDA based on a HATh (height above threshold) of 300 feet and RVR 4000, or
      ¾ mile visibility (1220 meters) with no RVR.
          6.42.4.1.1. Category I ILS. Full flight instrumentation consists of: dual flight displays
          (one flight director plus ADI repeat), complete differential pressure instruments,
          heading/compass systems, and attitude indicators in the pilot and copilot positions.
110                    AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         6.42.4.1.2. Full flight instrumentation for a precision approach radar (PAR) consists
         of: complete differential pressure instruments, heading/compass systems, and attitude
         indicators in the pilot and copilot positions.
  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision altitude for precision approaches will be as
  published, but no lower than 200 feet HATh.
      6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
      certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational
      procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
         ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
         arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
         clearance, who did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
         directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
         disengaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
         immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
         clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
         comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
         determines safety to be a factor.
  6.42.6. Aircrews are not authorized to fly RNAV(RNP), RNAV, RNAV (GPS); GPS; or
  "OR GPS" approaches until aircraft equipment is certified, aircrews are trained, and
  MAJCOM/A3 has issued operational approval.
  6.42.7. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC
  conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS and the ASRR. Back up
  each approach with available navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in SCNS.
  6.42.8. After Beginning Descent or Approach. IAW AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8, after
  beginning an enroute descent or published approach, and the weather is reported or observed
  to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option of continuing the approach to the
  MAP/DA. Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is
  received.
      6.42.8.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment
      is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
      6.42.8.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the
      approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel
      reserve.
      6.42.8.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
      designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               111


   6.42.9. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.9.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.9.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. NVG Approach and Landing.
   6.43.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG visual
   approaches, NVG visual pattern work, and crewmembers who are non-current and/or
   unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG aircrews may fly IFR approaches with
   weather at approach minimums.
   6.43.2. NVG Malfunction during Approach and Landing. If one of the pilots experience
   NVG failure on short final, it will be at the discretion of the PIC to transition to normal lights
   or perform a go-around. The PM will be ready to immediately assume aircraft control if the
   PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H for
   additional NVG emergency information.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the PIC will immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather or maintenance problems, forcing the
members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DOD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) will be made by the local accounting
   liaison/OPLOC citing TWCF funds. The appropriate TWCF fund cite may be obtained from
   the local financial analysis and/or accounting liaison office. Normally, a BPA contract or AF
   Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization is already established at these locations to charge the
   routine lodging costs for transient or TDY individuals who are on TWCF funded travel
   orders.
   6.44.2. If the delay is at a location where DOD facilities are available and AMC TWCF
   funds are not available, the PIC will utilize AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice
   authority to acquire the appropriate lodging accommodations. Upon return to home station,
   the PIC will send the AF Form 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service
   members' group travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must
   accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF Form 15 has been
   validated, it will be forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for payment, citing the funds of
   the unit whose aircraft was delayed.
   6.44.3. If the delay is at a location where both DOD facilities and TWCF funds are
   unavailable, the PIC will utilize AF Form 15 authority to acquire the appropriate meals,
   quarters, and transportation to support the service members. Upon return to home station, the
 112                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   PIC will send the AF Form 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service
   members' group travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must
   accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF Form 15 has been
   validated, it will be forwarded on to the servicing OPLOC for payment, citing the funds of
   the unit whose aircraft was delayed. NOTE: This policy does not apply to those passengers
   on delayed TWCF organic aircraft who are in a per diem or space available status, except for
   those duty passengers on TWCF funded travel orders delayed at locations where TWCF
   funds are available.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance
support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the C2 agency. On all AMC and AMC-gained missions, notify 618 AOC (TACC)
Logistics Control (618 AOC (TACC)/XOCL).
   6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state
   lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 2000 feet above sea except
   for takeoffs and landings.
6.46. Border Clearance. The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base
or area command in accordance with DOD 4500.54G FCG, AMCI 24-101V16, Military Airlift –
Border Clearance, and AMC Aircrew Border Clearance Guide.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the loadmaster, but the PIC retains
       ultimate responsibility. When an aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic
       function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
          visas, when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
          immunization (shot record).
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the DOD 4500.54G FCG and paragraph 6.47).
   6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              113


     6.46.2.1. Enroute, the loadmaster will distribute personal customs declarations (when not
     accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. The
     loadmaster will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and
     prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
     6.46.2.2. Enroute, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
     which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
     proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
     completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
     intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
     manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
     center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property (loadmaster excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
     agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
     initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
     or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the DOD
     4500.54G FCG, General Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US
     military aircraft are immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs
     and safety inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and
     adhere to, any specific DOD 4500.54G FCG provisions for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
114                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he/she protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he/she intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
      6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
      Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified DOD 4500.54G FCG
      supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
      6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
      exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
      immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
      between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
      6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
      and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
      operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
      base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.
         6.46.4.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
             6.46.4.3.2.1. Customs Form 7507 (Passenger list not required).

                 baggage.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.2. One copy of the US Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
                 each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
                 observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                 representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
                 certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
                 not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                           115


               6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
               6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
               each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
               media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD 1854, Customs
               Accompanied Baggage, U.S., or Customs Form 6059B.
               6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
               debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
               discretionary examination of the baggage.
     6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
        6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the AC will ensure
        all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
        6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
     6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
        6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
        6.46.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying

        6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
        6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Aircrew Border Clearance Guide.
            6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
            milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
            and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
            personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other
            foreign material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and
            equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their
            accidental entry into the U.S.
            6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
            will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
            6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the DOD
            4500.54G FCG, or higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol
            treatment 30 minutes before landing.
            6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
            troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
 116                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held
              for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104/AR 40-12/SECNAVINST 6210.2A, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed
   Forces, January 24, 1992, DOD 4500.54G FCG, or as directed by higher headquarters.
   Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.
   Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board. The only exception is when
   mandated by DOD 4500.54G FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       NSN 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft. Wear leather or Nomex
       gloves while spraying.
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
          ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
          use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
          minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
          board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            117


6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify 618 AOC (TACC) or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include
   details of routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR and FDR power circuit breakers. This procedure keeps
the CVR from recording over itself and retains the FDR data. NOTE: Some series of the C-130
also contain the FLT/VOICE RECORDER – INHIBIT circuit breaker. If this circuit breaker is
pulled, the CVR and FDR will continue operating with external AC power applied to the aircraft.
6.50. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC
or designated representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or enroute stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire
   or remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
       6.50.1.1. Restricted Aircraft AFE Configuration. Configure IAW AFI 11-2C-130V3
       Addenda A.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following enroute crew changes, review AF Form
   4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required Dash 21 equipment has
   been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by maintenance,
   and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following enroute crew changes, review, sign, and
   date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Aircrew Flight Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and aircrew flight equipment and survival equipment have been certified
   as installed by Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel and that configuration documents match
   mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for
   over-water missions carrying children and infants.
       6.50.3.1. Anti-Exposure Suits. IAW Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135
       Section 135.98, Operation in the Polar Area and FAR Part 121, Appendix P,
       Requirements for ETOPS and Polar Operations, place at least two anti-exposure suits
       onboard aircraft for missions operating above 78 degrees North latitude and below 60
       degrees South latitude.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment.        Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an enroute station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an enroute crew change.
 118                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A3TL (or MAJCOM aircrew flight equipment
       office) and appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions. See paragraph 6.3.8.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A3AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC shall impound the aircraft immediately after landing IAW AFI 21-101 and contact the
controlling C2 agency for further instructions. If at an Air Force installation, the PIC shall
request impound from the appropriate maintenance authority.
6.54. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP GP for more information
concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.55. Overflying Enroute Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a scheduled
enroute stop (ANG Command Center for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command center for
AFRC-directed missions).
6.56. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.56.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft
   and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
   provides specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment
   aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock
   and seal the aircraft. If available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards
   employed by the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded
   classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              119


   6.56.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during enroute,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. A GSA-approved lock
   is required to store classified information IAW AFI 31-401. Encrypted COMSEC will only
   be transferred to authorized DOD personnel.
   6.56.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4 (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.56.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.56.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through NORAD
   on UHF 364.2.
   6.56.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air
   Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.56.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form781A).
   6.56.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.57. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.57.1. The maximum number of persons on the flight deck will be the minimum
   commensurate with the mission requirements. At no time will this exceed seven (unless
   otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement).
   6.57.2. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed behind the condition levers or on the
   throttle quadrant during critical phases of flight.
   6.57.3. Place only soft items on the top bunk.
6.58. Ordnance Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of
chaff/flares or the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:
   6.58.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for
   hung ordnance.

  6.58.2. A qualified crewmember will deplane the aircraft and check all chaff/flare dispensers
  for hung ordnance or damage. NOTE: ALE-47 flare squibs that fail to fire are not
  considered hung ordnance.
  6.58.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare
  cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
  personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD
  personnel can clear all hung ordnance.

                                            Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C-130 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), and specific MAJCOM security
publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning
hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The C-130 is a ―Protection Level 3‖ resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Integrated Defense. The following security procedures will implement AFI 31-101,
requirements for C-130 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient
   permanent lighting is not available. Post security forces IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
   7.3.6. Locking and Sealing. Lock or seal the aircraft during a ―Remain Over Night‖ (RON)
   on non-secure ramps (see paragraph 7.6).
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a
means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be
present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew
pre-preflight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another
aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management
IAW TO 00-20-1 Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and
Prodedures and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. Enroute Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate enroute security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and
 122                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


enroute security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home
station departure and should request updates from enroute C2 as required. If required, a
PHOENIX RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of two US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel
   status is determined by MAJCOM. When in the execution phase, the team travels in MEP
   status and is responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for the team‘s
   welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). Ensure security team members receive a mission
   briefing and aircraft egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15, United States Air Force
       Invoice.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DOD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC‘s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
       7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             123


       7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
       inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
       7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal). With classified equipment
       on board (i.e. defensive systems) the aircraft must be locked with a GSA approved lock.
       7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       a forced entry.
       7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
       thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include: aircraft wheel wells, and crew/troop O2
   service panels for unauthorized packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any
   suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security
   posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-130 is operating away
from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
       7.7.1.1. The Transportation Security Administration provides the latest guidance on
       passenger screening and carry-on allowances. The latest guidance can be downloaded
       from www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/index.shtm
          7.7.1.1.1. Aircrew must ensure thorough screenings are accomplished when
          processing passengers at locations without an AMC Passenger Terminal.
          7.7.1.1.2. Carry-on restrictions apply to all passengers required to process through
          the passenger terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC location. Carry-on
          restrictions do not apply to personnel not required to process through the passenger
          terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC locations. This includes:
              7.7.1.1.2.1. Aircrew members listed on the Flight Authorization for that mission.
              7.7.1.1.2.2. MEP for that mission.
              7.7.1.1.2.3. OSA/VIPSAM passenger not required to process through the
              Passenger Terminal (primary DV, spouses/party, aides, and security details only).
              7.7.1.1.2.4. Duty passengers on ANG/AFRC mission numbers.
          7.7.1.1.3. Consider baggage contained in areas not readily accessible in flight as
          checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers. This includes, but
 124                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


          is not limited to segregated baggage compartments, floor loaded baggage tied down
          with cargo straps/chains, palletized baggage, and baggage in baggage bins.
          7.7.1.1.4. Brief passengers, required to process through the passenger terminal, or
          equivalent when at a non-AMC location, that baggage in these areas will not be
          accessed in flight. If these passengers attempt to access checked baggage in-flight, all
          attempts shall be made to stop the passengers from accessing the baggage. Land the
          aircraft at the nearest suitable airport (preferably a military facility) with appropriate
          law enforcement personnel if needed. Request assistance in removing the
          passenger(s) and accompanying baggage from the aircraft. Comply with all law
          enforcement direction.
   7.7.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
       7.7.2.1. For AE missions, the MCD is the final authority for determining what medical
       items can be carried by/for AE patients.
   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
       7.7.4.1. Troops or MEP status crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
       tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
       the order of the troop commander or team leader.
       7.7.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
       of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.7.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission ―frag‖ as ―RAVEN in-flight arming required‖.
   7.7.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.7.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.7.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/PIC
       retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.7.4.1.
7.8. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.8.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01B, Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) and
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             125


   Destruction of Derelict Aircraft Objects, January 1, 2008, Title 49 United States Code
   Section 46501 and Title 49 United States Code Section 44903(e).
   7.8.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.8.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DOD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DOD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DOD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.8.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.8.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.8.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.8.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.8.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.8.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.8.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
 126                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DOD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
   7.10.6. In any suspected or actual hijack attempt, the aircrew basic objective is to get the
   aircraft on the ground as quickly as possible and keep it there.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-clear
transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set transponder, or if not under
radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500. Notify ground
agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to be armed by the mission
execution authority, the PIC will determine which crewmembers will be armed (at least one
flight deck crewmember and one loadmaster will be armed unless directed otherwise). All
crewmembers should know who is armed. The following procedures apply when arming is
directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew enroute, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               127


     7.13.1.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only .When arming of
     crewmembers is required by AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
     Personnel and MAJCOM publications, and the 136th AS Current Operations section will
     coordinate the following actions the day prior to departure. Current Ops will contact the
     136th AS Life Support section (DSN 238-2554), and have them pre-position weapons
     ammunition box, lock, and weapon holsters. Current Ops will also contact the Security
     Forces Armory (DSN 238-2219), and schedule a time, after crew report time on the day
     of departure to obtain weapons.
     7.13.1.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Upon report time on day of
     departure, crewmembers will obtain weapons ammunition box and weapon holsters from
     the 136th AS Life Support. Life Support will issue these items using an AF 1297,
     Temporary Issue Receipt. Crewmembers will then go to the SFS Armory, Bldg 901, and
     obtain weapons. SFS will issue the weapons using an AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue
     Receipt.
     7.13.1.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) 107 AW only. Upon returning to home
     station, Current Ops will coordinate with SFS Armory (DSN 238-2219) on a time, after
     landing that crewmembers can turn in weapons. Current Ops may delegate this to the Ops
     Supervisor for that day.
  7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
  identifying armed crewmembers when flying missions outside of hostile areas or as directed
  by AOR instructions. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from the C2,
  armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities if landing at an airfield outside
  of hostilities. When operating in a combat zone and AOR standards direct personnel to carry
  personal weapons the crew should fly with and carry weapons in a holster outside of the
  uniform and not concealed.
     7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
     identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
     checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, their military
     identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
     the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
     the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
     proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
     will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
  7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
  onload or offload duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
  are aboard that require arming, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a
  satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not
  be unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
  7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
     7.13.4.1. Aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
     available, normally the base armory.
     7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
 128                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


           7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft
           gun box.
           7.13.4.2.2. Stage aircrews should contact C2 for guidance.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should not normally be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crewmembers will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

                                             Chapter 8

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for worksheets, reports, and forms associated
with AMC operational activities. Consult governing instruction or contact wing, unit, or local
flight safety officers for assistance with safety forms.
8.2. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. The AF IMT 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and

       OG/CC and the airfield(s) where training is to be accomplished. They will then
       coordinate with the 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency to ensure adequate ground
       time is available at planned training locations to allow for planned training events,
       clearing customs, required crew rest, etc. Once complete, wing current operations will
       coordinate with 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency to re-cut the mission and add the
       training mission number(s) in GDSS.
       9.3.1.4. Upon initial arrival at the training location, close out the current line on the
       AFTO Form 781 and log the training time on the next line using the appropriate training

   9.9.3. Max-effort landing limitations & brake cooling procedures. A lack of consideration
   for the heat generated in the wheel brakes can result in fused or hot brakes leading to a
   possible tire explosion or fire. Crews are reminded to review the Dash -1 regarding use of
   wheel brakes and hot weather procedures. During training, the following procedures will be
   followed while conducting multiple max-effort landings using partial brake landing criteria:
 142                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   9.9.3. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Crews will not perform more than three consecutive max-
   effort landings without an approximately 10-15 minute airborne gear-down brake cooling
   period (i.e. rectangular pattern to a touch-and-go or low approach.
       9.9.3.1. Outside ambient air temperatures of < 35 degrees Celsius
          9.9.3.1.1. Crews will not perform more than three consecutive heavy weight max-
          effort landings (115,000 – 130,000 pounds) without an approx 15 minute airborne
          gear-down brake cooling period (i.e. VFR pattern to either a touch-and-go or a low
          approach to the main.
       9.9.3.2. Outside ambient air temperatures of > 35 degrees Celsius:
          9.9.3.2.1. Crews will not perform more than two consecutive heavy weight max-
          effort landings (115,000 – 130,000 pounds) without an approx 15 minute airborne
          gear-down brake cooling period (i.e. VFR pattern to either a touch-and-go or a low
          approach to the main runway).
          9.9.3.2.2. Crews will not perform more than three consecutive max-effort landings
          (<115,000 pounds) without an approx 15 minute airborne gear-down brake cooling
          period (i.e. VFR pattern to either a touch-and-go or low approach to the main
          runway).
          9.9.3.2.3. Crews should not terminate or conduct operations requiring extended brake
          application (i.e. ERO, seat swap, etc.) following a max-effort or no flap landing. On
          normal landings, crews should consider extending rollout to minimize the use of the
          brakes.
          9.9.3.2.3. (NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Crews should not terminate or conduct
          operations requiring extended brake application (i.e. ERCC, ERO, seat swap, etc.) on
          landings requiring significant use of brakes. Any braking above 60 knots, other than
          a momentary application to check the brakes, should be considered "significant use".
          Extra care should be taken after max-effort or no flap landings. On all landings
          requiring setting of the brakes for extended periods of time, use maximum runway
          necessary to minimize brake heating.
       9.9.3.3. If the crew observes the initial signs of possible brake overheating, consider
       taking off and leaving the gear down for at least a 15-minute gear cooling period (i.e. to a
       low approach or touch and go). If hot brakes are suspected, follow the Dash-1
       procedures and do not set the parking brake, but chock the nose wheel prior to ground
       evacuation/engine shutdown.
9.10. Actual Engine Shutdown and Airstart. Direct IP supervision required. One engine may
be shutdown at no lower than 2,500 feet AGL or MSA (whichever is higher) in daylight VMC.

recommendations are mandatory. Requires OG/CC approval when performed at units other than
the FTU.
9.12. Aborted Normal Takeoff. Direct IP supervision required. Authorized during formal
upgrade training in daylight. Crosswind component must be within the recommended zone of the
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              143


takeoff crosswind chart. Runway must be dry, hard-surfaced, and long enough to allow refusal
and takeoff speeds to be equal. Initiate the abort by stating ―REJECT‖ before refusal speed. Do
not practice aborts from touch-and-go landings. Do not shut down an engine due to simulated
malfunctions. Requires OG/CC approval.
9.13. Aborted Maximum Effort Takeoff. Direct IP supervision required. Authorized for AC
upgrades and above during formal upgrade training. Restricted to the main runway during
daylight. Crosswind component must be within the recommend zone of the takeoff crosswind
chart. Runway must be dry, hard surfaced, 147 feet wide and long enough to allow refusal and
takeoff speeds to be equal. Simulate a runway length less than CFL. Initiate the abort by stating
―REJECT‖ at or below a refusal speed based on simulated runway length. Compare the distance
traveled to runway length and point out the ramifications of operating with less than critical field
length. Cool brakes between aborted takeoffs. Do not shut down an engine due to simulated
malfunctions. Do not practice aborted max effort takeoffs from stop-and-go landings. Requires
OG/CC approval.
9.14. Maximum Effort Takeoff. ACs may accomplish maximum effort takeoffs. Maximum
effort takeoffs should be performed from the main runway when it is available (i.e., safe and
practical to taxi from an assault landing zone).
9.15. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Training. Crews will accomplish aircrew training according
to AFI 11-2C-130V1 and MAJCOM approved training guides before performing NVG
operations.
   9.15.1. C-130 Airland Training.
       9.15.1.1. Copilots may accomplish NVG landings under the direct supervision of an IP.
       9.15.1.2. Ground Operations Training. NVG combat offloads and ground maneuvering
       are approved. Lights will be kept to a minimum during all NVG operations. Blacked out
       (no-light) operations in the cargo compartment are not authorized.
       9.15.1.3. NVG touch-and-go landings are authorized. Pilots who are both Touch-and-Go
       certified and NVG Airland certified may perform NVG Touch-and-Go landings IAW
       paragraph 9.2. WARNING: Crews must be thoroughly familiar with the visual and/or
       aural cues required to identify the amount of runway remaining when performing Touch-
       and-Go operations.

                                           Chapter 10

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment. For additional guidance see the AMC C-CBRN CONOPS.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   initial radiation, and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a
   nuclear detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                          147


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, AGE, and material
  handling equipment (MHE).
     10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
     attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
     at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
     controlling OPORD
     10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
     reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
     aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
     the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
     landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
     engines and avoid running environmental control systems.                   Close aircraft
     doors/hatches/ramps, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal
     protective cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, and the attack
     is a missile attack, remain in the sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the
     attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
     10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
     contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
     and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
     contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
     the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
     10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. Aircrew Chemical Biological, Radiological,
     Nuclear (ACBRN) protective equipment contained in D-Bags is the in-flight protective
     gear for aircrew members. Aircrew CBRN equipment includes Aircrew Eye-Respiratory
     Protection (AERP) mask or Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM), filter blower and
     communication unit for above the shoulder protection. Below the shoulder protection is
     provided by CWU-66/P Aircrew Chemical Ensemble (ACE), butyl gloves, and cotton
     inserts. The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of items in the C-Bag, including a
     protective mask (MCU-2A/P or M50 Series), C2 series canister/M50 series filter (as
     applicable for each type of mask), an overgarment, boots, and gloves. The ACBRN
     equipment and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents. They do
     not provide nuclear blast protection. However, they do provide limited protection from
     radiological particulates as well as low level radiation from an RDD. Aircrew CBRN
     equipment requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and AFE
     expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination Control Area (ACCA).
     NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A or M50 series ground crew mask.
         10.3.2.1.1. ACBRN Equipment/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized D-Bags
         and C-Bags at home station as dictated in reporting instructions or SPINS. Aircrews
148                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         will ensure D-Bags and C-Bags are available at all times when issued for a CBRN
         threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag contents and correct
         sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACBRN Equipment Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft
         contamination is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the
         highest threat to aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid
         chemical agents is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only,
         and separate ground duties from air duties. For example, use a duty crew in GCE to
         conduct pre-flight inspection of the aircraft.
         10.3.2.1.3. ACBRN Equipment Wear During Flight Operations. As referenced in
         paragraph 3.7.1.1.3, it may be necessary to limit the FDP for aircrew members in
         IPE. The FDP of encumbered crewmembers should be limited to account for
         increased fatigue. Although adjustments to the FDP will be scenario dependent (i.e.,
         shorter FDP for high-intensity tactical operations), the maximum recommended CDT
         is 12 hours with an 8-hour FDP. An example scenario is for an auxiliary crew to
         preflight the aircraft while the flying crew dons IPE less than 1 hour prior to flight;
         the mission profile includes 8 hours of flight duty with no more than 2.5 hours spent
         in a low level profile. For missions that are less demanding, a longer FDP may be
         possible. Consider additional crew rest of up to 48 hours between back to back
         encumbered missions.
      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
      contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
      such as the ACBRN. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
      to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
      and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
      zone. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection; seal
      windows and doors, turn off HVAC systems, and use room above the first floor when
      possible.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination.    Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              149


          characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
          screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
          altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
          (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
          around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
          into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACBRN is
          recommended. Follow smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior
          contamination.
          10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
          equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
          assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
          government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Counter-Chemical, Biological,
      Radiological, and Nuclear Concept of Operations (AMC C-CBRN CONOPS)) describes
      a method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A3N.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACBRN equipment wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and
   countermeasures, in-flight diversion, plans for on-load/offload in the event of a ground
   attack, and plans for the return leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative
   scenario plans should also be considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency
   (normally through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as
   medical pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure or issue of dosimetry for potential
   radiological hazards. Medical authorities may also prescribe the use of post-exposure
   therapeutics to reduce the possibility of infection.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACBRN equipment will require use of the aircraft oxygen
 150                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   system to counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting
   offers the greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir
   levels must be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to
   calculate the required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACBRN equipment based on the alarm
   condition (See Airman‘s Manual AFPAM 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures,
   and refer to locally developed donning checklist contained in the D-Bag to ensure proper
   wear. When wearing the ACBRN equipment, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors
   will be kept in the upper left ACBRN equipment pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to
   descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-Line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a covered vehicle.
   Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to prevent contamination
   spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they will require assistance
   from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape and overboots
   prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags and properly marked IAW technical order requirements. Aircrew members entering the
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            151


   aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and
   ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
   entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/decontamination procedures.
   Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and
   overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACBRN, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. IAW JP 3-40, Combating Weapons of Mass
   Destruction, in a Contaminated Environment, USTRANSCOM may restrict the retrograde of
   contaminated cargo to ‗mission critical‘ equipment (as determined by the GCC and
   authorized by SecDef).
   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. USTRANSCOM policy states that patients, personnel, or
   casualties with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear
   warfare agents will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system.
   Decontamination must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of
   contamination. In rare cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical
   missions.    In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved GCC,
   CDRUSTRANSCOM, and SECDEF in consultation with DoD medical authorities.
   Additionally, patients with known or suspected or highly contagious diseases will not be
   transported within the patient movement system. In extreme circumstances there may be a
   requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical medical care.
   If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the involved GCC,
   CDRUSTRANSCOM and SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACBRN. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
   thermal stress caused by wearing the ACBRN. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
   performing in-flight and ground duties. Table 10.1. has degradation factors for wearing full
   GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACBRN. A more
   extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical,

NOTES:
1. If wearing MOPP 4, add 10ºF to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing
personal body armor in humid climates, add 5ºF to WBGT.
2. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if
possible.
3. Caution: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not
exceed
1 quart. The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and
hydration for
at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water needs will vary ±¼
quart/ hour.
4. NL=no limit to work time per hour.
5. For continuous work in temperatures above 80ºF, personnel will consume 2 quarts of
water.
   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACBRN equipment should only be removed if there is
   absolutely no vapor hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable
   levels of currently fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The
   aircrew must take every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on
   the flight deck area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid
   those areas for the remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an
   aircrew member or passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel
   aboard the aircraft will stay in full ACBRN equipment/GCE until processed through their
   respective contamination control area (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be
   parked in an isolated area and cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered in the AFTO Form 781A and an
   annotation will be made in the historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10 & 50-Foot Rules. The 10-foot rules was developed in order to provide guidance
   for protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or
   working in locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 50-foot rule
   was adopted for larger contaminated structures, such as contaminated aircraft and buildings
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                           153


   that generate more agent off-gassing. The 10/50-foot rules embody a safety factor that goes
   beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE whenever detectors no longer
   detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases associated with the 10/50-foot
   rules.
      10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
      whenever they stay within 10/50 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
      seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
      chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
      10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
      (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
      equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
      may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
      with agent residue is avoided.
      10.5.10.3. Table 10 2 shows "estimated" times associated with initial and follow-on
      phases of the 10/50-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose
      to use the worst case scenario as the foundation for all 10/50-foot rule actions, i.e., 24
      hours for the initial phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on
      phase.

                                            Chapter 11

                                NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide enroute C-
130 navigation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in AFI
11-202V3, AFI 11-217, and FLIP. Since airspace and associated navigational aid equipment
capability are rapidly evolving, aircrews must maintain an in depth knowledge of current
requirements/policies.
   11.1.1. Prolonged Loss of Contact. Aircrews must ensure they are following proper
   navigation crosscheck procedures to maintain airspace situational awareness.
       11.1.1.1. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
       points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication with ATC/radio
       operators. Additionally, crews must monitor both VHF and UHF Guard to the maximum
       extent possible.
       11.1.1.2. In the event of known or suspected loss of two-way radio capability, follow the
       communications failure procedures published in the FIH.
       11.1.1.3. In cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, attempt to reestablish contact
       using other aircraft to relay messages to ATC controllers.
11.2. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, GP, DOD 4500.45G
FCG, and AP, for further guidance). US Military aircraft and DOD personnel entering another
nation to conduct US government business must have the approval of the foreign government
concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are
obtained through US officials known as Defense Attache Officers (DAO).
   11.2.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
   airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial seas.
   Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state.
   Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland
   waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted in such
   areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
   11.2.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
   Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
   operating in international airspace. Therefore, sufficient information must be provided far
   enough in advance to allow compliance with DOD 4500.45G FCG requirements established
   by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond
   12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits, which
   differ from the standard.
   11.2.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
   information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international borders
   or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of
   the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             155


   11.2.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into
   territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend
   entry point(s).
   11.2.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
   departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance
   has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
   11.2.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
   penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
   country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
   11.2.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts to
   negate existing clearances, PICs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response will
   be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination,
   as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of
   flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should
   aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over sovereign airspace, which was
   not approved through diplomatic channels before mission departure, as being valid
   authorization.
   11.2.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will
   normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited
   before performing the critical portion of the mission.
   11.2.9. Aircrews normally are not tasked to and will not fly "due regard" routings unless
   coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2 and specifically directed in the mission
   FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option obligates the military PIC to be their own
   ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements
   dictate, PICs may exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will
   return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical. Refer to FLIP GP for additional
   guidance on due regard.
11.3. Navigation Databases / Flight Plan / Data Verification.
   11.3.1. The PIC and navigator will jointly verify routing, altitude, and fuel load prior to
   departure. On flight managed sorties, the PIC and the navigator will review the flight plan
   provided by the Flight Manager (FM). Any disagreements/discrepancies/requests for change
   will be coordinated with the FM. Navigator crew changes (engine running crew change or
   augmented crews) will include, as a minimum, a briefing on equipment status.
   11.3.2. When practical, plan the most direct routing possible or utilize wind optimized CFP
   routing to enhance fuel conservation.
   11.3.3. A MAJCOM-approved CFP, AF IMT 70, or AF Form 4116 C-130 Navigator Flight
   Plan and Log is required for all flights except local area training flights with an established
   standard procedure. A copy of the navigator's flight plan will be provided to the copilot to
   verify routing and aid in position reporting.
   11.3.4. A fuel plan is required for all flights except routine local area training flights where
   the fuel requirement has been verified.
 156                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   11.3.5. The navigator will sign in the indicated block on page 2 of the AF Form 4116 to
   certify accuracy of all entries. Any entries not required for a particular mission on the AF
   Form 4116 may be left blank.
11.4. Master Flight Plan / Plotting Chart.
   11.4.1. Flight Planning. General instructions for completion of AF Form 4116 are provided
   in this section. MAJCOM-approved computer flight plans may be used as a substitute for AF
   Form 4116.
       11.4.1.1. The AF Form 4116 was developed to provide a tool for all possible missions of
       the C-130. Most missions will not require all sections of the Form. In the interest of
       conservation navigators are encouraged to print and use only those sections of the AF
       Form 4116 required for their respective mission.
       11.4.1.2. Most entries on the AF Form 4116 are self-explanatory or explained below.
          11.4.1.2.1. HIGHEST ACC FL - Highest Acceptable Flight Level. This altitude is
          obtained from the appropriate aircraft performance manual.
          11.4.1.2.2. WPT - Waypoint. Use this column to indicate the number of each
          waypoint as entered in the aircraft computer.
          11.4.1.2.3. A/B - Ahead or Behind. Compare ETA based on the original flight plan to
          actual time of arrival (ATA) at each waypoint. Record the difference in this column.
          If the flight plan changes in-flight, non-applicable ATA spaces may be left blank.
       11.4.1.3. When an alternate destination is required, use a flight planning line to indicate,
       as a minimum, the name of the alternate and the time, course, and distance to the
       alternate.
       11.4.1.4. Aircrews may use ACFP, PFPS or any other MAJCOM approved flight
       planning program. On a flight managed sortie, the FM uses AMC certified ACFP to
       create the CFP.
   11.4.2. Equal Time Point Computations. During mission planning for all oceanic sectors,
   crews are required to calculate an ETP. Use the worksheet on the AF Forms 4116, page 2 to
   calculate the time to the ETP.
       11.4.2.1. First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF) are used in
       the ETP calculation. These are represented as the First Nearest and the Last Nearest
       airports in the ETP calculation. They are airports closest to the coast out and coast in
       waypoints that meet applicable destination alternate requirements except weather.
       Forecast weather conditions for LSAF/FSAF (ETA +/- 1 Hour) will meet or exceed
       minimums for the lowest compatible approach or 500/1, whichever is greater.
       11.4.2.2. Computations are required on Category I routes or Category I portions of routes
       when the total time between the last suitable airfield (LSAF) and the first suitable airfield
       (FSAF) is three hours or more. (see Figure 11.1).
       11.4.2.3. Re-compute ETP in-flight when the actual time of arrival at a reporting point is
       15 minutes or more ahead or behind the planned time if the change was caused by
       erroneous wind information.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              157


      11.4.2.4. Additional guidance on calculating an ETP can be found on the AMC/A3V
      web page in the Pubs section: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/publications.aspx;
      under Miscellaneous Documents.
   11.4.3. Charts. The navigator will flight follow on all missions using a suitable plotting
   chart (JNC, JNCA, or GNC). On missions that do not require plotting fixes, for situational
   awareness only, navigators may use FalconView moving map in lieu of printed charts.
      11.4.3.1. Show the following items on the chart:
          11.4.3.1.1. Navigator‗s name and coordinated universal date. Chart number and
          edition will be annotated on a stripped chart.
          11.4.3.1.2. Flight plan course line and waypoints (if not pre-labeled) will be
          annotated with waypoint number, identifier, radial and DME, or latitude and
          longitude.
          11.4.3.1.3. Annotate suitable emergency airfields. Optimum emergency airfields are
          located within 50 NM of the intended route. Refer to the GDSS/ASRR for suitability.
          11.4.3.1.4. Portions of Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ)/FIR boundaries (if
          not depicted accurately) pertinent to the route will be annotated.
          11.4.3.1.5. Annotate the approximate location of the ETP.
      11.4.3.2. Plot each fix or position along with the time at that position. Use standard
      symbols from AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation.
      11.4.3.3. In the interest of conservation, flight charts for high level missions may be
      reused whenever such reuse would not affect plotting accuracy of fixes or position
      determination.
      11.4.3.4. FalconView produced Lambet-Conformal charts may be used.
      11.4.3.5. On approach or departure, the navigator will monitor the aircraft position using
      an appropriately scaled chart (TPC, JOG, etc). Use the chart updating manual or host
      nation chart updating product to update charts within 10-NM of the approach, departure,
      emergency and divert bases for airfields without a DOD or an approved Jeppesen
      approach plate. FalconView generated charts with updated ECHUM overlays fulfill this
      requirement.
          11.4.3.5.1. In IMC or at night, the navigator will use all available navigational aids
          (including aircraft radar) to keep the aircraft clear of all obstructions.
11.5. Navigation Capability / Airspace Requirements.
   11.5.1. MNPS standards are established in FLIP. NOTE: Airspace and associated
   navigational aid equipment capability are rapidly evolving. Pilots must maintain an in depth
   knowledge of current FLIP requirements/policies.
      11.5.1.1. Aircraft that lose required equipment prior to oceanic airspace will return to the
      nearest maintenance repair facility.
   11.5.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is
   applied is considered special certification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft
 158                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   type must be approved for operations in these areas. Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2 and the
   following for RVSM requirements:
       11.5.2.1. Both pilots‘ altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
       the transponder, must be fully operational. The PIC will request a new clearance to avoid
       this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
       11.5.2.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise, except when circumstances such as
       the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
       11.5.2.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record the
       readings of both altimeters.
       11.5.2.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
       11.5.2.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
       other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
       11.5.2.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
       RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
       11.5.2.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
       equipment.
   11.5.3. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where RNP is applied
   is considered special qualification airspace. RNP airspace is being incorporated around the
   world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing separation requirements between routes.
   Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
   RNP-10 airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms
   malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment. C-130 aircraft is approved for RNP
   operations only with a qualified navigator at the navigator‘s station, but limited to operational
   time restrictions based on the navigation equipment.
       11.5.3.1. RNP-10. C-130 aircraft may operate up to 6.2-hours (after entering the NAV
       mode in SCNS) of flight in RNP-10 airspace without an update. If an automatic update is
       made, the aircraft may continue for an additional 5.7 hours in RNP-10 airspace after the
       update is complete. If a manual update (Radar update, etc) is made, the aircraft may
       continue for an additional 5.2 hours in RNP-10 airspace after the update is complete.
   11.5.4. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Airspace where BRNAV is applied is
   considered special qualification airspace. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5.
   Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
   BRNAV airspace and coordinate a plan of action. Document in the aircraft forms
   malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment. C-130 aircraft are approved for
   BRNAV operations only with a qualified navigator at the navigator‘s station.
11.6. Enroute / Flight Progress.
   11.6.1. The navigator will monitor the primary command radio unless directed to do
   otherwise. The navigator will record ATC clearances and monitor the read back. This will
   normally include all ATC instructions involving departure, en-route, and approach
   procedures. This procedure is not applicable when ATC instructions require immediate
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            159


   execution by the pilot, or when such action interferes with the timely performance of other
   time-sensitive navigator duties.
   11.6.2. Compute a TAS check on all Category I routes of three hours or longer. Use the
   procedures in paragraph 11.11.
   11.6.3. Maintain a flight log on Category I routes or route segments of three hours or longer.
   Time between fix/MPP plots will not exceed 1 hour. NOTE: Malfunctions or loss of
   navigational capability, which degrade course centerline accuracy, will be reported
   immediately to ATC.
   11.6.4. On Category I routes, when the time between the LSAF and FSAF is 3-hours or
   more, the following procedures are required: wind factors, ETP calculations, and in-flight
   fuel management.
   11.6.5. Heading deviation checks are not required on Category II routes, tactical routes, or
   on aircraft without compasses. On Category I routes or route segments of 3-hours or longer,
   compute heading deviation for each compass system as soon as practical after initial level-off
   or coast out. Record the deviation for all compass systems (see paragraph 11.10).
11.7. Laptop Computers. Laptop computers running FalconView moving map software and
connected to a handheld GPS provide invaluable situational awareness. Laptop computers and
handheld GPS must be approved for unrestricted use in flight IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   11.7.1. Navigators should carry a USAF approved laptop on all missions.
       11.7.1.1. Handheld GPS units should be connected and the FalconView Moving Map
       Display should be operating.
   11.7.2. Laptop computers with handheld GPS FalconView moving map displays will not be
   used as the primary source of navigation.
11.8. Flight Records. Flight progress will be recorded for Category I routes of 3-hours or
longer. Record enough detail to reconstruct the mission. Units may publish local standards for
log procedures in the unit supplement. See Figure 11.2 for an example of a completed AF Form
4116.
   11.8.1. This form will consist of planning and in-flight progress data. It will be completed in
   sufficient detail to fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. Page 1 of the form will be
   completed when a CFP is not available on Category I routes. Section IX, In-Flight Data, will
   be used to record present positions and spot readings. The procedures below are general in
   nature and designed to accommodate a wide range of C-130 navigation equipment
   configurations.
       11.8.1.1. As soon as practical after level-off or coast-out, whichever occurs latest,
       navigators will verify aircraft position by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
          11.8.1.1.1. Record the fix in AF Form 4116 Section VIII, Radar/NAVAID Data.
          11.8.1.1.2. At the time of the fix record the primary navigation solution and
          corresponding deltas (or Lat/Long) for all other navigation solutions in AF Form
          4116 Section VI, Fix/Computer Position.
 160                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


          11.8.1.1.3. At the time of the fix record, as a minimum, GMT, present position, true
          heading, spot w/v, TAS, altitude and ETA to the next waypoint in AF Form 4116
          Section IX, In-Flight Data.
       11.8.1.2. After coast out, record current position every 30 minutes on AF Form 4116
       Section VI, Fix/Computer Position.
          11.8.1.2.1. Record the present position for the primary navigation solution.
       11.8.1.3. Plot the current position every hour or within 10 minutes of crossing an oceanic
       reporting point, whichever occurs first.
          11.8.1.3.1. Record the GMT, current position of the primary navigation system, true
          heading, spot w/v, TAS, altitude, ETA to the next waypoint, and corresponding deltas
          (or Lat/Long) for all other navigation solutions.
       11.8.1.4. Between recorded positions, record spot readings at regular intervals to allow
       for calculating a DR in the event of a navigation system failure.
          11.8.1.4.1. As a minimum, spot readings will include: time, heading, drift angle,
          ground speed, spot w/v. The # block is used for spot TAS or for averaging
          computations.
   11.8.2. In the event of a navigation system failure (INU or GPS) full log procedures will be
   implemented. If the navigation system failure is resolved, the navigator may resume log
   procedures as outlined in paragraph 11.8.1.
       11.8.2.1. Beginning at the last plotted position, compute a Dead Reckoning (DR) up to
       the present position. A DR associated with the fix/MPP will be plotted on the chart prior
       to plotting the position. The DR line will consist of: the GMT of the DR, averaged
       ground speed, averaged true airspeed, averaged compass heading, and averaged drift
       correction. Spin elapsed time versus ground speed to obtain total ground distance. Work
       back from the average compass heading to obtain the true course. Plot the DR using true
       course and ground distance.
       11.8.2.2. Plot a fix/MPP at a minimum of once per hour. At the time of the fix/MPP
       record the GMT, current position, true heading, spot w/v, true air speed, altitude and ETA
       to the next point.
       11.8.2.3. Alter Heading (A/H) lines are optional. If used, record the GMT, true course
       worked forward to obtain a compass heading, spot w/w, spot drift, true airspeed, and
       ground speed.
       11.8.2.4. As soon as practical prior to coast-in, navigators will verify aircraft position by
       either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
11.9. Celestial Procedures.
   11.9.1. See AFPAM 11-216 for a comprehensive discussion of celestial concepts.
11.10. Deviation Check Procedures.
   11.10.1. Heading checks should be computed in Section V of AF Form 4116. Mid-time
   celestial heading checks may be recorded in the Section X. When a heading check is
   performed based on INS/SCNS, note that in the pre-comp area of the deviation checks
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            161


   section. The AF Form 4116 deviation checks format solves for "deviation" (DEV) for all
   heading reference systems. Some navigation computers such as the SCNS allow the
   navigator to input compass ―deviation.‖ In this case reverse the sign of the calculated
   ―deviation‖ to arrive at ―deviation correction‖ , which is then inputted into SCNS.
      11.10.1.1. Compass deviation is not necessarily constant over time or after significant
      course changes. Navigators will reconfirm deviation on Category I legs every 3 hours or
      after planned course changes of greater than 30 degrees.
      11.10.1.2. A deviation check is not required on flights transiting Category I routes of less
      than three hours if:
          11.10.1.2.1. The aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the
          standby compass is not considered a system for this requirement).
          11.10.1.2.2. The difference between systems does not exceed 2-degrees.
   11.10.2. Dual INS Heading Checks. Deviation check not required.
   11.10.3. Single INS/SCNS Heading Checks. Record and compare the INS/SCNS true
   heading with all compass systems.
   11.10.4. In order to obtain an accurate celestial heading check, the exact ZN must be
   derived. Exact ZN is obtained by interpolating using exact longitude, latitude, declination,
   and LHA. ZN may also be derived from SCNS immediate page and the subpoint of the
   celestial body used for the heading check.
11.11. True Airspeed (TAS) Check Procedures.
   11.11.1. Accomplish within one hour of initial cruise altitude. Record the time of the check
   and the altitude on the pressure altimeter. If using free air temperature gauge, record
   indicated outside air temperature (IOAT). Use the heat of compression table on AF Form
   4116 to convert IOAT to true outside air temperature (TOAT). If using SCNS temperature,
   record TOAT.
      11.11.1.1. TAS check not required for C-130H3 aircraft.
   11.11.2. Normally, navigators on all C-130 models can use 0 knots for indicated airspeed
   (IAS) to calibrated airspeed (CAS) correction and minus 3 knots for CAS to equivalent
   airspeed (EAS) correction for TAS above 270 (or minus 2 knots if less than or equal to 270).
   11.11.3. ITAS - Indicated TAS. Record the TAS reading from the TAS meter and the
   SCNS/INS or other computer (if the aircraft is so equipped). Record the difference between
   computed TAS and this reading in the CORR block.
11.12. In-flight Fuel Management Procedures.
   11.12.1. Record the fuel readings listed below at level off time and regular time intervals
   (coinciding with entries on aircraft performance record), not to exceed 1 hour and 30
   minutes. Use section VII, In-flight Fuel Management of the AF Form 4116 to complete in-
   flight fuel management computations.
      11.12.1.1. ETA DEST. Best known arrival time at destination.
      11.12.1.2. TIME. Time of the fuel reading.
162                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      11.12.1.3. TERMINAL FUEL FLOW.
      11.12.1.4. CURRENT FUEL FLOW.
      11.12.1.5. AVG FUEL FLOW. Calculate by adding terminal fuel flow to current fuel
      flow and dividing the sum by 2.
      11.12.1.6. FUEL REM. Fuel quantity at time of calculation. In the interest of safety, use
      the lower of the calculated or gauge fuels.
      11.12.1.7. O/H FUEL. Required overhead fuel (item 12 of the fuel plan).
      11.12.1.8. DIFF. Subtract O/H Fuel from FUEL REM.
      11.12.1.9. FUEL ETE. Calculate using formula in paragraph 11.12.2.3.
      11.12.1.10. ETE DEST. Subtract TIME from ETA DEST.
      11.12.1.11. EXT TIME. Subtract ETE DEST from FUEL ETE. Report this value to the
      pilot. If this is a negative value, check the computation and values for errors. If they are
      correct, evaluate your destination options.
  11.12.2. Use the following formulas to accomplish in-flight fuel management:
      11.12.2.1. [(Terminal fuel flow + Present fuel flow)] / 2 = Average Fuel Flow
      11.12.2.2. Present fuel - Overhead fuel = Usable Fuel
      11.12.2.3. Usable fuel / Average fuel burn rate = Fuel ETE
      11.12.2.4. Fuel ETE - ETE to destination = Extra Time
  11.12.3. AF IMT 4125, Range Control Chart may be used for in-flight fuel management.
      11.12.3.1. Manual Construction. (Figure 11.4)
         11.12.3.1.1. ―POINT NUMBER‖ represents the approximate level-off point (initial
         cruise altitude), 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of the flight plan distance as indicated on
         AF Form 4116 or CFP.
         11.12.3.1.2. To compute Column A, ―ENROUTE FUEL‖:
             11.12.3.1.2.1. Record in Block 1 (L/O) the AF Form 4116 Block 7. Takeoff Fuel.
             11.12.3.1.2.2. Divide the AF Form 4116 Block 1. Enroute Fuel by 4 and record
             that number in each -25% Enroute block.
                 11.12.3.1.2.2.1. Optionally, a more accurate method is to compute the fuel at
                 each point and subtract them to obtain the enroute fuel burn between each
                 point. Put this number in the corresponding -25% Enroute block. This
                 method takes into account the initial higher burn rates.
             11.12.3.1.2.3. Subtract this number going down the chart to obtain the enroute
             fuel at each point. (e.g. 1. L/O - 25% Enroute Block = 2 (25%) enroute fuel, etc.)
             11.12.3.1.2.4. The destination block will be takeoff fuel minus the full enroute
             fuel.
         11.12.3.1.3. To compute Column B, ―MINIMUM FUEL‖:
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             163


              11.12.3.1.3.1. Record in Block 5 Dest the AF Form 4115 Block 12 Required
              Overhead Destination Fuel.
              11.12.3.1.3.2. Divide the AF Form 4116 Block 1. Enroute Fuel by 4 and record
              that number in each 25% Enroute block.
                 11.12.3.1.3.2.1. Optionally, a more accurate method is to compute the fuel at
                 each point and subtract them to obtain the enroute fuel burn between each
                 point. Put this number in the corresponding -25% Enroute block. This
                 method takes into account the initial higher burn rates.
              11.12.3.1.3.3. Add this number going up the chart to obtain the minimum fuel at
              each point. (e.g. 5. Dest + 25% Enroute Block = 4 (75%) min fuel, etc.)
              11.12.3.1.3.4. This fuel is the minimum, at each given point, to fly from that
              point to destination with sufficient fuel to make a missed approach (if required),
              continue to the destination alternate, hold, make the planned approach, and land
              with 4,000 pounds of fuel. Minimum fuel will also include any identified extra
              fuel needed overhead the alternate (e.g., excess holding, for succeeding legs, etc.).
              11.12.3.1.3.5. Column C, ―DISTANCE‖: The flight plan distance for the given
              points listed in paragraph 11.12.3.1.1, obtained from AF Form 4116. This can be
              graphically depicted as either distance flown or distance remaining.
              11.12.3.1.3.6. ―DISTANCE FLOWN/REMAINING‖: Label the nautical miles to
              the destination along the horizontal scale. For distance flown, start with 0 at the
              left and allow the major blocks to represent convenient increments of mileage.
              The distance scale should be expanded to the maximum to give as large a
              presentation as possible.
              11.12.3.1.3.7. Draw a vertical line on the graph representing total distance to
              destination and label this line with the destination name. If required, plot vertical
              lines representing ETPs at the appropriate distance flown/remaining.
              11.12.3.1.3.8. Estimated Performance Line. Estimated performance is based on
              planned fuel at T/O, level off, and arrival plotted column A versus distance in
              column C. The difference between the estimated performance line and the
              minimum arrival line is contingency and identified extra fuel.
              11.12.3.1.3.9. Minimum Arrival Fuel Lines. A "minimum arrival" line will be
              constructed by plotting fuel in column B versus distance in column C.
11.13. Airborne Radar Approach Procedures.
   11.13.1. VFR Operations. Units will construct VFR ARA approaches IAW AFI 11-230,
   Instrument Procedures, and submit VFR ARA approach plates for approval to OG/OGV.
   During VFR, the minimum ceiling and visibility will be 1,500 feet and 3 miles. VFR cloud
   clearances will be maintained at all times while performing VFR ARAs. Publish approved
   VFR ARA approaches in local supplements. The local supplement should include SCNS
   ARA input data. If available, pilots will back up the navigator using a published instrument
   approach.
164                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      11.13.1.1. Navigators will load LZ information into the SCNS for all NVG airland
      operations. Navigators may modify existing approaches to meet this requirement. Units
      should publish local procedures in the unit supplement to this AFI.
         11.13.1.1.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) ARA approaches at Niagara Falls
         ARS are VFR only. The approaches have not been TERPS‘ed and are not approved
         for IMC operation. The ARA approach is depicted in the Niagara Falls In-flight
         Guide.
         11.13.1.1.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The Navigator will program ARA
         information into the SCNS for all approaches as a back up to the primary approach
         being flown.
  11.13.2. IFR Operations. Crews are only authorized to perform ARAs in IMC with a valid
  TERPS‘d approach. Weather minimums will be established by the approach, but will be no
  lower than 500-feet and 1 mile (300-feet and 1 mile for AWADS certified crews).
  11.13.3. Planning and Coordination. Prior to entering the terminal area, the navigator will
  coordinate the following items with the PF:
      11.13.3.1. Desired pattern altitudes and headings.
      11.13.3.2. Distance on final where descent will commence.
      11.13.3.3. Glide slope angle and initial rate of descent (normally not greater than 400-
      feet per NM). Refer to Figure 11.3 for descent rate examples.
      11.13.3.4. Minimum descent altitude and missed approach point/procedures. Missed
      approach will conform to published procedures for a useable approach, if able.
  11.13.4. Terminology and Procedures.
      11.13.4.1. Pattern Control. The navigator will advise the PF when positive radar
      identification of the airfield complex is made.
      11.13.4.2. The navigator will direct the aircraft by headings to the final approach course.
      For AWADS equipped units, navigators may advise the PF to intercept the bank steering
      bar (as required), when flying computer ARAs.
      11.13.4.3. During the approach, the navigator will advise the PF of the drift and
      groundspeed. If PFs can view this information on the selected SCNS/INS display, this
      advisory is not required.
      11.13.4.4. The turn onto base leg (if required) should be made to allow for a 10 NM final
      (or as required).
      11.13.4.5. The navigator will state the distance from touchdown each mile from the end
      of the runway beginning 10-miles out. A glide path warning should be given 10 seconds
      prior to the "begin descent point."
      11.13.4.6. The navigator will give heading information at least every nautical mile
      during the final approach.
      11.13.4.7. Use Chapter 5 procedures for required non-precision approach calls upon
      reaching the MDA.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                         165


      11.13.4.8. AWADS-equipped units are authorized to perform computer ARAs using
      AWADS equipment in VMC or IMC according to paragraph 11.13.1 and paragraph
      11.13.2 One OAP will be active on the radar until the field is called in sight.
11.14. Grid Procedures.
   11.14.1. Definitions and formulae. See AFPAM 11-216.
   11.14.2. Grid Log. The navigator will use page 6 of the AF Form 4116 when grid navigation
   procedures are required. Block entries are as follows:
      11.14.2.1. Time. Time of celestial heading/system heading observation.
      11.14.2.2. TH. Observed/computed true heading.
      11.14.2.3. CA/LONG. Enter +W -E longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle.
      11.14.2.4. GH. Observed/computed grid heading.
      11.14.2.5. GYRO #1, GYRO #2. On aircraft equipped with two independent gyro
      stabilized systems with numbers corresponding to aircraft systems (e.g. C-12 No. 1, N-1
      No 2), circled number denotes the primary steering gyro. On aircraft whose systems are
      not numbered or do not correspond to the aircraft system, identify the primary steering
      gyro in "REMARKS".
      11.14.2.6. GR. Gyro reading. Record the reading from the primary compass.
      11.14.2.7. PREC. The amount of precession since the last heading shot (period
      precession): GH - GR = PREC.
      11.14.2.8. RATE/CUM. The hourly precession rate based upon the precession indicated
      at the time of observation. Precession rate is derived from the period precession and the
      applicable elapsed time period (since the last compass reset). Example: 2 degrees
      precession in 40 minutes equals a 3 degrees/hour precession rate. This entry is required
      only when period precession is greater than one degree. The cumulative portion of the
      block is used for tracking the cumulative precession rate once a false latitude has been
      set.
      11.14.2.9. LAT. The mid-latitude between the current observation and the next proposed
      observation.
      11.14.2.10. FALSE LAT. The false latitude setting being used to eliminate precession.
      This entry is required only when a false latitude setting is used.
      11.14.2.11. RESET. Whenever a gyro is reset, place a check mark in this block.
      11.14.2.12. GC. Measured grid course to the next checkpoint.
      11.14.2.13. DRIFT. The number of degrees (+ or -) of drift.
      11.14.2.14. DGH. Desired grid heading. Apply anticipated DRIFT to GC.
      11.14.2.15. RT/2 CORR. See formula on the bottom of the AF Form 4116.
      11.14.2.16. IGH. Initial grid heading. Used for alter heading.
166                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      11.14.2.17. GRID ENTRY. Apply grivation (GRIV) to Magnetic Heading (MH) to
      obtain desired grid heading (DGH); or apply (LONG) or convergence angle (CA) to True
      Heading (TH) to obtain DGH. See formulas on the AF Form 4116.
      11.14.2.18. GRID EXIT. Apply GRIV to DGH to obtain MH; or apply LONG or CA to
      DGH to obtain TH. See formulas on the AF Form 4116.
  11.14.3. Grid Celestial Computations:
      11.14.3.1. When plotting celestial lines of position (LOPs) in grid reference, apply
      longitude (polar chart) or convergence angle to the true azimuth and plot the grid
      azimuth.
      11.14.3.2. When taking heading checks at high latitudes, it is advisable to place data into
      the periscopic sextant to give the true heading and convert this heading to grid by
      applying the assumed LONG/CA.
  11.14.4. Construction and use of the ZN graph is optional. The ZN graph is based upon the
  route of flight and dead reckoning. See AFPAM 11-216 for construction procedures.
  11.14.5. Departure Requirements:
      11.14.5.1. Polar true/grid courses as reflected in FLIP terminal charts will be used for
      departures in polar areas. Before takeoff, visually align the aircraft with the runway
      heading and set the polar true/grid course of the runway in the aircraft's directional gyros.
      The navigator will set applicable systems in gyro mode with the correct latitude set.
      11.14.5.2. After reaching flight altitude, determine the polar true grid heading and reset
      the primary and secondary gyros. The type of chart being used will determine whether
      the heading will be polar grid heading or convergence grid heading.
  11.14.6. Enroute Requirements:
      11.14.6.1. The Grid Entry/Exit section of the AF Form 4116 will be completed prior to
      heading reference changes. When entering grid operation, spot grivation should be
      applied to the computed magnetic heading to obtain DGH. The aircraft will be
      established on the computed magnetic heading prior to resetting the heading references.
      When exiting grid, the computed magnetic headings will be the target heading when the
      compass systems are reset. In both cases, the computed magnetic headings will be
      compared to the flight plan to verify the accuracy of the courses measured and conversion
      data used. This will ensure the validity of initial entry headings and provide precise target
      headings for exit.
      11.14.6.2. Normally, the grid heading will be checked each 30-minutes after grid entry.
      If the compasses are precessing 3 degrees per hour or less, hourly checks may be
      obtained after the first hour. NOTE: On aircraft with reliable SCNS/INS, if the
      SCNS/INS heading is within 2 degrees of the initial celestial-derived grid heading, the
      SCNS/INS may be used to determine gyro precession.
      11.14.6.3. Determine the precession information for each gyro after each heading check.
      When a gyro‘s precession is greater than 1 degree, reset the gyro to correct grid heading.
      When the period precession is 1 degree or less, the navigator may either reset the gyro or
      treat the precession as zero.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               167


     11.14.6.4. Whenever the period precession is greater that 1 degree (optional for 1 degree
     or less), the hourly precession rate may be removed by use of a false latitude setting.
     When the combined earth rate and gyro precession are less than +15 degrees/hour, the
     false latitude setting will totally compensate for precession. Two considerations are
     necessary:
         11.14.6.4.1. Predicted precession becomes zero.
         11.14.6.4.2. It may be necessary to adjust previous DR and air plot positions if the
         precession rate changes at subsequent heading checks. If this occurs, adjustments
         normally will be small and have negligible effect on DR and air plot accuracy;
         however, the effect should be considered.
     11.14.6.5. To determine false latitude correction, enter the earth rate table with the
     desired latitude and extract the tabulated earth rate value. Algebraically combine the earth
     rate value and the observed hourly precession rate (use cumulative precession rate once a
     false latitude has been set). Re-enter the earth rate table with the combined value and
     extract the corresponding false latitude.
     11.14.6.6. Only 15 degrees/hour can be removed by a false latitude setting. When the
     sum of earth and primary gyro precession rates exceeds +15 degrees, the navigator must
     artificially steer the aircraft (in effect, the aircraft will fly a gentle arc) to compensate for
     the amount of precession in excess of +15 degrees/hour. The formula used to correct the
     DGH to an initial grid heading (IGH) to fly appears on the AF Form 4116 as "RT/2
     CORR" (note that the formula produces a correction, so the precession rate must be given
     its opposite sign). The precession rate used in the formula must be adjusted to reflect the
     time period in the DR ahead. When "carrying" precession as suggested above, the
     navigator should consider several aspects of the navigational problem. NOTE: When
     precession exceeds 15 degrees per hour, consider the compasses unusable.
         11.14.6.6.1. If alter headings are not made at heading check times, precession will
         have accumulated by alter heading times and a correction (opposite sign of
         precession) should be applied to the IGH using the total precession correction portion
         of the AF Form 4116.
         11.14.6.6.2. If the precession rate changes at subsequent heading checks, it may be
         advisable to adjust previous DR and air plot positions described at paragraph
         11.5.7.6.
  11.14.7. Miscellaneous Procedures:
     11.14.7.1. Normally, when changing charts or crossing the 180 degree meridian, only the
     reference changes; the heading of the aircraft is not altered. The change is made by
     comparing the grid courses and applying the difference to the gyro reading (old chart GC
     350 degrees; new chart GC 331 degrees; GR 353; 350 - 331 = 019 = 334; reset the gyro
     to read 334).
     11.14.7.2. Do not use the combined rhumb line/coriolis correction when flying DG. Use
     only coriolis correction for celestial observations.
     11.14.7.3. Always recheck computations and formulas when a radical change in
     precession is observed.

      11.14.7.4. Grid qualified navigators will maintain proficiency in grid procedures.

    FLIGHT ENGINEER / AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General: This chapter contains flight engineer procedures not contained in the flight
manual, other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. The flight engineer is responsible to the pilot in command for all
inspections and procedures required by the applicable technical orders and regulations.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X
and qualified maintenance personnel are not available to clear it, the highest qualified flight
engineer on scene may obtain authorization to sign off the Red X from the home station
MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1. Other crew members
are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The flight engineer may clear Red Xs for
engine panels and covers, pitot covers, gear pins and SPR drains when qualified maintenance
personnel are not available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. The flight engineer is qualified and
authorized to accomplish these duties when maintenance personnel are not available. This policy
is designed for support of the aircraft and its mission while away from home station. The
applicable refueling and de-fueling checklists will be used during all refueling and de-fueling
operations. If ground support personnel are not available, the aircraft commander will designate
other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. A flight engineer may assist the normal
maintenance function when critical taskings dictate their use, provided this action does not
impact crew duty and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI. WARNING: Do not
load/off-load cargo containing explosives, oxygen, flammable gases or liquids during any fuel
servicing operations.
   12.4.1. Fuel Servicing Operations. Unless servicing JP-4, simultaneous servicing of fuel
   while loading passengers, cargo, performing maintenance, aircrew members performing
   inspections, or operating aircraft systems is considered to be a normal fuel servicing
   operation. If refueling/defueling with JP-4, Concurrent Servicing operations are required
   IAW TO 00-25-172. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform fuel
   servicing duties. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily
   available and the mission would be delayed.
       12.4.1.1. When crewmembers are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as the
       refueling team supervisor. Flight engineers will comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and
       applicable TO 1C-130xx series. Two other crew members are required to assist in the
       refueling, one for safety duties and the other to act as fire guard.
       12.4.1.2. Designate a current and qualified maintenance personnel or aircrew member to
       remain on the flight deck to monitor interphone and be prepared to broadcast a request
       for emergency assistance on a radio tuned to the appropriate agency with ready access to
       an emergency response team anytime aircrew members are in the aircraft and fuel
       servicing is being conducted. The PA may be used to direct passenger evacuation in an
       emergency.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                         177


     12.4.1.3. With passengers on board, a current and qualified aircrew member will be
     designated the passenger compartment monitor (PCM) and shall continuously monitor
     passengers during fuel servicing operations. PCMs will not perform other duties during
     fuel servicing.
     12.4.1.4. The PCM shall brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions, and
     hazards. Passengers will remain seated except for brief physiological needs, but will not
     wear seat belts. When possible, conduct this briefing prior to fuel servicing. If fuel
     servicing is in progress, the briefing will be given immediately after boarding.
     12.4.1.5. When authorized, passengers may board or exit the aircraft for the express
     purpose of loading for departure or off-loading upon arrival. Boarding or exiting must be
     opposite of fuel servicing operations. Once onboard, except for emergencies, passengers
     shall not deplane once fuel servicing commences.
     12.4.1.6. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
     12.4.1.7. The PIC, or designated maintenance/aircrew representative will advise PCMs
     when to evacuate passengers.
     12.4.1.8. The PCM shall set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the combat
     environment.
     12.4.1.9. The loadmaster shall ensure cargo loading or unloading does not jeopardize
     passenger safety. Winching is prohibited with passengers on board.
     12.4.1.10. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
     12.4.1.11. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e. wooden) pallets is
     authorized. Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel
     servicing. When loading vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either
     completely inside the cargo compartment, or outside of the established fuel servicing
     safety zone, before fuel servicing lines can be pressurized. EXCEPTION: Diesel and
     turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered vehicles can be on-loaded or off-
     loaded without having to stop fuel flow.
     12.4.1.12. The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing operations:
        12.4.1.12.1. Electronic equipment may be on and operated to include operations
        performed by aircrew members during required inspections with the following
        exceptions:
            12.4.1.12.1.1. Radar Altimeters and TACANs must be turned off.
            12.4.1.12.1.2. Radar may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off.
            12.4.1.12.1.3. IFF/SIF may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned
            off.

      12.9.5.5. Block 5-ENGINE START Z. Enter GMT of last engine started.
      12.9.5.6. Block 6-COND. Enter symbol depicting flight condition as follows:
         12.9.5.6.1. WU/TAXI/TAKEOFF-Indicates warm-up taxi and takeoff conditions.
         12.9.5.6.2. 1k Climb. Initial climb is indicated by symbol (1k). Secondary and
         subsequent climbs are shown as (2 k, 3k, etc.). The number here indicates sequence of
         condition in flight profile. This is also true of cruise segments and descents. Climbs of
         4,000 feet or less will not be recorded separately but will be included in preceding
         cruise increments. When constant climb is maintained to cruise altitude, use fuel flow
         reading taken at 2/3 climb altitude. When constant climb cannot be maintained to
         cruise altitude due to ATC clearances, etc., enter difference between sum of
         individual fuel quantity gage readings at beginning and end of climb.
         12.9.5.6.3. Cruise operating conditions are indicated by the number in cruise
         sequence and an arrow (1g, 2g, 3g, etc.). Instrument readings will be averaged for this
         period. Normally, cruise entries will be no more than 1 hour. However, the first
         cruise, the cruise immediately prior to enroute or step climb and/or the last cruise
         prior to descent, may be no less than 30 minutes, nor more than 1 hour and 30
         minutes.
         12.9.5.6.4. Descents are shown as (1m, 2m, 3m, etc.). Do not confuse descent with
         the final letdown that occurs when your landing procedures begin. The loss in altitude
         during final letdown is indicated by "L & T." Landing and taxi is that condition from
         the end of the last entry in the sequence of descents to engine shutdown on the ramp.
         Holding time, however, must be accounted for as an additional cruise (g) condition
         after descent when necessary. Descents of 4,000 feet or less will not be recorded
         separately but will be indicated in the preceding cruise increment. When descent
         exceeds 4,000 feet, blocks 10 through 18 need not be completed.
         12.9.5.6.5. Air-Air Refueling Tanker Operation, Air-Air Refueling Receiver
         Operation. Cruise, climb, or descent to refueling altitude (end this condition
         approximately at start of on/ offload of fuel.) Indicate AR and ARR 1, 2, etc., in
         condition block, for refueling condition. Blocks 10 through 18 need not be completed.

        or offload of fuel, a new cruise, climb, or descent condition will be initiated. NOTE:
        Rescue. search, storm penetration, combat/combat support, or any special mission
        which requires constant variations in altitude and airspeed may use the same
        procedures as air refueling operations. For this type of condition use an "S" in the
        condition block.
     12.9.5.7. Block 7-END. Enter GMT for end of condition.
     12.9.5.8. Block 8-SET. Enter increment time duration for the condition for
     WU/TAX/TO. All warm-up and taxi times will be entered in the circle of the SET block.
     Takeoff time is computed from brake release to the first change of power (when reduced
     power procedures are used, compute take-off time using 2 minutes).
     12.9.5.9. Block 9-TOTAL. Enter cumulative total time of SET time, excluding the
     warm-up and taxi times entered in the circle SET time.
     12.9.5.10. Block 10-OATI. Enter indicated outside air temperature reading.
     12.9.5.11. Block 11-OAT/VAR:
        12.9.5.11.1. OATC. Enter corrected outside air temperature as determined from the
        appropriate performance manual.
        12.9.5.11.2. VAR. Enter temperature variation from standard International Civil
        Aviation (ICAO) temperature.
     12.9.5.12. Block 12-HP. Enter the pressure altitude for the condition with altimeter set at
     29.92 Hg.
        12.9.5.12.1. For climb, enter HP for 2/3 the intended climb as soon as the altitude to
        which the climb is to be made is known. The entry (2/3 HP) reflects pressure altitude
        for 2/3 of the actual climb. If a climb starts at 15.000 feet and terminates at 30,000
        feet, you compute the pressure altitude for 2/3 of the 15,000 difference, which is
        10,000 feet. This HP added to the 15,000 foot beginning HP equals 25,000 feet HP,
        which is the appropriate entry for this climb.

12.10. HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT REPAIR PROCEDURES.
  12.10.1. General. This instruction establishes operational procedures for C-130 Hostile
  Environment Repair Procedures (HERP). Authority to use HERP is granted by OG/CC/CD
  for Operations when the aircraft is directed into a hostile or potentially hostile environment
  or in extreme cases where recovery of the aircraft or completion of the mission dictates their
  use. This authority is documented on the FRAG or Air Tasking Order. The OG/CC/CD for
  Operations may delegate this authority as necessary in cases where: (1) The unit is
  geographically separated from the parent unit, or (2) the unit is deployed or otherwise not co-
  located with the OG/CC/CD for Operations. All normal avenues of repair/recovery should
  be exhausted (when practical) prior to use of the HERP. Procedures identified with an
  asterisk (*) are not considered a HERP and may be accomplished at the discretion of the
  Aircraft Commander. When HERP are actually employed, inform MAJCOM Stan/Eval by
  letter. Include a brief description of the circumstances and conditions leading to the decision
  to approve HERP.
  12.10.2. Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK). A complete repair kit is prescribed in
  Table 12.1. Units will identify repair kit inventory and issue procedures in the unit
  supplement this AFI.
  12.10.3. Designated Hostile Environment Repair Procedures:
     12.10.3.1. Battery Dead or Damaged. WARNING: If the aircraft battery is damaged,
     disconnect and remove it from the aircraft. Use caution to avoid acid burns if the battery
     is leaking. When swapping batteries, the battery connector should be installed as rapidly
     as possible to preclude excess arcing.          CAUTION: When flying with a dead or
     otherwise disabled battery, ensure the DC Power Switch remains in the ―BATTERY‖
     position.        CAUTION: When installing or removing battery connectors and
     recommended jumper wires electrical arching is possible.           NOTE: If aircraft is
     equipped with an Emergency INS Battery Bus Tie Switch (TCTO 1C-130-1723) and has
     a serviceable INS/SCNS battery proceed to Step 12.10.2.2 NOTE: If another aircraft is
     available, temporarily place its operable battery (or INS battery when available) in the
     disabled aircraft until at least one engine is operating.

         actuator) start receptacle. (See Figure 12.7)
         12.10.3.14.4. If actuator is failed in the closed position, remove the actuator mount
         bolt from the fuselage and reposition the actuator to the INOP actuator position. (See
         NOTE 1, Figure 12.7) NOTE: This will position the door to 35 degrees open for
         engine start only. It must be positioned to the closed position prior to flight.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                          191


        12.10.3.14.5. If the actuator is failed in an intermediate position, install the dummy
        actuator rod. NOTE: This will position the door to 15 degrees open for engine start.
        12.10.3.14.6. Reinstall the heat shield blanket and secure the panel. CAUTION:
        During hot weather conditions, delay operation of the APU until immediately prior to
        engine start; then operate the APU only long enough to start one engine.
        CAUTION: APU operation in-flight with the door in the fixed flight position is not
        recommended since the door is part of the in-flight fire protection and provides fire
        containment within the fire proof area.
     12.10.3.15. *APU Fails to Rotate (Start Light Fails to Illuminate)
        12.10.3.15.1. Check the following items:

            12.10.3.25.6.3. When fuel flow drops to zero and RPM decreases, pull the
            Ignition Control circuit breaker.
     12.10.3.26. Failed Speed Sensitive Valve. CAUTION: This procedure will render the
     torquemeter shroud anti-icing system inoperative. Icing conditions should be avoided.
        12.10.3.26.1. Open the lower left side engine cowling on the affected engine.
        12.10.3.26.2. Disconnect the air supply line to the speed sensitive valve (see Figure
        12.8) at the bottom of the filter element installed in the line and install a #6 plug in
        the open line.      WARNING: Install only the AN806S6 plug stock number
        4730007629456. Using improper plug may result in a bleed air leak and engine power
        loss.
        12.10.3.26.3. Disconnect the torquemeter shroud anti-icing at the left side of the
        balance line fitting and secure it.
        12.10.3.26.4. Disconnect the line from the top side of the speed sensitive valve and
        connect it to the balancing line fitting where the torquemeter shroud anti-icing was
        connected.
        12.10.3.26.5. Secure any loose hardware then close and secure engine cowling.
        NOTE: Do not start the affected engine first. Select another engine for the first
        engine to be started in order to supply bleed air to the affected engine.
        12.10.3.26.6. Place the Engine Inlet Duct Anti-icing switch for the affected engine to
        ON.
        12.10.3.26.7. Start the affected engine while watching RPM and stand by to activate
        the Prop and Engine Anti-icing Master Switch.
        12.10.3.26.8. At 94% engine RPM, place the Prop and Engine Anti-icing Master
        switch to MANUAL. The acceleration bleed valves should close at this time.
        WARNING: When the Prop and Engine Anti-icing Master switch is selected to the
        MANUAL position, the engine anti-ice and prop anti-ice/de-ice systems will be
        actuated if their respective switches are turned on. These switches are normally
        turned on during the Before Takeoff Checklist but should be delayed using this
        procedure unless absolutely necessary for safe operation. Turning these switches to
196                    AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         the ON position with the Prop and Engine Anti-icing Master switch selected to
         MANUAL will activate the systems and rob the engines of torque. Overheating of
         the blade/spinner anti-ice/de-ice systems will occur if the aircraft remains on the
         ground for longer than the two cycle operating limit. NOTE: In this configuration
         the affected engine will have continuous anti-icing and an associated reduction in
         torque will be noted.
         12.10.3.26.9. After landing, shutdown the engine in NORMAL GROUND IDLE.
         CAUTION: Do not use ―LOW SPEED GROUND IDLE‖ during ground operations.
         To do so may cause the engine to stall/over temperature.
      12.10.3.27. Failed Fuel Shutoff Valve on Fuel Control
         12.10.3.27.1. Open lower left side cowling on affected engine.

         the fuel control (see Figure 2.8).
         12.10.3.27.3. Insert a small common screwdriver into the spline end of the fuel
         control and rotate in a counterclockwise direction until the fuel control opens. There
         will be no fuel leakage from where the actuator was removed.
         12.10.3.27.4. Close the engine cowling and secure all fasteners. NOTE: During
         engine start, abnormal situations such as excessive fuel coming from drain mast,
         tailpipe torching and a higher than normal start TIT can be expected.
         12.10.3.27.5. For engine shutdown, place the condition lever to FEATHER rather
         than GROUND STOP for the affected engine.
      12.10.3.28. Failed Engine Fuel Drip Valve NOTE: Prior to using this procedure, use
      enrichment on next engine start. The sudden surge of pressure should close the drip
      valve.
         12.10.3.28.1. If enrichment fails to close the drip valve, shutdown the engine and
         plug or crimp the drip valve drain line closed.
      12.10.3.29. Prop Fails to Rotate (No Light In Button) (GTC Equipped
      Aircraft). CAUTION: Insure the oil shutoff valve circuit breaker is set (in).
         12.10.3.29.1. If it is determined or suspected that no power is available to the starter
         button, proceed as follows:
            12.10.3.29.1.1. Select another engine which is not operating and close its bleed
            air valve. (This bleed valve must remain closed throughout the start cycle.)
            12.10.3.29.1.2. Start the defective engine normally while simultaneously holding
            in the starter button for the selected non-operating engine. Both buttons must be
            held in until 60% engine RPM.
      12.10.3.30. Prop Fails To Rotate (No Light In Button) (APU Equipped aircraft,
      Engine Ground Start Interlock Relay Defective)
         12.10.3.30.1. Pull the start control and oil shutoff valve circuit breakers.

         start.
      12.10.3.31. Failed Bleed Air Valve (Engine Fails To Rotate)
         12.10.3.31.1. Place the bleed air valve switch to ―OPEN‖. Open horse collar and
         ―tap‖ the motor mechanism on the bleed air valve.
         12.10.3.31.2. If the valve still fails to open, remove the motor from the valve.
         Manually open the valve and secure the lever to one of the mount holes with safety
         wire. WARNING: Once bleed air valve has been secured in the open position, it
         will not be possible to close the valve for wing isolation procedures. Engine shut
         down will be required to isolate the wing.
         12.10.3.31.3. Close the horse collar and attempt engine start.
      12.10.3.32. Failed Bleed Air Regulator (Engine Fails To Rotate)
         12.10.3.32.1. Pressurize bleed air manifold. NOTE: Bleed air regulators require
         bleed air to operate.
         12.10.3.32.2. Place bleed air regulator switch to ―OVERRIDE‖.
         12.10.3.32.3. Open horse collar and ―tap‖ the Bleed Air Regulator Valve.
         12.10.3.32.4. If valve still fails to open, manually lock the valve in the ―OPEN‖
         position. WARNING: Once the bleed air regulator has been locked in the open
         position, it will not be possible to close the valve for wing isolation procedures.
      12.10.3.33. Severe Fuel Leaks
         12.10.3.33.1. Fuel leaks caused from punctures or small arms fire can be plugged by
         using the wooden plugs and Pig Repair Putty from the HERK. If a high number of
         plugs are used, it may be necessary (as time permits) to break or cut them off near the
         wing surface to reduce drag.

                        CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The loadmaster coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or
the shipping agency; plans loads; provides in-flight services to passengers; and supervises
onloading or off-loading operations. Performs preflight and postflight of aircraft and systems
and computes aircraft weight and balance; provides for safety and comfort of passengers/duty
passengers (hereafter, included as passengers such as Space-A)/ troops, and security of cargo,
mail, and baggage during flight. Prepares and rigs equipment for airdrop, and participates in the
aerial delivery of equipment, supplies, and personnel.
13.2. Responsibilities for Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations:
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning (as required),
       computing load distribution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled
       departure. Before starting loading operations, they will advise the loadmaster of
       destination, size, weight, and types of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper
       positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affecting loading and offloading,
       and assign sufficient aerial port loading personnel for cargo loading. Aerial port
       personnel are responsible for safe positioning of MHE and cargo to or from the aircraft
       cargo door, ramp or auxiliary ground loading ramps. Under the supervision of the
       loadmaster, aerial port personnel will prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading
       equipment if the aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft, tie down cargo
       and equipment, release tie down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as required),
       certifying load plans, preparing weight and balance documentation, operating aircraft
       equipment, and supervising cargo tie down. The loadmaster coordinates with the loading
       crew supervisor to validate the cargo against manifests, supervises and directs
       on/offloading and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft.
       The loadmaster will notify the PIC, C2, or terminal operations officer if loading
       personnel are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during
       on/offloading. The loadmaster will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo and
       jettisonability prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft
       loadmaster and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it
       will compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders
       or USAF/MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM
       Stan/Eval through Stan/Eval channels. AMC personnel attach an AMC Form 54, Aircraft
       Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities. EXCEPTION: The loadmaster may
       deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of on/offloading, accommodate additional
       passengers, alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration and if practical to load to
       optimum aircraft performance CG without submitting documentation. The loadmaster
 208                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       must take into consideration the next station‘s cargo configuration requirements and will
       ensure the aircraft is in proper weight and balance limits. A new load plan is not
       required.
       13.2.1.4. The loadmaster is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for
       airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the
       loadmaster to use his/her best judgment based on training, experience, and knowledge to
       determine the best and safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise, they
       should seek the advice of other personnel (i.e., squadron, group, wing or MAJCOM
       Stan/Eval personnel).
          13.2.1.4.1. Non-standard cargo/equipment that exceed limitations, and/or requires
          excessive shoring, and is not contained in the aircraft loading manuals requires
          certification for air shipment. The shipper will provide a copy of the certification to
          the loadmaster prior to loading.         If the certification letter with loading
          instructions/requirements is not provided to the loadmaster the cargo will not be
          loaded. Contact Air Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA) or ASC/ENFC
          at Wright Patterson AFB, OH, voicemail (937) 255-2330/2547 or MAJCOM
          Stan/Eval for questions concerning cargo certification.
          13.2.1.4.2. IAW with ATTLA memo, dated 7 May 2002, certification memos prior to
          1993 are validated to include blanket airlift approval for C-130 airlift. ATTLA
          certifications for cargo remain valid until superceded or rescinded. Cargo offered for
          airlift utilizing an ATTLA certification is considered a TO 1C-130A-9, Chapter 6
          equivalent and will not be rejected for airlift unless safety is compromised or the item
          has been altered from the approved certification. One-time ATTLA airlift approvals
          are annotated on the certification letter. The aircraft loadmaster is the final authority
          in determining the validity of certifications on C-130 aircraft. If the loadmaster
          determines the cargo is incompatible with aircraft dimensions, a Cargo On/Off
          Loading Validation Worksheet following the procedures in paragraph 13.9 is
          required to be filled out and forwarded through Stan/Eval channels to HQ
          AMC/A3VX. State the reason for rejection or comments and recommendations that
          aided in a safe on/offload.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities in paragraph 13.2.1.1 and provides sufficient qualified personnel and MHE
   for on/offloading. Loadmaster responsibilities and authority are the same as described in
   paragraphs 13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.3.
   13.2.3. During JA/ATT, SAAM, USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the loadmaster
   can accept DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as valid pre-inspection of
   equipment being offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspector
   signatures (user and transporting force), may be used in lieu of applicable portions of the
   vehicle inspection portion of the applicable loading checklist. However, this does not relieve
   the loadmaster from ensuring accompanying loads are secured prior to takeoff. The DD
   Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous materials. This will be
   accomplished using the Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Safety aisles will be IAW AFI11-2C-130V3
Addenda A, C-130 Configuration/Mission Planning.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            209


   13.3.1. All passenger hand carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not
   obstruct the safety aisle(s). Any items that do not fit under a seat, or obstruct an aisle way
   will be stowed with checked baggage and secured for flight.
13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions. See paragraph 12.4.1 for Concurrent Servicing guidelines.
      13.4.1.1. The loadmaster will coordinate with aerial port personnel to establish loading
      times. Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence of events will
      be established, with PIC coordination, before the loadmaster enters crew rest. Loading
      time is governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk,
      palletized, etc.) not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels.
      When reporting for duty, the loadmaster checks in with the air terminal operations center
      or other designated location to obtain load brief and assist in load planning as required.
      13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. A consolidated
      statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
      available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
      cargo listing or load plan with Transportation Control Numbers (TCN) will accompany
      the load. NOTE: Computer generated load plans may be accepted for unilateral training
      loads.
      13.4.1.3. Tiedown equipment will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. If this is not
      possible, annotate the AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At non-AMC
      stations, 463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
      13.4.1.4. Fleet Service Checklist.
          13.4.1.4.1. Loadmasters will make every effort to ensure that the AF Form 4128,
          Fleet Service Checklist, is signed by the fleet service representative and placed aboard
          the aircraft prior to departure if this service is provided.
          13.4.1.4.2. Annotate inventory changes in section III. Place item nomenclature,
          increase/decrease amounts, station, date, and reason for change.
      13.4.1.5. Duty/Preflight Loadmaster Operations. These Loadmaster duties provide
      flexibility for operational requirements when units/crews are deployed on tactical,
      contingency or exercise operations. Preflight/Duty Loadmaster(s) will receive crew rest
      prior to assuming duty for preflight/loading operations. When assigned/scheduled to
      perform duties, all necessary preflight checklists will be accomplished for the
      assigned/scheduled mission for that aircraft. When sealing the aircraft after completion,
      an info note will be entered in the AFTO Form 781A, indicating preflight
      accomplishment, cargo compartment configuration and any additional information
      deemed necessary for the oncoming primary Loadmaster(s).                Primary aircrew
      Loadmaster(s) will complete AFTER LOADING GENERAL Checklist and verify cargo
      documentation is aboard the aircraft.
      13.4.1.6. Ramp Coordinator (RAMPCO) Loadmaster Operations: This duty may be
      utilized by Mission Commanders/mission execution cells for aircraft launch operations
      when deemed necessary. Duties may include load planning, mission preparation, or
      maintenance coordination for successful mission execution.
210                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      13.4.1.7. Wireless Headset Procedures. Per MAJCOM instruction.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions:
      13.4.2.1. Maximize seat availability on all missions.
         13.4.2.1.1. Port personnel will calculate the maximum number of seats available
         based on existing cargo compartment/Aircrew Flight Equipment configuration,
         aircraft configuration time and ground time available for each mission leg. This
         information will be calculated no later than 5 hours prior to takeoff time.
         13.4.2.1.2. If an actual seat release is different than what the load plan or port
         personnel indicate, aircrews will provide the port representative a reason for the
         disparity. Annotate information in Mission Remarks of appropriate database(s).
         13.4.2.1.3. The PIC or loadmasters will inform port personnel of any maintenance,
         crew complement, or operational mission requirements that will negatively affect
         number of seats available when port representatives conduct the cargo/passenger
         upload briefing. Late takeoffs due to configuration changes will be reported as
         Passenger Service/ reconfiguration for the reason on aircrew documentation.
      13.4.2.2. Manifesting. Passenger service or airfield management personnel manifest
      passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
         13.4.2.2.1. The PIC and loadmaster are responsible for ensuring all passengers are
         properly manifested.
      13.4.2.3. All passenger briefing(s) contained in Flight Manual(s)/checklist(s) will be
      accomplished for any mission with passengers aboard regardless of passenger category
      (i.e. DV, Duty passenger, Space Required passenger, Space available passenger, Mission
      Essential Passenger, etc.) or manifest documenting method (passenger manifest, flight
      orders, etc.)."
      13.4.2.4. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity it may be necessary
      for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this
      capability. These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring
      visa/passport requirements are met. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-
      hijack processing is completed by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207. Do not hesitate to
      contact 618 AOC (TACC)/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center (APCC); DSN 779-
      0350/0355, commercial; 618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as who may
      travel to specific locations or pass-port/visa requirements. Aircraft operating within other
      MAJCOMs which have operational C2 over that aircraft will contact the appropriate
      AMOCC for specific details. File a copy of the DD Form 2131, Cargo/Passenger
      Manifest, with the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the location of the
      manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-202V3.
      13.4.2.5. Ensure the APU/GTC is shut down prior to boarding passengers unless
      adequate ear protection is provided. A passenger service representative or crewmember
      will assist passengers at the bottom of the steps/stairs, and the loadmaster will assist in
      seating passengers. DVs, passengers requiring assistance, and families should be boarded
      first to minimize separation. Make every effort to seat families together. Ensure that
      only adult, English speaking, physically capable, and willing passengers are seated next
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            211


      to emergency exits. Do not seat mothers with infants, or children under 15 years old, in
      seats adjacent to emergency exits.
      13.4.2.6. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
      has the option to either hold the child or place him/her in a Department of Transportation
      approved Infant Car Seat (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through
      AMC owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all
      passengers (duty and space-A), regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own
      seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a dedicated seat allowing
      the use of an ICS at the sponsor‘s discretion; this mirrors current FAA (commercial)
      standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harnesses, and vest child
      restraints.
         13.4.2.6.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, secure the ICS to the seat
         using the seat belt. Adults will not hold the ICS during any phase of flight. In the
         event of turbulence or emergency landing, it is highly recommended for infants to be
         secured in an ICS. To prevent blocking an exit route, the ICS should not be used in
         an emergency exit/aisle (for missions equipped with airline style seat pallets) seat. If
         the aircraft is configured with side-facing seats, aircrew must ensure the ICS is
         adequately secured. The design of the sidewall seatbelt makes it difficult to remove
         enough slack to secure the ICS. Crewmembers may need to reroute the seatbelt by
         crossing the belt, between the sidewall and the seatback webbing, routing the belt
         back through the webbing and through the securing point on the ICS. When removing
         slack from the seatbelt ensure the buckle remains on one side or the other so that it
         can be easily accessed for release. The PIC is the final authority for determining
         whether the ICS is adequately secured.
      13.4.2.7. Decisions regarding eligibility or acceptance of a passenger with disabilities for
      flight need to be determined at the lowest level possible. Problems concerning eligibility
      or acceptance that cannot be resolved locally must be reported (circumstances,
      chronology, names, units, etc.) to HQ AMC/A4T. For time sensitive problems, telephone
      HQ AMC/A4TP DSN 779-4592 or 618 AOC (TACC)/APCC.
      13.4.2.8. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
      In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with CRG
      or deploying unit CC to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.
      13.4.2.9. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-101V14,
      Military Airlift Passenger Service. The loadmaster will ensure ATOC provides a copy of
      the AMC Form 70, RUSH Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of RUSH baggage.
      13.4.2.10. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet service and
      returned to the flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF Form
      3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt, is received from fleet service to relieve
      the loadmaster of meal accountability.
      13.4.2.11. Pillow and Blanket Distribution. Hand out pillows and blankets only when
      requested by passengers. At enroute locations, leave used pillows and blankets on seats
      for thru-load passengers. Do not mix used and unused pillows and blankets.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
212                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  13.5.1. The loadmaster is a key figure in good passenger relations. The following rules
  should be observed:
      13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
      13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
      criticism of other personnel or organizations.
      13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
      willingness to help.
  13.5.2. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often determine
  passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals;
  address them collectively only when making announcements.
      13.5.2.1. Ensure crewmember‘s and MEP‘s entertainment media (magazines, DVD, etc.)
      are of an appropriate nature.
  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures.
      13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
      judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
      one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
      concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep on cargo or
      baggage. Discourage passengers from congregating around galley and lavatory.
      13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on cabin temperature, passengers with small children,
      and cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
      13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with cargo or emergency equipment.
      Passengers will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
      13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
      make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary cargo compartment
      lights.
      13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the PIC. Use good
      judgment when requesting this authority. Refer to paragraph 5.3 for further guidance.
  13.5.4. Body Fluid/Bio-Hazard Clean-Up:
      13.5.4.1. Aircrew personnel are the first line of defense when human fluids/waste
      contaminate aircraft. Because of the potential health risk to passengers and crew,
      crewmembers will immediately clean-up, to the best of their ability, all body fluids/waste
      when it does not detract from their primary duties. Loadmasters will request troop
      commanders, team leaders, or traveling companions assist with the in-flight clean-up
      whenever possible. The clean-up will be accomplished using kits provided by fleet
      service and the procedures listed below.
         13.5.4.1.1. Cordon of the contaminated area if possible.
         13.5.4.1.2. Use non-sterile vinyl or nitrile gloves that cover part of the arm.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            213


         13.5.4.1.3. Wear safety goggles or glasses and an N-95 disposable respirator or
         equivalent surgical mask to protect the mucous membranes and inhalation of blood-
         borne pathogens that may exist.
         13.5.4.1.4. Wear disposable coveralls and footwear covers to protect skin, clothing
         and footwear if available.
         13.5.4.1.5. Apply paper towels or other absorbent material to the fluid to absorb the
         fluids and minimize the spill area.
         13.5.4.1.6. Use fluid from clean-up kit.
         13.5.4.1.7. Place all material into bag.
         13.5.4.1.8. Avoid touching the mouth or face area with soiled hands or gloves. Wash
         hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning or clean hands with a alcohol-
         based hand gel (at least 60% alcohol) when soap and water is not available.
         13.5.4.1.9. Annotate type of body fluid/bio-hazard cleaned-up and location in AFTO
         Form 781A, Aircraft Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
         13.5.4.1.10. When it is not possible for aircrew personnel or passengers to clean-up
         during flight, fleet service (or maintenance personnel at locations without Fleet
         Service) will be notified prior to landing.
         13.5.4.1.11. When deploying to a COCOM or location without Fleet service
         capability, coordinate with local Fleet Service to build and deliver kits. Number of
         kits will be determined by tasked unit personnel.
  13.5.5. Meal Service.
     13.5.5.1. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the passenger‘s
     AMC Form 148, AMC Boarding Pass/Ticket.
     13.5.5.2. Box Meals. After takeoff, distribute box meals to passengers who boarded at
     the previous station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and more
     passengers board at subsequent stations. Frozen/Cooked meals will not be accepted for
     passengers. Box meals should be served in the following sequence:
         13.5.5.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
         13.5.5.2.2. Distinguished Visitors.
         13.5.5.2.3. All other passengers.
     13.5.5.3. Do not serve liquids or hot foods during turbulence.
     13.5.5.4. When purchased meals are not furnished to passenger(s), the loadmaster will
     annotate the individual‘s AMC Form 148, AMC Boarding Pass/Ticket to reflect
     reimbursement is authorized. Inform the passenger(s) they may receive refunds at the
     passenger service counter at the next station, originating location, or destination terminal.
     13.5.5.5. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on TWCF funded
     missions (including AFRC flown missions) for passenger consumption only.
     Complimentary snacks are not authorized on JA/ATT, Joint Chief of Staff (JCS)
     exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port operations officer will ensure snacks
 214                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       and beverages are placed on board when departing AMC stations. When departing from
       other stations and no snacks or beverages are placed onboard, the loadmaster may obtain
       required snacks and beverages from the local in-flight kitchen.
13.6. Enroute and Post-Flight Duties.
   13.6.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound loadmaster is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound loadmaster is
   responsible for planning and loading the outbound load.
   13.6.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment,
   any missing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information
   pertinent to through passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous
   material, perishables, etc.). If unable to conduct a face to face briefing, leave written
   instructions with the cargo manifest or local C2.
   13.6.3. Assist passengers in deplaning. If BLUE BARK, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers
   are onboard, the loadmaster informs the traffic or protocol representative respectively.
13.7. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.7.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
   coordinate with the loadmaster prior to directing personnel to load any weapons. This applies
   to airborne assaults and airland missions.
   13.7.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized palletized location for redistribution on arrival at the
   objective. Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.
13.8. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for this aircraft according to
T.O.1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and AFI 11-2C-130V3 Addenda A. The unit possessing the
aircraft maintains the primary weight and balance handbook containing the current aircraft status
and provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft. The supplemental
handbook should be enclosed in a wear-resistant binder (preferably metal), stenciled ―Weight
and Balance‖ with the airplane model and complete serial number on the cover or a spine.
   13.8.1. The supplemental handbook will include TO 1C-130E-5, Basic Weight Check Lists
   and Loading Data, AFI 11-2C-130V3 Addenda A, sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4,
   Weight and Balance Clearance Form F—Transport/Tactical, and a certified copy of the
   current DD Form 365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record. Chart C will include
   the aircraft‘s basic weight, basic moment, and center of gravity. HQ AMC/A3V approved
   electronic weight and balance programs may be used for any mission.
   13.8.2. The loadmaster will file the original DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance
   Form F—Transport/Tactical, at the departure airfield and maintain a physical or electronic
   copy for the duration of the flight.
       13.8.2.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) During engines running crew changes, the
       on-loading loadmaster will prepare the Form F, using a standard fuel burn-off of 5,000
       pounds per hour.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             215


   13.8.3. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft will provide the
   information required to maintain current and accurate documents to the appropriate agency.
       13.8.3.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) When DD Form 365-4 is prepared at the
       aircraft; the loadmaster will return it to Base Operations for the pilot‘s signature if time
       permits. At Niagara ARS, the DD Form 365-4 may be given to the Operations bus driver
       who will return it to Base Operations. The DD Form 365-4 will not be given to
       maintenance personnel.
13.9. Cargo Validation On/Offloading Procedures and Format. Use the following format
when tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any cargo you feel
requires special or specific on/offloading or tiedown procedures not currently listed in TO 1C-
130A-9. After completion, send through standardization channels to HQ AMC/A3VX.
   13.9.1. General Loading Data:
       13.9.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number
       (NSN), and a brief description of the item; i.e., dump truck, medical van, etc.
       13.9.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture of
       the unit pointing out critical dimensions, projections, overhangs, etc.
       13.9.1.3. Weight (in pounds). Gross weight; individual axle weight; or data plate weight
       if possible.
   13.9.2. Number of loading crew personnel and loadmasters/s required to on/offload cargo
   and their position to observe clearances, if required.
   13.9.3. Equipment and Material Requirements. Special equipment and material required to
   on/offload cargo; i.e., cargo winch, prime mover, shoring requirements.
   13.9.4. Aircraft Configuration Required.
   13.9.5. Preparation of Cargo for Loading. Components that must be removed or
   reconfigured to on/ offload cargo (i.e., helicopter struts, exhaust stacks, cabs, etc.).
   13.9.6. On/offloading Procedures.
   13.9.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
   13.9.8. Comments.
13.10. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Refer to Chapter 17.
13.11. Rucksacks. The following procedures apply to loading of rucksacks. NOTE: Refer to
AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H for additional rucksack information.
   13.11.1. During administrative (training) deployments, rucksacks may be loaded on
   deploying vehicles or palletized.
   13.11.2. During tactical deployments into a FOB/OB, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will
   be carried by the individuals onto the aircraft. Allocate pallet space on the load plan for
   loading rucksacks.
13.12. Additional Cargo Considerations.
216                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  13.12.1. Lithium Batteries and Pyrotechnic Material (Class/Division 1.3G). Aircraft halon
  fire extinguishers are ineffective in fighting fires involving primary (non-rechargeable)
  lithium batteries and pyrotechnic material. Primary lithium batteries shipped as cargo or
  installed/contained in equipment and pyrotechnic material will not be accepted as cargo
  without the shipper providing a suitable fire extinguisher(s). For non-rechargeable lithium
  batteries this may be C02, Class D, or a specialized fire extinguisher (e.g., LITH-X). Dry
  chemical agent is preferred extinguisher for pyrotechnic material. These extinguishers will
  only help reduce the intensity of the fire until the lithium and pyrotechnic material expends
  itself. Aircraft halon fire extinguishers are suitable when transporting only rechargeable
  (lithium ion) batteries. Fire extinguisher requirements for non-rechargeable lithium batteries
  and pyrotechnic material do not apply to items being hand carried by troops during Chapter 3
  operations. NOTE: Aircraft potable water will not be used as a fire suppression system for
  lithium batteries or pyrotechnic material. Water presents a hazard to electronic equipment
  located in the center accessory compartment and ARO compartment and water, in less than a
  large quantity, is ineffective.
  13.12.2. ISU-90 Containers. If the person responsible for the container is not on board, the
  key or combination for locks on containers must be on the container adjacent to the lock.
  AMC inspectors and aircrew are authorized access on all cargo containers placed on AMC
  aircraft except when waived by HQ AMC/A3 for security reasons. Load plans must allow
  in-flight access in event of an emergency, or hazardous materials will be removed from the
  container. Some containers have built-in ―HAZMAT‖ access panels; however, when these
  containers are utilized, any hazardous materials must be positioned to permit access through
  the panel. EXCEPTION: See AFMAN 24-204/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO
  P4030.19I/DLAI 4145.3 for hazardous cargo not required to be accessible in-flight.
  Hazardous materials in the upper compartment of the container are inaccessible unless the
  adjacent pallet position is left empty to facilitate opening the doors.
  13.12.3. Commercial Cargo Straps. Do not use commercial cargo straps. The only
  authorized cargo straps are the CGU/1B, 5K air cargo strap, NSN 1670-00-725-1437, strap,
  webbing universal tiedown, NSN 5340-00-980-9277 (Army version of the AF CGU/1B, 5K
  air cargo strap) and the 10,000-pound restraint assembly, cargo, NSN 1670-00-406-2657.
  13.12.4. Ratchet device stamped: PECK & HALE, LLC, CGU-1/B 5000 LBS CAP. 94658
  6MRW/ 1465B with white unmarked strap will not be used. Remove any deficient devices
  found on the cargo/aircraft and turn them in to aerial port/maintenance personnel for final
  disposition.
  13.12.5. Defective/prohibited tie-down equipment. Remove and write-up in AFTO Form
  781 any tie-down equipment identified as unserviceable. Quarantine any tie-down
  equipment involved with an abnormal occurrence (releases, loosens, or breakage). Retain
  and turn in to Safety inspection team, aircraft incident investigator(s) or Stan/Eval for
  disposition. The aircrew experiencing the incident will fill out an AMC Form 97 and
  forward IAW paragraph 8.4.
  13.12.6. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) On aircraft scheduled for Aero-medical
  evacuation training, the heavyweight ballast pallet, when required, will be loaded in ―H‖
  compartment (FS 557). Loadmasters will install an additional two forward and two aft
  restraints. Ensure restraints are not adjusted so tight as to overcome the dual rail lock system.

                                            Chapter 14

                         FUEL PLANNING AND CONSERVATION

14.1. General. This chapter is designed to assist pilots, navigators, and planners in fuel
planning airland and airdrop missions, with or without low-level segments. A fuel plan is
required for all flights except local area training flights with established standard fuel loads. The
CFPS Computer Flight Plan (CFP) and TO 1C-130xx-1-1 are the primary preflight references.
Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage.
14.2. Fuel Conservation. Air Force policy is to conserve aviation fuel when it does not
adversely affect training, flight safety, or operational readiness. Aircrew and mission planners
will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will
be considered throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Comply with the
following whenever consistent with tech order guidance and safety:
   14.2.1. Fuel Loads. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight and
   increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
   mission accomplishment and training objectives.
   14.2.2. Flight Planning. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight
   routing for fuel efficiency; use optimized CFPs when possible.
   14.2.3. APU/GTC Usage. Minimize the APU/GTC usage to the maximum extent possible.
   Early coordination may be required to ensure external power carts and heating/cooling units
   are available.
   14.2.4. Center-of-Gravity (CG). Load and maintain aircraft at an aft CG whenever possible
   consistent with mission requirements and Flight Manual restrictions.
   14.2.5. Engine Start. Delay engine start on all departures whenever practical to minimize
   fuel consumption.
   14.2.6. Taxi. Consider engine out taxi when permitted by Flight Manual.
   14.2.7. Departure Planning. Consider use of opposite direction runway to reduce taxi and/or
   expedite departure routing if winds allow.
   14.2.8. Takeoff. Consider a rolling takeoff as well as reduced power when able. This saves
   fuel and engine wear. Clean up on schedule and don‘t delay gear and flap retraction.
   14.2.9. Climb/Descent. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power
   settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage.
   14.2.10. Weather Deviations. Attempt to coordinate for off-course deviation early so gross
   maneuvering is not required.
   14.2.11. Cruise techniques. Attempt to trim the aircraft and match throttle settings whenever
   possible. Fly fuel efficient speeds and altitudes to the maximum extent possible.
   14.2.12. Approach. Fly most direct routing to arrival approach consistent with mission
   requirements.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             219


   14.2.13. Holding. If holding is required, hold clean at the most fuel efficient altitude and
   request a large holding pattern. Hold at endurance or performance manual recommended
   holding speeds, conditions permitting.
   14.2.14. Parking. Consider using shortest taxi route and avoid double blocking when able.
14.3. Fuel Planning Procedures. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel
optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training
accomplishment.
   14.3.1. Reserve and Contingency Fuels.
      14.3.1.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
      required).
      14.3.1.2. Contingency. Fuel identified for unforeseen circumstances during any phase of
      flight (i.e. unforecasted weather, launch delay, etc). For all missions, other than local
      training missions, calculate 15 minutes of contingency fuel using destination gross
      weights. Local training missions are not required to carry contingency fuel. If
      contingency fuel is carried on local training missions, it should not exceed 15 minutes.
      Contingency fuel is not considered reserve fuel since it can be consumed at any point
      during the mission. Contingency fuel will be included in the initial RRFL calculation.
      14.3.1.3. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates
      providing maximum endurance at 10,000 feet MSL using the end of cruise gross weight
      (ECGW). If an alternate is required, compute using weight at alternate destination.
          14.3.1.3.1. For remote destinations, compute reserve and contingency fuel using
          consumption rates providing maximum endurance at 20,000 feet MSL using ECGW.
      14.3.1.4. ACFP will calculate reserves and contingency fuel in the holding fuel block.
      Computer flight plans will have 1+00 holding when combining 0+45 reserve and 0+15
      contingency fuel.
          14.3.1.4.1. For remote destinations, ACFP will plan 2+15 holding, combining 2+00
          reserve and 15 minutes contingency fuel.
   14.3.2. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or this publication require the
   filing of an alternate.
      14.3.2.1. When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting
      mission requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and AFI 11-
      202V3 weather criteria.
      14.3.2.2. If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting AFI
      11-202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
      14.3.2.3. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75
      nautical miles of destination. The ACFP default distance to an alternate is 75 nautical
      miles. Consequently, where the alternate is less than 75 nautical miles from the primary
      destination, ACFP will assume that the airfield is 75 nautical miles away.
      14.3.2.4. The practice of selecting an alternate in another weather system or selecting an
      alternate based on maintenance capability will not be used.
 220                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       14.3.2.5. ACFP will provide a route of flight to the primary alternate if greater than 75
       miles from the destination.
       14.3.2.6. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. A
       remote destination is defined as any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic
       location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time. In such
       situations, use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45
       reserve).
       14.3.2.7. When filing an alternate located in Alaska or at latitudes greater than 59
       degrees (North or South) do not add additional holding fuel.
       14.3.2.8. Units may develop standard alternate fuel requirements for local training
       missions however; these fuel requirements will not be less than those specified in this
       AFI. Local supplements will not dictate a standard ―IAF‖ or ―Top of Descent Fuel‖.
   14.3.3. Using all available planning tools (including ACFP) and guidance in this chapter, the
   PIC and navigator will determine the Required Ramp Fuel Load (RRFL). When actual fuel
   load exceeds the RRFL by more than 2,200 lbs, defuel the aircraft to the RRFL.
   14.3.4. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. MAJCOM C2 or 618 AOC (TACC)
   sanctioned tankered fuel is deemed operationally necessary, and will be included in the
   RRFL.
   14.3.5. When there is a conflict between an on-time departure and defueling, the 618 AOC
   (TACC) deputy director of operations (DDO) or MAJCOM C2 equivalent will determine
   which takes precedence. The OG/CC (or designated representative) will make this
   determination when serving as execution authority for the mission.
   14.3.6. For those missions that are flight managed by the 618 AOC (TACC) or 613
   AOC/AMD, when an aircraft commander believes the fuel load is insufficient to execute the
   mission:
       14.3.6.1. They will call the appropriate FM to identify and resolve differences.
       14.3.6.2. If the aircraft commander and FM do not reach agreement, the aircraft
       commander is the final authority on the safe conduct of the mission.
14.4. Fuel Requirements. This section augments AFI 11-202V3 fuel requirements. See Table
14.1. Additional considerations:
   14.4.1. Wing Relieving Fuel (WRF). WRF is additional fuel kept in the main tanks intended
   to counter wing bending moments. These wing bending moments are most pronounced with
   heavy cargo loads and lighter fuel weights. WRF is an element of primary fuel management
   essential for the long term structural integrity of the C-130. WRF is considered unusable fuel
   until the cargo is off-loaded (except in an emergency). In practical terms, it is the minimum
   landing fuel for a particular load in a specific aircraft. It is calculated using the appropriate
   TO 1C-130xx-1 Weight Limitations Chart to remain in Areas A-C from takeoff to landing.
   Currently, the cost of replacing wing boxes is greater than the cost of tankering additional
   fuel. All missions should takeoff in primary fuel management with the following exceptions:
       14.4.1.1. All mission profiles that include flying low-level will initially takeoff with
       main tanks full and maintain primary fuel management to reduce the effects of wing
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             221


      upbending and increase the center wingbox service life. The following exceptions apply
      to taking off with less than full main tanks:
          14.4.1.1.1. Secondary fuel management with fuel in the AUX tanks for heavy-weight
          assault training.
          14.4.1.1.2. Secondary fuel management with fuel in the AUX tanks for 'elevator lifts'
          out of an assault LZ.
          14.4.1.1.3. A mission necessity based on a real-world operation.
   14.4.2. Depressurization Fuel. Additional fuel required for pressure loss when carrying
   passengers and oxygen is not available or sufficient oxygen is not available for the crew to
   fly unpressurized at the planned altitude.
      14.4.2.1. Crews are to calculate the fuel required to reach a recovery airfield in the event
      of depressurization at the ETP. Additional fuel for pressure loss at ETP is used when
      pressurized, carrying passengers, and aircraft oxygen is not available to the passengers.
      Compute at 1,000 lbs/hr for time from ETP to a suitable airfield. Plan to be overhead at
      the recovery location with 0+30 minutes reserve fuel.
      14.4.2.2. Prior to flight, crews must compare the calculated depressurization fuel with
      the RRFL to determine if additional fuel is required. See Table 14.1.
      14.4.2.3. Depressurization fuel will be calculated in ACFP at 10,000‘ altitude. If
      additional fuel is required from the ETP, then ACFP automatically adds the additional
      fuel into block 10.
14.5. Fuel Planning. Navigators are allowed to fuel plan by either using the appropriate TO
1C-130xx-1-1 method or electronically by using CFPS. In addition, ACFP fuel plans provided
by 618 AOC (TACC) are authorized for determining required fuel loads.
   14.5.1. TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Fuel Planning.
      14.5.1.1. There are three distinct phases of flight for which required fuel quantities and
      or fuel flows must be calculated. These three phases are: initial climb out, start cruise and
      end cruise.
      14.5.1.2. When computing fuel using TO 1C-130xx-1-1, use the appropriate drag index.
      Standardized drag indexes may be established by local OGVs and published in local
      supplements. Use 95 percent engine charts and Section II of the AF Forms 4116 for
      computations.
      14.5.1.3. Use the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Part 4 Figures to extract Time to Climb
      (TTC), Distance to Climb (DTC), and Fuel to Climb (FTC). Apply the correct
      temperature deviation and correct for pressure altitude to compute all climb data.
      14.5.1.4. Using TTC and DTC, calculate climb TAS.
      14.5.1.5. Climb Fuel. In the climb section of the enroute fuel computation worksheet
      enter takeoff gross weight (TOGW), total flight time, and FTC in the appropriate blocks.
      14.5.1.6. Start Cruise.
222                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         14.5.1.6.1. Subtract climb fuel from the TOGW to obtain the start cruise gross
         weight.
         14.5.1.6.2. Subtract TTC from the total time to obtain cruise time.
         14.5.1.6.3. Enter the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Part 5 figure to extract fuel flow.
         Entering arguments are start cruise gross weight, pressure altitude and temperature
         deviation. Fuel flow extracted is per engine. Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four
         to arrive at fuel flow total.
         14.5.1.6.4. Divide the fuel flow total by 60 and multiply by the cruise time to obtain
         start cruise fuel.
      14.5.1.7. End Cruise.
         14.5.1.7.1. Subtract start cruise fuel from the start cruise gross weight to obtain end
         cruise gross weight.
         14.5.1.7.2. Enter the appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1-1 Part 5 figure to extract fuel flow.
         Entering arguments are end cruise gross weight, pressure altitude and temperature
         deviation. Fuel flow extracted is per engine. Multiply the extracted fuel flow by four
         to arrive at fuel flow total. This is also the terminal fuel flow (TFF).
      14.5.1.8. Average Cruise Fuel Flow.
         14.5.1.8.1. Average the start cruise and end cruise fuel flow to obtain the average
         cruise fuel flow.
         14.5.1.8.2. Divide the fuel flow total by 60 and multiply by the cruise time to obtain
         cruise zone fuel total.
      14.5.1.9. Total enroute fuel. Add the FTC to the cruise zone fuel total to determine total
      enroute fuel.
      14.5.1.10. Compute preflight endurance using the Average Cruise Fuel Flow. When
      computing preflight endurance, always subtract 1,300 pounds from actual ramp fuel to
      account for start, taxi and takeoff.
      14.5.1.11. For an explanation of how to compute maximum endurance fuel flow (MEFF)
      using the applicable TO 1C-130xx-1-1 reference the ―Maximum Endurance Fuel Flow
      How To Guide‖ at https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/publications.aspx under ―C-130
      Publications‖
  14.5.2. CFPS Fuel Planning
      14.5.2.1. For instructions on how to fuel plan using CFPS reference the ―CFPS Planning
      Guide‖ at https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/publications.aspx under ―C-130
      Publications.‖ Also, a modified electronic version of the AF Form 4116 (CFPS 4116)
      can be downloaded from the same website for use with CFPS fuel planning.
  14.5.3. ACFP Fuel Planning. ACFP flight/fuel plans are available to aircrew flying 618
  AOC (TACC) flight managed missions.
  14.5.4. Multi-Leg Fuel Planning. See Figures 14.1 and 14.2.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                                       223


        14.5.4.1. A multi-leg fuel plan becomes necessary when a mission includes multiple
        stops where fuel is unavailable. Use the following procedure for multi-leg fuel planning,
        assume a three leg mission with legs labeled 1, 2, and 3:
            14.5.4.1.1. Begin with the last leg (3) and fuel plan as normal to obtain required ramp
            fuel.
            14.5.4.1.2. Next, determine the fuel required for leg 2. Include the required ramp fuel
            from leg 3 as identified extra fuel for leg 2. Do not plan for contingency, reserve or
            alternate/missed approach fuel for leg 2 unless those totals exceed the required ramp
            fuel for leg 3. If this occurs, add the difference in the identified extra block for leg 2.
            Use 1,000 lbs. for approach and landing.
            14.5.4.1.3. Plan leg 1 using the same procedures you used for leg 2.
        14.5.4.2. Fuel requirements must be verified at each stopover airfield. Requirement must
        be recomputed whenever the planned burnoff changes; for example, enroute altitude
        changes, actual cargo/passenger load differs from the estimate, holding is accomplished,
        diversion to alternate is required, etc.
        14.5.4.3. Regardless of the number of mission segments involved, fuel planning is
        always accomplished by planning the last leg‗s requirements first. The remaining leg
        requirements are planned in the reverse order to be flown until the refueling airfield is
        reached.

Table 14.1. Fuel Load Components.
1. ENROUTE                      Fuel for flight time from departure to overhead destination or initial
                                penetration fix at cruise altitude (including time for planned orbit, escort,
                                search, recovery, appropriate climb, weather recon, etc. when applicable).
2. RESERVE                      45 minutes (2+00 hrs for remote destinations). Reserve fuel will be
                                computed using consumption rates providing maximum endurance fuel flow
                                at 10,000 MSL (20,000 MSL for remote destinations). For gross weight, use
                                end cruise gross weight (ECGW) from section II of the AF Form 4116. If
                                an alternate is required, compute using weight at alternate destination.
3. CONTINGENCY                  15 minutes. Use same fuel flow as reserve fuel above. (Not required for
                                local training missions)
4. ALTERNATE AND                Alternate: Fuel for flight time from overhead destination or initial
MISSED                          penetration fix to alternate, or most distant alternate when two are required.
APPROACH                        Compute at terminal fuel flow. Required whenever alternate must be filed.
                                Missed Approach: 2,200 lbs. Required if destination is below ceiling
                                minimums but above visibility minimums for planned destination approach.
5. APPROACH/LANDING             Approach: 1,000 lbs (2,000 lbs for high altitude approach). Entry always
                                required.
                                Minimum Landing Fuel: 4,000 lbs. Entry always required. This accounts
                                for gauge error. Do not include this 4,000lbs of fuel in the reserve and
                                contingency fuel calculations.
       STORED FUEL              Ramp fuel for succeeding legs without refueling.

      KNOWN HOLDING      Fuel for anticipated/planned excess holding time. Compute at terminal fuel
      DELAYS             flow.
      WING RELIEVING     Dependent on cargo weight and basic aircraft operating weight. Normally
      FUEL (WRF)         negligible below cargo weights of 35,000 lbs. Calculate required WRF using
                         the Weight Limitations Charts in appropriate TO 1C-130xx-1. Minimum
                         landing fuel of 4,000 lbs is included as part of the WRF total.
6A. DEPRESSURIZATION     Additional fuel for pressure loss at ETP - used when pressurized, carrying
FUEL                     passengers, and aircraft oxygen is not available to the passengers. Compute
                         at 1,000 lbs/hr for time from ETP to a suitable airfield. Add 30min of
                         reserve fuel. If computed fuel required for depressurization is less than or
                         equal the total of blocks 2 and 4 no additional entry required in block 6A. If
                         computed fuel exceeds the sum of blocks 2 and 4, add the difference in
                         block 6A.
7. TAXI AND TAKEOFF      1,300 lbs. Entry always required.
11. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA   Difference between required ramp and actual ramp fuel. When actual fuel
                         load exceeds the RRFL by more than 2,200lbs, defuel the aircraft to the
                         RRFL. See exceptions in paragraph 14.1.6.1. and 14.1.6.2.
12. MINIMUM DIVERSION    Total of ALTERNATE/MISSED APPROACH, RESERVE, WRF and

                                          Chapter 16

                                    MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter provides combat mission planning guidance for general C-130
tactical operations (Airdrop planning guidance is contained in Chapter 19). It provides
parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H. Mission
planning is normally conducted the day before the mission. The OG/CC or Sq/CC may elect to
use a ―same day mission plan‖ option. The aircraft commander is ultimately responsible for the
accuracy of the mission materials. Unit mission planning facilities should possess essential
mission planning material.
   16.1.1. In addition to this chapter, AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H, Chapter 2, must be referenced to
   establish a sound understanding of the intricate combat mission planning process.
   16.1.2. Mission Commander. Chapter 2 of this instruction specifies mission commander
   requirements and qualification criteria.
   16.1.3. Mission Timelines. Units will supplement this instruction with guidance for local
   and off-station timelines to include crewmember pre-mission showtimes. These timelines
   should allow for adequate pre-mission planning, especially while conducting missions away
   from home station.
16.2. Mission Planning. Planners will thoroughly study enroute threats, terrain, ingress and
egress routes, target areas, operations and communications security (OPSEC and COMSEC),
political and cultural characteristics, climatology, and any other factors that enhance mission
success. Intelligence and meteorology and/or climatology requirements will be identified early
because this information may not be readily available. Mission support requests will also be
processed as soon as possible to allow coordination and planning. The level of coordination is
dependent on available time and means of communication. Aircrews will be ready to operate in
the joint arena with little or no face-to-face coordination.
   16.2.1. Minimum Altitude Capable (MAC). MAC is the lowest altitude an aircrew can
   descend to when they detect or suspect a threat. It is dependent on individual aircrew
   capabilities, experience level, fatigue factors, terrain clearance, etc. Since maneuvering and
   navigation capabilities are virtually negated at MAC, descending to this altitude is only
   warranted as a defensive response to an engaged threat and only for the duration of
   immediate threat activity.
   16.2.2. NVG Mission Planning. One full day of planning should be allocated to missions
   that will operate in the NVG low-level environment. This planning may be accomplished by
   the pilot, navigator, or appropriate representative designated by the mission commander for
   formation flights. CAUTION: Some red obstruction lighting systems are visible to the naked
   eye but not visible though NVGs. These lighting systems employ LEDs instead of traditional
   incandescent sources. The use of LEDs is becoming more common for almost all lighting
   applications because of their energy efficiency and extremely long life. Aviation red light
   ranges from about 610 to 700 nanometers, and NVGs (having a Class B minus blue filter) are
   only sensitive to energy ranging from 665 to about 930 nanometers. Because LEDs have a
   relatively narrow emission band and do not emit infrared energy like incandescent lights, it is
   possible for them to meet FAA requirements for aviation red but be below the range in which
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            227


   NVGs are sensitive. LED lighting systems falling outside the combined visible and near-
   infrared spectrum of an NVG (approximately 665 to 930 nanometers) will not be visible
   through their goggles. Crews that fly using NVGs are warned to use extra caution when
   flying near obstacle areas and to report any hazardous sites to their appropriate safety and
   tactics officers.
   16.2.3. Rules of Engagement (ROE). The crew will be familiar with the established ROE.
   CJCSI 3121.01B, Standing Rules of Engagement for US Forces, applies and may be
   supplemented for the particular mission. Commanders at all levels may request changes to
   the ROE through the chain of command. Changes to ROE will be rapidly disseminated to all
   personnel.
   16.2.4. Evasion Plan of Action (EPA). Aircrews and/or planners with the assistance of
   intelligence personnel and Aircrew Flight Equipment/survival specialists will develop an
   EPA. An evasion plan may be included in the OPORD or SPINS.
   16.2.5. For other planning considerations, reference AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H.
16.3. Planning Restrictions.
   16.3.1. Assault Landing Zones (ALZ). OG/CC is the approval authority for the use of semi-
   prepared ALZs.
   16.3.2. Drop Zone (DZ) Restrictions.
       16.3.2.1. Locate subsequent Multiple Points of Impact (MPIs) a minimum of 500 yards
       from the previous Point of Impact (PI). If MPIs are placed laterally, increase the width of
       the DZ accordingly. Ensure the PI distance from leading edge complies with AFI 13-217,
       Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures. Compute minimum size DZ required for the
       most restrictive aircraft in each element relative to their PI to ensure it fits within the
       surveyed DZ boundaries. Limit the number of MPIs to three without MAJCOM approval.
       All aircraft within an element must drop on the same PI. The coordinates for each PI
       must be provided to the aircrews. Use the most accurate PI altitude available. Thoroughly
       deconflict and brief all salvo and escape procedures as well as DZ markings prior to
       mission execution. Only the first PI will be marked. The user accepts responsibility when
       employing MPI for all injury/damage to personnel/equipment.
       16.3.2.2. Use of unmarked DZs requires OG/CC approval for unilateral missions, and
       MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for all other peacetime training missions. Authorization to
       use unmarked DZs for contingency airdrops will be contained in SPINs or ATO. NOTE:
       Certain combat/contingency situations may prevent marking the DZ. Aircrews may be
       required to airdrop on unmarked DZs; however, supported units must be made aware that
       drop accuracy may be reduced. Planners and aircrews must thoroughly develop run-ins
       with good visual points for timing. Specific airdrop procedures are in Chapter 19 and
       AFI 13-217.
       16.3.2.3. Ensure coordinate format is DD MM.MM for correct input into SCNS. Using
       other formats will induce a navigation error with inaccurate PI coordinates.
16.4. Route Planning. The following factors significantly influence route development:
   16.4.1. Low Level Altitude Restrictions. The following minimum altitudes are established
   for C-130 airlift operations. FLIP/ICAO procedures, training considerations, terrain, or
228                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  operational directives may dictate higher altitudes. CAUTION: Some charts may depict
  terrain and obstacle altitudes in meters versus feet (e.g. JOG and TLM charts in some areas
  of the world).
      16.4.1.1. Tactical Corridor. Low-level flights will be planned using tactical corridors.
      Tactical corridors should be planned as wide as possible, to provide maximum situational
      awareness and flexibility. The standard width for a tactical corridor is 3 NM. Tactical
      corridor width can vary from 1 NM minimum either side of centerline, to as wide as
      desired (10 NM either side is the max recommended). Corridors do not have to be
      symmetrical, but must be annotated when different from the standard. As a rule of thumb,
      tactical corridors should be wide over flat terrain and narrow in mountainous terrain.
      16.4.1.2. Day VMC Enroute. Fly no lower than 500 feet AGL (or 300 AGL IAW
      paragraph 16.4.4.8) modified contour altitude above the terrain using visual references
      and radar altimeter.
      16.4.1.3. Night VMC Enroute (Non-NVGs). Fly no lower than an indicated altitude of
      500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or
      spot elevation), or 400-feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted
      terrain contour, whichever is highest, within the tactical corridor to include the aircraft
      turn radius over each turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current
      leg altitude, climbs will be completed before the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg
      is lower than the current leg, do not initiate descent until over the turn point. Legs may be
      divided into segments for night altitude computations, depending on terrain differential or
      threats in order to allow flight closer to the ground. Once the obstacle or terrain feature is
      visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the
      next segmented altitude, if lower. See Figure 16.1.
      16.4.1.4. NVG Enroute. Fly no lower than indicated altitude of 500 feet above the
      highest spot terrain elevation, or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the
      highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within the tactical corridor.
      Aircrews must identify factor obstacles within the tactical corridor. If the aircrew does
      not visually identify the factor obstacles within the tactical corridor, the crew will climb
      to attain an altitude of 500 feet above the obstacle or avoid the obstacle laterally by 2
      NM. If the altitude for the next segment is higher than the current segment altitude,
      complete the climb prior to the segmentation point. If the altitude for the next segment is
      lower than the current segment, do not initiate descent until over the segmentation point.
      Once the controlling obstacle or terrain feature is visually identified and the aircraft is
      confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude. NVG
      modified contour will not be flown. WARNING: If either the pilots‘ NVGs, SCNS,
      pressure altimeter, or radar altimeter fail, climb to MSA until resolving the problem. In
      addition, climb to MSA to resolve any TO 1C-130xx-1 Section III procedures,
      commensurate with the tactical situation.
         16.4.1.4.1. Minimum altitude capable training will not descend below NVG enroute
         altitude for the leg/segment being flown. NOTE: Planning a route on a smaller scale
         chart, if available, significantly reduces NVG enroute altitudes. If the route has been
         planned on a smaller scale chart and night altitudes are verified, crews may fly the
         route at the lower altitudes referencing a TPC.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             229


Figure 16.1. Night VMC Enroute Altitude.




      16.4.1.5. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides
      additional terrain clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require interruption
      of low-level operations (route disorientation and equipment malfunctions or when either
      pilot must leave the seat during low-level operations, etc). Plan MSA at an indicated
      altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain
      feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest
      depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 5 NM of route centerline to include
      the aircraft turn radius. If the tactical corridor is > 5 NM of centerline, the MSA will be
      calculated for the tactical corridor width. An MSA will be computed for each leg, route
      segment, or entire low-level route.
      16.4.1.6. Minimum IFR Enroute Altitude. Compute Minimum IFR Enroute Altitude by
      adding 1000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstruction to
      flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation) within 5 NMs of route
      centerline (10 NMs outside the US unless 5 NM authorized by MAJCOM/DO). Round
      this altitude up to the next 100-foot increment. If the altitude for the next leg is higher
      than the current leg altitude, climb will be completed before the turn point. If the altitude
      for the next leg is lower, do not initiate descent until over the turn point.
         16.4.1.6.1. Minimum altitudes for IFR operations within published Military Training
         Routes (MTRs) in US sovereign airspace will be the computed leg MSA unless a
230                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         higher altitude is required by DOD FLIP AP/1B, Area Planning North and South
         America.
      16.4.1.7. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is designed to provide positive IMC
      terrain clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low level structure.
      Several ESAs may be computed for route segments transiting significant terrain
      differentials or a single ESA may be computed for the entire low level route. To compute
      ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the elevation of the highest
      obstruction to flight within 22 NMs of planned route centerline. An ESA will be
      computed for the route and conspicuously annotated on the chart. NOTE: Climbing to
      ESA may put the aircraft or formation in a controlled (i.e., IFR) altitude structure
      requiring coordination with Air Traffic Control agencies. NOTE: Pressure altimeters
      are calibrated to indicate true altitudes under International Standard Atmospheric (ISA)
      conditions. Any deviation from these standard conditions will result in erroneous
      readings on the altimeter. This error becomes important when considering obstacle
      clearances in temperatures lower than standard since the aircraft‘s altitude is below the
      figure indicated by the altimeter. Refer to the flight information handbook to determine
      correction.
      16.4.1.8. When routes are flown at temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or less, apply cold
      weather temperature corrections to Night VMC Enroute, NVG Enroute, Minimum Safe,
      and Emergency Safe Altitudes IAW FIH Section D procedures.
  16.4.2. Airdrops will not be conducted below the following altitudes: WARNING: DZ
  surveys do not assure terrain and obstruction clearance. Planners and aircrews are responsible
  for ensuring clearance through mission planning/chart preparation. NOTE: In combat or
  contingency operations the supported unit commander may direct drops below the AFI 11-
  231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, altitudes.
      16.4.2.1. Day VMC Drop Altitude. Fly minimum day VMC airdrop altitudes as specified
      in AFI 11-231, visually avoiding high terrain and obstacles in the vicinity of the drop
      zone.
      16.4.2.2. Night VMC Drop Altitude. If not on NVGs, fly minimum night VMC run-in
      altitudes through slowdown, at an indicated altitude of 500-feet above the highest
      obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400-feet
      plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher,
      within 3 NM of run-in centerline. If on NVGs, fly NVG enroute altitudes through
      slowdown. In both instances (with/without NVGs), after slowdown, when the drop zone
      is in sight and will remain in sight, or when a positive position is identified and adequate
      terrain clearance is assured, the aircraft may descend from run-in altitude to drop altitude
      specified in AFI 11-231, AMT, SPINS, or mission planning sheet.
      16.4.2.3. IMC Drop Altitude. Fly minimum IMC drop altitudes at 500 feet above the
      highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or
      400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever
      is highest, within 3 nautical miles either side of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point
      to DZ exit point or as specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            231


         16.4.2.3.1. DZ Entry Point. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft is
         at or past the DZ entry point.
     16.4.2.4. Low Cost Low Altitude (LCLA) Resupply Drop Altitude. LCLA resupply drop
     altitude is dependent upon the type of parachute being used. However, it will not be
     lower than 300 feet AGL.
  16.4.3. Night VMC Tactical Approach Altitude. Compute IAW AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H,
  Chapter 7.
  16.4.4. Peacetime Route Restrictions. In addition to restrictions in AFI 11-202V3, specific
  country or theater of operations publications, and FLIP area planning, routes will not be
  flown:
     16.4.4.1. With less than 1 NM separation (3 NMs when in excess of 250 KIAS) when
     below 2000 feet AGL from known sensitive environmental areas such as hospitals, fish
     hatcheries, ostrich and emu farms, large poultry complexes, recreation areas, institutions,
     and similar locations.
     16.4.4.2. With less than 3 NMs separation from prohibited airspace.
     16.4.4.3. With less than 3 NMs separation from nuclear power plants.
     16.4.4.4. Through restricted airspace, except transition or termination in such areas
     where the planning unit is a primary using agency or has approval of the controlling
     agency.
     16.4.4.5. In weather conditions less than those specified in this instruction and AFI 11-
     202V3.
     16.4.4.6. Below 1000 feet AGL within a 2000 feet radius over cities or towns shown as
     magenta shaded areas on 1:500,000 (TPC) scale charts.
     16.4.4.7. Over or through active live fire or impact areas that may not be specifically
     designated as prohibited or restricted areas.
     16.4.4.8. Below 500 feet AGL unless:
         16.4.4.8.1. Host nation rules specifically allow such VFR operations.
         16.4.4.8.2. Routes or training areas have been environmentally assessed and
         surveyed for 300-foot AGL operations. NOTE: This restriction does not apply to
         one-time-use routes. Consult FLIP AP/1B for published Military Training Route
         restrictions.
     16.4.4.9. For the airdrop portion of all SKE missions filed under IFR, or for portions of
     IFR SKE routes flown in uncontrolled airspace, the mission command unit must comply
     with appropriate FAA exemptions. Provide a NOTAM to the FAA flight service station
     nearest the affected areas so that it is in-place at least 6 hours in advance of the intended
     activity, regardless of actual or forecast weather. NOTAM information will include:
         16.4.4.9.1. Name of the nearest city or town and state.
         16.4.4.9.2. Date and time period of intended activity.
         16.4.4.9.3. Number and type of aircraft.

          16.4.4.9.4. Altitudes.
          16.4.4.9.5. IFR Drop Corridor Ingress and Egress points of the route segment
          expressed in radial and DME from a VORTAC.
   16.4.5. Navigation Chart Preparation. Mission planners will construct a master chart for
   mission briefings and aircrew reference. Planners should construct the chart using
   computerized mission planning systems if available. MPD/Copilot and navigator
   crewmembers will use individual tactical navigation route charts for each mission. Low-level
   navigation charts will be annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information in the
   most recent CHUM or supplement. In no case will CHUM coverage be less than 22 NMs
   either side of the entire planned route of flight. Crews may trim charts to no less than 10
   NMs after establishing the ESA. Color copies, if available, of a master chart reduce the
   probability of missing or misplotted data on aircrew charts.
       16.4.5.1. Chart Annotation. Annotate the master chart with the applicable Chapter 11
       and AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H requirements. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H and AFPAM
       11-216 for detailed chart annotation symbology. An individual‘s chart annotations will
       have as a minimum: turn points, IP, DZ, course line, course data, CHUM data and date,
       ESA and chart series/date.
   16.4.6. Mission Forms and Logs.
       16.4.6.1. AF IMT 4053, INS Flight Plan and Log. An AF IMT 4053 should be used
       when planning tactical low level missions. A MAJCOM approved computer generated
       flight plan may be used in lieu of the AF IMT 4053.
       16.4.6.2. AF IMT 4051, Low Level Flight Plan and Log. Pilots will complete and use
       either an AF IMT 4051 or AF IMT 70 for all low-level airdrop/airland missions. A log or
       stick diagram containing the same information or an aircrew flimsy page containing this
       information may be substituted for the AF IMT 4051/AF IMT 70.
       16.4.6.3. AF IMT 4062, C-130 Run-in/Drop Information Card. Navigators/engineers
       will use the AF IMT 4062 to annotate pertinent information during all tactical airdrop
       missions.
   16.4.7. Route Study. Crew route study is mandatory before accomplishing flight in the low
   level environment. Special emphasis should be placed on the run-in and objective area for
   the locations of visual and radar features that will assist in proper identification.
       16.4.7.1. Drop Zone Safety Boxes. Drop Zone safety boxes will be identified and
       briefed for all airdrops to include both SCNS tolerances and visual references for the
       lateral and longitudinal boundaries. Safety box construction will be validated by a pilot
       or another navigator.
16.5. Briefings.
   16.5.1. Mission Briefings. The aircraft commander is responsible for ensuring all
   crewmembers are briefed on applicable mission items. The standard mission briefings can be
   found in AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H.
   16.5.2. Mission Debriefings. Hold immediately after the mission. The standard mission
   debriefing can found in AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                         233


     16.5.2.1. Aircrews should attend the operations and maintenance debriefings as directed
     by unit or mission commander. Maintenance debrief should be conducted ASAP after
     flight.
     16.5.2.2. Intelligence debriefings will be accomplished as soon as practical after mission
     recovery. Debriefings will be as prescribed in AFI 14-105, Unit Intelligence Mission and
     Responsibilities.

                                       EMPLOYMENT

Section 17A—-General Procedures

17.1. General. Planners and aircrews should reference AFTTP 3-1.C-130, Tactical
Employment—C-130, and AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H for additional mission planning guidance. In a
threat situation crewmembers must understand their limitations and those of their equipment.
These procedures are not all encompassing; therefore, aircrews are expected to use good
judgment, innovation, and common sense to successfully accomplish the mission. NOTE:
Certain technical information was intentionally omitted or generalized to keep this chapter
unclassified. Users should be aware that written additions to any portion of this document could
cause it to become classified.
17.2. Airfield Requirements. AFI 13-217 depicts the required markings for a landing zone.
These markings are desirable for tactical airland operations; however, full markings are not
mandatory on runways that are marked or lighted to make the touchdown zone and runway
distances readily identifiable, or if the tactical situation does not permit. The ground reception
party (ALCE, CCT) will provide communications and navigational aids based on requirements,
capability, and the threat environment.

Section 17B—Enroute

17.3. Navigation:
   17.3.1. Threats permitting, use all available aids (e.g., map reading, INS/GPS, TACAN) to
   remain position oriented.
   17.3.2. The pilots and other crewmembers as designated by the aircraft commander share
   responsibility for enroute navigation, terrain avoidance, and time control. During low-level
   operations, a composite crosscheck is paramount for the pilots to ensure threat avoidance and
   navigation are not done at the expense of basic aircraft control. The attention of the other
   crewmembers (navigator, observers) should be focused outside the aircraft, emphasizing
   threat detection and situational awareness. Limit duties which distract attention from outside
   the aircraft to mission essential items only.
   17.3.3. Maintain flight planned altitude using the best available altimeter setting, radar
   altimeter information, or terrain.

Section 17C—-Objective Area

17.4. General. Threat analysis, planning, and flexibility are key factors in planning combat
airland operations. See Chapter 16 for specific mission planning procedures.

Section 17D—-Approaches

17.5. General. Plan approaches to the ALZ IAW AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H and the airfield
identification procedures published in the OPORD or SPINS. Where multiple options are
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                           235


available, select the approach which best minimizes exposure to the threat while still allowing a
high probability of landing on the first approach.
17.6. Low Altitude Approaches. Use these approaches primarily when a low altitude ingress is
necessary. All maneuvering is done at low altitudes. Enter these approaches from any direction
at enroute altitude and airspeed. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H for discussion of
advantages/disadvantages and flight parameters for each arrival. These maneuvers may be flown
on continuation training and operational missions with passengers aboard. Plan to roll out on
final at approach speed no lower than 150 ft AGL.
   17.6.1. ARA. Use the following guidance when planning ARAs:
       17.6.1.1. Day VMC. Plan a minimum of 300 feet AGL modified contour altitude above
       the terrain using visual references from the IP to a point where the approach begins. If a
       high approach is used, mark a start climb point.
       17.6.1.2. Night VMC. Full ARA procedures should be planned for all night VMC
       tactical LZ operations IAW Chapter 11. Also, see paragraph 17.12.1.
       17.6.1.3. IMC. Except for contingencies, ARAs conducted in IMC must use approach
       plates published by the Defense Mapping Agency Aeronautical Center (DMAAC) or
       approved by MAJCOM. During contingencies, the MAJCOM/A3, or DIRMOBFOR may
       approve IMC ARA approach plates. Units must comply with any restriction in FLIP or
       the host nation agreement, and receive written approval from ATC and airspace
       management authority.
17.7. High Altitude Approaches. Use these approaches when a high or medium altitude
ingress is necessary and allow some reconnaissance of the field as you fly over. Base initial
altitude, airspeed, and heading on the threat. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H for discussion of
advantages/disadvantages and flight parameters for each arrival. These maneuvers may be flown
on continuation training and operational missions with passengers aboard. Plan to roll out on
final at approach speed no lower than 150 ft AGL.

Section 17E—-Ground Operations

17.8. General. This section outlines procedures to follow when conducting EROs. Crews
should spend minimum time on the ground when accomplishing EROs. Preparation and a
thorough briefing enhance your ability to operate quickly and safely. Brief appropriate ground
personnel and subsequent aircrews on unexpected hazards encountered during takeoff or landing,
e.g., dust, winds, hostile activity.
   17.8.1. Engine Running On-load and Off-load (ERO) Procedures. Use ERO procedures
   when necessary to expedite aircraft or cargo movement, meet time requirements of unit
   moves, joint training exercises, and contingencies or enhance crew duty day. The PIC is
   responsible for prior coordination with 618 AOC (TACC) or the controlling agency for
   approval for ERO operations as well as early takeoffs. With the exception of small arms
   ammunition (Hazardous Class/Division 1.4), do not use ERO procedures when explosive
   cargo is involved unless authorized in the JA/ATT, exercise operation or contingency air
   tasking order. ERO procedures may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo. Material
   handling equipment should be used if palletized cargo is to be on-loaded or off-loaded. PICs
   must assess prevailing weather, lighting and parking location to ensure safe operations. At
236                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  their discretion, PICs may ERO any category of passenger. The number of passengers and
  amount of baggage to be on-loaded or off-loaded should be taken into consideration.
  WARNING: Do not on-load or off-load through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp and
  door at the same time. Paratroop doors will not normally be used.
      17.8.1.1. General Procedures.
         17.8.1.1.1. PICs will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation.
         17.8.1.1.2. The parking brake will be set and at least one pilot in the seat will monitor
         brakes, interphone, and radio.
         17.8.1.1.3. Use wing leading edge and taxi lights to enhance safety at night as the
         situation dictates.
         17.8.1.1.4. Station another crew member on interphone or public address (PA) in the
         cargo compartment as safety observer. Safety observers will remain forward of all
         cargo.
      17.8.1.2. Offload Preparation/Procedures. Prior to landing, the loadmaster will brief all
      personnel in the cargo compartment regarding their locations, duties, and responsibilities
      during the ERO.
         17.8.1.2.1. Brief drivers offloading vehicles on the following items:
             17.8.1.2.1.1. Exact offload procedures and applicable signals to be followed.
             17.8.1.2.1.2. When cleared by the loadmaster, to assume their position. Actuate
             brake pedal sufficiently to ensure brakes are operational. Vehicles requiring a
             build-up of air pressure to provide brake pressure must delay pressure build-up
             until engine start.
             17.8.1.2.1.3. The loadmaster will direct vehicle engines to be started when the
             aircraft comes to a complete stop and the cargo ramp and door are open.
             17.8.1.2.1.4. Vehicle parking brakes will not be released until all restraint is
             removed and cleared by the loadmaster.
             17.8.1.2.1.5. Vehicles will proceed directly aft of the aircraft at least 50 feet
             before turning and/or 300 feet before stopping.
         17.8.1.2.2. Brief troops on the following items:
             17.8.1.2.2.1. Secure baggage aboard vehicles, if applicable.
             17.8.1.2.2.2. Deplane when directed by the loadmaster.
         17.8.1.2.3. Proceed directly aft of the aircraft at least 50 feet before turning and/or
         300 feet before stopping.
      17.8.1.3. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the loadmaster may remove all
      tiedowns except one forward and one aft restraint, open the aft cargo door, and lower the
      ramp to approximately 12 inches above horizontal. WARNING: If a combat offload of
      pallets is to be accomplished before offloading vehicles, do not remove any vehicle
      restraint until after the combat offload is complete.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              237


     17.8.1.4. After clearance from the pilot, the loadmaster lowers the ramp, and clears off
     headset to direct on-load or off-load operations.
        17.8.1.4.1. The loadmaster will direct all on-load and off-load operations using pre-
        briefed signals. Other qualified loadmasters (CRG, aerial port) may perform these
        duties; however, the aircraft loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the
        operation.
     17.8.1.5. Personnel on/offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.
        17.8.1.5.1. Passengers will be escorted by a crewmember or qualified CRG, aerial
        port, or airfield control (e.g. STT) personnel when enplaning or deplaning through the
        aft door and ramp.
        17.8.1.5.2. Auxiliary ground loading ramps should be used.
        17.8.1.5.3. Unless cargo size and location dictate otherwise, deplane passengers
        before cargo, and enplane after cargo.
     17.8.1.6. Personnel on-load and off-load through the crew entrance door:
        17.8.1.6.1. Station a crewmember (normally the loadmaster) on interphone with cord
        held taut at approximately 20-feet at an angle of 45-degrees from the aircraft axis.
        17.8.1.6.2. Brief deplaning personnel to secure loose articles and remain forward of
        the interphone cord.
        17.8.1.6.3. No enplaning personnel will approach the airplane until the loadmaster is
        in place.
     17.8.1.7. Upload Preparation/Procedures. Review the passenger and cargo manifests,
     crew lists, and complete DD365-4 for the subsequent sortie.
        17.8.1.7.1. Loadmasters may use the load plan total weight and load center of
        balance (CB) for entry on the DD365-4 provided these procedures are followed:
            17.8.1.7.1.1. The load plan data must be checked and validated by a qualified
            load plan validator i.e., aircraft loadmaster, aerial port specialist, or any individual
            who has completed the AMC Affiliation Program Airlift Planners Course.
            17.8.1.7.1.2. The load plan validator will legibly sign the signature block on the
            load plan with name, rank, and organization.
            17.8.1.7.1.3. The load must be placed on the aircraft exactly according to the load
            plan.
            17.8.1.7.1.4. Prior to flight, if there is any doubt on the accuracy of the load plan
            weight or CB, the loadmaster must accomplish the DD365-4 by station loading
            each individual item.
            17.8.1.7.1.5. If downloading to an empty aircraft, a DD365-4 is not required for
            the subsequent sortie.
     17.8.1.8. After completion of on-load or off-load, secure the ground loading ramp(s) in
     the installed position (if mission dictates), in the cargo compartment, or stow them in the
     aft cargo door.
238                    AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      17.8.1.9. AE Engines Running On-loads. For AE missions requiring engine running on-
      loads/off-loads, see Chapter 20.
      17.8.1.10. Ramp will be raised to approximately 12-inches above the horizontal position
      prior to taxi.
  17.8.2. Combat Off-load Procedures. The controlling C2 commander, MAJCOM
  A3/DO/XO or the commander, or DIRMOBFOR may authorize combat offload when
  conditions warrant. The method of combat offload will be determined by the aircrew based
  on the conditions at the offload site. Unit OG/CC may approve unilateral combat offload
  training.
      17.8.2.1. Cargo pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers can be offloaded without
      damage to the aircraft with the cargo ramp in the horizontal position. Use the following
      methods for combat offload operations.
         17.8.2.1.1. Method "A." Use this method to offload single, multiple, ramp or
         married pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers. Pallets, platforms, or CDS
         may be offloaded in a train like fashion or one-by-one as the situation dictates.
         WARNING: Many explosive items have specific "drop" criteria that, if exceeded,
         render the item useless or dangerous to the user. With the exception of small arms
         ammunition (hazard class and division 1.4), explosives and munitions shall not be
         combat offloaded without approval of MAJCOM/A3/DO unless rigged for airdrop.
         CAUTION: A taxiway or ramp at least 500 feet long is required, however, 1,000
         feet is desired to provide a margin of safety. When pallets, platforms, or containers
         are offloaded one at a time, use a longer taxiway based on the number to be
         offloaded.        NOTE: Combat offload of fragile and sensitive cargo items (i.e.,
         computers) that might be damaged by standard method ―A‖ combat offload
         procedures will not be attempted without user concurrence. If the nature of the
         mission dictates that cargo must be offloaded, aircrews may lower the ramp to
         approximately 18 inches above the ground.
             17.8.2.1.1.1. Single or double/triple married pallets may be offloaded, without
             ballast, using this method provided their total weight does not exceed 12,000
             pounds, and the height of the pallets fall within cargo height jettison limit in
             section III of the flight manual or Chapter 5 of the cargo loading manual.
             17.8.2.1.1.2. Airdrop rigged platforms up to 24 feet in length may be offloaded,
             without ballast, using this method provided their total weight does not exceed
             12,000 pounds. NOTE: Single or married pallets and airdrop rigged platforms
             over 12,000 pounds may be offloaded using this method, provided ballast or cargo
             equal to the difference between 12,000 pounds and the weight of the pallets or
             platforms (to be offloaded) remains in C through F compartments during offload.
             Example: A 17,000 pound married pallet or airdrop platform requires 5,000
             pounds of ballast or cargo to remain in C through F compartments during the
             offload.
             17.8.2.1.1.3. CDS bundles may be combat offloaded using this method. The
             static line retriever will be used via manual activation; manual gate cut may be
             done if the retriever is inoperative. With the Centerline Vertical Restraint (CVR),
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                          239


            offload must be accomplished one side at a time if the total bundle weight exceeds
            12,000 pounds. Non-CVR single stick may be offloaded if the total weight is less
            than 12,000 pounds. Without the CVR, if the total weight of the bundles exceeds
            12,000 pounds, bundles should be restrained in groups of four or less and
            offloaded one group at a time. For the unplanned combat offload of non-CVR
            bundles, restrain the bundles as described above. Perform an initial offload via
            the static line retriever, and on sequential offload remove aft restraint before
            clearing the pilot to taxi. Consider the slope of the offload site, which may cause
            bundles to roll aft upon removal of restraint. CAUTION: When using method
            "A" on excessively rough, sharply undulating, or battle-damaged surfaces,
            damage to the aircraft ramp may occur. Reducing forward taxi speed on these
            surfaces will reduce aircraft oscillation. The PIC must determine if the offload
            area will permit the offload operation to be conducted without damage to the
            aircraft or equipment.
        17.8.2.1.2. Method "B." Use this method to offload married pallets that do not fit the
        category for method "A" or for which no ballast is available for married pallets
        weighing between 12,000 to 15,000 pounds. Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon
        drums under each pallet to be offloaded. The correct number of steel drums needed to
        complete this type of offload must be available at the offload site or must accompany
        the load when conditions at the offload site are unknown. WARNING: The
        maximum weight for pallets to be off-loaded across the ramp at any one time when
        using method ―B‖ is 15,000 pounds for C-130E, and H aircraft. Do not use method
        "B" for airdrop-rigged platforms to prevent binding the platform under the vertical
        restraint rails.
     17.8.2.2. Aircrew Procedures:
        17.8.2.2.1. Prior to commencing combat offload operations, the pilot will brief each
        crewmember on the method to be used. Specific procedures are in the expanded
        checklist. The pilot will coordinate tasks.
        17.8.2.2.2. All crewmembers participating in the offload will refer to the checklist.
        Report any problem to the pilot immediately.
        17.8.2.2.3. If other individuals must be aboard to assist the crew in an unusual
        circumstance, give them a thorough safety and procedures briefing for the entire
        offload sequence.
        17.8.2.2.4. A safety observer will take position at the bottom of the flight deck steps
        on interphone and PA and transmit warnings through all speakers of the PA system to
        help the loadmaster enforce all safety precautions.
        17.8.2.2.5. The loadmaster will maintain constant interphone contact with the PIC
        and is the only crewmember authorized to operate the dual rail locks during combat
        offload operations. WARNING: During the entire offload operation, no one is
        permitted behind or beside the load unless the loadmaster checks that all rail locks are
        locked and engaged in the pallet detents or secures‘ each pallet to aircraft tiedown
        rings to ensure positive aft restraint. Always maintain forward restraint with the
        right-hand locks.
 240                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   17.8.3. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Apply the following procedures to ensure a safe,
   efficient loading method for the emergency airlift of personnel and aeromedical evacuation
   of litter patients from areas faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, for humanitarian
   evacuations, or when directed by the MAJCOM C2. See Chapter 20 for additional
   information concerning emergency airlift of litter patients.
       17.8.3.1. Emergency airlift normally is accomplished without the use of individual seats
       or safety belts. The maximum number of personnel who may be airlifted by seating them
       on a pallet sub-floor in the cargo compartment will vary. Seat personnel in rows facing
       forward and load in small groups of 8-10 per pallet so they may be positioned and
       restrained by connecting the pre-positioned tie-down straps from the left and right
       outboard pallet rings. Load personal effects/baggage in any safe available pallet position.
       17.8.3.2. General Procedures:
           17.8.3.2.1. When available, mattresses or other cushioning material may be used for
           seating.
           17.8.3.2.2. When available, a pallet subfloor may be installed.
           17.8.3.2.3. When a pallet subfloor is installed, or when the intermediate rollers are
           removed from the aircraft, use the rail rings for attaching the tiedown strap used for
           forward restraint and body stability.
           17.8.3.2.4. When a pallet subfloor is not used, consider removing the intermediate
           rollers from the aircraft, mission conditions permitting.
           17.8.3.2.5. When the intermediate rollers are not removed from the aircraft, secure
           them on the outboard rails.
           17.8.3.2.6. Seat troops, passengers, and ambulatory patients facing forward.
           17.8.3.2.7. Attach a tiedown strap for each row of personnel to provide forward
           restraint and body stability.
           17.8.3.2.8. When the intermediate rails are stacked on top of the outboard rails, use
           floor rings for attaching the straps. In this situation, the available seating space is
           decreased, and the number of passengers must be decreased.
           17.8.3.2.9. Secure baggage on the cargo ramp/floor. Excess baggage and cargo
           secured on the cargo ramp/floor will decrease the number of troops, passengers, and
           patients proportionately.
   17.8.4. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL 250.

Section 17F—-Departures

17.9. General. Consider the same factors used for arrival planning. Plan your departure to
minimize the time spent within the threat environment, either egressing low level or spiraling up
to altitude.
17.10. Low Escape. Use this departure when a low altitude escape is necessary.
17.11. High Escape. Use this departure when a high or medium altitude escape is necessary.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            241


Section 17G—-NVG

17.12. NVG Operations. ALZ lighting patterns will be IAW AFI 13-217. AMP 4 (blacked out
runways) operations are not authorized.
   17.12.1. NVG Approaches and Landings. The navigator will program a backup ARA
   approach in SCNS and configure the radar to monitor the approach course to assist the pilot
   in LZ acquisition, approach, and landing.
      17.12.1.1. NVG Formation Departures/Arrivals. The mission commander will
      thoroughly brief NVG formation departures/arrivals to include emergency procedures,
      abort calls, light discipline, runway markings, etc.
      17.12.1.2. Crew Coordination. Coordinated actions during the final segment of an NVG
      approach and landing are critical.
          17.12.1.2.1. Navigator Duties. In addition to backing up the pilots with the radar,
          while on final the navigator should call altitude alerts every 100' (or as requested by
          the pilot) and should call when descending through 100', 50', 40‘, 30‘, 20', and 10' (or
          as requested by the pilot). On departure the navigator should call out passing 50',
          100', 200', 300' and 400' AGL, and will ensure terrain clearance with the radar.
          17.12.1.2.2. PM Duties. Beginning at 300' AGL, the PM should verbalize airspeed
          and rate of descent ("107, down 6" indicates 107 KIAS and a minus 600 VVI). The
          PM should also call out when passing 60 KIAS on landing roll.
          17.12.1.2.3. Engineer Duties. The engineer's primary job is to monitor engine
          instruments and ensure checklist completion. The pilot will brief the engineer of any
          additional crew coordination requirements.
      17.12.1.3. Tactical VFR Approaches. While VFR approaches afford flexibility in axis of
      approach, they demand thorough preflight planning and coordinated aircrew actions. The
      PIC will consider all mission aspects, including individual crewmember proficiency and
      qualifications when selecting an appropriate tactical VFR approach. For tactical VFR
      approaches, bank angle will not exceed 45 degrees and the aircraft will not descend
      below 150‘ AGL until rolled out on final. The first pilot to acquire the landing zone
      should state ―Pilot/Copilot has the LZ‖. The next pilot to acquire the zone should
      announce ―Pilot/Copilot has the LZ at (state clock position)‖.
      17.12.1.4. IMC Approaches. IMC approaches may be flown by either pilot. The pilot
      flying may execute the instrument approach with NVGs down but shall not use NVGs
      during the instrument portion (pilot flying will have to "look under" the NVGs for
      instrument crosscheck). The transfer of aircraft control for the landing will be no lower
      than 300' AGL. Altitude advisories shall be in accordance with earlier chapters of this
      regulation. The first pilot to acquire the landing zone should state ―Pilot/Copilot has the
      LZ‖. The next pilot to acquire the zone should announce ―Pilot/Copilot has the LZ at
      (state clock position)‖.

       17.12.2.1. ERO. It is recommended that LMs use NVGs to maintain situational
       awareness. Blacked out operations are prohibited. Goggles may be worn under NVGs for
       eye protection.
       17.12.2.2. Taxi/backing. Pilots may taxi using NVGs on airfields without lights (blacked
       out) or equipped with overt or covert lights. If taxiing or accomplishing ground ops on
       blacked out taxiways/runways/ramps, the PIC will ensure aircraft or environmental
       lighting provides for clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edge. Comply with all taxi
       restrictions in Chapter 5 and the GDSS/ASRR. The LM may provide the pilot with
       directions to taxi the aircraft while using NVGs. WARNING: If ever in doubt as to
       obstruction clearance, stop the aircraft, obtain additional wing walkers/marshallers and/or
       deplane crewmembers to act as wing walkers.
       17.12.2.3. Combat Offloads. Crews may accomplish Combat Offloads on NVGs
       provided aircraft or airfield lighting permit clear definition of taxiway/runway.
17.13. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC)
Procedure. To avoid confusion and ensure safe operation use ERCC procedures when
enplaning an entire crew. ERO procedures can be used for enplaning individual crewmembers.
Enplaning flight engineers will conduct a brief exterior inspection of the aircraft prior to
boarding.
   17.13.1. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) Deplaning crews will complete the AFTER
   LANDING checklist and set the parking brake. All crewmembers, except the copilot and
   engineer, will then assemble in the cargo compartment.
   17.13.2. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) The enplaning pilot, engineer, and evaluator (if
   present) will proceed directly to the flight deck and will be briefed by their counterparts the
   status of the aircraft. All other crewmembers will assemble in the cargo compartment and the
   crew entrance door will be closed.
   17.13.3. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) After all deplaning crewmembers are assembled
   in the cargo compartment and the enplaning loadmaster has assumed duty; the pilot will clear
   the deplaning crew to exit the aircraft.
   17.13.4. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) All crewmembers will check/set their oxygen
   and communications systems as required. Loadmasters will adjust their harness with the
   ramp and door in the ADS position for all airdrops utilizing the ramp and door.
   17.13.5. (Added-NIAGARAFALLSSAR) At the completion of the ERCC, the pilot will
   initiate the BEFORE TAXI checklist.

                                           Chapter 18

                                  AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. The standard formation building block is a two-ship element. Techniques to fly
C-130 formation are outlined in AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H. Consider safety, aircrew capability,
proficiency, survivability and user needs when planning any formation tactic.
18.2. Specified Times. The mission commander determines the sequence of events and mission
times based on ATO, fragmentation order, and staff input, fuel requirements,
parachutist/passenger comfort, taxi distances, briefing requirements, etc.
18.3. Weather Minimums.
   18.3.1. Formation takeoff and landing minimums are the minimums for the airport
   navigation aid used, but not lower than 200 feet and one-mile visibility (RVR 5000). During
   IFR formation operations, adhere to both ceiling and visibility minimums. If departure
   ceiling or visibility is below published landing minimums, but above 200 feet and one-mile
   visibility (RVR 5000), the formation may take off if the requirements for a departure
   alternate as prescribed in Chapter 6, are met. If the runway has dual RVR readouts
   (approach and departure end of the runway) both ends must be at least RVR 5000.
18.4. Ground Operations.
   18.4.1. Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length with four engines operating and two
   aircraft lengths with two engines operating. Formation lead may increase taxi intervals if
   circumstances dictate.
18.5. Takeoff.
   18.5.1. The minimum takeoff interval between aircraft is 15-seconds.
   18.5.2. For aborts during takeoff, the navigator immediately transmits an abort call (three
   times using formation position number) on interplane and the copilot on primary frequency.
   Clear the runway as quickly as safety allows. Succeeding aircraft not on takeoff roll will hold
   until the runway is clear. NOTE: For aircraft without ―hot mike‖ capability on primary
   radio, the navigator transmits the abort call on primary, and the copilot (or navigator if the
   copilot is occupied with emergency procedures) transmits on interplane. NOTE: Consider
   not using Have Quick or secure radio for interplane during takeoff.
   18.5.3. Do not advance power above flight idle until takeoff roll is started.
18.6. Altimeter Setting. Formation leaders will ensure all aircraft use the same altimeter
setting.
18.7. Formations.
   18.7.1. Formations will normally consist of 2-ship elements. During mission planning,
   mission commanders will choose a formation geometry appropriate to the mission and
   tactical situation. At no time will aircraft be operated within 500 feet of another aircraft.
   18.7.2. Airspeed Changes. Lead will announce airspeed changes of 15-knots or greater at
   night.
 244                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   18.7.3. Inadvertent weather penetration procedures will be briefed to the formation. At a
   minimum, formation lead will direct the formation to a safe altitude, heading, airspeed, and
   aircraft spacing. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H for inadvertent weather penetration
   procedures.
18.8. Visual Geometries.
   18.8.1. Basic visual spacing should be 2000-6000 feet between aircraft in an element and
   8000 feet between element leads. SKE must be operational for night, unaided visual
   formations or the formation is restricted to 2000 feet in-trail. The optimal formation
   composition and geometry will depend on mission requirement, theater restrictions, terrain,
   and the tactical situation.
       18.8.1.1. Flight leads will brief visual formation contracts.
   18.8.2. For visual geometries, refer to AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H.
   18.8.3. Night Geometries. Crews may fly visual in trail, fluid trail, and tactical formation
   maneuvering (TFM) during night NVG formation tactical missions. To fly night TFM, see
   paragraph 18.10.2.
   18.8.4. NVG Threat Reactions for Training. NVGs are required for night threat reactions.
   Crews must exercise vigilance to ensure the aircraft remains within the NVG en-route
   altitude corridor or climb to MSA while conducting threat reactions. NOTE: Any
   crewmember will call ―Terminate‖ if they observe the aircraft being flown outside the above
   parameters.
18.9. Visual Rejoins.
   18.9.1. Rejoining aircraft will maintain 500 feet above or below the formation until the
   formation is in sight and clearance to rejoin is granted.
   18.9.2. Rejoining aircraft must be in position at formation altitude by ―green light‖ to
   accomplish the drop.
18.10. Tactical Formation Maneuver Restrictions.
   18.10.1. Day VMC: No restriction.
   18.10.2. Night VMC:
       18.10.2.1. NVGs will be used.
       18.10.2.2. Formation contracts and verbal signals will be pre-briefed.
       18.10.2.3. SKE should be operational.
       18.10.2.4. Due to aircraft limitations, consider using line abreast NVG formation only
       when required by the tactical situation.
       18.10.2.5. Shackles, cross turns, and half cross turns should be limited to times when
       necessary for formation maneuvering. Verbal signals must be used. Normally, shackle,
       cross turn, and half cross turn training should be conducted during day VMC.
       WARNING: When flying at night, rapid changes in airspeed, altitude, bank angles, ―G‖
       loads and aircraft position necessitated by the performance of these maneuvers increase
       the potential for spatial disorientation.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              245


       18.10.2.6. The MC will brief lighting procedures (if the wingman calls ―blind‖, etc.).
       18.10.2.7. Wingmen should avoid flying the line right/left positions for extended periods
       of time.
       18.10.2.8. Fluid trail spacing will be no closer than 2000' between aircraft.
       18.10.2.9. Crews will brief altitude and airspeed terminate criteria for threat reactions.
18.11. Visual Slowdown Procedures.
   18.11.1. Unless tactically unsound, night slowdowns will include an aural or visual signal.
18.12. Visual Airdrop Procedures.
   18.12.1. Minimum spacing for CDS airdrops is 6,000 feet between aircraft. WARNING:
   Attempting to regain position by only reducing power or airspeed places the aircraft in a nose
   high, low-power situation and may lead to a stall.
18.13. Visual Recovery. Lead determines the type of visual recovery based upon formation
geometry, threat scenario, traffic pattern, traffic flow, etc. Attain traffic pattern altitude and
airspeed before arriving at the recovery field.
   18.13.1. Downwind Recovery.
       18.13.1.1. Roll out on final at no less than 150 feet AGL. Aircraft will not descend below
       preceding aircraft during the recovery.
   18.13.2. Overhead Recovery.
       18.13.2.1. Roll out on final at no less than 150 feet AGL. Aircraft will not descend below
       preceding aircraft during the recovery.
18.14. Landing. The desired landing interval is 20 seconds, minimum 15 seconds.
WARNING: Do not perform touch-and-go landings during formation recoveries.
18.15. SKE Procedures.
   18.15.1. Use the pressure altimeter and GSI to monitor altitude during climb or descent. The
   formation lead announces the altitude passing each 2,000 feet (including departure and
   recovery). All aircraft report reaching assigned altitude in sequence to the formation leader.
   Formation lead will not report the formation level to ATC until all aircraft have reported
   level at the assigned altitude.
   18.15.2. Priority of FCI signals are: altitude, heading and airspeed.
   18.15.3. Unless otherwise briefed, spacing between aircraft will be 4000 feet and spacing
   between element leads will be 8000 feet. Minimum SKE spacing is 4000 feet between
   aircraft.
   18.15.4. Lead will signal turns of 10 degrees or more and airspeed changes of 10 KIAS or
   more.
   18.15.5. Element leads will not exceed 20 degrees of bank for planned enroute turns. For
   formation check turns all aircraft (including element leads) will use 30 degrees of bank
   unless otherwise briefed.
18.16. Loss of SKE-Individual Aircraft. Notify lead in all cases.
 246                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   18.16.1. VMC.
       18.16.1.1. If only the Direct View Storage Tube (DVST)/plan position indicator (PPI) is
       inoperative aircraft may elect to maintain position with lead‗s concurrence. The route,
       drop, and recovery may be flown. NOTE: Consider using air-to-air TACAN or radar to
       maintain spacing.
   18.16.2. IMC.
       18.16.2.1. Loss of all SKE indications will require a breakout. Use the following
       procedure if an alternate plan was not briefed:
       18.16.2.2. If the formation is in straight and level flight climb 500 feet, turn 30 degrees
       in the safest direction from the base heading for 30 seconds, and then return to base
       heading. If the formation is in a turn, roll out and climb 500 feet. Lead will contact (or
       direct contact to) ATC for a separate clearance. CAUTION: Performing the above
       maneuvers in a radar pattern may place an aircraft outside of protected airspace.
18.17. SKE Rejoins.
   18.17.1. Set leader number as required to the formation according to lead‗s direction and
   enable all formation slot numbers.
   18.17.2. Set ―range‖ X 1,000 feet, switch at maximum range.
   18.17.3. Approach the formation from 1,000 feet above or below the formation.
   18.17.4. Establish radio contact with the formation. Confirm SKE frequency and appropriate
   leader‗s slot number.
   18.17.5. When the formation appears on the DVST/PPI, check that the master lost
   indications have been extinguished.
   18.17.6. The rejoining aircraft will identify the appropriate element leader. Upon positive
   identification, lead completes an FCI check prior to the rejoin.
   18.17.7. Join in position while maintaining 1,000 feet altitude separation. When stabilized in
   position and the last formation aircraft is positively identified, request rejoin clearance from
   lead and climb or descend to formation altitude.
   18.17.8. The rejoining aircraft must be stabilized in position at formation altitude by the IP
   (IMC) or by one-minute prior to the TOT (VMC) to accomplish the drop.
18.18. SKE Airdrop Procedures.
   18.18.1. All aircraft will use formation lead's drift to determine SKE crosstrack. Non-
   AWADS formation aircraft must ensure they use the same ballistic wind for identical SCNS
   programming. AWADS formation aircraft may use their own computed wind. After level at
   drop altitude, formation lead will pass back revised drift and ballistic winds if different.
   18.18.2. Slowdown. The entire formation will slowdown simultaneously. Lead signals 30
   seconds prior to slowdown with the SKE ―SD‖ button. Lead transmits a 5-second ―-― prep.
   Lead initiates slowdown with the FCI ―E‖ and a radio call (tactical situation permitting).
   After slowdown, element leads will not exceed 10 degrees of bank.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            247


      18.18.2.1. Descending Slowdown. Upon reaching 140 KIAS, the formation may descend
      to drop altitude. Start descent using 140 KIAS and 1,000 feet per minute until reaching
      drop altitude. Do not initiate descent until the following conditions are met:
          18.18.2.1.1. Lead position is positively identified.
          18.18.2.1.2. The entire formation is within 3 NMs of DZ run-in course centerline.
          18.18.2.1.3. The last aircraft in the formation is at or past the DZ entry point (or the
          last aircraft in the flight or element if using the waterfall descent procedures.).
   18.18.3. Each element stacks 50-feet above the preceding element's drop altitude. Wingmen
   maintain the same drop altitude as their element leaders by reference to the pressure altimeter
   and SKE TWS. For large formations, i.e., greater than two flights, all aircraft within a flight
   will maintain the same drop altitude with following flights stacking 50-feet above the
   preceding flight‗s drop altitude. WARNING: Analyze pre-drop gross weight to determine if
   obstructions can be cleared with one engine inoperative. If obstruction clearance cannot be
   met, adjust the number of aircraft, reduce aircraft gross weight, revise run-in and/or escape
   course, or increase drop altitude. NOTE: Do not attempt AWADS/SKE airdrops in areas of
   thunderstorm activity, heavy precipitation, or during icing conditions.
   18.18.4. During the run-in, element leaders will maintain formation position in relation to
   their flight leader (TWS) until they are established on drop altitude and airspeed. When these
   two requirements are met, element leaders are cleared their own independent run-in to their
   own CARP.
   18.18.5. Non-AWADS element leads must verify SCNS accuracy via visual ground
   references or SCNS ETE timing window, TWS, and SCNS XTRK, as prescribed in AFTTP
   3-3.C-130E/H, no later than the 5 second advisory.
   18.18.6. AWADS run-in requirements:
      18.18.6.1. AWADS leads will verify at least two different Offset Aim Points (OAPs)
      during the run-in.
      18.18.6.2. AWADS leads will have an OAP active on the run-in at least from the 1-
      minute advisory through the escape point.
      18.18.6.3. For additional AWADS information, reference AFFTP 3-3.C-130E/H.
18.19. SKE Formation Landing.
   18.19.1. The interval between aircraft for landing is 6,000 feet desired, 5,000 feet minimum.
18.20. C-130E/H/J Interfly Procedures. Reference AFFTP 3-3.C-130E/H for C-130E/H and
C-130J interfly procedures.

                                            Chapter 19

                                    AIRDROP OPERATIONS

19.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for C-130 airdrop operations. It provides
parameters used to employ the techniques and procedures of AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H.
   19.1.1. Airdrop above 3000 feet AGL. Equipment and CDS drops performed above 3000
   AGL will be made using one of the following methods: AWADS, Ground Radar Aerial
   Delivery System (GRADS), precision airdrop systems, or a radar beacon airdrop. A SKE
   wingman may execute a SKE timing drop provided the leader navigates to the release point
   by AWADS, GRADS, or a radar beacon.
   19.1.2. Airdrops overwater can be planned up to 5000‘ AGL using standard methods.
19.2. Identification of Airdrop Items. It may be necessary to identify items that are not
dropped or land off the DZ in unsecured areas.
   19.2.1. Identify supplies or equipment by the following class numbering system:
       19.2.1.1. Class I - Subsistence.
       19.2.1.2. Class II - Individual equipment.
       19.2.1.3. Class III - POL.
       19.2.1.4. Class IV - Construction materials.
       19.2.1.5. Class V - Ammunition (include the type):
          19.2.1.5.1. Type "A" - Small arms.
          19.2.1.5.2. Type "B" - Mortars.
          19.2.1.5.3. Type "C" - Artillery.
       19.2.1.6. Class VI - Personal demand items.
       19.2.1.7. Class VII - Major end items (vehicles, howitzers, etc.).
       19.2.1.8. Class VIII - Medical supplies.
       19.2.1.9. Class IX - Repair parts.
       19.2.1.10. Class X - Non-military programs (i.e. agricultural supplies).
19.3. Airdrop Kits. The loadmaster will carry enough equipment in the airdrop kit to satisfy
load or mission requirements. Minimum contents of airdrop kits will include cloth-backed
pressure sensitive tape, masking tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, 550 cord, 5 cord, 80 pound
cotton webbing, one carabineer (NSN 4240-01295-4305 or equivalent carabineer with a locking
mechanism), and two small G-14 clevises. For LCLA airdrops, three carabineers are required.
19.4. Joint Air Drop Inspection.
   19.4.1. The loadmaster will complete the applicable DD Forms 1748, Joint Air Drop
   Inspection Records, before takeoff (see AFJI 13-210/AR59-4/OPNAVINST 4630.24D/MCO
   13480.1D, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction Investigations, and Activity
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             249


     Reporting, 23 June 2009 for specifics) and verify the accuracy of cargo and troop
     documentation. The Joint Airdrop Inspector (JAI) will check all possible items for all loads
     to be dropped during that mission. For loads that require in-flight rigging, the Joint Airdrop
     Inspector will annotate on the DD Forms 1748 which items are required to be completed
     during flight, and the aircrew loadmasters will ensure those items are completed and
     checked. No further inspections by the Joint Airdrop Inspector are required. NOTE: Reject
     loads with inaccurate or unavailable weights, or loads hazardous to flight. Equipment not
     rigged per 13C-series technical orders or Joint Special Operations Command 350 series
     manuals, requires a waiver from the Quartermaster Center and School at Fort Lee Va, or
     Natick Soldier Systems, Natick Ma. This includes unilateral training loads.
     19.4.2. If loads to be airdropped and loads to be airlanded are carried at the same time, see
     the restrictions listed in Table 19.1 These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads
     from interfering with airdrop rigging equipment.

                                                         NOT USED
NOTES:
1. Personnel airdrops may be performed with only one troop door configured for airdrop
with user concurrence.
2. Will not exceed 80" within 12" either side of retriever cable. Height of cargo outside of
the 12" left and right (total 24") may exceed the 80" height limitation, but will not
interfere with overhead rigging equipment.
3. CDS and heavy equipment configuration. A maximum of three rows of canvas seats
may be used. The remaining vacant row serves as a safety aisle. All sidewall seats will be
raised or stowed in the wheel-well area when airland pallets and vehicles are located
within this area and exceed 96" width.

19.5. Verification of Load Information. The navigator will verify the actual number and type
of parachutes, load weights, sequence of extraction, and position of loads in the aircraft agree
with planned CARP data. If an individual load has a different type or number of parachutes from
other loads, compute a CARP for each load to ensure all loads will land on the DZ. Base drop
altitude on the item requiring the highest drop altitude.
19.6. Marking Airdrop Loads. For training missions (e.g. unilateral, exercise, or JA/ATT) the
navigator will mark all equipment and standard airdrop training bundles with the aircraft call
sign and date. If more than one load is dropped on the same pass, mark loads with order of exit
from aircraft. Markings will be placed on the extracted end of the load, and also between the
extraction parachute and attachment to the floor. EXCEPTION: If more than one CDS bundle
is dropped on the same pass, mark only the first container out.
19.7. DZ Markings. Plan and coordinate DZ markings according to AFI 13-217.
19.8. Safety Equipment.
     19.8.1. Personnel required to be mobile in the cargo compartment will wear protective
     headgear from the combat entry point to the combat exit point if an actual threat is briefed.
     EXCEPTION: Personnel performing water jumps. All other personnel will be seated with
     the seat belt fastened. Check helmet boom mike during preflight. Loadmasters will lower
     their helmet visor (except when NVGs are used) before opening any doors and keep them
     lowered until doors are closed. As a minimum, the helmet will be worn from the start of the
     pre-slowdown checklist until the completion of the drop checklist. Loadmasters will be on
     interphone from completion of pre-slowdown checks until completion of the drop checklist.
     19.8.2. During airdrops, loadmasters will wear a restraint harness from the pre-slowdown
     checklist until doors are closed and locked. When using a restraint harness, loadmasters
     performing duties near an open ramp and/or door in-flight will attach the lifeline IAW
     paragraph 19.8.3. If carried, loadmasters may wear a parachute instead of a restraint
     harness. Parachute will be worn from the pre-slowdown checklist until doors are closed and
     locked. WARNING: During the aircrew briefing, the PIC will brief the loadmaster(s) when
     the mission profile requires flight below 800 feet AGL with the door(s) open. NOTE:
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             251


  Loadmasters must wear a restraint harness when performing duties near an open exit above
  25,000 feet MSL or below 800 feet AGL.
  19.8.3. When used, fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline before flight as follows:
     19.8.3.1. Troop door personnel drops. Connect the hook to tiedown ring 26D and adjust
     the lifeline to allow mobility only to the troop door for installation of the paratroop
     retrieval strap/bar and to accomplish other emergency procedures. When dropping with
     CVR sections 2 and 3 installed, connect the hook to the CVR tiedown ring near floor
     tiedown ring 25D.
     19.8.3.2. Troop door SATB drops. Connect the lifeline as described in paragraph
     19.8.3.1 or to a floor/dual rail tiedown ring at FS 657 and adjust to allow mobility only to
     the troop door being used.
     19.8.3.3. Ramp and door operations. (See paragraph 19.8.3.3.1 for ICDS/JPADS
     guidance) Loadmasters will pre-measure the harness with the ramp and door in the ADS
     position prior to flight. Connect the hook to a floor/dual rail tiedown ring at FS 677,
     adjusting to a point that will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft. Restraint
     harness lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor cable provided the anchor cable
     stop is positioned and taped at FS 677. WARNING: Except for an actual contingency,
     towed trooper, or emergency that threatens the survivability of the aircraft and crew, the
     restraint harness will not be disconnected or lengthened to a point that would allow the
     loadmaster to fall outside the aircraft.
         19.8.3.3.1. ICDS/JPADS operations. When pre-flighting the restraint harness for
         dropsonde airdrops, pre-measure the harness with the ramp in the closed position.
         Connect the hook to a floor/dual rail tiedown ring at FS 737, adjusting to a point that
         will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft. For the subsequent cargo airdrop,
         connect the hook to floor/dual rail tiedown ring no further aft than FS 677, adjusting
         to a point that will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft. Restraint harness
         lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor cable provided the anchor cable stop is
         positioned and taped at FS 677.
  19.8.4. Loadmasters will wear a LPU for operations over bodies of water when doors are
  open and a parachute is worn or with restraint harness below 2000 feet.
  19.8.5. During an airdrop, occupants in the cargo compartment will either have a seat belt
  fastened, wear a restraint harness, or wear a parachute (if carried) before doors are opened.
  EXCEPTION: Flight examiner loadmasters are exempt from wearing a parachute or
  restraint harness while conducting flight evaluations provided they do not go aft of FS 677.
  For static line jumps, static lines are attached to anchor cables before doors are opened.
  EXCEPTION: Jumpers exiting on subsequent passes (racetracks) may stand and hook up
  with doors open if they are forward of the aft edge of the wheel wells (FS 617). NOTE: Do
  not use flight deck restraint harness.
  19.8.6. Two parachutes for Army safety personnel will be provided during joint airdrop
  training missions. Units may provide additional parachutes when requested by the user.
 252                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


19.9. Secure Enroute Communications Package (SECOMP). Use of SECOMP will cease at
the discretion of the PIC if it interferes with either aircraft equipment or an aircraft emergency
condition.
19.10. Airdrop Weather Minimums and Wind Restrictions. Comply with published AFI 11-
202V3 and FLIP VFR weather minimums for visual airdrops. For non-CONUS VFR airdrops,
comply with host nation VFR criteria if more restrictive than AFI 11-202V3. Comply with AFI
13-217 for minimum DZ weather/wind restrictions.
19.11. Tactical Checklists. Tactical checklists found in the applicable TO 1C-130xx-1 will be
used.
   19.11.1. During the PIC‘s crew briefing, the pilot, navigator, and loadmaster will coordinate
   appropriate times or geographical location for execution of all tactical checklists. The time
   required by the loadmaster will determine when checklists must be accomplished enroute.
   Complete all items of the preceding checklist before beginning the next checklist. The
   combat entry checklist will be accomplished prior to entering the tactical or threat
   environment or when deemed necessary by the PIC. EXCEPTION: The ―SLOWDOWN
   CHECKLIST‖ may still be in progress after the ―ONE MINUTE ADVISORY‖. NOTE:
   Avoid use of the word "green" or "light" from the slowdown checklist until arriving at the
   release point.
   19.11.2. The "twenty minute", "ten minute", "one minute", and "five second" advisories are
   required for all personnel airdrops. Only the "one minute" and "five second" advisories are
   required for equipment and CDS airdrops. Additional advisories may be provided at crew
   discretion if requested by the user and pre-coordinated with the aircrew. NOTE: Loadmaster
   will ensure jumpmasters receive all time advisories, wind updates, and no-drop decision
   when passed.
   19.11.3. The navigator will give accurate time advisories regardless of the tactical checklist
   in progress. Advisories are based on planned TOT up to slowdown. After slowdown, all
   advisories are based on green light time from the DZ. NOTE: During personnel airdrops,
   the aircraft must be at or above drop altitude and stable not later than one minute out (two
   minutes out for jumpmaster directed drops) to allow the jumpmaster access to the paratroop
   door. The loadmaster will notify the PIC when an emergency condition exists in the cargo
   compartment, complete the required emergency checklist and report completion of the
   malfunction checklist or status. Normal tactical checklists are resumed if possible. If not
   possible, proceed with the completion of drop checklist.
19.12. Airdrop Altitudes and Airspeeds. See AFI 11-231 for specific airdrop altitudes and
airspeeds. The aircraft must be level at drop altitude and on drop airspeed by green light time.
Slowdown during personnel drops should be planned to allow jumpmaster access to paratroop
doors NLT 1-minute before TOT (2-minutes for jumpmaster directed drops).
19.13. No Drop Decisions. Should the crew believe the drop will occur outside of safe
parameters, they will call ―no drop‖ and ensure the red light is illuminated.
   19.13.1. The PM and loadmaster will acknowledge the no-drop call. AWADS/SKE flight
   and element leaders, if able, will continue to provide signals for wingmen as long as the no-
   drop situation does not affect the wingmen or formation.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                           253


   19.13.2. In IMC a ―no drop‖ will be signaled via FCI and over interplane, if tactically sound.
19.14. Drop Zone Communications. See AFI 13-217 and AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H for DZ
communication procedures.
19.15. Methods of Aerial Delivery. The following are approved methods of aerial delivery:
   19.15.1. Visual Airdrops.
   19.15.2. Ground Marked Release System (GMRS). NOTE: The user assumes responsibility
   for airdrop accuracy during GMRS drops.
   19.15.3. Verbally Initiated Release System (VIRS).       NOTE: The ground party accepts
   responsibility for drop accuracy.
   19.15.4. Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) Personnel Release Procedures.
       19.15.4.1. Jumpmaster directed drops are limited to single ship airdrop operations only.
       These drops may be performed by qualified AF or sister service jumpmasters (or trainees
       under supervision of qualified personnel). Units will receive approval notice through the
       mission tasking directive from 618 TACC/XOOMJ for AMC-directed missions or from
       the appropriate theater command and control agency, annotated on JA/ATT Form 612R,
       tasking order, etc. The following conditions apply:
          19.15.4.1.1. The jumpmaster‘s parent service/user accepts all responsibility for the
          accuracy of the drop, plus any potential injuries/damage to equipment.
          19.15.4.1.2. Specific in-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone
          procedures between the jumpmaster, loadmaster, and PIC will be coordinated during
          the pilot, loadmaster and jumpmaster briefing.
          19.15.4.1.3. Navigators will still accomplish Computer Air Release Point (CARP) or
          High Altitude Release Point (HARP) calculations to back up the computations and in-
          flight directions given by the jumpmaster.
          19.15.4.1.4. Navigators will update the jumpmaster in-flight on actual wind
          information and any changes to the crew‘s preflight computed CARP location.
          19.15.4.1.5. JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of airdrop method,
          i.e., GMRS, VIRS, or standard CARP drops. If JMD drop procedures are called for,
          the crew will follow the jumpmaster‘s instructions, while adhering to normal safety
          concerns. Should the crew believe the drop will occur outside of safe parameters, they
          will call ―no drop‖ and ensure the red light is illuminated.
   19.15.5. AWADS Airdrops. AWADS-equipped units are authorized to make airdrops using
   AWADS equipment in VMC or IMC.
   19.15.6. Radar Beacon Airdrops. Radar beacon drops in IMC during peacetime must be
   approved by MAJCOM/A3/DO for active duty units and either HQ AFRC/A3 or ANG/A3
   for AFRC/ANG units. The AOC/AMD may approve IMC radar beacon airdrops for
   exercises or for contingency and combat operations.
   19.15.7. I-CDS / JPADS Procedures
254                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      19.15.7.1. I-CDS and JPADS airdrop operations are conducted using the JPADS Mission
      Support Equipment (MSE) (UHF Dropsonde Receiver Subsystem (UHF-DRS), GPS
      Retransmit System (GPS-RTS), Precision Aerial Delivery System Mission Planner
      (PADS-MP) laptop and software. I-CDS operations are conventional ballistic CDS
      airdrops with non-steerable chutes using the JPADS MSE, PADS-MP, and Dropsondes to
      calculate an improved CARP. JPADS operations are conducted using steerable chutes
      with Autonomous Guidance Units (AGUs).
      19.15.7.2. Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE): Units must perform a full airdrop damage
      assessment prior to CDS/I-CDS/JPADS airdrops. The ADE must be coordinated and
      approved by the area controlling agency. Coordinate with the owning agency of the
      restricted airspace or controlled airspace and landowners with property surrounding the
      DZ for all CDS/I-CDS/JPADS operations. Examine the area in the vicinity of the DZ for
      potential damage or hazards in the course of normal operations or during extraordinary
      system failure events. If the ADE demonstrates potential damage or hazards restrict the
      airdrop release Launch Acceptability Region (LAR); lower the drop altitude, change the
      run-in, change parachute type or cancel airdrop operations. Inform the controlling unit of
      the risk to their operations; the controlling unit, and the JFC designated agency are
      approving authorities for risk to the area surrounding the DZ. Intelligence personnel are
      responsible for providing the JFC-designated agency close-up and overview imagery to
      facilitate ADE. For actual JPADS training airdrops, units will contact AMC/A3DT (2-3
      weeks prior) in order to ensure all planning, coordination and reviews/assessments have
      been accomplished. Operations conducted at Yuma Proving Ground under JPADS
      related test plans do not need AMC/A3DT review. See AFI 13-217 for further
      information. The ADE must include, at a minimum, a review of the airspace and ground
      space with respect to: CARP and LAR location, 63% 1-sigma I-CDS success ellipse,
      Chute failure footprint and Guidance failure footprint.
      19.15.7.3. The PO or mission planner is required to provide JPADS-MP derived
      CARP(s) for each airdrop pass and a completed ADE prior to airdrop mission execution.
      Both pilots will review preflight CARP(s) and ADE for each respective airdrop. During
      the cargo door Dropsonde release, use of zero flaps at speeds between 170 – 180 KIAS is
      required to preclude Dropsonde tail strikes. Loadmasters will open the cargo door for the
      Dropsonde airdrops. Loadmasters will release the Dropsondes from the corner of the
      cargo ramp, which will be in the fully closed position. Upon hearing and seeing
      ―GREEN LIGHT‖, release the Dropsonde at a 45-degree angle away from the corner of
      the ramp.
      19.15.7.4. Intermediate gates made of ½-inch tubular nylon or greater and will be rigged
      on all JPADS-equipped CDS bundles. Intermediate gates are used to ensure 3-second
      separation between bundles. Intermediate gates will not be considered restraint when
      computing aft restraint requirements. All additional aft restraint requirements will be met
      utilizing normal aircraft restraint provisions. Cut the release gate(s)/intermediate release
      gate(s) IAW paragraphs 19.29.3 or 19.29.3.1.
         19.15.7.4.1. For single stick JPADS drops, all intermediate gates will be manually
         cut by the loadmaster. Double stick JPADS drops are not authorized.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                         255


     19.15.7.5. JPADS certified aircrews are authorized to airdrop above 3,000 feet AGL
     without the use of radar beacon, GRADS, or AWADS when using JPADS procedures
     and equipment.
        19.15.7.5.1. For I-CDS operations, GPS Figure of Merit (FOM) 3 (including single
        GPS/INS equipped aircraft) or verification of waypoints by AWADS offset aimpoints
        is required. For JPADS operations, GPS FOM 3 (including single GPS/INS equipped
        aircraft) is required from the 1 minute warning until ―Green Light‖.
        19.15.7.5.2. Wind Limits.     Wind limitations are unrestricted for Dropsonde
        operations, 18 knots for JPADS 2K/10K and as published in AFI 13-217 for all other
        parachutes.
        19.15.7.5.3. DZ Size. DZ size criteria for JPADS and ICDS drops during
        contingency operations is at the discretion of the user. AFI 13-217 DZ size
        restrictions apply during training.
        19.15.7.5.4. JPADS Guidance Footprint Locations.              During normal training
        operations a JPADS DZ, CARP, chute failure footprint and guidance failure footprint
        will be located within a restricted airspace and on military owned property. If winds
        force the CARP outside of restricted airspace additional coordination with ATC is
        required prior to airdrop operations. This includes coordination with the ATC
        agency, filing a Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), and ensuring airspace is clear for the
        entire guided system‘s flight profile from the drop altitude to the ground.
        19.15.7.5.5. During normal training operations the entire 1-sigma (63%) I-CDS
        success footprint will be located within the surveyed DZ boundaries. The chute
        failure footprint must fall within restricted airspace and on military owned property.
        If outside of a restricted airspace the chute failure must fall on the surveyed DZ. If
        operating in a restricted area and winds force the CARP outside of restricted airspace,
        coordination with ATC is required prior to airdrop operations. This includes
        coordination with the ATC agency, filing a NOTAM and ensuring airspace is clear
        from the drop altitude to the ground.
     19.15.7.6. IMC/VMC day/night drops are authorized for contingency operations.
     CONUS training operations are required to comply with FAR 105 restrictions. Drops
     conducted thru or originating from IMC are only authorized from within or above an
     active restricted area. Before conducting IMC drops, check with the controlling agency
     for additional local restrictions. JPADS parachutes will not be dropped thru severe
     turbulence or severe icing.
     19.15.7.7. Aircrew Procedure. After the JPADS-MP produces a CARP it is entered into
     the SCNS. The pilot not flying and PO will verify the CARP and all airdrop parameters
     are entered correctly into the navigation system. For verification, the PO will read the
     JPADS-MP computed release point coordinates directly from the JPADS-MP while the
     pilot not flying verifies the same information is in the aircraft navigation system.
     19.15.7.8. Jettison of JPADS AGU with MILGPS. Instances of jettison, unauthorized
     access, tampering, theft, or loss of the JPADS MILGPS enclosure must be reported to the
     GPS Controlling Authority (CA). Each report shall include the JPADS MILGPS serial
     number and Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS serial number
 256                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       of the missing item and must state whether the system was keyed or unkeyed. US Army
       Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) will relay such jettison to the
       GPS CA. NOTE: Time permitting; the LM with concurrence from the PO will remove
       the MILGPS enclosure from the AGU prior to load jettison.
       19.15.7.9. JPADS AGU MILGPS Procedure. For training missions with Air Force
       JPADS AGUs aircrew will check out the MILGPS from the tactics office. Upon mission
       completion and prior to removing the MILGPS enclosure, power up the AGU and
       accomplish the Recovery Mission Duration Zeroization (RMDZ) function. Zeroize prior
       to removal by pushing, for three seconds, the zeroize button located on the front panel of
       the MILGPS enclosure. NOTE: Keying and unkeying requires the MILGPS to be
       installed in a powered ON AGU. The AGU LCD screen should update within 20 seconds
       and should read MILGPS Keyed or Unkeyed. Once complete power OFF the AGU. The
       PO will remove and return the enclosure to the Unit‘s Tactics Office.
19.16. High Altitude Airdrop Oxygen Requirements.
   19.16.1. A continuous supply of 100 percent oxygen will be used during unpressurized
   operations IAW Table 19.2.
   19.16.2. When dropping from 20,000 feet MSL or higher, use pre-breathing procedures.
   When the aircraft oxygen system does not provide sufficient oxygen regulators for all
   personnel, approved portable oxygen console(s) will be pre-flighted and installed in the
   aircraft. The console(s) will provide enough oxygen regulators for all parachutists and
   crewmembers not accommodated by the normal aircraft system.
   19.16.3. All airdrops above 25,000 feet MSL require a waiver to AFI 11-202V3 for
   unpressurized flight, from Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) Oklahoma City, OK
   through MAJCOM/A3V. MA-1 portable oxygen units (with serviceable web carrying straps)
   equipped with A-21 regulators will be provided for each person aboard the aircraft except
   parachutists. WARNING: No personnel will be exposed to unpressurized flight at or above
   25,000 feet MSL more than four times each 7 days or 30,000 feet MSL more than three times
   each 7 days. In addition, they must have at least 12 hours between exposures to or above
   25,000 feet MSL and at least 22 hours between exposures to or above 30,000 feet MSL.
   19.16.4. Pre-breathing requirements for missions at or above FL 200. All personnel will
   prebreathe 100 percent oxygen below 16,000 feet MSL pressure altitude or cabin altitude on
   any mission scheduled for an exposure at or above FL 200 for times shown in Table 19.2
   Operational considerations dictate that pre-breathing must be completed before the cabin
   altitude exceeds 16,000 feet MSL. The aircraft commander, with recommendations from the
   PT, will determine the course of action for a break in pre-breathing. All personnel on board
   the aircraft will remain on 100 percent oxygen until cabin altitude is below FL 200. After
   descent below FL 200, all personnel will remain on 100% oxygen or select supplemental
   oxygen until 10,000 feet MSL. Pre-breathing will be conducted with a personally-fitted
   oxygen mask attached to an approved helmet and personal oxygen system. NOTE: Portable
   oxygen bottles may not be used for pre-breathing; the quick-don/smoke mask is emergency
   equipment and is not approved for pre-breathing or operations conducted at or above FL 200.
       19.16.4.1. The purpose of pre-breathing (denitrogenation) is to reduce the amount of
       nitrogen in the body and therefore reduce the risk of altitude-induced decompression
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              257


       sickness (DCS). Pre-breathing times are based on scientific research that outlines
       acceptable DCS risks. Major factors that enhance the effectiveness of denitrogenation
       are good hydration and good circulation.

NOTES:
(1) Maximum exposure time per sortie is when cabin altitude reaches maximum planned
altitude; extended or delayed ascent times expose everyone onboard to greater DCS risk;
missions that require staggered altitude drops will use accumulative times per sortie information
for mission planning. Mission planned drops at FL350, FL299, and FL249; 30 minutes upon
reaching FL350, descend to FL299, spend only 30 minutes (60 accumulative), descend to
FL249, spend only 50 minutes (110 minutes accumulative). Limits based on not exceeding 23%
DCS under laboratory conditions (<1% operational impact such as abort or mission
alteration/descent).
(2) Total flight time (without supplemental oxygen) above 10,000 ft. MSL shall not exceed 1 hour if
any portion of the flight above 10,000 ft. MSL is in IMC, at night, or when using NVGs, employing
weapons, conducting airdrop or air-refueling, or performing high-g maneuvers.
(3) No more than 3 Pre-breather sorties in a 24-hour period unless otherwise restricted.

   19.16.5. The jumpmaster may dictate the use of supplemental oxygen by any or all jumpers
   at altitudes less than those listed. Parachutists transfer from the aircraft oxygen system or
   portable oxygen console to a personal oxygen system at approximately one minute before
   green light.
   19.16.6. Pressurization Scheduling. Maintain cabin pressure at or below 10,000 feet until the
   Cabin Altitude Check and the Pre-Slowdown checklist (time for check may have to be
   adjusted) are complete. Depressurization will not exceed 3,000 feet per minute. Slower rates
   are recommended if time allows. Ensure zero pressure differential before opening doors.
19.17. High Altitude Airdrop Loadmaster Requirements. Loadmaster requirements will be
based on the following criteria:
 258                    AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   19.17.1. Two loadmasters will be used on actual equipment drops utilizing the ramp and
   door. EXCEPTION: One loadmaster may be used on unilateral single CDS container drops
   using manual gate cut procedures, or personnel airdrops up to 13,999 feet MSL provided
   only one exit is used (ramp and door or, only one paratroop door).
   19.17.2. Two loadmasters will be used on all airdrops 14,000 feet MSL and above.
19.18. High Altitude Operational Requirements for Physiology Technicians (PT). PTs will
support high altitude airdrop missions IAW AFI 11-409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support
Program. One USAF PT is required for each 16 personnel on board the aircraft for all
unpressurized high altitude missions conducted at or above 20,000 feet MSL. PT support for
high altitude missions below FL200 is by request to further mitigate risks and is highly
recommended. All CONUS requests for PT support must be made to the USAF High Altitude
Airdrop Mission Support (HAAMS) current operations desk (DSN 731-7389). PACAF requests
must be made to Kadena AB, JA (DSN 315-634-1967). NOTE: The USAF HAAMS Program
Manager, 19 AMDS/SGPT, 1090 Arnold Dr, Little Rock AFB 72099, DSN 731-7389, may
authorize variations to the PT-to-personnel ratio.
19.19. High Altitude Airdrop PT Duties.
   19.19.1. PTs will fly as crewmembers as stated on aeronautical orders. When missions
   require a PT, the PT will be on interphone at all times. PT flight duty stations will be as
   required to monitor crewmembers, jumpers, and oxygen equipment. PTs will:
       19.19.1.1. Preflight aircraft supplemental oxygen equipment.
       19.19.1.2. Advise and aid loadmasters in positioning and securing oxygen equipment.
       19.19.1.3. Brief crew and jumpers prior to the first mission on physiological problems
       that may be encountered, the importance of proper pre-breathing, and any special
       requirements.
       19.19.1.4. Advise the PIC, crew, jumpers, and other personnel on use of oxygen
       equipment and on the depressurization schedule.
       19.19.1.5. Monitor personnel, aircraft and supplemental oxygen equipment, and aircrew
       flight equipment.
   19.19.2. The aircrew or the mission PT will notify HQ USAF/SGPA (DSN 858-4654), and
   HQ AMC/SGPA (DSN 779-6305) and appropriate Command Coordinator for Aerospace
   Physiology, for any incident involving decompression sickness or loss of consciousness by
   the most expedient manner.
19.20. High Altitude Airdrop Conduct of Operations.
   19.20.1. For communications and signals, interphone and hand signals are the primary
   methods of communications. Written messages may be necessary in some instances to
   communicate with individuals not connected to the aircraft interphone. Loadmasters will
   carry a suitable writing utensil and medium to write out messages that cannot be dealt with
   by using hand signals. When dropping parachutists, the jumpmaster may monitor interphone.
   The loadmaster will coordinate all hand signals with the jumpmaster.
   19.20.2. Crewmembers will wear parachutes or restraining harnesses in the cargo
   compartment any time the doors are open during high altitude airdrop operations. Safety
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             259


   harnesses are worn on airdrops conducted above 25,000 feet MSL. (EXCEPTION: PTs may
   wear a parachute on drops above 14,000 feet MSL but will not position themselves near an
   open exit.) LPUs must be worn with parachutes for operations over bodies of water with the
   doors open.
   19.20.3. If an oxygen console is used, the loadmaster will be stationed aft of it to perform in-
   flight duties. The other loadmaster and physiology technician will be on interphone and
   normally forward of the oxygen console, if used, to perform in-flight duties. This
   arrangement will provide a buddy system to check everyone on oxygen.
   19.20.4. Maintain interphone contact between the cockpit and the cargo compartment. Both
   loadmasters must be on interphone from completion of pre-slowdown checks until execution
   of the completion of drop checklist and the cabin altitude is below 14,000 feet. The
   jumpmaster may also monitor interphone during high altitude personnel airdrops.
19.21. High Altitude Personnel Airdrop Procedures. CAUTION: Ensure any paratroopers
remaining on-board de-arm their parachutes before cabin altitude descends below set parachute
activation altitude.
   19.21.1. Air deflectors must be operational if paratroop doors are used. If an air deflector
   does not extend, do not open the affected troop door. NOTE: Jump platforms may be used.
   WARNING: The aircraft ramp and door and paratroop door(s) will not be open at the same
   time.
   19.21.2. When parachutists exit from the ramp, all parachutists, with the exception of the
   jumpmaster, will stand forward of the ramp hinge until the five-second advisory. One or both
   paratroop doors may be used in lieu of the cargo ramp. The ramp and door or paratroop door
   may remain open during racetracks if required, provided racetrack altitude is at or above a
   safe drop altitude and paratroopers are rigged for high altitude airdrops.
   19.21.3. For jumpmaster-directed HALO drops, the green light may be turned on one minute
   prior to the release point. The navigator will provide a standard "green light" call at the
   jointly agreed upon release point. User assumes responsibility for drop accuracy.
   19.21.4. Normally, the jumpers will exit the aircraft at their own discretion; however, their
   exit must occur during the green light time.
19.22. High Altitude Cargo Airdrop Procedures. Conduct high altitude cargo drops using
AWADS, GRADS, I-CDS/JPADS or radar beacon procedures. Heavy equipment airdrops above
14,000 feet MSL will be rigged with the Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS) regardless
of the size of extraction chute used.
19.23. Personnel Airdrops.
   19.23.1. In the event user personnel plan to jump with mixed parachute types, aircrews will
   always fly to and drop off the CARP for the main mass of paratroopers. The user assumes
   responsibility for the drop accuracy of individuals who choose to jump along with the main
   body of troopers while using a different type parachute. Aircrews will inform user
   jumpmasters if significant differences exist between CARPs.
   19.23.2. Troop seats must have a serviceable retaining strap or be fitted with a pre-measured
   length of type III nylon cord to secure the seat in a raised position prior to slowdown. Ensure
260                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  that parachutists have secured their seats, as required, and that no part of the seat protrudes
  into the aisle.
  19.23.3. The loadmaster allows the jumpmaster access to the paratroop doors not later than
  the one minute advisory. (EXCEPTION: The jumpmaster needs a minimum of two minutes
  in the door for jumpmaster directed drops.) The loadmaster then takes a position on the cargo
  ramp to provide maximum maneuverability for jumpmasters and safety personnel to perform
  their duties. WARNING: During personnel airdrops, the loadmasters will not position
  themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports (A-Frame, FS 737) in case of
  anchor cable or support mounting failure. NOTE: At no time will both paratroop doors be
  opened for paratroop drops if only one loadmaster is on board.
  19.23.4. Upon seeing the red jump lights illuminate, the primary loadmaster will notify the
  jumpmaster or safety personnel of the red light condition. The loadmaster will count, if
  possible, any parachutists that exit while the red light is illuminated. WARNING: Do not
  attempt to physically stop or hinder jumpers from exiting the aircraft if jumpers continue to
  exit after "red light".
      19.23.4.1. Control of the paratroop doors reverts back to the loadmaster after all
      parachutists have exited or remaining parachutists have been stopped by the jumpmaster
      or safety personnel and cleared from the paratroop door area. For racetracks, the
      loadmaster will retain control of the doors until completing the next slowdown checks.
         19.23.4.1.1. Racetrack speeds and flap settings are flown as briefed. The paratroop
         door(s) may be left open with jump platform(s) extended during racetracks if all
         paratroopers aft of the aft edge of the wheel-well (FS 617) are hooked up to the
         anchor cables. Jumpers may stand and hook up to the anchor cable with paratroop
         doors open provided they are forward of FS 617. Other occupants of the cargo
         compartment must either be seated with a seat belt fastened, wear a restraint harness,
         or wear a parachute.
         19.23.4.1.2. Avoid flying over water or built up areas while doors are open.
  19.23.5. Static line retrieval:
      19.23.5.1. The primary method of retrieval is using the static line retriever. The static
      line retriever will always be rigged and used for emergency retrieval of a towed
      parachutist. Manual static-line retrieval may be used to retrieve no more than ten static
      lines per door, per pass with one loadmaster, or 20 static lines per door, per pass with two
      people (combination of loadmasters, jumpmasters or safety personnel).
      19.23.5.2. Jump platform(s) may be left extended during manual retrieval of static lines.
      However, if the retriever winch is used, the jump platform must be retracted.
      19.23.5.3. When using the Towed Parachutist Retrieval System (TPRS), paratroop door
      static lines are normally retrieved using the retrieval sling assembly (choker). The
      retriever assist strap (RAS) is not required for normal retrieval of static lines. Although
      not required, the RAS may be used for proficiency or instructional purposes during
      normal static line retrieval.
  19.23.6. During combat, cut static lines that cannot be retrieved. On other than combat
  missions, if the static line retriever fails during retrieval and more than 10/20 static lines are
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              261


   to be retrieved from a paratroop door, manually retrieve the static lines by using a 5,000
   pound tiedown strap as follows:
      19.23.6.1. Secure the hook end to a point forward enough in the cargo compartment to
      permit static lines to enter completely in to the aircraft.
      19.23.6.2. Pass the other end of the strap under the static line from the bottom up,
      making a "U" around the static lines.
      19.23.6.3. Pull the strap forward to retrieve the static lines into the aircraft. Loadmasters
      may require assistance to pull the strap forward.
   19.23.7. If the static line retriever fails following a combination or tailgate drop, use the
   following procedure using the Prusik knot.
      19.23.7.1. Take a 30-inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop. Loop
      the cord around the static line retriever winch cable. Use a minimum of three wraps
      around the retriever cable to ensure locking of the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord.
      19.23.7.2. Pull to tighten the knot around the retriever winch cable to prevent slipping.
      Attach a carabineer into the 1/2-inch tubular nylon loop. Attach the hook end of a 5,000-
      pound strap into the carabineer and pull in the static lines. The 1/2-inch tubular nylon
      cord will remain locked in place under tension.
      19.23.7.3. More than one 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch cable
      using the Prusik knot to facilitate static-line retrieval. The Prusik knot may be adjusted up
      or down the cable as required. The knot will not slip as long as it is wrapped tightly with
      a minimum of three turns (more wraps equal more friction) and tension is applied.
19.24. Tailgate Airdrop Procedures.
   19.24.1. Tailgate drops are those drops during which parachutists exit from the aircraft ramp.
   The maximum rigged weight of the parachutist is 325 pounds. Tailgate drops are approved
   for STT, Pararescue (PJ), Air Force Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) Specialists,
   Army Special Forces, Navy SEALS, paratroopers equipped for arctic airdrop, other US and
   allied special operations personnel, US Army Quartermaster Center and School, Yuma
   Proving Ground Airborne Test Force, and units for which a combination drop is their normal
   method of deployment.
   19.24.2. Rig both anchor cables and static line retrievers before takeoff to provide maximum
   mission flexibility. Mission commanders may approve rigging only one cable and static line
   retriever winch if circumstances dictate.
   19.24.3. Use one anchor cable for each pass and limit each pass to a maximum of 20
   parachutists. If more than one pass is required, alternate anchor cables, retrieving static lines
   and deployment bags prior to each additional pass to prevent entanglement. Static lines are
   retrieved using aft controls. NOTE: To ensure full utilization of the aircraft during training,
   over-the-ramp personnel airdrops may be made with center-aisle seats installed to
   approximately flight station 650 (aft of escape ladder). When more than 20 static line
   parachutists are to be dropped on a single pass, the paratroop doors will be used.
19.25. Combination Airdrops.
 262                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   19.25.1. Combination drops are those during which parachutists exit from the aircraft ramp
   after equipment extraction or gravity release (CDS, Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC),
   Container Ramp Bundle (CRB) etc.).
   19.25.2. Combination drops are restricted to single-ship or the last aircraft of an equipment
   formation. When tailgating parachutists, the drop altitude is determined by the item
   requiring the highest drop altitude per AFI 11-231. If an additional pass is required to drop
   all the personnel after a combination CDS drop, close the ramp and door and re-rig the static-
   line retriever cable as depicted in TO 1C-130A-9.
   19.25.3. The navigator will compute a CDS or platform CARP and a personnel CARP (for
   ten seconds after the equipment release point) using the same IAS and altitude used for the
   equipment. Inform the jumpmaster if the PI falls within 150 yards of the DZ boundary; the
   jumpmaster is the final approving authority in this situation.
19.26. Door Bundle Airdrops.
   19.26.1. General A-7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds (excluding the weight
   of the parachutes) are referred to as "door bundles" and are dropped from the aircraft through
   the paratroop door or ramp and door using the personnel airdrop checklist. Door bundles may
   be dropped independently or with personnel and are limited to one bundle per exit used.
   When dropped with personnel, the bundle is the first object to exit the aircraft. Remove
   restraints and position the bundle in the paratroop door or on the ramp prior to completion of
   the slowdown checklist. (EXCEPTION: If the jumpmaster needs the paratroop door for
   spotting, place the door bundle as close as possible to the paratroop door.) If jumpers are to
   follow the door bundle, the user is responsible for ejecting the bundle out the troop door or
   off the ramp. For door bundles exiting over the ramp, secure the forward end of the bundle to
   a suitable floor tiedown ring with one-half inch tubular nylon. This tie is to prevent
   premature release of the bundle and will be cut by the loadmaster at the release point.
       19.26.1.1. Door bundles dropped from the paratroop doors will be rigged with non-
       breakaway static lines. Their dimensions, including the parachute, must not exceed 48
       inches by 30 inches by 66 inches unless authorized in a specific T.O. When the container
       is placed in the door for airdrop, the largest dimension will be placed in the vertical or
       upright position. The parachute must be placed on top of the load, or toward the inside of
       the aircraft.
       19.26.1.2. Door bundles dropped from the ramp and door will be rigged with a T-10
       parachute (converted for cargo) or parachute equipped with breakaway static lines (per
       TO 13C7-1-11, Airdrop of Supplies and Equip—Rigging Containers). Also, bundles
       rigged for a ramp exit are equipped with a skid board compatible with the center roller
       conveyors. NOTE: If no parachutists are to be dropped after the door bundles, non-
       breakaway static lines will be used. Anchor cable stops will be positioned as depicted in
       TO 1C-130A-9 for CDS airdrops.
   19.26.2. During unilateral single-ship airdrop training, door bundles will not exit aircraft
   after a paratrooper has jumped. NOTE: During joint training, combat or contingency
   operations, the user determines door bundle requirements and order of exit from any or all
   personnel airdrop aircraft in the formation.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              263


   19.26.3. When door bundles are dropped with personnel, compute the CARP for the first
   paratrooper exiting after the bundle and compute an additional CARP for the door bundle to
   ensure that it will impact on the DZ. Release the bundle at the personnel CARP, followed by
   the parachutists when the door is clear. When a door bundle is the only object dropped, base
   the CARP on the bundle.
19.27. Equipment Airdrops. Only equipment rigged in accordance with 13-C series T.O.s or
JSOC 350 series may be airdropped. The maximum airdrop load to be extracted over the ramp is
42,000 pounds for C-130E/H airplanes 61-2358, 62-1784 and up and 25,000 pounds for other C-
130 aircraft. The aerial delivery unit supporting the load movement ensures current publications
are available for loadmaster reference during joint inspections.
19.28. Heavy Equipment airdrops with the Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS).
   19.28.1. Loadmasters must receive EPJS ground training before using the system during
   airdrop missions.
19.29. CDS Airdrops.
   19.29.1. Reset flaps according to the appropriate CDS flap setting chart and maintain level
   flight. It is not recommended to drop CDS at gross weights less than 104,000 pounds. If drop
   must be made, use zero flaps and expect longer than normal exit time. CAUTION: The
   aircraft will tend to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft. This pitch must be controlled to
   allow no more than two or three degrees additional pitch. Do not over control to the point
   that negative "G" forces are encountered while the load is exiting the aircraft as this increases
   exit time or may stop load movement. CAUTION: Dropping high altitude CDS bundles at
   17,000 feet or above requires proper yoke compensation for shift in center of gravity as the
   load exits. Premature yoke inputs, over compensation, or no yoke inputs all may result in
   aircraft tail impacts by exiting bundles.
   19.29.2. When the loadmaster calls ―load clear‖, the flaps should be set to 50 percent.
   19.29.3. Loadmasters are permitted to pull down sharply with a gloved hand or on a tiedown
   strap looped over the static-line retriever winch cable to assist the cut of the release gate.
   Loadmasters will only pull on the cable after hearing and seeing "GREEN LIGHT‖.
       19.29.3.1. A manual gate cut is defined as using a knife to cut/release the CDS/inter-
       mediate gates. Loadmasters will not cut release gates while in the paratroop doors next to
       the exiting bundles. Loadmasters will ensure they hear and see ―GREEN LIGHT‖ before
       manually cutting the CDS/intermediate release gate. EXCEPTION: For LCLA airdrops,
       ―Green light‖ must be seen or heard by the loadmaster prior to releasing the load.
       Loadmasters are allowed to go aft of the buffer stop/ alternate forward barrier to
       manually cut the release gate. Exercise caution to remain clear of exiting bundles. All
       single stick container loads (CVR and non-CVR) may be released using manual gate cut
       procedures. Double stick CDS released simultaneously will only be cut using the static-
       line retriever.
       19.29.3.2. When performing a manual gate cut, enter ―N/A‖ into blocks 3, 5, and 6 of the
       DD Forms 1748-1 Entry C ―Type XXVI Nylon Release Gate.‖ Annotate ―Manual Gate
       Cut‖ into Block 17, Remarks.
 264                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   19.29.4. Airdrops at or above 3,000 feet AGL will normally be conducted with high velocity
   parachutes. When necessary for operational missions, airdrops at or above 3,000 feet AGL
   may be accomplished with low-velocity parachutes with prior coordination through theater
   CAOC/AMD, and with concurrence of the user and aircraft commander. The user must
   understand accuracy utilizing low-velocity parachutes above 3,000 feet AGL will be
   diminished. User must accept responsibility for final bundle condition and the potential
   diminished accuracy of airdrop loads.
   19.29.5. Loadmasters will ensure all CDS bundles (high or low-velocity) are rigged in the
   following static-line configurations:
       19.29.5.1. Non-Breakaway: CDS loads rigged with low velocity chutes dropped below
       1000 feet AGL will be rigged Non-Breakaway. CDS loads rigged with high velocity
       parachutes dropped below 2000 feet AGL will be rigged non-breakaway.
       EXCEPTION: LCADS parachutes will always be rigged for breakaway regardless of
       altitude.
       19.29.5.2. Breakaway: CDS loads rigged with low velocity parachutes above 1000 feet
       AGL or high velocity parachutes above 2000 feet AGL may be rigged with break-away
       or non-breakaway. CDS loads dropped at 10,000 feet MSL and above will be rigged and
       airdropped with breakaway static lines regardless of AGL altitude.
       19.29.5.3. Release-away: JPADS 2K loads will be rigged and airdropped with release-
       away static lines regardless of planned drop altitude.
   19.29.6. Release-away, breakaway, and non-breakaway static lines for CDS airdrops
   (contingency and training), will be rigged utilizing the anti-oscillation tie. EXCEPTION:
   The anti-oscillation tie is not required for a single non-breakaway bundle per cable, per pass.
   Additional bundles may be rigged on the same/opposite cable without anti-oscillation ties if
   dropped on separate passes.
19.30. Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) Airdrops.
   19.30.1. Use the standard CDS checklist. Either two CRRC platforms and up to 18 static-
   line parachutists or one CRRC platform and up to 19 parachutists may be airdropped on one
   pass. Checklist and emergency procedures are the same as for CDS airdrops. Wind and sea
   state limitations are at the discretion of the supported unit. NOTE: When airdropping two
   CRRC platforms, the forward release gate must be cut manually by the loadmaster. When
   dropping one CRRC, either use the static line retriever or manually cut the release strap.
19.31. Free-Fall Airdrops. Use the normal CDS airdrop checklist and emergency procedures.
Single containers not exceeding weight or dimension restrictions for door bundles may be
dropped from either troop door using the personnel airdrop checklist.
19.32. High Velocity CDS Airdrops. Use normal CDS aircrew checklist procedures.
   19.32.1. Units must establish a marking system to readily identify which 26-foot parachutes
   are packed for breakaway and non-breakaway static lines. The aircrew must ensure the CDS
   loads and the high-velocity parachutes are rigged and packed (marked) properly for the
   planned airdrop altitude (MSL). Aircrew procedures must be consistent with parachute
   packing.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            265


19.33. Container Ramp Bundles. The CDS Airdrop Checklist will be used with the exception
of arming the CDS switch. CDS flap setting must be computed and used to ensure a positive
deck angle for the drop.
   19.33.1. Current items considered ramp bundles are: Zodiac Boat in A-22 Cargo Bag
   (RAMZ) rigged IAW FM 10-542/TO 13C7-51-21, Airdrop Of Supplies and Equipment
   Rigging Loads for Special Operations, Small Inflatable Boat (IBS) rigged IAW FM 10-
   542/TO 13C7-51-21, and One or Two Motorcycles on a Combat Expandable Platform rigged
   IAW FM 10-577/TO 13C7-55-1, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment Rigging Military Utility
   Vehicles. Ramp bundles will be loaded and rigged in the aircraft IAW Section 7-IIA of the
   aircraft TO 1C-130A-9.
      19.33.1.1. RAMZ containers are jumpmaster-directed ramp bundle drops regardless of
      the type parachute used by the STT team. The jumpmaster may use streamers and request
      additional passes to position the aircraft over the containers and STT release point.
      Containers are individually secured to the ramp with Type VIII nylon, which is manually
      cut by the loadmaster on the jumpmaster‘s command. The STT may exit immediately
      after container release or on a subsequent pass.
      19.33.1.2. For jumpmaster-directed RAMZ airdrops, a navigator‘s CARP/HARP is not
      required when using streamers/spotter chutes.
      19.33.1.3. For single-pass RAMZ airdrops, compute the CARP/HARP for the RAMZ by
      dividing the packages weight in two and applying this result to the ballistic data for a
      single, personnel T-10A/B parachute. If STT personnel jump on the same pass with the
      RAMZ, combination drop procedures apply.
   19.33.2. Alternate Navigator Directed RAMZ Deployment.
      19.33.2.1. Accomplish the slowdown using normal procedures.
      19.33.2.2. Release point. The navigator determines the release point and assumes the
      responsibility to call "five seconds" and "green light." At green light, the loadmaster will
      manually cut the RAMZ bundle loose, which will signal the jumpers are clear to follow
      the gravity ejected load.
   19.33.3. RAMZ Preflight. Prior to flight, the loadmaster will ensure the following items are
   accomplished:
      19.33.3.1. Ensure that no fuel is leaking from the RAMZ bundle. A leaking bundle will
      not be loaded aboard the aircraft or will be downloaded if already aboard. If one or more
      RAMZ with fuel are loaded aboard the aircraft the day prior to flight, the fumes may be
      decreased/eliminated by venting the aircraft overnight. Close both paratroop doors onto
      the extended jump platforms and secure them with tie down straps. WARNING: If
      flammable fumes are present, unnecessary electrical equipment/switches will not be
      turned on or off until the fumes are eliminated. Use 100 percent oxygen and accomplish
      the Smoke and Fume Elimination checklist as appropriate. WARNING: Only 15-foot
      static line will be used on the RAMZ cargo parachutes. A 12-foot static line extended to
      15-feet will not be used. If personnel (rigged for static line airdrop) are to follow
      immediately after the RAMZ, their static lines will also be 15-feet. NOTE: When loaded
      aboard the aircraft, the vertical restraint tiedown strap on the RAMZ will be secured in
266                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


      such a manner that it is not placed over any fuel bladder, and just tight enough to take the
      slack out of the strap.
  19.33.4. RAMZ Deployment:
      19.33.4.1. During the pre-slowdown checklist, vertical, aft and forward restraint straps
      will be removed from the RAMZ package. Gradually release the forward restraint to
      allow the package to slowly shift forward against the Type VIII nylon release strap.
      WARNING: Personnel must stand clear of the RAMZ package when removing the
      forward restraint.
      19.33.4.2. At the "one minute" call, the jumpmaster will normally be on the left side of
      the cargo ramp and may be spotting from the aft end. Additional jumpers will be forward
      of the RAMZ. The loadmaster will be positioned to retrieve the RAMZ parachute static
      line D-bag(s) (for HALO airdrops) and to observe equipment and jumpers at all times. At
      the "one minute" call, the jumpmaster will be alerted and the Type VIII nylon release
      strap is rechecked. WARNING: If a "no drop" is called and the RAMZ is held in place
      by only the release strap, all personnel will move forward of the ramp hinge, except the
      loadmaster and the jumpmaster who will monitor the RAMZ for possible shifting and
      secure as necessary.
      19.33.4.3. If the deployment is jumpmaster directed, the jumpmaster will determine the
      exit point and deploy prior to receiving a "no drop" notification or seeing the red light
      come on. The loadmaster will relay to the pilot all visual corrections given by the
      jumpmaster. The jumpmaster will signal for the loadmaster to cut the Type VIII nylon
      release strap.
      19.33.4.4. If the deployment is PIC or navigator directed, the loadmaster will relay
      pertinent information to the jumpmaster. At the command "green light", the loadmaster
      will cut the Type VIII nylon release gate and deploy the RAMZ. If jumpers are tailgating,
      this will signal the jumpers that they are cleared to follow the load. If jumpers are freefall
      parachuting, they will exit after the loadmaster has retrieved the RAMZ parachute D-
      bags. WARNING: If the RAMZ exits the aircraft, but fails to properly deploy, the static
      lines will be cut immediately. CAUTION: The Type VIII nylon release strap must be
      cut below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free through floor tie down rings.
  19.33.5. The RAMZ package will normally be delivered aligned into the wind (+/- 30
  degrees) when the wind is 5 knots or greater. The jumpmaster will be advised when this
  cannot be complied with.
  19.33.6. The minimum deployment altitude will be 3500 feet AGL when the STT exits using
  freefall parachutes. Higher altitudes may be used for training. For operational missions,
  minimum altitude with the freefall parachutes is 2500 feet AGL. If low ceilings prohibit the
  use of freefall parachutes, the STT will deploy using static line parachutes immediately
  following the RAMZ package. The RAMZ and STT will be deployed from the same altitude.
  The minimum deployment altitude for both RAMZ and STT will be 800 feet AGL.
  19.33.7. For training, one or more safety recovery boats will be in position to recover
  equipment and personnel as required.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               267


19.34. Low Cost Low Altitude Airdrop (LCLA). LCLA airdrop is an aerial delivery system
consisting of low-weight airdrop bundles deployed from the aircraft ramp and door at very low
altitudes, enabling circular error (CE) accuracy within 100 meters. This airdrop is appropriate for
employment within or near a FOB or close to troops. While US Army and USMC fixed- and
rotary-wing platforms have traditionally accomplished this mission, theater requirements
necessitate MAF aircraft meet ground component requirements. Refer to applicable AFI, TO,
TTP, for further LCLA guidance.
   19.34.1. Bundles. LCLA bundle size and weight range depends on the rigging procedure and
   parachute type. Use the low cost polypropylene straps (similar to the A-7A straps) and a 42-
   inch skid board. NOTE: IAW TO 13C-7-1-11, Airdrop of Supplies and Equipment: Rigging
   Containers, skid boards require a minimum weight of 28 pounds per square foot. Bundles
   may be dropped individually or simultaneously from the ramp.
   19.34.2. Parachutes. All LCLA parachutes are one-time-use expendable items. MAJCOMs
   may permit subordinate organizations to reuse 24 and 35-foot cargo parachutes for training
   purpose only. The following is general information regarding current systems. Until
   published in AFI 11-231, refer to the LCLA Tactics Bulletin for parachute configurations,
   associated weight ranges, and ballistics data.
   19.34.3. Joint Airdrop Inspection. Accomplish JAI on all bundles utilizing the DD Form
   1748-1 in accordance with AFJI 13-210. For bundles to be repositioned, annotate ―to be
   rigged in-flight‖ in the Remarks section of the DD Form 1748-1.
   19.34.4. Checklists.
       19.34.4.1. Utilize the CDS AIRDROP checklist for all LCLA airdrops. The PF states
       ―CDS, LCLA PROCEDURES‖ during the PRE-SLOWDOWN checklist.
       19.34.4.2. Consider terrain on/around the DZ when setting the radar altimeter. Consider
       setting 50 feet below drop altitude to identify any discrepancies between planned MSL
       drop altitude and the radar altimeter due to an inaccurate altimeter setting. Identify a
       minimum CARA on the run-in and climb anytime ―ALTITUDE, ALTITUDE‖ is heard.
       19.34.4.3. During the slowdown, configure with 50-percent flaps and ramp and door on-
       speed.
       19.34.4.4. Do not remove forward restraint until the ramp is in the horizontal position.
       19.34.4.5. Crews may keep the RELEASE POINT checklist open if subsequent airdrops
       or racetracks are planned at the same DZ or to DZs within close proximity. Base
       racetrack decisions on mission-specific parameters, such as terrain and threat, and crew
       proficiency.
       19.34.4.6. Execute the airdrop with 50-percent flaps and the ramp and door open.
   19.34.4.7. Drop Airspeed. LCLA drop airspeed is 130 KIAS. CAUTION: LCLA parachutes
   are limited to 150 KIAS. The parachute‘s opening shock increases with PA.
   19.34.4.8. Drop Altitude. The primary altitude reference should be the planned MSL drop
   altitude based on the most accurate altimeter setting available. It is critical to cross-check the
   radar altimeter against the MSL altitude during the run-in.
 268                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   19.34.4.9. Release Point. Base navigator-directed airdrops on navigator sight angle. The
   SCNS-derived CARP is secondary for situational awareness.
   19.34.4.10. Navigator calls ―‖5 SECONDS…GREEN LIGHT.‖
   19.34.4.11. The LM must hear ―GREEN LIGHT‖ before initiating the airdrop. Seeing the
   GREEN LIGHT is highly desired, but not required.
   19.34.4.12. LMs should use a J-knife to cut the release gate. Ensure loadmasters cut both
   layers of Type VIII above the excess if utilizing the Nate Gate. Ensure to cut above the knot
   if utilizing 1, 9/16, or ½-inch nylon. Do not position the knife near the gate. CAUTION: Cut
   the gate towards the inboard of the aircraft. Failure to do so may cause the static line to
   become entangled with the J-knife and be severed from the load.
   19.34.4.13. Escape. Upon hearing ―LOAD CLEAR‖ the PF should advance the throttles as
   necessary and begin the egress.
   19.34.4.14. LMs should clear the ramp and door to close as soon as able after static line
   retrieval. Once the door is closed, accelerate and continue to climb above the threat, if
   possible.
   19.34.4.15. Load Drift Back. LMs may reposition (i.e., drift) containers weighing up to 650
   pounds rigged weight with the ramp and door open for racetracks or multiple DZs.
   CAUTION: Do not drift back bundles weighing over 650 pounds in-flight. NOTE: Conduct
   a preflight, static rehearsal of drifting to prevent inadvertent bundle release during execution.
       19.34.4.15.1. Do not move bundles onto the ramp until the ramp is horizontal. Advise
       the pilot ―Drifting.‖
       19.34.4.15.2. Immediately after the bundle is in position, take an additional carabineer
       and route it around the type VIII gate and attach it to a tie down ring immediately
       forward of the load. When tight, this gate will prevent the load from exiting prematurely.
       The additional carabineer will limit forward travel in the event of defensive maneuvers.
       19.34.4.15.3. Two bundles may be moved simultaneously, provided they are positioned
       side-by-side and both LMs have positive control of each bundle.
19.35. SATBs. A 15-pound training bundle may be dropped to simulate personnel, equipment,
or CDS airdrops. Use the applicable tactical airdrop checklist for the type airdrop being
simulated. EXCEPTION: The loadmaster will use the equipment checklist for simulated CDS
airdrops. SATBs may be dropped on the actual heavy equipment or CDS CARP for sight angle
airdrop training provided the bundle will land on the DZ. Adjust the drop score for the difference
between the SATB CARP and the actual CARP.
19.36. NVG Airdrop Procedures. Qualified NVG airdrop pilots are authorized to perform
normal night operations (including low level flying and formation) at night VMC altitudes IAW
the tactical chapters of this regulation and AFTTP 3-3.C-130E/H. Airdrops may be accomplished
on drop zones marked IAW AFI 13-217 lighting patterns (covert and overt) while wearing
NVGs. NVG airdrops on unmarked DZ are prohibited unless permitted by contingency SPINs or
coordinated through contingency ATO.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             269


   19.36.1. Loadmasters will use NVGs during airdrops if the mission dictates. Loadmasters
   are authorized to perform airdrops with minimum lighting. Use NVGs as necessary to assist
   with operations and keep cargo area lighting to a minimum.
   19.36.2. Cargo Compartment Lighting. After the Combat Entry Checklist, all cargo
   compartment lighting will be minimized. Blacked out (no-light) operations in the cargo
   compartment are not authorized. Loadmasters will carefully consider cargo compartment
   lighting intensity prior to opening ramp and door to minimize interference with formation
   wingmen‘s NVG vision.
19.37. Emergency Procedures. Loadmasters will complete a detailed emergency procedure
coordinated task briefing. All crewmembers should review the applicable emergency procedures
for the airdrop to be performed before takeoff. If a malfunction occurs during an airdrop, the
loadmaster immediately notifies the PIC and takes appropriate action. After all appropriate
emergency actions are complete, run the completion of drop checklist. NOTE: In the event of
a malfunction, incident, or off-DZ drop, do not de-rig, handle or move items unless required for
safety of flight. Any follow-on investigation will benefit from seeing the items in the position or
state they were in at the time of the event.
19.38. Emergency Parachutist Bail Out Procedures.
   19.38.1. Under satisfactory conditions (static-line exit), the minimum acceptable emergency
   bailout altitude is 400 feet above the terrain. When an aircraft emergency occurs during
   static-line airdrops, the PIC maintains an acceptable attitude and altitude for the parachutists
   to evacuate the aircraft. If the jump must be made at an airspeed in excess of 150 KIAS,
   advise the parachutists of the airspeed and altitude. Order evacuation by turning on the green
   light and giving the briefed alarm bell signals.
   19.38.2. Minimum emergency bail-out altitude for free-fall parachutists is 2,000 feet AGL.
   19.38.3. If conditions are unsuitable for aircraft evacuation, turn the red light on until exit
   doors are closed. The PIC advises the jumpmaster through the loadmaster to have the
   parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten seatbelts.
19.39. Towed Parachutist.
   19.39.1. The jumpmaster will stop the remaining parachutists; the loadmaster will notify the
   PIC; and the PM will turn on the red light. The PF will maintain drop airspeed, at least the
   minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the type parachute being used, and avoid flying over or up
   wind of water or built up areas.
       19.39.1.1. Crews should suspect they have a towed parachutist if static lines are not fully
       tucked into the upper corner of the paratroop door or if a D-bag appears to be stuck
       outside the door. It is unlikely for a D-bag to become caught on the outside of the aircraft
       and is a probable indicator a parachutist is being towed. In any case, crews should follow
       emergency procedures until they have confirmed no parachutist is being towed. Crews
       should take special effort to confirm towed jumper status at night with limited rearward
       visibility. They should consider using an additional source of illumination to view the
       rear of the aircraft.
   19.39.2. The jumpmaster or safety observer is responsible for identifying how the
   parachutist is towed. If being towed by anything other than the static line, the jumpmaster or
270                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


  safety will attempt to free the parachutist. If being towed by the static line, the jumpmaster or
  safety will make a recommendation to the PIC, through the loadmaster, whether to retrieve
  the parachutist or cut him or her free. If all parachutists have exited and there is no safety
  person onboard, this responsibility rests with the loadmaster.
  19.39.3. The PIC will make the final decision whether or not to cut the towed parachutist
  free. If the decision is to cut the parachutist free, the loadmaster will cut the static line on the
  PIC‘s command. NOTE: Towed parachutists indicate consciousness and that reserve
  parachute is ready by maintaining a tight-body position with both hands on reserve
  parachute. This indicates the jumper is prepared to be cut away.
  19.39.4. If the parachutist is towed after exit from a paratroop door, the pilot should lower
  the landing gear and set flaps to 100 percent to reduce parachute buffeting. (See warning
  below.) If possible, avoid turning the aircraft in the direction of the towed parachutist as this
  often causes parachutist to swing violently and increases the possibility of injury. All turns
  should be shallow and coordinated to reduce the severity of parachutist oscillation. During
  training, the first priority is to retrieve the parachutist whether he or she is conscious or
  unconscious. However, if the parachutist cannot be retrieved and indicates consciousness, cut
  the parachutist free. WARNING: Although 100 percent flaps selection provides an improved
  airflow for a towed parachutist, under certain conditions the landing gear down, 100 percent
  flap configuration may reduce aircraft performance. The PIC must consider density altitude,
  aircraft weight, position in formation, or other factors deemed important in determining what
  flap setting between 50 and 100 percent should be used.
  19.39.5. For a parachutist towed after exit from the cargo ramp and door, the first priority is
  to cut the parachutist free if consciousness is indicated. Retrieve if the parachutist is
  unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or if a condition exists that prevents
  cutting the static line. NOTE: If the parachutist is towed following a ramp exit, it will be
  necessary to partially rewind the static-line retriever to reach the static line for cutting.
  19.39.6. There are two methods for the retrieval of towed parachutists from the paratroop
  doors. The primary method of retrieval is use of the TPRS. The secondary method of
  retrieval is to rig a 5,000-pound tiedown strap/paratroop retriever bar in the paratroop door
  prior to retrieval of the towed parachutist. When the secondary method must be used, the
  maximum rigged weight of the parachutist is limited to 250 pounds (including equipment,
  parachute, etc.). WARNING: The 5,000-pound tiedown strap/paratroop retriever bar shall
  not be used with the TPRS.
  19.39.7. Parachutist Retrieval Through Paratroop Door Using TPRS.
      19.39.7.1. Install the retrieval sling assembly (choker) around all static lines immediately
      below the static line snap hooks.
      19.39.7.2. Install Retriever Assist Strap (RAS) around all static lines.
      19.39.7.3. Fold in jump platform.
      19.39.7.4. Using the static line retriever winch, retrieve the static lines through the RAS.
          19.39.7.4.1. If the static line retriever winch has been modified with the slip clutch
          assembly, engage static line retriever winch until it slips. If the retriever clutch slips
          prior to bringing the parachutist into the paratroop door area, determine and remove
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            271


        the cause of the overload, slightly unwind the static line retriever winch to reset the
        slip clutch, and continue retrieval operation. WARNING: During retrieval attempts,
        take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time. This
        does not preclude unwinding the retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary.
        19.39.7.4.2. Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begin to
        pass through the RAS.
     19.39.7.5. If in the paratroop door area, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand. If
     the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, i.e. positioned in the lower aft corner of the
     paratroop door, it is necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the RAS. Primary
     loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip. Secondary loadmaster
     and safety observer or jumpmaster (if safety observer or jumpmaster are onboard the
     aircraft) routes the D-bags through the RAS. Once the D-bags have been brought into the
     aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so they will not interfere with the
     remaining retrieval. The primary loadmaster will continue retrieval. When pulled up to
     the door, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand. WARNING: All personnel
     should remain clear of the paratroop door and the line of travel of the static line retriever
     cable until the parachutist has been retrieved to the door area. NOTE: When the
     parachutist is in the door area and is under the control of the loadmaster or safety
     observer, or jumpmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the
     line so the parachutist can be brought into the aircraft.
     19.39.7.6. After retrieving the parachutist, the pilot will reset flaps to 50 percent, raise
     the landing gear (if required), and call for completion of drop checklist.
  19.39.8. Parachutist Retrieval Through Paratroop Door Using 5,000-Pound Strap/Paratroop
  Retriever Bar.
     19.39.8.1. Install a 5,000-pound tiedown strap across the paratroop door by threading the
     hook end of the strap behind the one inch tubular brace located at FS 737, across the door
     under all static lines, and behind the one inch tubular brace at FS 700. Secure the hook
     end of the tiedown strap to a floor/rail tiedown ring forward of FS 700 and the ratchet end
     to any convenient tiedown ring aft of FS 737. Remove as much slack as possible.
     WARNING: Use extreme caution when routing 5,000-pound strap over the oxygen
     regulators located at FS 740 left and right side. NOTE: The strap may be routed prior to
     the drop at FS 740 provided it is secured and does not interfere with the paratroop door
     operation or jumpers.
     19.39.8.2. Push the static lines to the top of the paratroop door and remove additional
     slack in the tiedown strap. Fold the jump platform in.
     19.39.8.3. If the airplane is equipped with a paratrooper retriever bar, install the bar as
     follows: The bar is inserted beneath all of the static lines extending out of the door, and
     one end is then raised and inserted in the retaining bracket in the aft portion of the door
     frame. The other end of the bar is then carefully raised and inserted in the forward portion
     of the door frame. The bar provides a smooth surface for the static lines to ride over as
     the paratrooper is retrieved back into the airplane.
     19.39.8.4. Fold the jump platform in and initiate retrieval using the static-line retriever
     winch.
272                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


         19.39.8.4.1. If the aircraft has been modified with the slip clutch assembly to the
         static-line retriever winch, engage static-line retriever until it slips. If the retriever
         clutch slips prior to bringing the parachutist into the paratroop door area, determine
         and remove the cause of the overload. Then, slightly unwind the retriever to reset the
         retriever‘s slip clutch, and continue retriever operation.
         19.39.8.4.2. On aircraft not modified with slip clutch assemblies, stop retrieval when
         the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-bags begins to pass over the 5,000-pound
         strap/paratroop retriever bar. WARNING: During retrieval attempts, take all
         possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time. This does not
         preclude unwinding the retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary.
      19.39.8.5. When the parachutist is in the paratroop door area, bring the parachutist into
      the aircraft by hand. If it is difficult to get the parachutist into the area of the paratroop
      door, i.e. positioned in the lower aft corner of the paratroop door, it will be necessary to
      pull the D-bags manually through the opening between the 5,000-pound strap/paratroop
      retriever bar and the paratroop door.
         19.39.8.5.1. The loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever pistol grip.
         The other loadmaster, safety observer or jumpmaster will route D-bags through the
         opening. Once D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far
         enough forward so they will not interfere with the remaining retrieval.
         19.39.8.5.2. The loadmaster will continue retrieval. When pulled up to the door,
         bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand. WARNING: All personnel should
         remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the static-line retriever cable
         until the parachutist has been retrieved to the door area. NOTE: When the
         parachutist is in the door area and is being controlled by the loadmaster, safety
         observer or jumpmaster, slightly unwind the static-line retriever to relieve tension on
         the line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft. The jump platform may be
         extended once the parachutist is in the door area.
      19.39.8.6. After retrieving the parachutist, the PM will reset flaps to 50 percent, raise the
      landing gear (if required) and call for the completion of drop checklist.
  19.39.9. Parachutist Retrieval Through Ramp and Door. WARNING: The TPRS shall not
  be used during parachutist retrieval through ramp and door.
      19.39.9.1. Thread the hook end of the 5,000-pound tiedown strap, front to rear, around
      the right/left vertical support member at FS 840 approximately 5-1/2 feet above the ramp
      in the ADS position. Attach the hook end into the strap and draw taut. Run the ratchet
      end of the strap across the ramp and thread it, front to rear, around the opposite vertical
      support member at FS 840. Remove all slack from the strap and attach the ratchet end to
      any convenient tiedown ring forward of FS 840. Ratchet the strap until taut. NOTE: For
      aircraft with tiedown rings installed at FS 847 (waterline 208), the 5,000-pound tiedown
      strap may be installed by attaching the hook end of the strap to the sidewall ring at FS
      847 on the same side as the towed parachutist with the hook facing forward. Hook the
      ratchet end of the strap to the opposite sidewall ring at FS 847, remove all the slack from
      the strap, and ratchet the strap until taut. The strap will be pre-measured prior to pre-
      slowdown and excess strap taped.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                               273


      19.39.9.2. Using the static-line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the
      parachutist is pulled up to the ramp, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand
      underneath the strap. WARNING: The last 5 feet are the most crucial for the towed
      parachutist. An oscillating parachutist usually strikes the aircraft head first. If the
      parachutist is oscillating violently, stop the retrieval momentarily to allow stabilization,
      and then continue with retrieval. Repeat these steps as required. NOTE: After the
      parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster, safety
      observer or loadmaster slightly unwinds the static-line retriever to relieve tension on the
      line so the parachutist can be brought into the aircraft.
      19.39.9.3. After retrieving the parachutist, run the completion of drop checklist.
      WARNING: There is no effective, dependable, or consistently reliable means to
      manually retrieve a towed parachutist from the paratroop door or ramp and door.
      Manually retrieving a parachutist is a last resort. Manual retrieval techniques vary,
      depending on the scenario, and should be used with extreme caution.
19.40. Equipment Emergency Procedures.
   19.40.1. When notified of a malfunction, the PF will maintain drop airspeed and AGL
   altitude (if possible) and avoid flying over or upwind of water or built up areas to the
   maximum extent possible. NOTE: Make no further attempt to airdrop the platform.
   WARNING: Exercise extreme caution when manually cutting the extraction line. Platforms
   could dislodge from restraint chains, or a malfunctioning EPJS could suddenly initiate the
   squib and release the extraction line. In all cases, the extraction line will rapidly recoil after
   the cut. WARNING: The combined effects of aircraft gross weight, drop altitude, and
   temperature may prevent level flight at drop speed when towing deployed extraction
   parachutes as small as 22 feet. Total drag on the aircraft may be more than the thrust
   available to overcome it. The situation could require an immediate forced landing near the
   DZ.
   19.40.2. For multiple 28-foot extraction parachutes deployed outside the aircraft, if the load
   cannot be jettisoned and flight conditions permit, proceed to a suitable airfield, avoid flying
   over built up areas and land in a flat attitude with ramp and door open. WARNING: With
   multiple 28-foot extraction parachutes deployed outside the aircraft, maximum thrust will be
   needed to stay aloft or to control the descent. The drag produced by the extraction parachutes
   should decrease if airspeed is allowed to bleed off. This reduction in drag could permit level
   flight or reduce the rate of descent should level flight not be possible. Do not reduce power to
   achieve this air speed change and do not slow below max effort takeoff speed. Max effort
   takeoff speed is 1.2 X power on stall speed and provides an acceptable airspeed margin for
   zero bank angle. If the aircraft must be turned to get to a suitable landing area, this airspeed
   may not be sufficient to prevent a stall while in banked flight. If a turn is required, pilots
   should be sensitive to the first indication of a stall and reduce bank and or lower nose to
   decrease angle of attack and eliminate the stall indication. Any power reduction will increase
   the stall speed. The tradeoff in selecting a landing site, straight ahead or one requiring a turn
   is a function of the rate of descent the required airspeed will produce. The higher the
   airspeed, the faster the aircraft will likely descend. A forced landing straight ahead will
   produce the lowest allowable airspeed, least rate of descent and most desirable impact forces.
   Any turn will decrease the time before impact. However, the risks associated with turning
   may be mitigated by the terrain the aircraft will impact such as forest or built up areas.

   19.40.3. Upon landing, ensure the load and airdrop system is not tampered with until after
   the malfunction is investigated by tactics/standardization and evaluation personnel.
19.41. CDS Emergency Procedures. WARNING: When notified of a malfunction, extend
additional flaps and lower the nose to maintain a slight nose down attitude until the ramp and
door are closed and the load is secured. Maintain drop airspeed and AGL altitude (if possible)
and avoid flying over or upwind of water or built up areas.
   19.41.1. If a malfunction is due to a failure of the static-line retriever or CDS remote timer
   system, the mission may be continued provided the 80 lb tie on the knife did not break, and
   the knife did not nick the gate. Use the opposite static line retriever and manually activate the
   retriever switch at FS 245 for three seconds or perform a manual gate cut. The DD 1748-2 is
   not required, but a write-up in the AFTO 781A is required.
19.42. High Altitude Emergency Procedures. If a physiological incident occurs, the PIC will:
   19.42.1. Abort the mission.
   19.42.2. Begin descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and
   degree of sickness or pain).
   19.42.3. Ensure the affected person remains on 100 percent oxygen until a medical doctor
   determines the type of treatment required.
   19.42.4. Proceed to the nearest base with qualified medical assistance available.
   19.42.5. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request an ambulance meet the
   aircraft.
   19.42.6. Advise attending physician to call USAF Hyperbaric Medicine Division; during
   duty hours call DSN 554-3483 or (210) 292-3483 and after duty hours call DSN 554-5990 or
   (210) 292-5990. For out of area medical assistance, call the Divers Alert Network (DAN) at
   1-800-446-2671.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                          275


                                         Chapter 20

                             AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force C-130 Aircrews, AE Aircrews and all management
   levels concerned with operations of the C-130 aircraft. All operators involved in AE
   missions on C-130 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-130 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DOD members and their
   dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel
   will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AEV3, Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
   Operations Procedures, and AFI 41-307, in conjunction with this publication, to accomplish
   the AE mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3)
   is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is a qualified pilot responsible for command and control of all persons
   aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or
   operational considerations, his/her decisions are final (see AFI 11-2MDS-specific V3 for a
   more detailed list of PIC responsibilities). In matters of patient care, decisions of the MCD
   are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director. The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for the
   overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions.
   He/she advises the PIC on patients‘ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may
   affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well
   being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with
   supporting agencies.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will alert the
   medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before
   mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
 276                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems
20.4. Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communications link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable). Identify armed crewmembers (as required).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
   (AECM) into single crew throughout mission including enroute transportation, dining,
   billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
   patient requirements. When the sortie is being flight managed, coordinate flight restrictions
   with the FM if the FM provided plan needs to be modified.
   20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for
   loading, positioning, and egress considerations as outlined in paragraph 20.10.
   20.4.6. Comply with hazardous cargo/passenger restrictions in AFMAN 24-204/TM 38-
   250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO P4030.19I/DLAI 4145.3.
   20.4.7. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, and additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
   20.4.8. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as
   requested by the MCD.
   20.4.9. Brief the MCD on additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
20.5. Loadmaster Responsibilities.
   20.5.1. Assist the AE crew with aircraft systems.
   20.5.2. Coordinate emergency evacuation plan with the MCD.
   20.5.3. Operate aircraft systems, (i.e. doors, ramps, emergency exits, etc).
   20.5.4. Assist the AE crew as necessary, providing such assistance does not interfere with
   primary duties.
   20.5.5. Operate galley and prepare food and beverages for food service provided to patients
   by AECMs.
   20.5.6. Assist with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.5.7. The LM will provide the MCD with an interphone cord.
20.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Responsibilities.
   20.6.1. Responsible for patient clinical care activities including loading, positioning, and off-
   loading.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             277


   20.6.2. Assist Loadmaster/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
   20.6.4. The MCD or designated AECM should monitor interphone (headset) during flight.
   The MCD will be on headset with the PIC during critical phases of flight and during in-flight
   emergencies.
   20.6.5. The Charge Medical Technician (CMT) is responsible for all ground operations
   involved with patients. The CMT, in coordination with the loadmaster, is responsible for
   vehicle movement and positioning around the aircraft.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
   EXCEPTION: ERO procedures as outlined in paragraph 20.14.
20.8. Aircraft Refueling.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station's patients.
       20.8.1.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
   20.8.2. Fuel Servicing Operations. Unless servicing JP-4, simultaneous servicing of fuel
   while loading passengers, patients, cargo, performing maintenance, aircrew members
   performing inspections, or operating aircraft systems is considered to be a normal fuel
   servicing operation.
       20.8.2.1. Normal Fuel Servicing Operations is the simultaneous servicing of fuel or
       oxygen with or without patients on board while cargo loading/unloading or maintenance
       operations are being performed. Normal fuel servicing may be accomplished with
       patients onboard.
       20.8.2.2. Prior to starting servicing, the total number of patients, passengers, and crew on
       board the aircraft will be given to the fire department. EXCEPTION: See guidance
       below. AECMs and passenger service representatives will not serve as PCMs.
       20.8.2.3. The PCM will brief patients on emergency egress, exit prohibitions, and
       hazards. Ambulatory patients will remain seated but will not wear seatbelts during CS.
       When possible, the PCM should conduct the briefing prior to servicing.
       20.8.2.4. At least two qualified AECMs (one must be a FN) will remain onboard to
       observe patients and assist patients in the event of an egress.
       20.8.2.5. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling
       process. Onload/Offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.
       20.8.2.6. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-
   flight per TO 1C-130A-9 and AFI 11-2C-130 V3 Addenda A.
   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions.
 278                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       20.9.2.1. Roller conveyers will be stowed, unless required for comfort/baggage pallets.
       Rollers on the ramp will be stowed during patient on-loading or off-loading operations.
       20.9.2.2. Litter patients will be enplaned feet first and deplaned head first due to minimal
       degree of ramp incline. This eliminates the need to turn litter patients around on the cargo
       ramp prior to placing them in the litter tier. Patient diagnosis may determine that they be
       loaded head first.
       20.9.2.3. A five (5) high configuration using the center seat and litter stanchions is
       approved for all AE missions.
       20.9.2.4. The seat and litter stanchion ladder will be installed for all AE missions when
       cargo requirements permit.
       20.9.2.5. Litter support straps will be secured to the aircraft floor prior to take-off. If
       litters are not in the tier, loose litter support straps will be secured in a top and bottom
       litter support bracket on the center seat and litter stanchion. This will remove a free-
       swinging strap hazard.
   20.9.3. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin‘s
   mission configuration.
   20.9.4. Therapeutic Oxygen. Therapeutic oxygen is not an integral system on the C-130
   aircraft. Use the PTLOX/NPTLOX system.
   20.9.5. Integral patient/passenger emergency oxygen is not available on the aircraft. In the
   event of an emergency, patients and passengers will use the EPOS.
   20.9.6. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. AECMs normally use an MA-1
   portable oxygen bottle. If MA-1 bottles are not available, PBE‘s may be used as portable
   oxygen. NOTE: If a pressure demand regulator is used, the oxygen supply will be turned
   ―off‖ when the personal oxygen equipment is removed.
   20.9.7. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.8. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
   20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
   utilization for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations
   will be identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of
   the number seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
   health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
   made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Refer to
   AFMAN 24-204 for hazardous product special provisions rating. P4 and P5 rated hazardous
   material have no AE restrictions. Conflicts will be referred to the respective tasking AE
   command element for decision. Litter patients will be positioned forward of cargo pallets.
   EXCEPTION: If cargo is in place, and the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported
   aft of the cargo. The MCD and loadmaster will ensure patient egress is not affected by
   mixed cargo/patient loads.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                             279


   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
   MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.5. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PTLOX) or Next Generation Patient
   Therapeutic Oxygen System (NPTLOX) may be transported for positioning and
   depositioning AE crews. A maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported
   simultaneously without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required.
   If shipping more than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic. This will
   prevent potential high concentration of oxygen levels. WARNING: Ensure the cargo floor is
   free from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.6. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. It is United States
   Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients personnel, or casualties
   with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare agents
   will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system. Decontamination
   must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of contamination. In rare
   cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical missions. If such
   transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent the spread of
   contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
   combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
      20.10.6.1. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
      transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
      that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
      and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
      suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated ―in place‖ or
      with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may
      be a requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical
      medical care. If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the
      involved geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and
      SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
      20.10.6.2. AMC will train and equip AE crews and stage required equipment at key hubs
      to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and contagious
      patients. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, a FL
      below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid
      decompression.
   20.10.7. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions except in
   extreme circumstances.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue (CFR).
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per TO 00-25-172.
   When concurrent fuel servicing with patients/passengers on board a major aircraft rescue and
   fire vehicle will be available to respond within three minutes or as determined by the base
 280                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


   Fire Chief. (NOTE: When servicing with JP-4 or Jet B Fuel, a major aircraft rescue and fire
   vehicle will be positioned at the aircraft).The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance. If a medical emergency occurs during flight,
and is determined by the MCD to be an urgent situation, a request for AIR EVAC Priority will
be requested. The PIC may request ―AIR EVAC priority‖ for preferential ATC handling if a
delay will affect a patient‘s well being. AIR EVAC priority will only be used for that portion of
the flight requiring expedited handling. Do not request priority for routine air evacuations to
avoid ATC delays or inconveniences. It is the PIC‘s responsibility to use this option only for
bona fide medical situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. The MCD will complete an AF Forms 3858, Aeromedical Evacuation Mission
   Offload Message and coordinate for transmission of patient information to C2 a minimum of
   30 minutes prior to estimated time of arrival.
20.14. ERO Procedures.
   20.14.1. ERO procedures are outlined in AFI 11-2AEV3. ERO procedures for loading
   patients are authorized for contingency operations or when AE mission requirements dictate
   minimum ground time. ERO procedures can be practiced/trained during Aeromedical
   Readiness Missions (ARMS), static trainers, joint training operations, exercises, etc. EROs
   will not be used in a non-contingency environment unless mission essential.
   20.14.2. The loadmaster will be positioned in a location to observe safety and on headset
   during actual on-load procedures. AECM‘s may exit the aircraft to conduct ground duties.
   Other guidance (e.g. ROE/Intel/SPINS) may provide additional information.
   20.14.3. When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen, helmets, flak
   vests, etc.), consider loading four (4) high versus five (5) high in the center seat and litter
   stanchions, to increase space between litters to accommodate gear. If situation
   requires/permits, remove personal gear from patients and secure on ramp or in a designated
   area.
   20.14.4. Baggage will be loaded on the aircraft ramp (or as required for weight and balance)
   and will not impede emergency egress. If duties permit, loadmasters will assist AECMs with
   securing baggage.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a time
   critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor
   loading procedures can be practiced/trained during ARMS, joint training operations,
   exercises, etc. The cargo/ramp floor will be configured with all rollers stowed (cargo
   permitting). Maximum altitude for floor loaded patients is FL 350. Patients will have an
   EPOS pre-positioned on their litter when floor loaded.

     20.15.1.1. Ambulatory Patients. If available, any cushioning material may be used for
     seating, to prevent the patient from having to sit on the cargo floor. Seat ambulatory
     patients to face forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row of
     patients, in a manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability. See TO 1C-
     130A-9 for proper use of the tie down device.
     20.15.1.2. Litter Patients. Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A for securing litter
     patients.

              EMERGENCY NUCLEAR AIRLIFT OPERATIONS (ENAO)

21.1. General. The objective is to move nuclear weapons safely. You may be tasked at any
time to airlift nuclear weapons. The amount of preparation time and degree of assistance you
receive will depend on the length of time the MAJCOM has to move the weapons.
21.2. Conduct of Operations. Crews should be briefed and receive detailed instructions from a
specific OPLAN or mission directive. If there is a conflict between this instruction and the
requirements in an OPLAN or mission directive, use the OPLAN or mission directive.
21.3. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Standards. Crews are expected to use sound judgment and
common sense in what may be a turbulent or tense environment. Pay particular attention to the
following areas:
   21.3.1. Nuclear weapons must be handled safely. The most immediate hazard is the high
   explosive that can be set off by shock or heat in most nuclear weapons. Keep loading
   operations controlled and orderly at all times. Load or handle only one item or pallet at a
   time. Shipper and receiver personnel are highly trained in nuclear cargo movements and
   should be used to assist in cargo loading operations and tie down. The overall aircraft loading
   responsibility belongs to the aircrew.
   21.3.2. Use specific loading procedures outlined in TO 1C-130A-9, Section 6.
       21.3.2.1. For mixed loads (more than one type of weapon), base the load plan on how
       many weapons can be properly restrained using TO 1C-130A-9 criteria. Do not allow
       weapons to rub or touch each other when tied down.
   21.3.3. The route of flight must not violate restrictions in the classified United States Air
   Force Special Weapons Over-flight Guide (SWOG). Over-flight of a foreign country with
   nuclear weapons is an extremely sensitive issue. Comply with SWOG instructions at all
   times. Crews without access to the SWOG, will request a route of flight that complies with
   the SWOG through command and control center (C2 agency) channels, 618 AOC/XOCG,
   DSN 779-0323. The C2 agency must ensure the route of flight is provided to the aircrew by
   the most expeditious means available. If no route of flight is provided, fly normal ATC
   routings to the destination. Do not divulge the nature of cargo to any enroute ATC facility or
   country to obtain a specific clearance.
21.4. Aircrew Selection. All active duty aircrews (except 374 AW) may be used for
Emergency Nuclear Airlift Operations (ENAO).
21.5. Aircrew Requirements.
   21.5.1. Crew complement will be according to the OPLAN or specific mission directive. If
   not specified, use a normal crew complement.
   21.5.2. The crew will be armed (courier and two additional crewmembers).
   21.5.3. Crewmembers tasked for a mission that has a higher security classification than their
   personnel security clearance will be authorized emergency access to enough information to
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            283


   complete the mission. Approval authority rests with a general officer, wing commander, or
   wing commander equivalent and cannot be delegated.
21.6. Aircrew Briefings.
   21.6.1. A controlling agency or delegated representative will conduct a predeparture or
   enroute briefing for aircrew members prior to executing an active leg of ENAO. The
   controlling agency can pass classified mission information to the crew through the Shipping
   Agency. The aircraft commander will brief anyone who joins the mission enroute. Aircrews
   should be briefed on the following:
      21.6.1.1. Purpose of the mission.
      21.6.1.2. Classification of the mission, cargo, and locations.
      21.6.1.3. Itinerary, including confirmation of prior coordination for hazardous material
      as required by IFR supplement and alternate airfields.
      21.6.1.4. Cargo. TO 11N-20-11 (C), Gerneral Firefighting Guidance line numbers
      should be included. Obtain line numbers from the fire department or the controlling
      agency prior to loading. TO 11N-20-11 (C) is a classified technical order that assigns an
      unclassified line number to each nuclear weapon.
          21.6.1.4.1. Restrictions on transporting additional general cargo or passengers.
      21.6.1.5. ―No lone zone,‖ two-person concept, and security requirements.
      21.6.1.6. Personnel authorized to sign for nuclear weapons at the destination.
      21.6.1.7. Current intelligence, including threat analysis.
      21.6.1.8. SWOG route of flight restrictions.
      21.6.1.9. Airborne intercept (SWOG).
      21.6.1.10. Jettisoning (SWOG).
      21.6.1.11. Command Disable System (CDS) procedures.
      21.6.1.12. The PIC will ensure emergency procedures in paragraph 21.10 below are
      briefed
      21.6.1.13. ORM risks/levels/mitigating factors for the mission.
21.7. Enroute Procedures. Use these procedures in addition to the normal operating
procedures in the rest of this regulation.
   21.7.1. Flight Plans. Enter ―hazardous cargo‖ and the mission number in the ―other
   information‖ section of the flight plan. Crews carrying inert weapons, trainers, or other items
   that could be mistaken for real weapons by crash or rescue personnel in an emergency will
   enter ―inert devices.‖
   21.7.2. Radio Calls:
      21.7.2.1. Departure (on-load) base. Before starting the on-load, tell the tower to notify
      the fire department the ―on-load is commencing.‖ Prior to engine start, give the
      controlling agency (ground or tower) the parking location and approximate engine start
 284                      AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       time and announce there is hazardous cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is
       standing by the aircraft for engine start.
       21.7.2.2. Enroute or offload base. At least 30 minutes prior to landing, contact one of the
       following: command post, base operations, or control tower. Pass mission number and
       verify that the hazardous cargo information has been received. If the arrival base does not
       have hazardous cargo information, request the following be relayed immediately to the
       crash or fire protection agency and other support agencies as appropriate:
           21.7.2.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
           21.7.2.2.2. ETA.
           21.7.2.2.3. Department of Transportation (DOT) explosives hazard class or division
           (normally 1.1).
           21.7.2.2.4. Net explosive weight (NEW).
           21.7.2.2.5. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 (C) if requested. Obtain line numbers
           from the base fire department prior to starting the load at the on-load location.
           21.7.2.2.6. A request for isolated parking and security forces to meet the aircraft.
21.8. Custody of Nuclear Cargo. United States military custody of nuclear weapons is
required. The courier officer is responsible for receipt, custody, security, safety, and delivery of
nuclear weapons to authorize receivers. The courier must be a commissioned officer. A copilot
or navigator is the preferred option. Under certain conditions, the shipper may furnish United
States military couriers who will retain custody of the weapons in-flight.
   21.8.1. Prior to accepting and loading nuclear cargo, the shipper will brief the courier officer
   on the nature and hazards of the cargo. The courier will brief all crewmembers who didn't
   receive the shipper's briefing prior to flight. Ask the shipper to point out any specifics crews
   may need to handle the weapon, i.e. tiedown points, forklift stirrups, CDS procedures, etc.
   21.8.2. Time permitting, the courier and LM will inspect the cargo before accepting custody.
   The courier should have the shipper verify the integrity of a weapons case and replace any
   broken seals. Crews may be held responsible for damage at the receiving end if crews accept
   a damaged weapon without documentation. Document damage or broken seals on the DD
   1911, Materiel Courier Receipt, prior to signing for the weapon.
       21.8.2.1. Loadmasters will inspect weapons to ensure they are secured to carriers,
       conditions of tiedown rings, and condition of wheel casters etc.
   21.8.3. The courier accepts custody of the weapon by signing the DD 1911 provided by the
   shipper. Use this form to transfer cargo custody to replacement couriers.
   21.8.4. Release custody of the cargo only to a replacement courier or someone authorized to
   sign for nuclear material. Authorized receivers are identified by the shipper, by message, or
   through the AMC command and control system.
   21.8.5. Time permitting, refer any questions through the 618 AOC (TACC) Command
   Center to 618 AOC/XOCG, DSN 779-0323 for resolution.
21.9. Security Procedures. The host base is responsible for providing security for the aircraft
and the nuclear cargo. The courier officer (who has custody of the weapons) is the final authority
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                              285


on security matters; however, crews should follow the advice and procedures of the host security
force as much as possible. If the situation is serious and crews must load and depart quickly, use
judgment and dispense with the formalities. Prior to takeoff, the PIC will ensure security support
at all stations being transited that day through the 618 TACC or theater C2 agency Command
Center.
   21.9.1. Home Station. Conduct a thorough visual search of the aircraft for unauthorized
   explosives or stowaways. Use a bomb detection dog if available. If time is critical, do not
   delay the mission to ―sanitize‖ the aircraft.
   21.9.2. On-load Base. The host base should set up a restricted area, normally with ropes and
   stanchions, around the aircraft.
       21.9.2.1. Entry Control. Use one entry point to maintain strict control of entry into the
       area. The entry controller will have a roster of all personnel allowed to enter. Use a copy
       of the flight orders for the aircrew. Instruct the entry controller to coordinate with the
       aircrew courier before allowing anyone into the area. EXCEPTION: Allow the weapons
       convoy to enter the restricted area without delay.
       21.9.2.2. ―No lone zone.‖ Do not allow anyone to be alone in the restricted area or
       aircraft when nuclear weapons are present (inside either the area or the aircraft). The
       purpose of a ―no lone zone‖ is to prevent any one person from tampering with a nuclear
       weapon. The easiest way to enforce a ―no lone zone‖ is to always be in pairs inside the
       restricted area (for example, two aircrew members, two shippers, or one aircrew member
       and one shipper). Maintain the two person concept throughout the flight. Do not allow
       anyone to be alone in the cargo compartment or flight deck.
   21.9.3. If security forces do not meet the aircraft, the aircraft commander must be prepared
   for an immediate departure until security is established. Immediately upon block-in, the
   courier and security team will deplane. The aircrew will keep the aircraft engines running, all
   aircraft doors closed and delay preparation for nuclear cargo transfer until the courier verifies
   appropriate security is in place. CDS codes (if issued) must remain onboard the aircraft
   (normally with the copilot) until custody is transferred to the receiving authority. Once
   security is established, the only personnel authorized near the aircraft are aircrew members
   and those support personnel necessary to install landing gear pins, ground power and wheel
   chocks. Monitor these people at all time.
21.10. Emergency Procedures.
   21.10.1. Security Emergencies. Crews may use deadly force to protect nuclear cargo and
   will resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture a nuclear weapon. Consider any attack on
   an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against the
   nuclear weapons. Should hostages be used to gain access to, as cover for removal, or to
   thwart recovery of a nuclear weapon; the welfare and safety of the hostages should be
   considered in determining actions to be taken. However, the presence of hostages shall not
   deter the taking of decisive, prompt, and effective action that includes the use of deadly force
   to recover a nuclear weapon and to prevent unauthorized access to or removal of a nuclear
   weapon. If crews are attacked, take the following actions:
       21.10.1.1. Make an immediate takeoff, with the cargo if possible.
 286                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


       21.10.1.2. If the attack occurs during on-loading or off-loading, load the weapons as fast
       and as safely as possible; ensure sufficient cargo restraint and takeoff immediately.
       21.10.1.3. Some weapons are equipped with a CDS that internally destroys the capability
       of a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield. The CDS will be used when capture of
       a weapon is imminent.
       21.10.1.4. Aircrews will not use emergency destruct procedures on nuclear weapons.
       Emergency Destruction (ED) of weapons by shaped charges requires SECDEF approval
       and will be accomplished by qualified personnel who have the capability to receive,
       authenticate, and carry out ED orders. When two properly identified shipper or receiver
       personnel concurrently request custody of the cargo for ED purposes, release the cargo
       using appropriate custody transfer procedures.
   21.10.2. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The LM will identify which cargo is jettisonable IAW
   TO 1C-130xx-1. The PIC bears a moral obligation to jettison cargo or crash-land where the
   least amount of damage will result. Use the CDS, if applicable, prior to jettisoning or crash-
   landing. Record the coordinates of each jettisoned item. Observe the jettison restrictions in
   the SWOG.
   21.10.3. Landing in Foreign Countries. Be prudent and keep things very low key. If
   confronted with demands to board or inspect the aircraft, refer to the status of US military
   aircraft in DOD 4500.54G FCG which states: US military aircraft are sovereign
   instrumentalities. US military aircraft cleared to overfly or land in a foreign territory are
   entitled to the privileges and immunities customarily accorded to warships. These privileges
   and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties
   and taxation; immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety
   inspection); or other exercise or jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel,
   equipment, or cargo on board. Air Force PICs will not authorize search, seizure, inspection,
   or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by
   direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned. Diplomatically,
   but firmly, refuse any requests to board or inspect, and get help through any available United
   States channel. Flash priority is authorized.
21.11. Maintenance and Servicing on Aircraft Loaded with Nuclear Cargo.
   21.11.1. Maintenance on an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons must not violate safety
   rules normally used with aircraft loaded with conventional explosives. As much as possible,
   have maintenance and servicing completed before loading nuclear weapons on the aircraft.
   Do not allow maintenance, such as the following, that could increase the possibility of a fire:
       21.11.1.1. Using flame or uncontrolled heat-producing items.
       21.11.1.2. Repairs on the fuel system, cell, and tank or other maintenance where
       significant fuel spills are likely to result from disconnected lines, ruptured components,
       etc.
   21.11.2. Aircraft will not be jacked. The temporary lifting of one set of landing gear
   "integral jacking" for minor maintenance (tire change, brake change, bogie maintenance, etc.)
   is not considered aircraft jacking.
AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012                                            287


   21.11.3. Have a fire truck standing by at the aircraft during refueling, defueling, or oxygen
   servicing. Do not refuel, defuel, integral jack, or service oxygen while loading or offloading
   nuclear weapons.
   21.11.4. The flight engineer or crew chief will monitor all maintenance on the aircraft while
   nuclear cargo is on board.
21.12. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Operations Guide. This guide describes recommended
actions for courier and crew during emergency nuclear airlift operations. It is designed for those
missions diverted enroute to an on-load site where the crew does not have the opportunity to
receive a formal CRG, home station, or command post briefing. However, even if a formal
briefing is given, this guide may be used as a refresher. Security, time, and ground support may
not be sufficient to allow using this guide during emergency operations. In such cases, the
courier and crew must discuss all factors and use their judgment on the best course of action to
accomplish the mission. Safety and security is paramount in all decisions affecting transportation
of nuclear cargo.
21.13. Prior to On-load. Accomplish the following, either at home station or enroute to the on-
load site:
   21.13.1. Review crew responsibilities and the procedures to be used during on-load (loading
   method, security setup, cargo receipt, two-person concept). Do not discuss classified
   information over inter-phone.
   21.13.2. Enroute and 30 minutes prior to landing, contact the on-load site and notify them of
   ETA. Make support requirements known (fuel, MHE, transportation, security, etc.) at this
   time.
   21.13.3. If time permits and the equipment is readily available, install the Combat Track II
   system.
21.14. Arrival and On-load.
   21.14.1. Contact the senior security official and comply with the following: If crews have
   nuclear cargo on board, establish a restricted area and keep everyone off the aircraft. Provide
   armed security until the host security forces assume responsibility.
       21.14.1.1. A restricted area will be established around the aircraft. Ropes and stanchions
       are normally used to denote the restricted area. However, depending on the situation,
       crews may see additional guards, security vehicles, etc., rather than ropes. Be flexible.
       The key is whether the host base is furnishing enough security to protect the nuclear
       cargo.
       21.14.1.2. A single entry control point will be established.
   21.14.2. The entry controller must allow only those individuals into the restricted area who
   have been cleared by the courier. Tell the entry controller which individuals are authorized
   into the area and, time permitting, use crew orders as an EAL and prepared shipper lists.
   21.14.3. After security is established, verify shipper identification and accomplish the
   following with the shipper:
       21.14.3.1. Shipper briefing to include the following:
 288                     AFI11-2C-130V3_NIAGARAFALLSARSSUP_I 23 AUGUST 2012


          21.14.3.1.1. Nature, hazard, and safety regarding shipment of nuclear weapons cargo,
          including line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 (C), DOD class explosive hazard class or
          division, and net explosive weight (NEW).
          21.14.3.1.2. Courier escort requirements.
          21.14.3.1.3. Items requiring the two-person concept.
          21.14.3.1.4. Items that are CDS equipped and if the CDS has been activated (weapon
          not operational).
          21.14.3.1.5. Items exposed to an abnormal environment or not operational.
          21.14.3.1.6. Special handling or unique requirements particular to the cargo.
          21.14.3.1.7. Individuals required to assist during on-load or off-load. Pass the
          information to the entry controller.
          21.14.3.1.8. Authorized recipients at offload station. Get this information in writing.
       21.14.3.2. Cargo inspection:
          21.14.3.2.1. The primary LM, courier, and shipper will inspect the cargo for broken
          seals, exterior damage, security to carrier, wheel and casters, tiedown points, etc.
          Have the shipper annotate any discovered damage or discrepancies on the DD 1911.
          NOTE: Ensure the aircraft is ready for on-load prior to accepting custody of nuclear
          cargo.
          21.14.3.2.2. After the inspection, accept custody of the cargo by signing the DD
          1911.
   21.14.4. During on-load or off-load monitor the operation, assist as necessary, and ensure
   personnel comply with the two-person concept.
   21.14.5. After cargo on-load is complete and the crew is ready for engine start, the armed
   courier will deplane and tell the host base security to break down security and maintain
   surveillance until aircraft departure. The courier and other armed crewmembers will monitor
   access to the aircraft and crew entrance door during engine start.
21.15. Enroute to Offload.
   21.15.1. Maintain the two-person concept.
   21.15.2. Notify the 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency Command Center of departure
   time and ETA at the offload station. Be prepared to encode this information.
   21.15.3. If time permits, review the security and handling procedures to be used at the
   offload station. Do not discuss classified information over the interphone.
   21.15.4. Contact the agency specified in flight information publications (command post,
   base operations, or tower) 30 minutes prior to landing; ask if they have hazardous cargo
   information. If they don‘t, pass the following information:
       21.15.4.1. Call sign, type aircraft, and mission number.
       21.15.4.2. ETA.
       21.15.4.3. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 (C) or DD 1911.

      21.15.4.6. Inert devices, if applicable.
21.16. Off-load.
   21.16.1. If security forces do not meet the aircraft, the aircraft commander must be prepared
   for an immediate departure until security is established. Immediately upon block-in, the
   courier and security team will deplane. The aircrew will keep the aircraft engines running, all
   aircraft doors closed and delay preparation for nuclear cargo transfer until the courier verifies
   appropriate security is in place.
   21.16.2. Maintain the two-person concept.
   21.16.3. Brief the receiver on the cargo, and transfer custody.

may safely begin descent from IFR enroute altitude to IFR drop altitude. The DZ entry point is a
maximum of 40 NM prior to the DZ exit point according to Federal Aviation Administration
FAR exemption 4371C. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft in formation is at
or past the DZ entry point.
DZ Exit Point—A fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline, established during pre-
mission planning, at which the formation will be at the minimum IFR enroute altitude. Calculate

Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated
and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control normally provides full
authority to organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in
operational control considers necessary to accomplish the assigned missions. Operational
control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistical matters of
administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Operational Missions—Missions executed at or above 618 AOC (TACC) or theater C2 agency
level. Operational missions termed "CLOSE WATCH" include CORONET missions and priority
1, 2, and 3 missions tasked by the 618 TACC or theater C2 agency. Other operational missions
such as deployment, re-deployment, reconnaissance operations, operational readiness inspections
(ORI), AMC-directed channel or SAAM, and JA/ATT missions may be designated "CLOSE
WATCH" as necessary.
Operational Risk Management (ORM)—A logic-based, common sense approach to making
calculated decisions on human, materiel, and environmental factors before, during, and after Air

operational capabilities while minimizing risks by applying a simple, systematic process
appropriate for all personnel and Air Force functions.
Opportune Airlift—Transportation of personnel, cargo, or both aboard aircraft with no
expenditure of additional flying hours to support the airlift.
Originating Station—Base from which an aircraft starts on an assigned mission. May or may
not be the home station of the aircraft. When aircraft is under change of operational control,
deployed location is the originating station.
Over-water Flight—Any flight that exceeds power off gliding distance from land.
Patient Movement Categories—
Urgent—Patients who must be moved immediately to save life, limb, or eyesight, or to prevent
complication of a serious illness.
Priority—Patients requiring prompt medical care that must be moved within 24 hours.
Routine—Patients who should be picked up within 72 hours and moved on routine/scheduled
flights.
Permit to Proceed—Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e. number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. Aircraft commanders are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to
the customs inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can
be imposed on the aircraft commander for not complying with permit to proceed procedures.)

permit return to its own or some other associated base on its own fuel supply.
Point of Safe Return—Most distant point along the planned route from which an aircraft may
safely return to its point of departure or alternate airport with required fuel reserve.
Positioning and De-Positioning Missions—Positioning missions are performed to relocate
aircraft for the purpose of conducting a mission. De-positioning missions are made to return
aircraft from bases at which missions have terminated.
Ramp Coordinator—Designated representative of the C2 whose primary duty is the
coordination of ground handling activities on the ramp during large scale operations.
Required Ramp Fuel Load (RRFL)—The minimum fuel required at engine start to complete
the tasked mission.
Rush Baggage—Baggage or articles, which have been misrouted or separated from the owner,
are to be forwarded as RUSH baggage.
Scheduled Return Date (SRD)—Scheduling tool used by air mobility units to predict when
crews will return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability and
provide crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews (except
those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders.
Scheduled Takeoff Time—Takeoff time is established in the schedule or OPORD. For air
aborts and diversions, this will be engine shut down time (or arrival in the blocks if engine
shutdown is not scheduled) plus authorized ground time. Early deviation does not apply to aborts
or diversions unless the mission is formally rescheduled by current operations.
Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)—Area weather advisory issued by an
ICAO meteorological office relayed to and broadcast by the applicable ATC agency. SIGMET
advisories are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail,
severe and extreme turbulence, severe icing, and widespread dust or sand storms. SIGMETs
frequently cover a large geographical area and vertical thickness. They are prepared for general
aviation and may not consider aircraft type or capability.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—Funded airlift that cannot be supported by
channel missions because of the unusual nature, sensitivity, or urgency of the cargo, or that
requires operations to points other than the established channel structure.
Special Tactics Team (STT)—A task-organized element of special tactics that may include
combat control, pararescue, and special operations weather team (SOWT) personnel. Functions
include austere airfield and assault zone reconnaissance, surveillance, establishment, and

terminal control; terminal attack control; combat search and rescue; combat casualty care and
evacuation staging; and tactical weather observations and forecasting.
Stabilization Point—Point on the DZ run-in course at which the lead aircraft should plan to be
stabilized at drop altitude and airspeed. Unless otherwise briefed, this point will be planned to be
6 NMs prior to the point of impact.
Stations Time (Air Force)—The time at which the crew, passengers, and cargo are to be on
board and ready for the flight. Normally, 30 minutes prior to takeoff time. Aircrews will have
completed their pre-flight duties and be at their crew positions. Passengers will be seated and
cargo will be secured.
Tactical Event—Airdrop, low level, formation, assault landings/takeoffs,                    tactical
approaches/departures, landings to an AMP 3 configured airfield at night.
Tanker Airlift Control Center (18 AF TACC)—The 18th Air Force direct reporting unit
responsible for tasking and controlling operational missions for all activities involving forces
supporting US Transportation Command's global air mobility mission. The 18 AF TACC
contains the following functions: Command and Control, Current Operations, Mission Support,
Logistics Operations Center, Aerial Port Control Center, Flight Planning, Diplomatic Clearance,
Weather, and Mission Support Planning Office.
Tankered Fuel—Additional fuel carried through a primary destination for use on a subsequent
leg.
Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)—MAJCOM TERPS office ensures each published
instrument procedure is operationally acceptable for the command or unit mission to include
evaluation and endorsement of each nonstandard procedure.
Terminal Fuel Flow (TFF)—The fuel flow rate expected during the last hour at cruise altitude
TFF is the fuel flow found on the last leg of a CFPS flight plan.
Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC)—The TPMRC is responsible for
theater wide patient movement (e.g., medical regulating and AE scheduling), and coordinates
with theater MTFs to allocate the proper treatment assets required to support its role. The
primary role of the TPMRC is to devise theater plans and schedules and then monitor their
execution in concert with the GPMRC. The TPMRC is responsible to the Combatant
Commander through the Combatant Command Surgeon. The TPMRC is also responsible for all
aspect of intratheater patient movement management. A TPMRC provides command and control
for patient movement management operations in its theater of operations, as directed by its
Combatant Commander‘s operational policy, and in coordination with USTRANSCOM, acting
as a supporting combatant command, responsible for intertheater and CONUS.
Time Out— Common assertive statement used to voice crewmember concern when safety may
be jeopardized. Used to cease maneuvering without affecting the overall mission/exercise. See
AFFTP 3-3.C-130E/H.
Training Mission—Mission executed at the unit level for the sole purpose of aircrew training
for upgrade or proficiency. Does not include operational missions as defined in this AFI.
Transition Event/Training—An approach, traffic pattern, or landing flown for the sole purpose
of aircrew training or upgrade.

Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)—Formerly known as Defense Business
Operations Fund-Transportation (DBOF-T). TWCF is part of the Air Force Working Capital
Fund (AFWCF). Normally, TWCF funds are used for costs that can be recovered from an air
mobility customer. Examples include: TDY costs, site surveys of CRG or airlift unit deployment
beddown locations, airlift unit level mission planning expenses, and support or contract costs for
deployed TWCF units/personnel.
Unilateral—Operations confined to a single service.
Unit Move—A mission airlifting military passengers or troops who originate from the same unit
and on-load point, are under the control of a designated troop commander and off-load at the
same destination.
Wing Relieving Fuel (WRF)—Additional Fuel kept in the main tanks intended to counter wing
bending moments.
Zero Fuel Weight—Weight, expressed in pounds, of a loaded aircraft not including wing and
body tank fuel. All weight in excess of the maximum zero fuel weight will consist of usable fuel.
