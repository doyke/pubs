SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2000-1. It makes changes to paragraph 4.9.3. A bar (|)
indicates revision from previous edition. See the last attachment of the publication for the complete IC.
(ACC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
requires vehicle operators to use headlights in conjunction with windshield wipers; restricts the use of cell
phones while operating a motor vehicle while on Air Combat Command (ACC) installations; requires all
personnel (to include civilians and retirees) to wear approved protective helmets when bicycling, roller
blading, in-line-skating, skateboarding, or using Gopeds on ACC installations; it establishes a minimum
age requirement for personnel operating off-road vehicles (ORVs); prohibits the use of coaster-wheeled
conveyance (defined as any form of object propelled afoot to include, but not limited to, in-line skates,
roller skates, roller blades, scooters, or skateboards), all-terrain vehicles to include go-carts and gopeds
(electric motors) from being operated on any roadway, parking lot or sidewalk except in established areas
designated by the installation commander; adds Chief of Security Forces (CSF) may allow security forces
members who the CSF believes have the necessary technical expertise and documented On-the-job train-
ing to perform accident investigations.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                                                  3


(HOLLOMAN) This document is substantially revised to comply with AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor
Vehicle Traffic Supervision and AFI 31-204_ACCSUP1, Air Force Motor Vehicle Supervision, and shall
be completely reviewed in its entirety. The revision updates paragraph numbering, office symbols, and
publication references. The use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle, (privately owned or gov-
ernment), is prohibited unless the vehicle is properly parked or the driver utilizes a hands-free unit. The
wearing of portable headphones/earphones utilized for compact disc players, IPODs, or MP3 Players,
while operating a motor vehicle or while bicycling, skateboarding, roller blading or while on a scooter on
the roadway of HAFB is prohibited. EXCEPTIONS: (1) The use of headphones/earphones utilized for
compact disc players, IPODs, or MP3 Players while jogging is only authorized on approved running sur-
faces. (2) Motorcycle helmet intercom systems between operator and passenger are permitted. Use of
those devices masks or prevents recognition of emergency signals, alarms, announcements, the approach
of vehicles, human speech and the ability to determine the direction from which the sound is coming. This
does not negate wearing of hearing protection when conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as
when driving in noise hazard areas. The installation has established the area across from 4th Space Con-
trol Squadron as the only authorized area on HAFB for operating all terrain vehicles (ATV)/dirt bike for
recreational purposes. Any other type of off-road vehicles (i.e., Jeep, dune buggies, etc.) are not allowed
on the established ATV/dirt bike track. IAW AFI 91-207, all ATV/dirt bike operators shall complete a cer-
tified ATV/dirt bike Safety Course and maintain the completion card on their person when operating these
vehicles. There is no requirement to register the vehicle on base. The DD Form 1805 has been replaced
with United States District Court Violation Notice. For brevity purposes all reference to the DD Form
1805 remain, however, the references will apply to the United States District Court Violation Notice.

                                               Chapter 2

                                      DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
   2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a privilege
   granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must comply with the laws
   and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Consequently,
   everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation must produce, upon request from the
   security police, the following:
      2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
      2.1.1.1. (HOLLOMAN) Proof of vehicle registration is not required for temporary vehicle
      passes issued for 24 hours or less for Texas residents. However, Texas residents shall have current
      license plates and registration sticker. Temporary vehicle passes issued for periods longer than 24
      hours and permanent vehicle registration shall require proof of vehicle registration.
      2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license and/or AF
      Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card, supported by a DD
      Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine acceptable identification
      media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each installation commander must deter-
      mine if international drivers licenses are recognized and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdic-
      tion, and if so, will their use be authorized on the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS
      civilian jurisdictions will honor use of international drivers licenses for short periods of time by
      non-resident visitors and assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders
      should assimilate local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
      2.1.1.2. (HOLLOMAN) International driver's licenses are accepted by the local jurisdiction for
      90 days for assigned resident personnel. A nonresident visitor's international driver's license is
      valid for 30 days if employed in the state of New Mexico or for 90 days if unemployed. Nonresi-
      dent visitors include dependents of resident personnel.
      2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of motor
      vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety inspection, or
      other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement. Note: In some
      instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is registered may require, as a
      condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state or jurisdiction, a safety or other
      inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another state or jurisdiction. Though not enforce-
      able (in another state), failure to comply may invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/
      operator in a precarious legal position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to
      comply with their "home state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state
      requirements. Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/
      or registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
      2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the installation
      commander.
10                             AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


        2.1.1.5. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Operators of government vehicles on the flightline shall possess
        a valid state driver's license or an international driver's license and an AF Form 483, Certificate of
        Competency, indicating "Holloman Airfield" authorization by airfield management.
        2.1.1.6. (Added-HOLLOMAN) It is unlawful to drive a motorcycle, regardless of status, on
        HAFB without carrying proof of completion of Motorcycle Safety Foundation Training (MSFT).
            2.1.1.6.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) All military personnel shall complete the MSFT before
            they operate a motorcycle, at any time, on or off duty, on or off HAFB.

2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
     2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the installation com-
     mander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
        2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off base as
        determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
        2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command instructions,
        and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop, inspection, search, and
        impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates and in Air Force restricted
        areas.
        2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
        POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to enforce a traffic
        regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
     2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their installation com-
     manders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and impoundment of vehicles.
     This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass appropriate legal review. Note: A theater
     commander or those commanding unified forces may direct policy covering all installations under
     their command. In this case, MAJCOMs must review those policies before issuing their guidance.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for
alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired
driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force instal-
lation.

2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation driving privi-
leges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their
POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with traffic operations; 3) Creates a
safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, con-
trolled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned. Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their
motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
     2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction, the defi-
     nitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to enforcement action
     under paragraph 2.4. Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and definitions into the local instal-
     lation traffic code and make them known to the general public.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                          11


   2.4.1. (HOLLOMAN) The installation commander has defined "Abandoned," relevant to enforce-
   ment action, as 30 days or more.
   2.4.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) The installation commander has defined “Illegally parked for unrea-
   sonable period” relevant to enforcement action, following the issuance of a citation for parking ille-
   gally the individual will have no more than 30 days to rectify the situation before it will be considered
   “abandoned” and impounded.
   2.4.3. (Added-HOLLOMAN) The installation commander has defined “Interferes with traffic oper-
   ations” and “creates a safety hazard” relevant to enforcement action, any vehicle found to be interfer-
   ing with normal traffic flow, emergency response, or causing obvious safety concerns.
   2.4.4. (Added-HOLLOMAN) The installation commander has defined “Disabled by accident or
   incident” relevant to enforcement action, a vehicle involved in a reported accident/incident which
   requires it to be moved via tow truck or similar vehicle.
   2.4.5. (Added-HOLLOMAN) The installation commander has defined “Left unattended in, or adja-
   cent to a restricted, controlled or off limits area” relevant to enforcement action, any vehicle found in
   a restricted, controlled, or off limits area will be considered unattended if the driver is not within view
   of the vehicle and of the present security forces or other law enforcement personnel.

2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges . Installation commanders may suspend or
revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and unrelated
to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must incorporate procedures gov-
erning suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement to this instruction. Make these
known to the general public.
2.5. (ACC) Suspension of Revocation of Driving Privileges. Units will develop local base driver sus-
pension and revocation procedures in coordination with the local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).
2.5. (HOLLOMAN) On-duty security forces are the designated representatives of the installation com-
mander for the purpose of issuing notices of suspension of base driving privileges to persons appre-
hended, detained or cited for driving while their state driver's license or installation driving privileges are
suspended or revoked.
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
       2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
       lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also suspend or
       revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation parking standards,
       or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in nature. Installation commanders
       determine suspension and revocation policy for non-moving violations, as well as what constitutes
       a non-moving violation on their installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to regis-
       ter; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make
       these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
       known to the general public.
       2.5.1.1. (HOLLOMAN) The installation commander may suspend or revoke licenses for up to
       12 months if a driver continually violates installation-parking standards, or habitually violates
       other standards considered non-moving in nature. Examples of non-moving violations are: per-
12                            AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


        forming unauthorized repair, failure to register, unauthorized modifications or alterations, failure
        to maintain safety standards, etc. (See Attachment 3 (Added)).
        2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw anyone's
        authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the installation.
        2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV driving
        privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves active duty mili-
        tary personnel, their family members, retired members of the military service, and DoD civilian
        personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident.
        Installation commanders can only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents
        occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a
        review of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6., suspend driver’s privileges pending
        resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
        2.5.1.3. (HOLLOMAN) Persons who have been apprehended or detained and cited for intoxi-
        cated driving offenses shall be issued a preliminary notice of suspension of base driving privileges
        memorandum by on-duty security forces. Reliable evidence shall be coordinated and reviewed by
        49 FW/JA and 49 FW/CC or designated representatives as soon as practical after the offense has
        occurred.
            2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine blood
            alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.
            2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher.
            2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood alcohol
            by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a suspension for a BAC
            or BrAC level below 0.10.
               2.5.1.3.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) HAFB applies the New Mexico (NM) standard for
               intoxicated driving of .08 BAC/BrAC, or greater. Such drivers shall have their driver's
               license suspended.
               2.5.1.3.3.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) HAFB applies the NM standard for intoxicated driv-
               ing when the driver is under 21 years old. While not driving under the influence, as defined
               by NMSA 66-8-102, persons under the age of twenty-one shall have their driver's licenses
               administratively revoked if their BAC is .02 or over.
            2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an intoxicated
            driving incident occurred.
     2.5.2. Revocation.
        2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
        not less than one year in the following circumstances:
            2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit to or
            complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law of the jurisdic-
            tion, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                      13


          2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action
          resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for intoxicated driving. Official
          documentation is required as the basis for this type of revocation action.
          2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the installation com-
          mander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve public
          safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
      2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and driving
      records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
      records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
      2.5.2.2. (ACC) The Chief of Security Forces (CSF) will incorporate these plans and procedures
      in the local supplement to this publication.
      2.5.2.2. (HOLLOMAN) Upon notification, individual’s permanent change of station (PCS)ing
      from HAFB will report to 49 SFS/S5AR. 49 SFS/S5AR will review the individual’s driving
      records and forward those records along with any current revocation/suspension to the gaining
      commander via certified mail.
          2.5.2.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Upon receipt of an individual’s driving records from the
          losing commander, 49 SFS/S5AR will review the records thoroughly. If the inbound individ-
          ual has a current revocation/suspension, 49 SFS/S5AR will notify the gaining unit and route a
          revocation/suspension package through 49 FW/JA to the 49 MSG/CC for processing.
      2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the revocation period
      from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
      were restored pending resolution of charges.
      2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or con-
      currently.

2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
   2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation com-
   manders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassign-
   ment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. Installation
   commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or
   revocated privileges may petition an installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.

2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that person in
   writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate this notice with the
   base legal office.
   2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., do not suspend or revoke a person's
   driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative
   hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or revocation takes effect once mak-
   ing or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual circumstances should you make verbal notifica-
   tions. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or
   revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. Installation commanders determine the time

     period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hear-
     ing. For offenses outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., an installation commander will authorize an
     immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
     statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete chemical
     testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
     2.7.2. (HOLLOMAN) The panel for the hearing shall consist of the 49 MSG/CC or 49 MSG/CD. He
     or she conducts the hearing and reviews evidence from personnel relevant to the case (i.e., the individ-
     ual's statement) and other relevant statements on the individual's behalf.
        2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as soon as pos-
        sible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
        2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary suspension for
        intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-installation, non-DoD
        affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving
        either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the person is employed on the installation, send
        the notice to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
        2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification for
        intoxicated driving:
            2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph 2.5.2. of this
            AFI.
            2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or reso-
            lution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or designee).
            2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be repre-
            sented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel. Commanders
            determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel requests.
            2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative present at the
            administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.
            2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the administrative hearing
            before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes permanent.
            2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
            the address shown in the letter.
            2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is determined
            by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in
            effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. However, if no decision is
            made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or revocation, restore full driving privi-
            leges until the accused is notified of the final hearing results.
            2.7.2.3.7. (ACC) Written procedures (governing suspensions and revocations) established by
            installation commanders define what is a reasonable time between the request for a hearing
            and the hearing.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                          15


           2.7.2.3.7. (HOLLOMAN) Anyone requesting a hearing shall submit a written request to 49
           SFS/S5AR within 10 working days of the suspension/revocation notice. When the request is
           received, the hearing shall be held within 10 working days of the request.
   2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) The law
   enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in physical con-
   trol of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) The person was lawfully
   cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) The person was asked to submit to a test for
   alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and was informed of the consequences for
   refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath,
   or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of
   allowed blood alcohol content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
   apprehension or in violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing
   methods used were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
       2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation is
       mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
           2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the effective date
           of the revocation.
           2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension letter, or
           send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
           showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
           2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
           Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
           driving privileges.
   2.7.4. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Upon issuance of the final suspension/revocation of base driving
   privileges, 49 SFS/S5AR will notify 49 SFS/S5AV via email and instruct the individual to report to
   the Pass and Registration Office within three duty days to turn in his/her base access stickers. If the
   individual fails to turn-in the base access stickers as required, his/her first sergeant will be notified by
   49 SFS/S5AV and request assistance to get the tickers turned in as soon as possible.

2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle incident to
   Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.
   2.8.1. (HOLLOMAN) Unit First Sergeants and/or commanders will refer their military personnel
   involved in any intoxicated (alcohol/drug) motor vehicle incident to the 49 FW Substance Abuse
   Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation within seven duty days following the incident to
   determine whether a member is dependent on alcohol or other drugs. The results of this screening
   shall be made available to the command having jurisdiction over the case.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding determines
lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxi-
cated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
   2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
16                             AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


     2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in violation of
     the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.
     2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another prelimi-
     nary suspension or revocation.
     2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend or revoke
     driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
     2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s training pro-
     gram.

2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
     2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication, installation
     commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
     military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service authority. Ensure the individ-
     ual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) are still valid.
     2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement to
     any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a state, federal, or host
     nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and for on base privileges only), coordi-
     nate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This option applies only to installations exercis-
     ing exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges
     in the base supplement to this AFI or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in
     which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the
     granting of limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is
     the more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential liability
     inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or other license is
     allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropri-
     ate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of performing their
     military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.
     2.10.2. (ACC) If the installation commander or designee authorizes restricted driving privileges, the
     individual will be issued AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass, over stamped with the word
     “RESTRICTED.” The individual must present a copy of the letter of authorization upon request.
     2.10.2. (HOLLOMAN) A person who has had his/her state driver's license suspended or revoked
     may not be granted privileges to drive on the installation unless restricted privileges are coordinated
     through the 49 FW/JA to the 49 MSG/CC for approval/disapproval.
     2.10.3. (Added-HOLLOMAN) The 49 MSG/CC or MSG/CD shall have the power to grant or deny
     a request for restricted driving privileges or probation. Such exceptions may be granted only based on
     mission requirements, unusual personal or family hardship or in the case of a preliminary suspension
     following lawful apprehension, delays exceeding 90 days in the formal disposition of the allegations
     insofar as such delays are not attributed to the individual. To request restricted driving privileges or
     probation, the suspended/revoked driver shall submit a written request, endorsed by his/her com-
     mander, sponsor's commander or organization chief through 49 SFS/S5AR and 49 FW/JA to 49 MSG/
     CD. If approved, the driver shall report to 49 SFS/S5AV to be issued an AF Form 75 stamped with the
     word "RESTRICTED." The driver shall have the memorandum in his/her possession while operating
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                     17


   a vehicle on HAFB and be able to present the authorization memorandum upon request of security
   forces personnel.

2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is discovered driv-
   ing in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or installation commander may
   also take administrative or disciplinary action.
   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the offender com-
   pletes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed
   necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.
   2.11.3. (Added-HOLLOMAN) If restricted driving privileges or probation are granted and the
   driver is subsequently involved in a chargeable accident or moving violation, restricted driving privi-
   leges shall be withdrawn and the original period of suspension shall be reinstated, in addition to any
   further suspension or revocation action taken for the offense that occurred.

2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal suspension and
   revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should honor the reciprocal agree-
   ments with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the
   receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred
   within its own jurisdiction.
   2.12.1. (HOLLOMAN) Statutory authority exists in NM.
       2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal military
       reciprocity:
          2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
          individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable military
          administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point assessment) for those off-base viola-
          tions reported by local, state, or host nation authorities.
          2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued
          when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one year or more only)
          following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to submit to a
          BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC
          level.
          2.12.1.1.2. (HOLLOMAN) For individuals who have their driving privileges revoked for 1
          yr or more, SFAR will forward a locally developed memorandum to the individual’s state
          licensing authority.
   2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the host nation
   concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation commanders.
   When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an agreement concerning reci-
   procity exists, the installation commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude
   such an international agreement in accordance with applicable directives.

2.13. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Reinstatement of Driving Privileges. Upon completion of the suspension
and/or revocation period, personnel shall report in person to 49 SFS/S5AR with all required documenta-
tion and request reinstatement of driving privileges.
     2.13.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Personnel shall report in person to 49 SFS/S5AR with the following
     documents as required:
        2.13.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) All personnel shall show proof of successful completion of the
        Drivers' Improvement Safety Course from 49 FW/SE or off-base equivalent.
        2.13.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Personnel who lost privileges for intoxicated driving offenses
        shall also provide proof of receiving substance abuse counseling from 49 MDOS/SGOMHA or
        off-base equivalent.
     2.13.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) 49 SFS/S5AR shall conduct a history check and verify the required
     suspension and/or revocation period has ended and ensure requirements in paragraphs2.13.1.1.
     (Added)) and 2.13.1.2. (Added)) are met.
     2.13.3. (Added-HOLLOMAN) If all of the conditions outlined above have been met, one week prior
     to the completion of the revocation, the individual shall submit a request for reinstatement through the
     49 SFS/S5AR to 49 MSG/CC for formal reinstatement. Driving before formally being reinstated is a
     violation of the revocation even after the revocation is completed.
     2.13.4. (Added-HOLLOMAN) If all conditions have not been met, i.e., an unfavorable history
     check or suspension/revocation period not complete, then 49 SFS/S5AR shall staff these requests for
     reinstatement to the 49 MSG/CC for approval/disapproval.

                                                Chapter 3

                                MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION

3.1. Registration Policy.
   3.1.1. Register motor vehicles according to guidance in this instruction and policies established by
   the installation commander. Installation commanders may extend registration to anyone they deem
   appropriate. This may include reserve force personnel who maintain close affiliation with the instal-
   lation and other persons who frequently visit the base, such as local dignitaries, community leaders,
   retired civilian employees, civil air patrol members, etc.
       3.1.1.1. Consistent with base entry policy in AFI 31-209, the installation commander is responsi-
       ble for ensuring vehicles entering their installation are controlled. Vehicles entering Air Force
       installations must be registered or meet other entry requirements outlined in paragraph 3.2. Eligi-
       ble vehicle registrants include assigned active duty military and civilian personnel working on
       base, retired military personnel, reserve and national guard personnel assigned to a unit or
       attached for training on an active installation or a reserve or national guard base or facility, and
       survivors of deceased active duty and retired military members who are authorized to use base
       facilities. The installation commander may authorize the registration of vehicles that are in the
       custody of or owned by dependents, step-parents, or guardians of minor children authorized to use
       base facilities. A dependent living away from home may require a letter stating acceptance of
       responsibility from the military sponsor to support an application for vehicle registration. Further-
       more, a person need not own the vehicle to register it; however, they must have a lease agreement,
       power of attorney, or notarized statement from the owner of the vehicle granting them permission
       to use the vehicle and specifying the inclusive use dates.
       3.1.1.1. (HOLLOMAN) Vehicle registration is required for the following personnel who fre-
       quent the installation or frequently use base facilities:
          3.1.1.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Active duty personnel and their dependents.
          3.1.1.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Retired military personnel and their dependents.
          3.1.1.1.3. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Permanent Civil Service employees issued an AF Form
          354, Civilian Identification Card, or DA Form 1604, Department of the Army Civilian Identi-
          fication.
          3.1.1.1.4. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Retired Civil Service employees with an AF Form 354 or
          DA Form 1604, who live in the local area.
          3.1.1.1.5. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Active Reserve or National Guard and their dependents
          assigned or attached to HAFB, i.e., 49th Security Forces Squadron and 49th Medical Group
          Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA).
          3.1.1.1.6. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Survivors of deceased active duty and retired military
          members living in the local area.
          3.1.1.1.7. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Active duty German Air Force (GAF) personnel, their
          dependents and GAF civilians who have been assigned to HAFB.
20                             AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


            3.1.1.1.8. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Licensed motorcycle operators may be granted a 72-hour
            temporary registration, prior to completing the MSFT. The temporary registration is strictly
            for the purpose of allowing members, dependents and civilian employees to get their motorcy-
            cles to the training location the day of training. Military members shall obtain and present doc-
            umented prior approval from their unit commander before being granted the temporary permit.
            This pass is only valid for travel directly to and from the training; no side trips or stops are
            authorized.
        3.1.1.2. Treat rental vehicles as government vehicles when being used for official business by
        military or DoD personnel. Check the driver's installation entry credentials and if all is in order,
        the vehicle may proceed in the same manner as a marked government vehicle.
     3.1.2. Vehicles intended for construction and material handling or used solely off the road are not
     usually registered as motor vehicles. Installation commanders determine the need and method for reg-
     istering off road vehicles (ORV) on the installation. However, ORV owners must register and license
     the vehicle prior to its operation on installation roadways.
     3.1.2. (HOLLOMAN) The installation has established the area across from 4th Space Control
     Squadron as the only authorized area on HAFB for operating all terrain vehicles (ATV)/dirt bike for
     recreational purposes. Any other type of off-road vehicles (i.e., Jeep, dune buggies, etc.) are not
     allowed on the established ATV/dirt bike track.
        3.1.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) In accordance with AFI 91-207, all ATV/dirt bike operators
        shall complete a certified ATV/dirt bike Safety Course and maintain the completion card on their
        person when operating these vehicles. There is no requirement to register the vehicle on base.
     3.1.3. When unit vehicle registration (via orderly rooms) is authorized by the installation commander,
     each unit commander can grant limited temporary registration for up to 45 days pending permanent
     registration, or in other circumstances for longer terms.
     3.1.3. (HOLLOMAN) Unit orderly rooms shall not issue decals for members who are waiting for
     permanent registration.
     3.1.4. Air Force installations and activities honor the DD Form 2220, DOD Registered Vehicle
     Decal, issued by other military or DoD organizations.
     3.1.5. Use of AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The AF Form 75 is one method to control and iden-
     tify personnel and vehicles on a temporary basis. You can give it to installation visitors who do not
     have the authorized personal or vehicle credentials needed for unescorted or unchecked entry to the
     base. Installation commanders determine the use of AF Forms 75 on their installation and, if used, to
     what degree and to whom issued. If used, develop local policy and procedures governing the issue
     and control of visitor passes. Issue other access credentials when a pass is needed for longer than one
     year.
     3.1.5. (ACC) Use of AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. Incorporate policy and procedures governing
     the issue and control of visitor passes in the local supplement to this publication.
     3.1.5. (HOLLOMAN) The AF Form 75 or automated visitor pass shall be issued to visitors, contrac-
     tors and other on-base employees who do not possess valid military identification.
        3.1.5.1. How to process the AF Form 75:
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                     21


         3.1.5.1.1. Ask the visitor to fill out the form and sign the consent to search and towing/
         impoundment warning.
         3.1.5.1.2. Use either the driver's license, state vehicle registration, or passport (overseas) or
         other recognized credential according to para 2.1.1.
         3.1.5.1.3. Display the form so one can view it from outside the vehicle.
         3.1.5.1.4. Installation commanders determine if and how to retrieve passes once the visit is
         finished.
         3.1.5.1.4. (ACC) If AF Form 75 is retrieved upon completion of visits, identify the proce-
         dures in the local supplement to this publication.
     3.1.5.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) The sponsoring organization of contractors shall refer to
     HAFBI 31-101 for access requirements.

3.2. Registration and Driver Requirements. Registration systems for POVs on Air Force installations
will include the requirements specified below. Overseas commands and overseas installations should
modify these procedures to conform with local and international agreements. All motorcycle operators
must comply with the requirements of AFI 91-207 prior to registering a motorcycle. Individuals must
have the following credentials immediately available upon demand as required by state law or policies
established by the installation commander. 1) A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or interna-
tional driver’s license (as applicable) supported by DD Form 2, or other appropriate identification for
DoD civilians; 2) A certificate of state registration as required by the state or authority in which the vehi-
cle is registered; 3) Proof of meeting the minimum requirements for automobile insurance laws or regu-
lations of the state or host nation. Within the United States, the installation commander may set
reasonable liability insurance requirements for registration and operation of POVs within the confines of
the installation; and 4) Evidence of satisfactory completion of emission, safety, mechanical, or other test
or evaluation required by local, state, or other jurisdiction in which the vehicle is licensed or located.
Installation commanders may require periodic safety inspections for all vehicles operated routinely on
their installation if a like inspection is not required by a nonmilitary jurisdiction. In such cases, the instal-
lation commander must ensure reasonable and accessible inspection facilities are available and that
inspections follow National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards. Note: The
owner or authorized operator is responsible for reasonable fees and expenses associated with vehicle
inspections. Failure to comply with safety inspection standards will result in termination or denial of use
of installation roadways.
3.2. (ACC) Registration and Driver Requirements. A l l m i l i t a r y p e r s o n n e l m u s t a c c o m p l i s h
DoD-specified motorcycle training before they operate motorcycles on or off base, on or off duty. All
DoD civilian personnel must accomplish DoD-specified motorcycle training before they operate motor-
cycles on base. There is only one exception to this policy: Licensed operators may be granted a 72-hour
temporary registration (prior to completing the DoD-specified training) as long as they are scheduled to
attend the training class within that 72-hour period. The temporary registration is strictly for the purpose
of allowing members to get their motorcycles to the training location on the day of training. Use AF Form
75 to temporarily register motorcycles on base until the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) course is
successfully completed. Issue permanent motorcycle registration only when all state licensing laws have
been met, registrant has a completed AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency, and insurance require-
ments are met.
3.2. (HOLLOMAN) All personnel assigned to HAFB shall register their vehicles within three duty days
of arrival. Personnel buying a new vehicle shall immediately register the vehicle upon receipt of perma-
nent state registration. Personnel who have a DD Form 2220 from another base are required to provide the
decal number to Pass and Registration Office for issue of installation tab and registration sticker.
     3.2.1. Vehicle registration record keeping. Registering officials must check the eligibility to register
     and ownership (or legitimate custody) of a vehicle. Unit distribution points (i.e., unit orderly rooms)
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                        23


   may perform registration functions under the supervision of the installation pass and registration sec-
   tion. In this case, these distribution points receive registration decals in bulk from the pass and regis-
   tration section. After issuing decals, provide the pass and registration section the completed AF Form
   533 or the necessary information for entering registration data into the automated system. Use one of
   the following methods to keep records:
       3.2.1.1. Manually kept records. Each registrant fills out an AF Form 533 upon initial Air Force
       vehicle registration and upon arrival at a new installation after permanent change of station. The
       registrant’s signature on the AF Form 533 certifies compliance with registration requirements. To
       minimize inconvenience to the registrant, you can preprint the name of the installation and mini-
       mum insurance limits in the appropriate blocks on the front. Determine filing methods locally.
       3.2.1.2. Automated records. Use the security police automated system (SPAS) computerized
       vehicle registration program. The registrant must read and understand the registration require-
       ments before issuing a decal.
   3.2.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Personnel wishing to register a privately owned vehicle (POV) on
   HAFB shall certify they have complied with the State of New Mexico financial responsibility law.
   Personnel whose vehicle is registered in a state other than NM shall comply with that state's insurance
   requirements. For states that do not require mandatory vehicle insurance, the person shall meet the
   NM minimum insurance requirements in order to register a vehicle on HAFB.
   3.2.3. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Personnel shall also show proof of vehicle ownership (current state
   vehicle registration in the present owner's name) and keep it in the vehicle at all times or as required
   by the issuing authority.
       3.2.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Personnel who operate a POV with expired vehicle registration
       shall be issued a citation and released.
       3.2.3.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Personnel who operate a POV without insurance shall be issued
       a citation and shall be instructed to show proof of insurance prior to operating the vehicle. The
       vehicle will be parked in a location determined by the patrolman citing the individual to ensure it
       does not impede the traffic flow or create a safety concern.
   3.2.4. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Motorcycles, motor scooters and mopeds, as defined in Attachment
   3 (Added), shall be insured with, at a minimum, liability coverage equal to that required of automo-
   biles.

3.3. Appointing Registration Officials . The chief of security police (CSP) develops local procedures
governing base registration officials. Generally, security police personnel working in the pass and regis-
tration section are assigned duties as registration officials. When authorized by the installation com-
mander, unit orderly room personnel may also act as registration officials for their unit personnel when
unit-level vehicle registration has been authorized. Local registration official procedures must cover the
following:

                                                  Chapter 4

                                  TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
     4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision. A strong
     traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
     motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations together
     with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also important. Finally,
     every successful program must include meaningful interaction, education, and communication with
     the general public.
     4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most
     efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circula-
     tion control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies develop
     the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway engineering representatives from adjacent civilian
     communities to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans developed by the state and sur-
     rounding local communities. As a minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
     4.1.2. (HOLLOMAN) 49 CES/CECP is responsible to ensure the HAFB traffic circulation/transpor-
     tation plan is properly coordinated, completed, and a current copy is provided to 49 SFS/S5AR.
        4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
        4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include measures
        for special events and adverse road conditions.
        4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic
        directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
        4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
        4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
        4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
        4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic engi-
        neer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This is normally
        a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should have an infrastruc-
        ture planning and engineering background.
     4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns,
     and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control
     studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor routes, locations for traffic
     control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.
     4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMC-
     TEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. MTM-
     CTEA traffic engineering team services include:
        4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
        4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                      31


       4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
   4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance with AFR
   75-88, Highways for National Defense.
   4.1.6. (Added-ACC) The chief of airfield management will provide program oversight for flightline
   vehicle operations IAW AFI 13-213, Air Field Management.

4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
   4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the
   installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority is
   empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic codes must
   contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the code of the state or
   host nation in which the installation is located. The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code
   and for ensuring it meets all local and legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the
   following:
       4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR 1230.
       4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published
       by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is contained in 23,
       CFR 1204.
       4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
   4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
   impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure they contain the fol-
   lowing:
       4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
       4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
       4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
       4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
   4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic provisions con-
   tained in the subparagraphs below:
       4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. Operators must comply with special requirements when driv-
       ing motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motor-
       cycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6. for information concerning off-road vehicle use.
       Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance concerning the legal definition,
       operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized bicycles, and other such devices on installation
       roadways. Such guidelines will be modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or
       the safe and orderly flow of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing
       safety requirements.
       4.2.3.1. (ACC) Motorcycles and Mopeds. Operators must have an AF Form 483 or MSF comple-
       tion certificate. An MSF completion certificate will be provided after the operator completes the
       following motorcycle training required by AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program;
       the motorcycle riding course, riding street skills course IV A or experienced rider course IV B.
32                             AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


        Unqualified persons are prohibited from operating motorcycles on base. All persons must have a
        valid AF Form 483 or MSF course completion card immediately available when operating a
        motorcycle on base except when operating officially classified dirt bikes off the street or roadway.
        Personnel operating an ATV on an installation must complete a certified ATV rider’s course. Per-
        sonnel must maintain the ATV Safety Institute Riders Course completion card on their person
        while operating an ATV. NOTE: Motorcycles will not be loaned to unqualified military or civil-
        ian personnel. The owner is responsible for ensuring operators possess an AF Form 483 or MSF
        course completion card.
        4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
        4.2.3.2. (ACC) Restraint Systems. Vehicle operators are responsible for ensuring all vehicle
        occupants wear/utilize required restraint devices.
            4.2.3.2.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations must
            wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must wear restraint
            systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
            4.2.3.2.1. (ACC) Safety personnel may stop vehicles to conduct seatbelt surveys with the
            approval of the installation commander.
            4.2.3.2.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty must
            wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.
            4.2.3.2.3. US Department of Transportation requires approved infant/child restraint devices in
            POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 50 pounds in weight.
            4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved restraint
            system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
            4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the manufacturer's
            primary restraint system (seat belts).
        4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
        while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
        conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
        restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
        4.2.3.3. (HOLLOMAN) See Table 5.3, Point Assessment for Moving Violation, Violation:
        Other moving violation (involving driver behavior only) for points assessed for violation.
     4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation driving
     privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
     4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state traffic codes
     applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that state’s criminal offense
     code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United States Code 13 (USC).
        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts the vehic-
        ular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not considered criminal
        offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these laws applicable to military
        installations having concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to
        installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regula-
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                        33


     tions for their installations. Those found guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on instal-
     lations under provisions of DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or
     imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you can-
     not assimilate traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in
     a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
         4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate violations of
         traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally, this applies to installa-
         tions under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
  4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee determines if,
  when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road
  vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety train-
  ing, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
  gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.
  However, ensure full compliance with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary,
  develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
  supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating
  any off-road vehicle use area.
  4.2.6. (ACC) Off-road vehicles usage: The term "off-road vehicle" refers to any self-propelled vehi-
  cle that is not required to meet state licensing requirements. If state or local law has not established a
  minimum age, personnel must be at least 16 years of age to operate off-road vehicles (ORVs). Indi-
  viduals under 16 years of age may operate ORVs only under adult supervision, unless prohibited by
  state or local laws. All-terrain vehicles to include go-carts and gopeds (electric motors) are restricted
  on any roadway, parking lot, or sidewalk, except in established areas designated by the installation
  commander.
  4.2.7. (Added-ACC) All personnel who bicycle, roller blade, in-line-skate, skateboard, roller blade,
  or use Gopeds on ACC installations will wear approved protective helmets. Helmets will meet Amer-
  ican National Standards Institute or Snell Memorial Foundation criteria. Use of knee pads, elbow
  pads, and wrist guards is also required.
  4.2.8. (Added-ACC) The use of coaster-wheeled conveyance (defined as any form of object pro-
  pelled afoot to include, but not limited to, in-line skates, roller skates, scooters, or skateboards) are
  restricted on any roadway, parking lot, or sidewalk, except in established areas designated by the
  installation commander. In addition to an approved helmet, the wear of elbow pads, kneepads, and
  wrist guards is required for participants utilizing dedicated skate parks, arenas, or related facilities on
  ACC installations.
  4.2.9. (Added-ACC) Vehicle operators will turn on headlights from sunset to sunrise; during fog,
  smoke, or rain when windshield wipers are activated; and at any other time when persons and vehicles
  cannot be seen clearly. Points are assessed as operating an unsafe vehicle as per Table 5.2. of the
  basic publication.
  4.2.10. (Added-ACC) Vehicle operators on ACC installations and operators of government owned
  vehicles shall not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a
  hands-free device. The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones or other listening
  devices (except for hand-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited.

     tion, Violation: Other moving violation (involving driver behavior only) for points assessed for viola-
     tion.
     4.2.11. (Added-ACC) The use of Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances (OGMVC),
     self-propelled assets providing a basic transportation capability (i.e. golf carts, all- terrain vehicles,
     quad-runners, etc) not meeting specifications of 49 CFR 571.500 FMVSS are prohibited on any road-
     way, parking lot, or sidewalk, except in established work areas designated by the installation com-
     mander. Personnel will wear appropriate Personnel Protective Equipment while operating OGMVCs.
     4.2.11. (HOLLOMAN) Installation commander designates only paved roadways as authorized areas
     for operation of OGMVC’s.

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
4.3. (ACC) Traffic Law Enforcement Principles. Selective enforcement will be determined locally.
The installation commander or CSF, if delegated, will establish procedures to evaluate traffic violations
and vehicle accidents. Results of analysis should be provided to the base traffic board, Safety and law
enforcement patrols.
4.3. (HOLLOMAN) 49 SFS/S5AR will provide monthly input through the 49 SFS/CC to the 49 FW Sta-
tus of Discipline review board which will include results of traffic violations. The 49 SFS/CC will deter-
mine when traffic accident data warrants inclusion.
     4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws
     and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should
     emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. You can reach these goals by
     developing effective programs in the following areas.
        4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
        4.3.1.1. (HOLLOMAN) Traffic rules applicable to the operation and control of motor vehicles
        on HAFB are outlined in the New Mexico Motor Vehicle Code and the Installation Traffic Code
        (Attachment 3 (Added). All vehicle operators shall comply with all traffic rules.
        4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National Highway
        Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
        Streets and Highways.
        4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
        act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in opera-
        tion.
        4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with suspended
        or revoked privileges.
        4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a citation, or
        warn the offender.
     4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
        4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of
        alcohol or drugs.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                      35


      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection tech-
      niques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11.).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs prevents
      their safe operation of a motor vehicle.

4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and enforce-
ment programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police training
   and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the same brand and
   model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible, attend the same or similar
   certification courses used by local authorities.
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
      4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet training and
      certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the installation is located.
      Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting
      the state agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Notwithstanding the above informa-
      tion, the CSP may establish other local training and certification programs for operators of
      speed-measuring devices. If exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and train-
      ing standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil author-
      ities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts used
      to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge advocate and attor-
      ney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
      4.4.2.1. (ACC) Unit training sections ensure operators of speed-measuring devices attend formal
      training and are locally certified by competent authorities.
      4.4.2.1. (HOLLOMAN) The 49 SFS is recognized by the State of New Mexico as a federal law
      enforcement agency. As such, the requirement for formal speed measuring device training for law
      enforcement patrols is conducted by 49 SFS/SFTT. Supporting documentation shall be maintained
      by 49 SFS/SFTT.
      4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's training
      program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar certification courses.
      4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the effective-
      ness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement radar. On
      successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
          4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths, and inju-
          ries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
          4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
          4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement policy
          and procedure.

            ment(s).
            4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and courtroom testi-
            mony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
     4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required by the
     state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification and training stan-
     dards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit commanders when personnel PCS.
     4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
        4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
        4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-measuring
        devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association
        of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.

4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
     4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
        4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
        4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the installation com-
        mander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and property damage; however,
        the installation commander may establish different damage amounts for each category.
        4.5.1.2. (HOLLOMAN) The installation commander shall determine the level of personal prop-
        erty and vehicle damage that warrants an investigation. Refer to paragraph 4.6.3.6.
     4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel according to
     local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident report
form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.
     4.5.3. (Added-ACC) Personnel performing detailed investigations should be graduates of a formal
     course of instruction such as L3AZR3P072 005, Traffic Management and Accident Investigation.
     The CSF may allow security forces members who have the necessary technical expertise and
     on-the-job training to perform accident investigations. NOTE: Formal training for these individuals
     is the goal.

4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
     4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident to the
     security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries to military per-
     sonnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines what agencies to notify
     and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop a local notification matrix or
     other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies. Develop and
     publish these notification procedures locally.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                    37

  4.6.1. (HOLLOMAN) Refer to Attachment 3 (Added), paragraph A3.2.1.3. (Added)
  4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information.
  Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible, obtain copies of major
  accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
  4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions or poli-
  cies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
     4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
     4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
     4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
     4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
     4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
     4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if minor vehi-
     cle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may delegate this authority to
     on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy in this area locally.
     4.6.3.6. (ACC) If this authority is delegated, publish this information in the local supplement to
     this publication.
     4.6.3.6. (HOLLOMAN) Security forces shall not investigate minor POV accident unless one of
     the three applies: injury occurred, damage exceeded $10,000, or a citation was issued. The SFCC
     controller shall direct drivers to report to building 35 to accomplish statements. Accidents of this
     type which involve GOVs or government-owned property shall require a security forces response
     and completion of appropriate documentation.
  4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police within 72
  hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information should include the
  accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or address when civilian
  not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license number(s). You should also include a
  brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is
  any accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount
  established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving
  a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount established by the installation commander.
  The installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
  property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative
  techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
  4.6.4. (HOLLOMAN) All accidents, even minor ones shall be reported to the security forces imme-
  diately. Refer to Attachment 3 (Added), paragraphs A3.2.6. (Added) and A3.2.7. (Added)
     4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor vehicle
     accident:
         4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
         4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is sought
38                             AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


            4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or
            any other visible damage to the body.

4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
     4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes. When
     frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors
     in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and
     trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
     exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies
     cleared to receive accident and incident data.
     4.7.1. (HOLLOMAN) The Traffic Trend Analysis (TTA) shall be published by 49 SFS/S5AR when
     requested by authorized agencies. The TTA shall be provided to 49 CES, 49 FW/SE, 49 MSG, 49 FW
     and 49 SFS/SFOSP. Selective Enforcement schedules shall be provided on a weekly basis to the law.
     enforcement patrols by 49 SFS/SFOSP.
     4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will
     indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where applicable, if air bags
     deployed.

4.8. Parking.
     4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation. Strong
     enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing traffic accidents
     and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and awareness initiatives in areas
     where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness fail, installation commanders may
     authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use
     towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revo-
     cations, etc., prove effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
        4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing or boot-
        ing to specific offenses.
        4.8.1.1. (HOLLOMAN) Refer toAttachment 3 (Added) for enforcement of towing or booting
        of vehicles.
        4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for immobilizing
        unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in high offense areas or to
        compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more effective for moving vehicles that pose
        safety hazards. Some examples include double parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
        4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing or boot-
        ing. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
        4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how to have the
        boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
        4.8.1.5. (Added-ACC) Do not use DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice,
        for parking violations.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                       39


   4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders determine
   reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility design and layout,
   traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine the number and location of
   reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing reserved parking a part of the instal-
   lation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction, or base parking plan. The
   publication must address approval, issue, control, and review of reserved parking and should give spe-
   cial consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated
   under the uniform federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
   4.8.2. (HOLLOMAN) Refer to Attachment 3 (Added), paragraph A3.6.3. (Added) for parking vio-
   lations.
   4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space assignments
   and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is placed on a vehicle
   bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification. MAJCOMs (or installation command-
   ers if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop policy concerning the issue and control of the
   identification media discussed above.
   4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially
   within off-street parking facilities.

4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations
   within Air Force channels.
   4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United States or
   its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following circumstances:
       4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
       4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter
       because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only proprietary legis-
       lative jurisdiction.
       4.9.2.2. (ACC) Installations should establish administrative procedures for dealing with depen-
       dents and civilians (such as DAF employees, contractors, etc.) when the United States Federal
       Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter. For example, the instal-
       lation commander can restrict or withdraw driving privileges as attention-getters, when necessary,
       before resorting to contacting the magistrate.
       4.9.2.2. (HOLLOMAN) The installation commander has the authority to restrict or withdraw a
       civilian’s and/or a dependent’s driving privileges for safety concerns or when determined needed
       to maintain good order and discipline before resorting to contacting the magistrate. Privileges will
       be suspended/revoked IAW para. 2.5. of AFI 31-204 and this supplement.
       4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
       4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the
       court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US district court.
   4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket,
   or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP determines who is autho-
40                             AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


     rized to issue those forms and what training they must complete before issuing either form. The DD
     Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Mil-
     itary Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive
     duty training including commuting to and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title
     10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the
     DD Form 1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
     4.9.3. (ACC) Units using DD Forms 1805 will ensure governing court procedures for issuance are
     incorporated into unit training programs.
     4.9.3. (HOLLOMAN) A DD Form 1408 shall be issued for a moving or non-moving violation by
     any active duty military personnel and for civilian government employees who are operating a GOV.
     Any civilian operating a POV in concurrent and exclusive jurisdiction areas of the installation shall be
     issued the DD Form 1805 for moving or non-moving violations. Military and civilian personnel shall
     be issued a DD Form 1805 for parking violations (parking in a handicapped parking slot or handi-
     capped zoned area). Civilian personnel operating a POV in proprietary jurisdiction areas shall be
     stopped and briefed for minor moving violations and detained for Otero County Sheriff response for
     more serious offenses. All security forces members shall be trained on the use and issue procedures
     for the DD Form 1805 and DD Form 1408.
     4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases through
     administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and
     federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military personnel and DoD civil-
     ian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol
     Control.
        4.9.4.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Upon receipt of a DD Form 1408, the commander/first sergeant
        of the individual involved shall indicate in the proper block what action was taken and return the
        citation to 49 SFS/S5AR, either by base distribution or hand delivery. Squadron CCs/CCFs retain
        responsibility for ensuring the citations are returned. If action taken by the commander/first ser-
        geant cannot be completed by the suspense date, the commander/ first sergeant shall contact 49
        SFS/S5AR by phone or memorandum and request an extension.
        4.9.4.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) A person who disagrees with the issuance of a DD Form 1408
        for moving violations shall submit a rebuttal memorandum with his/her commander's endorse-
        ment (49 SFS/S5AR shall provide template) and forward to 49 SFS/S5AR within ten duty days.
        The 49 SFS/S5AR shall process a ticket rebuttal package. The package shall be forwarded to 49
        SFS/CC for recommendation and sub-sequent forwarded to 49 MSG/CC or CD for final decision.
        Civilians and military dependents who disagree with the issuance of a DD Form 1805 shall wait
        until notified by the Central Violation Bureau of a court appearance date and appear before the
        Magistrate Court judge.
     4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2., use the DD Form 1805 to refer civilian
     violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the commander,
     first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian employees is cited with the
     DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD Form 1805 and make it available to
     the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
     4.9.5. (HOLLOMAN) Persons issued a DD Form 1805 shall be cited according to the DD Form
     1805 Code Listing memorandum maintained at 49 SFS/S5AR. Civilian employees, active duty depen-
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                     41


   dents, retired military personnel, their dependents and visitors to HAFB shall be issued DD Forms
   1805. Violations that cannot be assimilated under the Assimilative Crimes Act (Title 18, United States
   Code, Section 13) shall be forwarded to 49 FW/JA for action.
       4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through standard
       publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender. Before issuing this
       form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the US District Court (Central
       Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the communication, on the reverse of the
       violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. Determine the entry for the amount of
       the fine, mandatory court appearance of the offender, and the date of appearance according to
       guidance furnished by the governing district court.
       4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in the
       CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US magistrate.
       4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local staff judge
       advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is required by the fed-
       eral misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.
       4.9.5.3. (HOLLOMAN) The Statement of Probable Cause on the DD Form 1805 shall be used in
       compliance with PLFA Office of Counsel, U.S. Magistrate Court and /or Central Violations
       Bureau (CVB) policies and instructions.
       4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as follows:
          4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District Court
          (Central Violation Bureau).
          4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
          4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
       4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
       4.9.5.5. (HOLLOMAN) For unit responsibilities and rebuttal procedures, refer to paragraphs
       4.9.4.1. (Added) and 4.9.4.2. (Added) of this supplement.
          4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions and rebuttal
          instructions as determined by the installation commander.
          4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the commander of
          the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or employer for administrative
          action within the unit/organization.
          4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for processing
          and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit commander, section com-
          mander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received, review it for action taken, annotate
          the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313, Driver Record, with the moving or non-mov-
          ing violation and any points assessed. File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.
          4.9.5.5.3. (ACC) The CSF will advise the installation commander, through SJA, when action
          being taken by the reviewing authority appears to be inadequate or excessive.

4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
     4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the follow-
     ing:
        4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating motor vehi-
        cles.
        4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which adequately
        documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
        4.10.1.2. (ACC) Coordinate locally produced forms with the installation SJA and forms and
        records managers prior to using to ensure forms and records management requirements are met.
        4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety test con-
        sists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Also consider any
        local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the above standard Air Force
        tests.
        4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears intoxicated, but
        is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
        4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
        4.10.1.6. (Added-ACC) Document all driving while intoxicated offenses using AF Form 3545,
        Incident Report or equivalent SFMIS report, to ensure accurate reporting under the Defense Inci-
        dent-Based Reporting System.
     4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
        4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
        4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
     4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products list pub-
     lished in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as specified in para-
     graph 4.13. and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14. and 4.15. relating to voluntary
     and involuntary testing.
     4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will develop
     their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian institutions or
     manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the installation staff judge
     advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure your program meets local require-
     ments for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at the intervals determined by the CSP and
     staff judge advocate.
     4.10.4. (ACC) Provide the intervals of refresher training determined by the CSF and SJA in the local
     supplement to this publication.
     4.10.4. (HOLLOMAN) Personnel authorized to operate the breath-testing device shall be appointed
     in writing by the 49 SFS/CC. When the 49 SFS breath-testing device is inoperable, individuals appre-
     hended for driving under the influence are transported to Alamogordo Department of Public Safety for
     testing. Results are included in revocation/suspension packages.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                        43


      4.10.4.1. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Authorized personnel shall receive initial certification training
      from Scientific Lab Division prior to operating the breath-testing device.
      4.10.4.2. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Personnel shall adhere to local OI for annual and recertifica-
      tion requirements.

4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
   4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement mea-
   sures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is tested per para-
   graph 2.3., evaluate the results of the test as follows:
      4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the
      person is not under the influence of alcohol.
      4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired. Consider
      this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
      influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5. Note: The 0.10 threshold
      delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when assimilating a more stringent local,
      state, or host nation standard.
      4.11.1.2. (HOLLOMAN) If the percentage of alcohol in a person's blood is over 0.05 (BAC/
      BrAC) but less than 0.08 (BAC/BrAC), presume the person is impaired. Consider this standard
      with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alco-
      hol. Other competent evidence includes properly completed DD Forms 1920, Alcoholic Influence
      Report, as well as a determination made by the apprehending officer that the subject failed the
      field sobriety test due to impairment of the subject's motor skills, which was a direct result of the
      subject being under the influence of alcohol or other drug, observations by patrolman, subject's
      confessions/admissions, and video (if utilized). Drunk or impaired means any intoxication which
      is sufficient to impair the rational and full exercise of the mental or physical faculties. Suspend
      driving privileges according to paragraph 2.5.
      4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or host nation
      standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
      been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to para
      2.5.1.3.
      4.11.1.3. (HOLLOMAN) If the percentage of alcohol is 0.08 (BAC/BrAC) or more, or if tests
      reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have been driving under the influ-
      ence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to paragraph 2.5.1.3.
      4.11.1.4. (Added-HOLLOMAN) If the percentage of alcohol in a person under 21 years of age
      is 0.02 (BAC/BrAC) or greater, suspend driving privileges according to paragraph 2.5.1.3.
   4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1. are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood
   based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will modify military
   standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation standard. Refer to Assess-
   ment #3, Table 5.1.

4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
44                             AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


     4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following circum-
     stances:
        4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally accepted sci-
        entific and medical methods and standards.
        4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
        4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
     4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing devices, then
     apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1) During the initial traffic
     stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction with other field sobriety testing
     techniques as long as the state or host nation does not prohibit such use, and 2) According to the man-
     ufacturer's operating instructions.
        4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
            4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the breath
            specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew tobacco, or ingest
            any substance.
            4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to manufac-
            turer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation requirements.
            4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current instruction
            manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's manual.
     4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
        4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon death of
        any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction, medical author-
        ities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or mishap. Conduct tests for
        the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as
        soon as possible and where practical within eight hours of death. Include the test results in the
        medical reports.
        4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath sample
        from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
     4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal driving
     behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If you reason-
     ably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform field sobriety tests.
     The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests. Use the
     standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10. Specific procedures for administering them can be
     found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for proce-
     dures and guidance concerning the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving
     reduction measures.

4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                       45


   4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
   4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
       4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a motor
       vehicle on the installation.
       4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the influence of
       alcohol or drugs.
       4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that failure to
       voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may result in revoca-
       tion of on-base driving privileges.
   4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the driver that
   the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to voluntarily submit to or com-
   plete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the right to have an attorney present before
   deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph
   4.12. Also advise the driver that you can use the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
   consent provisions of this instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under
   Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.14.3. (ACC) Provide the type of chemical tests prescribed in the local supplement to this publica-
   tion.
   4.14.3. (HOLLOMAN) Refer to paragraphA3.4.3. (Added) of this supplement for chemical testing
   procedures.
   4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders, or any
   medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may refuse a blood
   extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both. You must outline these
   procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for nonpunitive refusal in readily available
   medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other reasonable areas where blood samples might
   be drawn from those suspected of drunk driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a med-
   ical doctor.
   4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do not admin-
   ister a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.

4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or
   cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom proba-
   ble cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence,
   and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches govern the extrac-
   tion of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual
   extraction of blood samples is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of
   Clinical Services.
   4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure authori-
   zations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and who subse-
   quently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced to submit to an
46                              AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


     involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions are considered only when
     an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death, serious personal injury, or significant
     property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of
     a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the
     following procedures: 1) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate
     obtained pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual
     extraction; 2) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear
     indication that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay nec-
     essary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought;
     and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate
     and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability of the
     appropriate commander or military magistrate.
        4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful (due to
        nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
        Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the
        time an authorization is sought.
            4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facil-
            ity should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate.
            4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d) need
            not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can perform the
            extraction.
            4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individ-
            ual in determining probable cause.
     4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by
     qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions defining medical care,
     such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR 160-12. Only qualified medi-
     cal personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure.
     Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
     enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer
     or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
        4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention.
        Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other medi-
        cal treatment is required.

4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
     4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3. can request additional testing. These tests are
     paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base hospital or research
     laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in a military or civilian court
     of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an overseas area) approves the test and test
     method. Complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the resulting documents.
     4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make those
     arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid when circum-
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                        47


   stances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason additional testing is not com-
   pleted.

4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not under mili-
tary control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and incidents of interest to
local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the sharing and exchanging of infor-
mation with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures are generally well documented in formal
agreements with the host nation. Local procedures must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of
traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.
4.17. (HOLLOMAN) The 49 FW/JA shall act as a liaison with civil authorities for all civil traffic cases
pending on military members.

4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
   4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws when
   operating government vehicles on or off base.
   4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before moving gov-
   ernment vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits such as weight,
   length, width, or other standards.
   4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement agencies and
   encourage the following:
       4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators involved in
       accidents or incidents.
       4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of government
       motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious violations of civil traffic
       laws.
       4.18.3.2. (ACC) The individual’s unit commander, section commander, or first sergeant is
       responsible for providing a copy of the person's suspension/revocation memorandum to vehicle
       operations.
       4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
       driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
   4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to coordinate mili-
   tary and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation commanders should coop-
   erate and provide proper support and participation.
   4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic workshop pro-
   gram to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local communities. Sound and practical
   traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic enforcement, engineering, and education.
   Civilian and military legal and law enforcement officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public
   affairs officers should take part.

                    DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and
parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military
installation. In filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
5.1. (HOLLOMAN) The 49 SFS/S5AR shall use the SFMIS data base to record driving records.
     5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or “V” vic-
     tim.
     5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability deter-
     mined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and
     “FO” fixed object.

 revocation.
 Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
 Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
 Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
 Violation:
 1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
 2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
 0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead of
 0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
 3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
 other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
 4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
 5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
 6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
 ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
 7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
 Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
 one year is discretionary.
 Violation:
 1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
 incompetent to drive.
 2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
 grounds for suspension or revocation.
 3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
 4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
 5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
 6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.

NOTES:
  1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
     date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or host
     nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
   2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
      violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial, nonjudi-
      cial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise addressed in
      this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as
      one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24 months) or con-
      currently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy systematically and not
      on a case-by-case basis.

(minimum 6-months not to exceed 12-months) as determined by the 49 MSG/CC.

5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to
impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a
substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reason-
able exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate
installation driving privileges.

5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are man-
datory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the
installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs
on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this
instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court,
or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the
point system for non-moving violations.

Driver involved in accident is deemed responsible (only added to points assessed for 1
specific violations).

NOTES:
  1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the offense
     having the greater value.
   2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails to
      correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace period
      on a warning ticket).
   3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier, booster
      seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points when no
      restraint system of any kind is used.

   as a basis for determining point assessment.
56                            AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007


     5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation
     (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an inquiry. The com-
     mander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action.
     5.4.2. (ACC) Citations returned with a recommendation that no administrative action be taken must
     include a written rebuttal, and routed through the support group commander for final resolution.
     Rebuttals are limited to one page and must be endorsed by the unit commander.
     5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9.
     5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropri-
     ate:
        5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
        acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.1. (HOLLOMAN) The 49 SFS/S5AR shall notify the appropriate unit commander by advi-
        sory memorandum when an individual has accumulated six or more points within 12 months or
        seven or more points within 24 months.
        5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any person who
        acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to
        have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
        5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill, awareness, or
        attitude.
        5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counsel-
        ing, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all cases in which
        alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.
     5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
     instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
     5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation
     or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
     consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation periods for
     offenses not covered in Table 5.1.; however, any revocation must be for a period of 6 months or more.
     The installation commander may impose a longer suspension or revocation period (to include offenses
     in Table 5.1.) based on the person’s overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and
     severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all
     cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training
     before reinstatement of driving privileges.
     5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 con-
     secutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during records update while
     recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation
     based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                         57


   5.4.7. (ACC) Suspension of driving privileges for a period of less than 6 months does not constitute
   authority to remove accumulated traffic points from the Security Forces Management Information
   System (SFMIS).
   5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations,
   chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain posted on individual
   driving records for the period of time indicated below.
       5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
       5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
       5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.

5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a person
assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released from military
service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
   5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other entries on
   their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining installation. The
   gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any Air Force suspension
   or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons
   transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in para 5.4.7.
   5.5.1. (ACC) Personnel who transferred from other Air Force installations whose driving privileges
   were suspended or revoked will be notified in writing that they will remain under suspension or revo-
   cation for at least the original specified period. Revocation or suspension should also continue for the
   specified period for personnel in a temporary duty (TDY) status to another installation. Individuals
   who have had limited driving privileges granted by the installation commander must have a copy of
   the granting memorandum immediately available when operating a motor vehicle on base.
   5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
   37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released
   from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of
   officer component, or military and civilian retirement when continued vehicle registration is autho-
   rized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139 records on civilian personnel who are terminat-
   ing on-base employment or on-base registration.
   5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
   entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for service members.
   Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges. Do not delete points
   accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or
   chargeable accidents from the driver records except per para 5.4.7. and 5.4.8.

                                                  Chapter 6

                           IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
     6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle
     traffic movement.
     6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search
     and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.

6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
     6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
     convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
     abandoned.
     6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
     possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasi-
     ble, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
     owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, the security
     police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
     6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
        6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
            6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
            flow of traffic.
            6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
            lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
            hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
            6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
            6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
        6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
            6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
            6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
            6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
            6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
            (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
            6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
            ways.
            6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
            cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                       59


          6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.

6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs depending
   on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
   6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation for use as
   an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted wrecker service pro-
   vided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor impoundment areas and maintains
   keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
   6.3.2. (HOLLOMAN) The Security Forces Impound Lot, located next to the HAFB Horse Stables, is
   the designated impoundment lot on HAFB. Access to the lot is controlled by 49 SFS/SFOI.
   6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or involvement
   in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
   6.3.3. (HOLLOMAN) Vehicle owners claiming an impounded vehicle or wishing to have the vehicle
   towed shall produce proof of ownership and valid insurance.

6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
6.4. (HOLLOMAN) Forms Prescribed.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
   6.4.1. (HOLLOMAN) AF Form 213, Receipt for Accountable Forms
      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD 5525.4),
      on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
      the security police blotter.
      6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle. Have
      the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted wrecker service is used,
      complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
      6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD Form
      2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action taken.
          6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory listing
          personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless necessary to iden-
          tify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public. In most cases, listing the
          container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
          6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
          6.4.1.3.2. (ACC) Locking the vehicle with positive key control satisfies this requirement.
      6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD 5525.4), by cer-
      tified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
      impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s intentions concerning the
      vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.

     6.4.2. (HOLLOMAN) AF Form 335, Issuance Record Accountability Identification Card
        6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes. Release
        recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law
        enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
        6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request the Air
        Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff such requests
        through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and support such requests
        and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if civil authorities do not
        take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by the installation com-
        mander.

     6.4.13. (Added-HOLLOMAN) Standard Form 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report

6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in conjunction
with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
     6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related
     impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle unless evidence or contra-
     band is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in
     doubt, obtain proper search authority before searching.
     6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal incident
     or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause
     exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present but is unwilling, incapacitated, or
     otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may
     search vehicles without search authority when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is
     a risk of loss or destruction of evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search inci-
     dent to apprehension.

6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
     6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law enforcement,
     or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority, release vehicles and prop-
AFI31-204_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                      61


   erty when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above. Review Title 10, USC 2575, Dispo-
   sition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing
   Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner
   or an authorized agent.
   6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts to con-
   tact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to assume responsi-
   bility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt to secure release of the
   vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD Form 2507. The 60-day waiting
   period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed
   letter, power of attorney, or other legally recognized document.
       6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the vehicle as
       abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise directed, installation
       commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use for, or disposal of, abandoned
       property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are
       potential options. Consider local, state, or if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process
       vehicles through the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO
       and DoD directives.
