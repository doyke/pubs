This instruction establishes the Vandenberg Air Force Base Public Access Defibrillation (PAD)
Program and implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 41-1, Health Care Programs and
Resources, 15 April 1994, and Guidelines for Public Access Defibrillations in Federal Facilities
dated 23 May 2001. The PAD program employs an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) to
be used in an emergency response to sudden cardiac arrest as a means to decrease premature
mortality. This instruction identifies the lines of responsibility and provides guidelines to ensure
an appropriate response to such an event. This publication is applicable to DoD entities of VAFB
(non DoD/contractor tenet units will be responsible for maintaining their own PAD programs).
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AF Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at ttps://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.
Comply with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program, for documents containing Privacy
Act information.

1. Concept of PAD. Most cardiac arrests are due to underlying heart disease and result in
irregular rhythms called ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The technique of
delivering an electrical shock, called defibrillation, is the only known treatment for pulseless
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. To be effective, defibrillation must be
administered within minutes of a cardiac arrest, for every minute that passes without
defibrillation, a victim’s chance of survival decreases by 7 to 10 percent. After as little as 10
minutes, very few resuscitation attempts are successful. With the advent of the AED, a trained
rescuer can quickly and easily defibrillate a cardiac arrest victim and save lives. In August 2003,
the Secretary of Defense mandated that military installations establish PAD programs with
consideration for potential placement of AEDs in federal buildings.

   event occur outside of typical duty hours and a targeted responder is not available, any
   responder may provide CPR and use the AED following the instructions of an EMS
   dispatcher.
3. AED Procurement and Placement:
   3.1. Initial AED procurement is at the request of the owning unit commander/director,
   approved by the Medical Director in keeping with risk assessment findings, and coordinated
   by the Program Coordinator with BMET and Medical Logistics. An AED use Protocol
   signed by the Medical Director serves as the prescription for AED placement and as the
   standing order for use by the targeted responders.
   3.2. AEDs are approved for placement in strategic locations supported by risk assessment
   findings. AEDs will not be relocated or removed without additional risk assessment and
   Medical Director approval. Unit commanders/directors requesting relocation or removal of
   an AED will coordinate through the Program Coordinator.
   3.3. AEDs will be positioned in conspicuous locations where Targeted Responders can
   readily find them. Those locations will also be secure in order to prevent or minimize the
   potential for tampering, theft and/or misuse, and preclude access by unauthorized users.
4. AED Maintenance:
   4.1. 30 MDG BMET is the focal point for AED maintenance. They will maintain a
   minimum of five additional devices as temporary replacements for AEDs requiring
   maintenance/repair that cannot be done immediately.
   4.2. BMETs will perform an initial inspection on all new AEDs. During this process, the
   serial number, manufacturer and model number will be entered into the Defense Medical
   Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) database to ensure device accountability on the 30
   MDG Equipment Inventory.
   4.3. BMETs will inventory all AEDs during annual preventive maintenance in accordance
   with manufacturer’s specifications and guidelines. Should replacement items be required,
   BMET will provide a listing of supply sources to owning Site Coordinators.
 6                                                               30SWI44-101 25 APRIL 2014


     4.4. Malfunctioning AEDs will be brought to the BMET section where a technician will
     make an assessment. AEDs still under warranty will be returned to the manufacturer or
     designated dealer for repair or replacement. AEDs no longer under warranty will be assessed
     by BMET for in-house repair. If the AED is not amenable to in-house repair the AED will
     either be returned to the manufacture or designated dealer for repair or BMET will make a
     recommendation for replacement.
     4.5. All repair or replacement actions and costs will be recorded by the Medical Logistics
     Flight. All costs will be paid by the owning unit. In accordance with the Safe Medical
     Devices Act, all equipment errors must be reported to the Food and Drug Administration
     (FDA). 21 U.S.C. 360(i) (1997). This reporting will be handled by the Medical Logistics
     Flight.
5. Event Response and Post-Event Procedures:
     5.1. Mechanism for activation of the PAD program is determined by the unit Emergency
     Medical Response Plans and Protocols. Once activated, Targeted Responders will act
     accordingly until arrival of EMS personnel.
     5.2. In all instances in which the PAD program is activated, the AED Event Summary Sheet
     will be completed by responding unit personnel and forwarded to the Program Coordinator
     along with the AED within 2 hours of use or by 0800 the following duty day if the event
     occurred outside of normal duty hours. If unable to return the AED in a timely manner, a
     BMET will give the unit one of their loaner devices.
     5.3. The Program Coordinator will arrange for download of the AED Summary Report,
     route the AED Event Summary Sheet and AED Summary Report according to quality
     assurance procedures and return the AED to the owning unit.
     5.4. The Site Coordinator will inspect unused supplies for any damage or expiration dates;
     restock any used, damaged or expired items; clean the AED according to manufacture
     instructions; remove and replace the AED battery as necessary; and perform a battery
     insertion test prior to returning the AED to its approved location.
     5.5. After final review the AED Event Summary Sheet and AED Summary Report will be
     stored in 30 MDG Quality Managers office.
6. Quality Assurance:
     6.1. Site Coordinators will conduct and document semiannual PAD Activation exercise
     scenarios to ensure staff know how to activate the program and Targeted Responders and
     other certified, trained staff know the AED location, that all equipment is operational, and
     that staff respond appropriately. Evaluation of these exercises will be documented on PAD
     Activation Exercise Criteria (Attachment 8). The PAD Activation Exercise Criteria will be
     kept on file by the Site Coordinator and available for inspection at any time by the Program
     Coordinator and/or Medical Director.
     6.2. BLS/AED instructors may conduct unannounced exercise scenarios to ensure targeted
     responders appropriate use of the AED protocols at the discretion of the Medical Director.
30SWI44-101 25 APRIL 2014                                                                   7


  6.3. The PAD program Medical Director or the 30 MDG Code Blue Representative will
  review all AED Event Summary Sheets and AED Summary Reports with focus on the
  identification of lessons learned and system deficiencies. Findings will be presented at the
  next scheduled 30 MDG Executive Committee of the Medical Staff (ECOMS). Both
  findings and recommendations may be shared with unit commanders/directors at the
  discretion of the Medical Director.

but are not limited to:

2.1. Electrical dangers (downed power lines, electrical cords).

2.2. Chemical (hazardous gases, liquids or solids, smoke).

2.3. Harmful people.

2.4. Traffic

2.5. Fire hazards (flammable gasses such as oxygen, cooking gas).

3. PAD Program Activation:

3.1 During Unit Duty Hours: 0730 to 1630 Monday through Friday. In any potentially life-
threatening cardiac emergency:

3.1.1. After ensuring the scene is safe, the first person on scene accesses the victim for potential
life threatening emergency and if present will:

inform them of the location and nature of the emergency.

3.1.1.2. Activate Emergency Medical Services (EMS) by calling “911” and inform the EMS
dispatcher of location of the emergency (the building Number and/or facility name, room number
and floor), the nature of emergency and the status of the victim (unconscious, breathing,
bleeding), their gender and approximate age, the availability of the AED, and any other
information requested by the EMS dispatcher.

3.1.1.3. Render care appropriate to level of training, to include initiating CPR as indicated.

3.1.2. Security Personnel immediately upon receiving the call will:
