       10.3.1. Is still needed to perform missions/duties,
       10.3.2. Does not adequately perform all of the tasks for which it was procured and used,
       10.3.3. Was not originally acquired for the purpose of conducting an exchange, and
       10.3.4. Isn’t in a prohibited federal supply class.
    10.4. The System Program Director (SPD) for major end items and the managing DoD Integrated
    Manager/Inventory Control Point (ICP) for secondary items determine whether centrally managed eli-
    gible nonexcess items qualify for exchange/sale.
    10.5. SPDs will coordinate proposed end item exchanges or sales with the ICPs managing installed
    components/parts.

  tion in accordance with existing supply policy in AFI 23-501.
  10.8. Prior to contracting for replacement property, the holding activity will contact Federal Agencies
  known to use or distribute similar property to determine if an agency wants the property by means of
  a reimbursable transfer. The price negotiated must not be greater than the best estimate of what would
  have been received in a sale or exchange.
  10.9. Prior to contracting for replacement property, a determination will be made of which method –
  exchange or sale – will provide the greater return to the Government. This determination will become
  part of the contract file. When estimating the return under each method, all administrative and over-
  head costs will be considered. If the exchange allowance or estimated sales proceeds for property
  would be unreasonably low, property will be turned in for disposal in accordance with existing supply
  policies.
  10.10. Proceeds from exchange/sale of nonexcess materiel may only be used to acquire materiel that
  is similar to the materiel exchanged/sold. (See DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Paragraph
  010210.)

   acquiring replacement property. Units will record sales and exchanges by fiscal year and retain
   records for five years as prescribed in AFMAN 37-139. Each acquisition transaction will include:
   FSC, NSN, noun, number of items sold/exchanged, original acquisition cost, number of items
   acquired, exchange allowance or sales proceeds, and source from which the property was originally
   acquired, i.e., new procurement, excess, forfeiture, or other source. These data, aggregated at the
   MAJCOM level, may be requested by HQ USAF to evaluate use of the exchange/sale authority.
   11.2. MAJCOMs and DRUs shall ensure bases/organizations establish management controls to
   ensure, as a minimum, that:

Section D—Domestic Technology Transfer Programs
Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)

12. Program Objective. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 authorized CRADAs as a means
to help improve the way Federal agencies transfer commercially useful technologies to the private sector.
This section provides guidance for Air Force activities to provide temporary custody of Air Force prop-
erty to CRADA applicants.

13. Authority. CRADAs between laboratories and applicants (collaborators) are authorized by 15 U.S.C.
3710a. DoD policy in DoDD 5535.3, May 21, 1999, DoD Domestic Technology Transfer (T2) Program,
and procedures in DoDI 5535.8, May 14, 1999, DoD Technology Transfer (T2) Program, provide over-
arching guidance for CRADAs. AFI 61-302, July 26, 1994, establishes AF policy and procedures for exe-
cuting CRADAs.

14. General Guidance.
AFI23-119 5 JUNE 2001                                                                                      13

   14.1. A military-use CRADA is an agreement between a DoD laboratory and/or technical activity
   and an industrial partner to utilize existing unique capabilities and facilities at the DoD laboratory in a
   product or process intended primarily for DoD or other military use. A "laboratory" means any facility
   or group of facilities that is owned, leased, or otherwise used by DoD and funded by the Government,
   whether operated by the Government or by a contractor.
   14.2. Under a CRADA the laboratory/technical activity may provide personnel, services, facilities,
   equipment, or other resources with or without reimbursement, but not funds to the non-Federal party.
   14.3. The non-Federal party may provide funds, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, and other
   resources toward the conduct of specific R&D efforts that are consistent with the missions of the lab-
   oratory.
   14.4. A CRADA, as provided in 15 U.S.C. § 3710(d), is not a procurement contract or a cooperative
   agreement as Section 6303 et seq. of Title 31 of the United States Code uses these terms. FAR proce-
   dures shall not be used in providing materiel to CRADA collaborators.
   14.5. The Air Force shall not make monetary payments to the collaborating party under a CRADA.
   14.6. Equipment, maintenance or other sustainment support shall not be provided for the laboratory
   equipment furnished by the CRADA.

15. Responsibilities:
   15.1. The head of the laboratory shall:
       15.1.1. Determine which laboratory property is suitable and available for temporary and exclu-
       sive use by a CRADA collaborator.
       15.1.2. Ensure property is nonexcess, but not for the time needed by DoD, by screening within the
       DoD laboratory/scientific community to determine whether there are other immediate government
       requirements for the property.
       15.1.3. Ensure proper controls are applied to prevent unauthorized release of property having
       environmental regulations, U.S. Department of State or Commerce export license restrictions,
       demilitarization requirements or trade and security control risks.
       15.1.4. Ensure property provided by custodial transfer is managed in accordance with procedures
       in AFI 61-301.
       15.1.5. Ensure leased property is managed in accordance with procedures in AFI 64-103.
       15.1.6. Ensure the laboratory retains title/accountability for property provided to collaborators,
       accomplishes required CFO reporting, and ensures, after termination or expiration of the agree-
       ment/lease, that property is returned in the condition in which it was provided, normal wear and
       tear excepted.
       15.1.7. Ensure all reporting is accomplished as required by DoDI 5535.8.
   15.2. The laboratory supply activity shall:
       15.2.1. Use the federal catalog (FED LOG) to obtain item characteristics for stock-listed property
       to identify items requiring controls.
14                                                                              AFI23-119 5 JUNE 2001

        15.2.2. Obtain item characteristics/controls data from the manufacturer for nonstock-listed prop-
        erty.
        15.2.3. Contact the Defense Logistics Information System (DLIS) Demilitarization Coding Man-
        agement Office (DCMO), Battle Creek, MI, to obtain assistance identifying security and trade
        control requirements for property being considered for lease or custodial transfer under a
        CRADA.
        15.2.4. Ensure property is not released to the collaborator until the CRADA document is formal-
        ized and the laboratory director, or his representative, has authorized release of the property.
        15.2.5. Maintain accountable records, accomplish CFO reporting, and inspect the property upon
        return by the collaborator.
     15.3. Air Force inventory control points (ICP) will normally not be involved in educational partner-
     ship property transactions since the property is laboratory-owned and on the laboratory’s accountable
     records. Requests for ICP involvement in CRADA property transactions will be referred to HQ
     AFMC/LGIA.
     Educational Partnerships

16. Program Objective. The educational partnership is a vehicle whereby Air Force laboratories under-
take joint tasks with educational institutions for the purpose of encouraging and enhancing study in scien-
tific disciplines of interest to the Air Force. Such partnership agreements provide educational institutions
access to laboratory resources (laboratory equipment, personnel, facilities, etc.) and provide a unique
opportunity for students to work on projects and equipment not otherwise available within the educational
institution. This section provides guidance for Air Force activities to authorize the use of Air Force prop-
erty in conjunction with an educational partnership agreement.

17. Authority. 10 U.S.C. 2194 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to allow defense laboratories to enter
into one or more educational partnership agreements and to transfer excess laboratory equipment to par-
ticipating educational institutions at all levels of education. 15 U.S.C. 3710(i), commonly known as the
Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act, also provides transfer authority for a laboratory, agency,
or department to donate excess research equipment to educational institutions and non-profit organiza-
tions for technical, scientific education, and research activities. DoD policy in DoDD 5535.3, May 21,
1999, DoD Domestic Technology Transfer (T2) Program, and procedures in DoDI 5535.8, May 14, 1999,
DoD Technology Transfer (T2) Program, provide overarching guidance for these partnerships. AFI
61-301 and AFI 61-302 provide implementing procedures. .

18. General Guidance.
     18.1. Property shall be made available to public and private schools and nonprofit educational insti-
     tutions located in the U.S. by means of a lease, custodial transfer agreement or donation agreement.
        18.1.1. Property provided by custodial transfer agreement or lease shall be nonexcess.
        18.1.2. If property is surplus, it may be provided by donation in accordance with DoD

Data Package (TDP), an incomplete TDP, or a TDP that contains limited rights data; and
2. The annual buy value of the part exceeds $10,000 as defined in Defense Acquisition Regulation Sup-
plement Number 6; and
3. Lease of the part will not adversely affect or deplete required supply quantities; and
4. Potential life cycle cost saving exceed the cost of making the part available; and
26                                                                           AFI23-119 5 JUNE 2001

space applications, as determined in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25, “Withholding of Unclassi-
fied Technical Data from Public Disclosure.”
