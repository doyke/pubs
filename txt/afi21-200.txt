SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance
Management

       By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum immediately
implements changes to AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management, 2 Jan 2014.
Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with
other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI33-360,
Publications and Forms Management.

       This Guidance Memorandum incorporates two changes to AFI 21-200 guidance to specify
implementation period and clarify key and lock storage requirement. In advance of a rewrite of AFI
21-200, the following items are updated to provide guidance changes that are effective immediately.

(Replace) This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-2, Munitions and is
consistent with AFPD 13-5, Air Force Nuclear Enterprise. It provides the strategic structure for
Air Force munitions units and provides the policy framework for uniform and effective
management of nuclear, conventional, and missile organizations. This publication applies to
individuals at all levels who manage, steward, and maintain munitions, nuclear weapons,
Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM), space launch mission assurance, and related systems
and components, including the Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG). The
ANG is a MAJCOM for the purpose of this instruction. MAJCOMs and units have 90 calendar
days from the effective date of this publication to rewrite or certify as current supplements to this
publication. Changes to documentation requirements in this instruction may exceed the 90
calendar day implementation requirement; however documents will be updated or revised at the
next normal required or mandated update or revision point. Organizational structures may differ in
the Air Reserve Component (ARC). In these instances, responsibilities will be assigned to the
appropriate functional manager command channels. This publication outlines organizational
structure based upon mission focus and outlines common responsibilities across the munitions and
missile maintenance community. Where specific requirements exist relative to a specific
functional specialty, the requirement is delineated in the applicable Air Force Instruction (AFI).
This publication applies to all major commands (MAJCOMs) and their subordinate units. Units
will contact the applicable MAJCOM for interpretations of the guidance contained in this
publication. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are
identified with a Tier (T-0, T-1, T-2, or T-3) number following the compliance statement.
Subordinate paragraphs carry the parent tiering unless otherwise specified. See AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated
with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the
appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) for non-tiered compliance items. MAJCOM supplements to this publication
must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval.
Units will not supplement this publication. Ensure all records created as a result of the processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) in
the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the OPR using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s
chain of command.

(Replace) 7.1.6.1. Keys and locks may be stored within the same safe as long as they are stored in
separate drawers. (T-1). Keys and locks to nuclear weapons storage and maintenance facilities must
maintain compliance per paragraph 7.1.4. (T-0).

      This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication,
whichever is earlier.

                                             Chapter 1

                                            GENERAL

1.1. Introduction. This instruction contains general information to support Air Force munitions
and missile maintenance communities and provides broad responsibilities for these
organizations. This Air Force instruction is the capstone document that defines munitions and
missile maintenance organizational structure and related roles and responsibilities. When
requirements of a specific item in a technical manual conflict with this instruction, the specific
technical manual takes precedence. Units will notify the MAJCOM staff of conflicts. (T-2).
1.2. Defining Munitions. Munitions are defined within AFPD 21-2, Munitions. Throughout
this AFI, the term "munitions" refers to this definition.
1.3. Defining Duty Periods. Ensure 2WX and 2M0 personnel (except those dispatched as
noted in paragraph 1.3.2.2) handling, loading, or performing maintenance actions on nuclear or
conventional weapon systems or explosives do not exceed 12-hours of continuous duty (may be
waived up to a maximum of 16 hours) followed by a period which provides at least 8 hours of
uninterrupted rest. (T-0). Duty time begins when personnel report for duty and ends when their
supervisor releases them; however, timeframe must not exceed the limits specified in this AFI.
     1.3.1. Ensure maintenance personnel are provided the appropriate rest period and do not
     exceed maximum duty periods. (T-0). EXCEPTION: The Group Commander or equivalent
     may waive these provisions during actual advanced defense readiness conditions, actual
     emergencies as defined in DoD Directive 3150.2, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program,
     AFPD 91-1, Nuclear Weapons and Systems Surety, and AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear
     Weapons Surety Program, or to resolve an unexpected event (e.g., disabled vehicle, alarm
     fault, hoist failure, weather). The maximum duty period cannot be waived solely to support
     exercises or inspections. Consider climatic conditions for local work/rest cycles during
     extreme temperatures.
     1.3.2. Ensure all personnel who dispatch within the missile field complex receive an 8-hour
     rest period prior to beginning their scheduled duty period. (T-1) Duty time begins when
     personnel report for duty or start their standby period (whichever is earlier). The duty period
     ends when personnel turn in all equipment and vehicles or release these items to another
     individual/team, or when personnel arrive at a Missile Alert Facility (MAF) to remain
     overnight.
        1.3.2.1. All personnel will receive an uninterrupted 12-hour rest period upon completion
        of an off-base dispatch. (T-1). Personnel who remain overnight at a MAF will be
        provided at least 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. (T-1).
        1.3.2.2. The maximum duty period for dispatching personnel is 16 hours in any
        combination of on/off-base duty. This maximum duty period may be waived to meet
        mission requirements consistent with paragraph 1.3.1
     1.3.3. Civilian technician work and rest requirements will be governed by respective
     contractual and labor management agreements.

                   ORGANIZATION ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Wings. Air Force wings are the primary maintenance level for munitions. Wings prepare
for and execute activities in support of Combatant Commander commitments or assigned
missions such as deactivation, conversion, and the Force Development Evaluation (FDE)
program. Additionally, they execute maintenance management guidance and procedures to
achieve the most efficient use of manpower and fiscal resources, surety, readiness, and
maintenance productivity.
2.2. Munitions Squadrons (MUNS) and Munitions Flights. Munitions organizations are
aligned IAW AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, and amplifying guidance in Figures 2.1 and
2.2 as well as Tables 2.1 and 2.2 Munitions units are responsible for command and control;
administration and management of training, resources, and programs; and the control,
accountability, storage, receipt, shipment, inspection, maintenance, assembly, flightline delivery,
armament systems (if applicable), and limited disposition of munitions and associated
components. Munitions units manage utilization of munitions and maintenance information
technology (IT) systems. Squadron and flight personnel manage and maintain all assigned tools,
test, munitions handling equipment, and associated support equipment.
   2.2.1. Munitions Squadron (MUNS) Organizational Structure. The MUNS commander is
   directly responsible to the group commander (or equivalent) and is organized in accordance
   with Figure 2.1 The Unit Manning Document (UMD) is aligned according to the Air Force
   approved template at Table 2.1 Dependent upon assigned mission, a MUNS may consist of
   Production, Materiel, Systems, Armament, Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile
   (CALCM), and Special Weapons flights.
       2.2.1.1. The Combat Munitions Training (CMT) Section is typically aligned under the
       Production Flight; however, CMT may be combined with squadron training under the
       Systems Flight. ACC and PACAF units are not required to meet CMT Program
       requirements for the following munitions systems that may appear on the Unit
       Committed Munitions List as primary or support munitions: ALCM, CALCM, and B61
       and B83 bombs. These systems are not maintained by 2W0X1 personnel or readily
       deployable and not generally prepared for use in a mass production environment.
       2.2.1.2. The MUNS may include 21M, Munitions and Missile Maintenance officers;
       2W0X1, Munitions Systems; 2W1X1, Armament Systems; 2W2X1, Nuclear Weapons
       Systems; 2M0X1, Missile and Space Systems Electronics; 3D1X2, Cyber Transport
       System; 2R0/1, Maintenance Management Systems; 2S0X1 Supply Management, and
       authorized Commander’s Support Staff (e.g., personnel, workgroup managers, training
       management). Munitions Squadrons designated as Geographically Separated Units
       (GSU) may be authorized other specialties such as Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE)
       and Vehicle Maintenance in accordance with applicable manpower standards.
       2.2.1.3. Generally, a MUNS is established when the unit’s mission involves critical,
       diverse, and multi-functional capabilities or when essential capabilities demand
       coordinated and simultaneous activity of multiple 2WX and/or 2M0 or other specialty
       skills on a scale broader than what a Munitions Flight can provide.

    2.2.2. Munitions Functions/Activities. Munitions squadrons and flights may physically or
    functionally consolidate internal workcenters and activities to maximize operational
    efficiency. (T-2). MAJCOM functional staff will be notified. However, MAJCOM approval
    is not required. UMDs will not be changed to reflect local consolidation. When
    consolidating, the organizational structure outlined in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2 will remain
    the approved structure. (T-3). Munitions organizations may establish consolidated tool room,
    resource, supply, training, and support functions, as they deem necessary. Resources are
    earned to support wartime, training, or other mission requirements; therefore, no additional
    resources are earned or lost due to local consolidation. See paragraph 2.2.3 for small and
    unique munitions organizational structure.
       2.2.2.1. Production Flight or Section. The Production Flight/Section assembles,
       disassembles, delivers, and maintains conventional munitions, missiles, containers,
       dispensers, assigned Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (MMHE), and training
       items.
       2.2.2.2. Materiel Flight or Section. The Materiel Flight/Section stores, handles, inspects,
       ships, receives, accomplishes local dispositions, coordinates transportation, and accounts
       for conventional munitions, containers, dispensers, and training items.
       2.2.2.3. Systems Flight or Section. The Systems Flight/Section provides broad
       command and control, direction, and support for all munitions activities to include
       training, resources, munitions information systems, facilities, and mobility programs.
       The flight/section plans, schedules, coordinates, controls, and directs all munitions
       activities. For nuclear capable units, specific training requirements are prescribed in AFI
       21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures.
       2.2.2.4. Armament Systems Flight. The Armament Systems Flight performs off-
       equipment maintenance of weapons release systems, guns, munitions racks, adapters,
       pylons, and launchers. Specific responsibilities are described in AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
       Equipment Maintenance Management, and appropriate MAJCOM supplemental
       guidance. The Wing Weapons Manager is the wing's focal point for all weapons loading
       and armament systems related matters.
       2.2.2.5. Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile Flight. The CALCM Flight
       performs on-equipment and off-equipment maintenance on assigned CALCM and
       associated equipment. Specific responsibilities are described in AFI 21-202V2, Missile
       Maintenance Management, and appropriate MAJCOM supplemental guidance.
       2.2.2.6. Special Weapons Flight or Strategic/Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Flight or
       Section. The Special Weapons Flight/Section performs on-equipment and off-equipment
       maintenance on assigned nuclear weapons, missiles, Reentry Systems (RS), Reentry
       Vehicles (RV), and associated equipment. Specific responsibilities are described in AFI
       21-202V2, Missile Maintenance Management, AFI 21-203, Nuclear Accountability
       Procedures, AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures, and appropriate
       MAJCOM supplemental guidance.

                                   MUNITIONS CONTROL

5.1. Munitions Control. Munitions Control is the focal point for planning, coordinating,
directing, and controlling munitions/weapons activities. Munitions Control coordinates with
munitions, weapons, flightline, ICBM missile maintenance activities, security forces, fire
department, and command post to ensure effective flow of information, scheduling, and use of
available resources to accomplish the mission. Munitions Control personnel must have a
working knowledge of all munitions functional areas, adapt well to stress, and speak in a clear
and concise manner. (T-2).
5.2. Facilities and Communications.
   5.2.1. Munitions Control must be located, equipped, and arranged to ease the collection,
   recording, and dissemination of information essential for command, control, and
   communications. (T-3).
   5.2.2. Facilities must meet the minimum security standards commensurate with the
   information being maintained and stored. (T-0). Small and unique units with limited
   facilities are exempt from the structure requirements in this chapter.

                     MUNITIONS KEY AND LOCK MANAGEMENT

7.1. General.
   7.1.1. Security of and controlling access to munitions storage and maintenance facilities
   helps guarantee physical inventory control and accountability of munitions. These
   procedures apply to government-owned facilities including those operated by contractors.
   7.1.2. Protect keys and locks used to secure classified munitions with a classification at least
   equal to the classification of the items being secured. (T-0). Master keying is prohibited. (T-
   0). Keys to high security locks will not be duplicated. (T-1).
   7.1.3. Keys and locks to conventional munitions storage and maintenance facilities will be
   controlled and secured in accordance with DoDM 5100.76, Physical Security of Sensitive
   Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives, AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO),
   and the procedures in this chapter. (T-0). An individual authorized to issue keys will not
   issue key(s) to themselves unless responding to emergencies or during non-duty hour stand-
   by response where limited personnel availability necessitates such action. (T-1).
   7.1.4. Keys and locks to nuclear weapons storage and maintenance facilities will be
   controlled per DoD S-5210.41-M, Nuclear Weapons Security Manual, AFMAN 31-108, The
   Air Force Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, and the procedures in this chapter. (T-0). Cell
   unlock devices and Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS) keys that house weapon storage vaults
   do not fall under the high security key and lock management program. Keys and locks will
   be secured with a General Services Administration (GSA)-approved lock requiring a
   minimum of two separate combinations or two GSA-approved locks. (T-0). Units must
   ensure no one individual is given both combinations to key(s) or container(s), or has physical
   possession of both keys at one time. (T-0).
   7.1.5. Rooms where keys and locks are stored will be secured during non-duty hours. (T-0).
   Access to the room is restricted to authorized personnel. (T-0).
      7.1.5.1. Keep keys and locks to nuclear weapons storage and maintenance facilities in
      any 24-hour manned or alarmed container, room, or facility within the restricted area
      during non-duty hours. (T-0).
      7.1.5.2. If stored in security facilities, do not give the combinations or assign Security
      Forces key responsibilities. (T-1). Key containers belong to and are controlled by the
      munitions activity.
   7.1.6. Store primary keys separate from spare/control (maintenance) keys. (T-0).
      7.1.6.1. Keys and locks may be stored within the same safe as long as they are locked in
      separate drawers with different combinations. (T-1).
      7.1.6.2. Both primary and spare keys may be issued when required to support daily
      operations. Monitor this practice closely to identify adverse key control trends. (T-3).
   7.1.7. Keys to conventional munitions facilities will not be stored in the same key box as the
   keys to nuclear weapons facilities. (T-0). This restriction does not preclude a conventional
 40                                                             AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


   munitions facility key box from being stored in the same safe as the nuclear weapons facility
   key box.
   7.1.8. All keys removed from their storage container shall remain under the constant
   surveillance of personnel authorized to receive or issue keys to preclude unauthorized access
   or duplication. For Example: Keys will not be taken to lunch, home, etc. (T-1).
   7.1.9. External Locking Devices. Locks and cylinders are received with a control key (for
   lock maintenance) and two non-control keys. Designate one non-control key as primary and
   the remaining non-control key as a spare. (T-1). Control keys may be designated and issued
   as spare keys in the event that a non-control key becomes unserviceable. A minimum of two
   serviceable keys for each lock or cylinder must be maintained.
      7.1.9.1. If the primary or spare key is broken and all pieces of the broken key are
      recovered, destroy the broken key pieces. (T-1). Annotate the AF IMT 2427, Lock and
      Key Control Register, indicating that two keys remain for that lock. (T-2). If all pieces
      cannot be recovered, remove remaining keys and lock from service and dispose of
      accordingly. (T-1). Broken or damaged control keys require replacement of the lock.
          7.1.9.1.1. Unserviceable high-security padlocks, keys, and cylinders will be
          controlled until properly destroyed or sent to the DoD Lock Program for disposal. (T-
          1). Contact the DoD Lock and Hasp Program Technical Support Hotline ((800)290-
          7607, (805) 982-1212, DSN 551-1212 or send an email to NFESCLock-

          _schema=PORTAL.
      7.1.9.2. Padlocks will be physically retained or locked to the hasp when the entry gate,
      munitions structure, or key container is open to prevent theft or substitution of the key,
      cylinder, or lock. (T-1).
   7.1.10. Internal Locking Devices (ILD). Units having the ILD on igloo doors only receive
   two keys. One key will be designated as the primary key while the other will be designated
   as the spare key. If either one of these keys is broken or damaged beyond use, remove the
   cylinder and replace with another operating cylinder that has two keys associated with it. (T-
   1). Annotate changes on an AF IMT 2427, Lock and Key Control Register. (T-2).
      7.1.10.1. Appointed Key and Lock custodians for ILDs will have a letter on file with the
      Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme, California, 93043-4370
      (DSN 551-1212), designating them as having ordering authority for keys and cylinders

   7.6.1. To provide local assistance, Munitions/Maintenance Supervision may approve
   personnel outside the munitions activity to receive keys and authorize placement on the Entry
   Authorization List. Munitions/Maintenance Supervision must verify proper security
   clearance prior to approval. (T-1). This authority applies to exceptional and emergency
   conditions and shall not be used for routine activities or convenience. (T-1). Exceptional
   circumstances include:
      7.6.1.1. Emergency EOD or Security Forces response when support of normal munitions
      stand-by personnel is not a viable option.
      7.6.1.2. Units operating from/supporting geographically separated installations may
      release the primary (daily-use) keys outside the Munitions Activity. The application of
      geographical separation to the operating/support environment is at the discretion of
      Munitions/Maintenance Supervision. For example, geographical separation may be
      based on a significant distance (e.g., different region, country) or may be a short distance
      (e.g., local barriers impeding effective access/movement such as a highway, flightline,
      other obstacle).
 48                                                               AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


   7.6.2. Keys to munitions structures located within the MSA are not generally released to
   organizations outside the munitions activity.                 Under unique circumstances,
   Munitions/Maintenance Supervision may authorize release of conventional facility keys in
   writing. This authorization is granted only after local procedures for control of keys and
   access to facility is developed, agreed to by all units involved, and approved. Before
   implementing these options, ensure consideration is given to munitions storage area and
   facility access, security and alarms, required notifications, 24-hour coverage, and explosives
   safety criteria. (T-0).
   7.6.3. The commander of the organization owning and controlling access to facilities must
   approve requests designating personnel outside the organization as key issuing authorities,
   key control custodians, and key issue/receipt authorities, as appropriate, for the designated
   facilities. (T-0).
   7.6.4. Personnel appointed to maintain primary/spare keys to munitions facilities outside the
   Munitions Activity must comply with all provisions of DoDM 5100.76, Physical Security of
   Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives, and AFI 31-101, Integrated
   Defense (FOUO), for key and lock control and documentation to include key issue logs, key
   and lock control registers, and key and lock audit records. (T-0). When complete, submit
   these documents to the host Munitions Control activity for filing and disposition. (T-0).
7.7. Conventional Automated Key and Lock Control Procedures. (T-0).
   7.7.1. Automated records documentation requirements. Air Force units may use an Air
   Force approved and accredited information system that requires individual password access
   (by the key issuing authority and key receipt individual) and creates a historical record of the
   key transaction.
   7.7.2. The automated key and lock control system must be able to record, display, and
   retrieve key transaction records including the rank, name (or password) that identifies the
   individuals involved in the transaction, date and time of the transaction, and key or facility
   number.
   7.7.3. There is no requirement for printed automated key control records. However, an
   automated record must be retrievable on-demand and display all required information for the
   same time period that printed copies are required to be maintained on file.
   7.7.4. If an electronic/digital key control system is used, the UserID/Password combination
   or CAC/PIN satisfies signature requirements for access identification and authorization
   controls.
7.8. Weapons Storage and Security System (WS3). For USAFE units maintaining WS3, see
USAFEI 33-201, Operational Doctrine for Safeguarding and Control of Weapons Storage and
Security System, for code module access procedures.

                                          Chapter 8

                               QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA)

8.1. General Purpose and Scope.
   8.1.1. Purpose. The MSEP is designed to provide logistics managers and wing leadership
   with a method to evaluate compliance with Air Force, MAJCOM, and local directives and
   policies. It provides an objective sampling of both the quality of equipment and the
   proficiency of personnel. Quality assurance personnel are not normally an extension of the
   work force and will not be tasked to support unit operations without Group Commander
   approval. QA is responsible to the Group Commander and serves as the primary technical
   advisory agency, assisting supervision at all levels to resolve quality problems and manage
   the logistics effort. For units not aligned under a maintenance group or geographically
   separated from a parent group, quality assurance inspectors may be directly responsible to the
   assigned Squadron Commander. Munitions equipment condition and personnel proficiency
   are validated through the MSEP and shall be recorded using a MAJCOM-approved quality
   assurance database. Conventional Munitions and Armament Systems will follow the MSEP
   in AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
   8.1.2. Scope.
      8.1.2.1. Nuclear, ICBM, and Cruise Missile units. QA will assess following areas:
      management and administration; quality assurance; stockpile and facilities; key and lock
      management; tools, test, tiedown and handling equipment; technical operations;
      Munitions Control; MMOC; training; and supply support. (T-2). MAJCOMs may dictate
      additional requirements.
          8.1.2.1.1. If conventional munitions units or armament systems sections support
          nuclear operations, personnel will meet applicable requirements for Nuclear Certified
          Equipment within this chapter. (T-1).
          8.1.2.1.2. If 2W0 or 2W1 personnel are certified to perform nuclear operations other
          than flight line loading (e.g., limited general maintenance, transfer, transport), they
          will comply with personnel evaluation requirements for nuclear certified tasks in this
          chapter.
      8.1.2.2. Unit-level MSEP program is not applicable to contract logistics activities unless
      required by the Statement of Work, Performance of Work Statement, or contract. Wings
      ensure contracted maintenance programs are in compliance with applicable directives
      through evaluations performed by the Contracting Officer Representative using the
      criteria outlined in the Performance Requirement Summary, Performance Measurement
      Analysis Package, Contract Performance Work Statement, or Quality Assurance
      Surviellance Plan as applicable. (T-1).
      8.1.2.3. The use of the word “annual” or “annually” within this chapter means not to
      exceed a 12-month interval. The term “biennial” or “biennially” within this chapter
      means not to exceed a 24-month interval.
 52                                                               AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


       8.1.2.4. The use of the word “semi-annual” or “semi-annually” within this chapter means
       not to exceed a 6-month interval.
       8.1.2.5. The use of the word “quarter” or “quarterly” within this chapter means not to
       exceed a 3-month interval.
       8.1.2.6. The use of the terms “Pass/Fail” and “Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory” may be used
       interchangeably if the MAJCOM approved QA database does not support both
       rating/grading systems.
8.2. Responsibilities.

   8.3.6. Establish appropriate Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL) for tasks, processes,
   programs, and inspections identified in the unit plan. An AQL denotes the maximum
   allowable number of minor findings that a task, program, process, or product may receive
   and be rated “Pass/Satisfactory.” The AQL is derived from QA performance-based data.
   Units must develop minimum AQLs for inspections and evaluations not standardized in Air
   Force or MAJCOM publications and supplements. AQLs will be reviewed at frequencies
   determined by the Group Commander.
       8.3.6.1. AQLs for selective nuclear weapons maintenance, cruise missile maintenance,
       weapons mate/demate, nuclear weapons handling, and final assembly tests defined in
       Table 8.4 are maximums and shall not be adjusted higher than indicated. AQLs are
       defined for each task, program, process, and product identified in the RIL.
       8.3.6.2. A nuclear weapon maintenance, weapon mate/demate, or final assembly test task
       is defined as a task performed on a single weapon or single piece of launch gear (e.g.,
       launcher, pylon). A weapon handling task is defined as the handling of a single weapon,
       single double-stack, or a group of weapons on a single piece of launch gear.
       Maintenance or handling operations on multiple weapons and/or launch gear will be
       evaluated as separate tasks but may be captured on one report provided the AQL per task
       is not exceeded.
   8.3.6.3. AQL will be published in the unit’s MSEP.
8.4. Evaluations and Inspections. (T-1 unless otherwise specified).
   8.4.1. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is an over-the-shoulder evaluation of a
   maintenance action, inspection, training session, or QA evaluation. Individuals performing,
   supervising, training, or evaluating maintenance tasks are subject to a PE. Ancillary
   discrepancies found during PEs, such as an improperly etched tool, shall not be assessed
   against the evaluation unless it directly contributes to improper task completion (e.g.,
   overdue torque wrench utilized to attach hardware). Ancillary discrepancies noted during the
   evaluation will be assessed in a separate Special Inspection on the affected item or program.
       8.4.1.1. Personnel Proficiency Evaluation (PPE). This is a QA over-the-shoulder
       evaluation of a technician or supervisor performing a technical task.
       8.4.1.2. Trainer Proficiency Evaluation (TPE). The TPE is an over-the shoulder
       evaluation of a trainer conducting qualification, certification, and recurring training.
       TPEs are used to verify technical accuracy and completeness of training provided, not the
       proficiency of the trainees themselves. A trainer who fails or is overdue their semi-
       annual EPE will be restricted from performing unsupervised training.
AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014                                                                     59


     8.4.1.3. Evaluator Proficiency Evaluation (EPE). The QA OIC/SUPT or Chief Inspector
     knowledgeable of applicable task requirements will perform EPEs on QA inspectors per
     Table 8.5. Each QA inspector must pass the EPEs prior to performing unsupervised
     evaluations and inspections. QA inspectors who fail or are overdue their semi-annual
     EPE will be restricted from performing evaluations and inspections unsupervised. EPEs
     will be tracked in the MIS or MAJCOM-approved QA database. QA inspectors who are
     also nuclear weapons certifying officials must also meet AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons
     Maintenance Procedures, requirements.
        8.4.1.3.1. For units with a currently assigned QA OIC/SUPT and Chief Inspector not
        possessing the requisite AFSC, the QA OIC/SUPT or Chief Inspector qualified on
        QA requirements may conduct the EPE. A 7-skill level technician qualified on the
        applicable task being inspected, and QA evaluations where possible, may assist and
        serve as technical advisor.
     8.4.1.4. Personnel Evaluation Guidelines:
        8.4.1.4.1. Observe a variety of tasks, different equipment, and different maintenance
        actions for each technician.
        8.4.1.4.2. Ensure evaluations cover all weapon systems in which a technician is
        qualified and/or certified in accordance with Table 8.5.
        8.4.1.4.3. Use no-notice evaluations whenever possible.
        8.4.1.4.4. PEs will only be accomplished while observing actual task. Evaluators
        will not be part of the task being performed; however, QA may be part of the Two-
        Person concept team when required. Under normal circumstances, do not consider
        the evaluator as the second person to satisfy Two-Person Concept or buddy care
        requirements.
        8.4.1.4.5. QA may perform evaluations on personnel utilizing training weapons and
        in training facilities.
        8.4.1.4.6. A nuclear certification is considered a normal PE with regards to all
        evaluation rules provided in this instruction. EXCEPTION: Certifications will not be
        counted against QA’s required PE totals in the MSEP and failed/no-go certifications
        are not subject to Group Unsatisfactory Boards.
        8.4.1.4.7. Verify the technician, instructor, or evaluator is qualified to perform,
        instruct, or evaluate the maintenance task. If not completed prior to the evaluation,
        verification must be completed before the grade is rendered.
        8.4.1.4.8. Whenever possible, evaluators should have their own copy of T.O.s
        available for the task being evaluated.
        8.4.1.4.9. Evaluators must detect, intervene, and stop a task if conditions exist that
        would jeopardize personnel or weapon safety, security, weapon system reliability,
        cause equipment damage, or after determining individuals under evaluation cannot
        correctly or safely perform a task without excessive outside intervention or assistance.
        The evaluator may only stop the task after all reasonable opportunities by those under
        evaluation to detect or correct a deficient condition have passed. If a task is stopped,
        the QA evaluator(s) will:

        8.4.1.4.9.1. Notify the bay chief or critical task supervisor (as applicable) and the
        Section NCOIC.
        8.4.1.4.9.2. In conjunction with the technician's Section NCOIC, assess whether
        the unit will:
            8.4.1.4.9.2.1. Replace the technician(s) on the spot.
            8.4.1.4.9.2.2. Supervise the technician(s) finishing the task. The supervisor
            must be qualified on the task. This does not apply if individual is decertified
            in accordance with AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures.
            8.4.1.4.9.2.3. Terminate the task.
     8.4.1.4.10. Evaluators may ask questions to determine the individual’s knowledge of
     the task being performed. Questions of this type will be deferred to the end of the
     operation. .
     8.4.1.4.11. Individuals may refer to technical guidance or use their normal
     supervisory chain of command when answering questions.
     8.4.1.4.12. Evaluators will brief all personnel to be evaluated prior to the start of the
     evaluation. If a task is already in progress, notify the individuals being evaluated that
     they are under evaluation and brief them as soon as possible. The brief must advise
     the technicians of the following:
        8.4.1.4.12.1. All personnel involved in the operation are subject to evaluation.
        8.4.1.4.12.2. Evaluated personnel may take breaks during the evaluation.
        8.4.1.4.12.3. Evaluated personnel must notify the evaluator of any steps
        previously complied with, simulations, and/or deviations affecting the evaluation.
        8.4.1.4.12.4. The technician may ask for technical help from personnel and
        agencies normally available in the conduct of day-to-day maintenance.
        8.4.1.4.12.5. The evaluator will stop the task per paragraph 8.4.1.4.9, if
        required.
        8.4.1.4.12.6. If conducting a TPE, the evaluator must also advise the
        instructor/trainer of the following additional items:
            8.4.1.4.12.6.1. The instructor must prevent and immediately correct any of
            the following: weapons system safety rule violations, code compromises,
            Two-Person Concept violations, significant security violations, or safety
            errors which could result in personnel injury and/or equipment damage.
            8.4.1.4.12.6.2. The instructor must correct all noted errors before completing
            the training session. The training session is considered complete when the
            instructor critiques the student’s performance.
            8.4.1.4.12.6.3. Evaluators will consider the instructor’s familiarity with
            procedures, adherence to T.O.s and lesson plans, verbal skills, ability to
            precisely describe procedures, and control over trainees.
            8.4.1.4.12.6.4. Evaluators will not generate an evaluation report on the
AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014                                                                        61


                 trainees.
          8.4.1.4.13. Determine a PE grade for each individual per paragraph 8.5.2.2.
          8.4.1.4.14. Technicians and instructors will be critiqued as soon as practical after an
          evaluation. The evaluator must cover the following:
             8.4.1.4.14.1. Explain each error, who it was charged to, error category, and grade
             for each individual.
             8.4.1.4.14.2. Explain the mission impact of each error.
             8.4.1.4.14.3. Identify the substandard performance that contributed to any
             Unsatisfactory rating.
             8.4.1.4.14.4. Review the technician, instructor, or evaluator strengths and
             weaknesses.
          8.4.1.4.15. Render QA reports IAW paragraph 8.6.
   8.4.2. Inspections. QA conducts inspections to provide managers an appraisal of mission
   capability and management effectiveness. The focus is on efficiency, procedural compliance,
   and adequacy of directives.
      8.4.2.1. Quality Verification Inspections (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
      condition, or a process, following an inspection, servicing or repair action, or verification
      that a technician or supervisor properly completed an inspection or repair action. QVIs
      shall not be conducted after equipment operation when such operation could invalidate
      indications of proper job accomplishment. Limit QVIs to the same inspection card deck
      or T.O.s required for the job. The QVI report will reflect all discrepancies and identify
      the individuals who performed the maintenance; however, grades for individuals will not
      be given.
      8.4.2.2. Management Inspection (MI). MIs are utilized to follow-up on trends, conduct
      investigations or conduct research to get to the root cause of problems. Commanders or
      superintendents may request MIs. Report MI results to the requester, and allow them
      latitude to explore options prior to implementing corrective actions. MIs may be non-
      rated and may be counted in QA trends.
      8.4.2.3. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs or MIs. SIs
      may include, but are not limited to, equipment, equipment forms, document files, tool
      program, T.O. files, vehicle inspections, facility inspections, housekeeping, and safety
      programs. SIs may be condition, procedural, or compliance oriented. SIs may be non-
      rated; however, if rated, rate as pass or fail.
      8.4.2.4. Activity Inspection (AI) Program. MAJCOMs may establish an AI program. AIs
      are management and compliance oriented inspections applied group-wide. AIs may be
      utilized to identify maintenance discipline, housekeeping, and technical discrepancies.
8.5. QA Grading and Rating Standards. (T-1).
   8.5.1. Evaluation and Inspection Criteria. Units will use Air Force checklists, work cards,
   and instructions approved for use at the unit level as the inspection standard. MAJCOMs or
 62                                                                AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


   units may supplement with additional local checklists. For evaluations of technician
   proficiency and inspection of equipment condition, the applicable T.O. is the standard.
   8.5.2. Categorizing Errors, Grading, and Rating Inspections/Evaluations. Discrepancies
   discovered during inspections and errors committed during evaluations will be categorized as
   either major or minor. The performance of personnel during evaluations will be graded as
   “Satisfactory” or “Unsatisfactory.” Grades above “Satisfactory” may be used if included in
   the unit plan. Overall inspections will be rated as either “Pass” or “Fail.”
       8.5.2.1. Definitions of Major and Minor.
           8.5.2.1.1. A major finding is defined as a condition that could endanger personnel,
           jeopardize equipment or system reliability, affect safety of flight, compromise
           security standards, violate weapon system safety rules, warrant discontinuing the
           process or equipment operation, or condemn serviceable equipment. Any major
           discrepancy will result in an automatic inspection or evaluation failure. Specific
           examples of major findings include, but are not limited to, those items identified in
           Table 8.1.
           8.5.2.1.2. A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires
           repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, affect safety of flight,
           jeopardize equipment reliability, or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment
           operation. Specific examples of minor findings include, but are not limited to, those
           items identified in Table 8.1.

Table 8.1. Major and Minor Finding Examples.
                                       MAJOR FINDING:
1. Violation of Weapon System Safety Rules. An error that would violate weapon system safety
rules (Actual or Possible).
2. Significant Safety Error. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, could result in personnel

NOTES:
  1. For the purposes of this table, a nuclear maintenance and inspection activity is any
     element or flight level organization that performs FDE activities, nuclear weapons
     maintenance, weapons mate/demate, weapons handling or final assembly tests.
  2. Required percentages apply to forecasted maintenance only, not to unscheduled
     operations performed as a result of failed launcher/pylon test, MGS failure, etc. A
     sampling of unscheduled operations should be evaluated as the opportunity arises.
  3. This includes ALT 900 series maintenance.
  4. QA must observe the first weapon retrofit, alteration or modification (does not
     apply to ALT 900 series.)
  5. This applies to both the shipping and receiving units in the FDE process. QA shall
     watch all applicable operations in the RS build-up or tear-down process for systems
     selected for FDE, including the inspection of RS/RV components.
    70                                                             AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


         Assemble/disassemble operations may be counted as personnel evaluations,
         including the packaging/unpackaging of components. After the fact inspections
         may be used by the evaluator to fulfill the 100% requirement. Appropriate AQL
         levels will be applied to each applicable operation performed as part of the FDE.
      6. In addition to Transfer, Transport and items identified under General Tasks, the
         following tasks apply to ICBM maintenance technicians only: Mate/Demate RS
         to/from MGS and FDE.

                                           Chapter 9

                ACCESS, APPROVAL, AND AUTHORITY LIST (AAAL)

9.1. General Guidance.
   9.1.1. The AAAL is used to identify personnel authorized to accept custodial responsibility
   and perform specific actions associated with a WSA or the WS3. The MASO uses the
   AAAL to control access to nuclear weapons. The unit commander certifies the AAAL, and
   Security/Custodial Forces authenticates the AAAL. AAAL management procedures in this
   chapter apply to all nuclear capable units. USAFE units will also comply with additional
   requirements in ACO 80-6/ECI 6801.01, Nuclear Surety Management for the WS3. (T-0).
   9.1.2. Units using the Advanced Entry Control System (AECS) for authorizing entry into
   exclusion areas will have the MASO approve access by signing the appropriate section of the
   AF Form 2586, Unescorted Entry Authorization Certificate. (T-1). In the event of AECS
   failure, the unit will create a two-person access list using applicable requirements in
   paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 to ensure continued operations. (T-1).
9.2. AAAL Management.
   9.2.1. AAALs identify, as a minimum, personnel authorized to:
      9.2.1.1. Issue and receive keys/code modules to weapons maintenance and storage
      structures/vaults. Personnel authorized to issue keys/code modules may also be
      authorized to receive keys/code modules.
      9.2.1.2. Open and secure weapons maintenance and storage structures or lock or unlock
      weapon storage vaults (as applicable).
      9.2.1.3. Open and close containers at Entry Control Points and secure keys to
      maintenance facilities or assembly, surveillance, and inspection type facilities.
      9.2.1.4. Perform notifications to Security/Custodial Forces for personnel accessing
      weapons maintenance and storage structures, weapons storage vaults, or escorting
      personnel into the WSA.
      9.2.1.5. WS3 AAAL specific:
          9.2.1.5.1. Issue and receive alternate controller.
          9.2.1.5.2. Issue and receive Universal Release Code Cards.
          9.2.1.5.3. Perform WS3 maintenance.
   9.2.2. AAAL will include full name, codes authorized, rank (enlisted, officer, civilian, or
   contractor), last six of Social Security Number (SSN) or entire control number (CN) from
   government issued identification, security clearance, and PRP status (None, Interim, or
   Certified). (T-1).
   9.2.3. Pen and ink additions without authenticated Change Letter are prohibited. (T-1).
   9.2.4. Quantities of AAALs will be determined locally. (T-1).
 74                                                               AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


   9.2.5. Original signatures are required on all copies of the AAAL. (T-1). If the AAAL pages
   are bound together in a single computer-run product, authenticate on the first or last page
   only, and indicate the number of pages. If the pages are separated each page must be
   authenticated.
   9.2.6. Code descriptions will be clear, concise, and not repetitive. (T-1).
   9.2.7. AAALs will be published when determined by Operations Officer/Maintenance
   Superintendent or AAAL OPR. (T-1).
9.3. Change Letters. Change Letters will be used for interim changes to the AAAL (see Figure
9.3). (T-1). A single letter may be used to add and delete individuals. Change Letters to an
AAAL will be consecutively numbered, beginning with number one, and will identify the date of
the AAAL it changes. (T-1). With each revision of the AAAL, the Change Letter sequence
number starts with one. These letters will be authorized, certified, authenticated (except for
deletion letters), and distributed in the same manner as the AAAL. (T-1) Entries will be pen and
inked (handwritten or typed) on referenced AAAL with Change Letters filed with or attached.
(T-1).
   9.3.1. Deletions. In cases where individuals or information must be deleted, Operations
   Officer/Maintenance Superintendent or designated representative will immediately notify all
   agencies possessing AAALs by telephone and document time, date, and agency called. (T-1).
   Each workcenter will place a single line through the entry on the AAAL upon receipt of the
   telephone notification. (T-1).
       9.3.1.1. As soon as practical, the AAAL OPR will produce a Change Letter. (T-1).
       Letter will include member’s full name, last six of SSN or entire CN from government
       issued identification, and change requested. Upon receipt of the Change Letter, annotate
       the deleted entry with the Change Letter sequence number. (T-1).
       9.3.1.2. Suspension from PRP duties alone does not require removal from the AAAL if
       other means of removing access to nuclear weapons are available (e.g., confiscation of
       line badge). An individual who has been PRP decertified (temporary or permanent) must
       be removed from the AAAL. (T-1).
   9.3.2. Additions.      In cases where information is to be added, Operations
   Officer/Maintenance Superintendent or AAAL OPR will initiate a Change Letter. (T-1).
   Letter will include all information listed in paragraph 9.2.2 and be processed using same
   procedures as processing AAAL. (T-1). Upon receipt of the authenticated Change Letter, the
   entry will be pen and inked on the AAAL and annotated with the Change Letter sequence
   number. (T-1).
9.4. Responsibilities.
   9.4.1. Squadron Commander will:
       9.4.1.1. Review and sign (certify) AAALs and addition letters. (T-1).
       9.4.1.2. Ensure authorized individuals have a security clearance equal to or greater than
       the items being secured by the keys and locks or code modules. (T-1).
AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014                                                                    75


     9.4.1.3. Ensure authorized individuals have appropriate PRP certifications.            An
     individual suspended from PRP duties is still considered interim certified/certified under
     the PRP. (T-1).
  9.4.2. Operations Officer/Maintenance Superintendent will:
     9.4.2.1. Designate responsible OPR to maintain, update, review, and distribute AAAL
     and Change Letters and determines contents of legend (codes and description) for the
     AAAL. (T-1).
     9.4.2.2. Review and sign (certify) deletion letters. (T-1).
  9.4.3. The MASO will review and sign (authorize) AAALs and addition letters. (T-1). If the
  MASO is unavailable, appointed MASO delegate or the MASO’s appointing authority will
  sign the AAAL. (T-1).
  9.4.4. Security/Custodial Forces will sign (authenticate) AAALs and Change Letters with
  additions in accordance with standard Security/Custodial Force processing procedures for
  Entry Authorization Lists. (T-1).
  9.4.5. AAAL OPR will:

                       TOOL AND EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT

10.1. Tool and Equipment Management. The objectives of the tool and equipment
management program are to prevent damage to weapon systems and support equipment, reduce
costs through effective control and accountability, and ensure technicians are adequately
resourced. Conventional, Armament Systems, and other munitions activities supporting
flightline operations follow tool and equipment management policies and procedures in AFI 21-
101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. The tool management program
outlined in this instruction represent Air Force minimum program requirements. MAJCOMs may
dictate additional requirements.
10.2. Guidelines for Program Management. The Group Commander is the OPR for the
development of wing procedures for control and management of tools/equipment used on
weapon systems, and aerospace equipment maintenance industrial areas. (T-1). As a minimum,
guidance will address the following: (T-1).
   10.2.1. Standardized procedures for security, control, and accountability of tools and
   equipment. Chits are not authorized.
   10.2.2. Inventory requirements. As a minimum, conduct and document an annual inventory
   of all tools and equipment.
   10.2.3. Procedures for management of warrantied tools.
   10.2.4. Procedures for control and management of replacement, expendable, and consumable
   hand tools, hazardous materials, and other items contained in CTKs.
   10.2.5. Assignment of equipment identification designators (EID) for CTKs, non-Custodian
   Authorization/Custody Receipt Listed (CA/CRL) equipment, and assignment of CTK
   numbers for tools.
   10.2.6. Procedures for issue and control of personal protective equipment (e.g., ear
   protectors, reflective belts, headsets). Mark work-center assigned equipment that is issued to
   individuals.
   10.2.7. Procedures to limit numbers of personnel authorized to procure tools.
   10.2.8. Procedures for control of locally manufactured or developed tools and equipment.
   10.2.9. Procedures for depot teams, factory representatives, and contract field teams (CFT)
   when working on equipment within the unit.
   10.2.10. Procedures and responsibilities when two or more workcenters operate out of the
   same tool room or support section, or when workcenters elect to dispatch tools and
   equipment to the field.
   10.2.11. Procedures directing a second party or on-duty supervisor inspection of the tool kit
   at turn-in. The same individual that signs out a CTK cannot sign it back in.
   10.2.12. Procedures for controlled access to tool rooms.
 80                                                              AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


   10.2.13. Procedures for transfer of tools and equipment at the job site (on-site transfers). As
   a minimum, losing and gaining team shall accomplish a complete inventory prior to transfer
   and document the transfer on an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, or equivalent. (T-
   3).
10.3. General Program Guidelines.
   10.3.1. The Flight Commander/Chief will
   10.3.1.1. Designate CTK Custodians in writing. (T-1). CTK custodians are responsible for
   tool, HAZMAT, and consumable asset accountability and control. A separate person may be
   designated as the HAZMAT monitor.
      10.3.1.2. Review and sign the Master Inventory List (MIL). (T-1).
   10.3.2. Workcenter supervisors determine type, size, and number of CTKs required for their
   workcenters and will maintain a complete listing of all CTKs and tools/equipment issued as a
   single item. (T-1).
   10.3.3. Design CTKs to provide a quick inventory and accountability of tools. Clearly mark
   all CTKs and tools with the EID. (T-1) Inspect all tools at least annually or when the
   CTK/TK custodian changes for serviceability IAW T.O. 32-1-101, Use and Care of Hand
   Tools and Measuring Tools. (T-1).
      10.3.3.1. CTK contents will be standardized to the maximum extent possible within
      functional elements of a squadron that have similar missions. (T-1).
      10.3.3.2. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK has an
      assigned location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout,
      or silhouette. (T-1). No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette
      except for tools issued in sets such as drill bits, Allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items
      (e.g., gloves, booties).
   10.3.4. A MIL is required for each tool kit, series of identical kits, and equipment and will
   be filed by the CTK custodian in the master MIL file. (T-1). The MIL remains valid until
   contents change and do not require replacement solely to update signature.
      10.3.4.1. A copy of the MIL will be kept in the tool and equipment storage facility at all
      times. (T-1). For dispatchable CTKs, a copy of the MIL must be kept with the dispatched
      CTK at all times. (T-1).
      10.3.4.2. If identification tags or dust caps are attached to tools or equipment, they will
      be secured in a manner that will preclude any possibility of foreign object damage. (T-1).
      Locks(s), key(s), and tie down strap(s), if not permanently attached, will be marked with
      the appropriate CTK number. (T-1).
      10.3.4.3. Consumables may be placed in CTKs provided they are identified on the MIL
      as consumables. Examples of consumables include safety wire, adhesive, wire bundle
      lacing, solder, etc. Do not include common hardware items such as bolts, nuts, or screws
      unless they are required as tools or part of equipment required for use in missile field. (T-
      1).
      10.3.4.4. Document removed or broken tools and equipment on all copies of the MIL
      and in MIS. The EID will be removed from any broken or removed item. (T-1).
AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014                                                                       81


   10.3.5. Equipment and accessories that do not present a foreign object damage potential and
   will not leave the workcenter, support section, or tool room, do not need to be included in a
   CTK. Designated storage locations, such as work area or station, must be established for
   such equipment. (T-1).
   10.3.6. Industrial shop machinery accessories and attachments dispatched to the field do not
   need to be controlled as tools. Designate and label storage locations for accountability. (T-
   1).
   10.3.7. Discard removable pocket clips from tools prior to placement in tool kits. (T-1). Do
   not damage tools for sole purpose of removing clips, rubber switch guards, etc.
   10.3.8. Personal tools are not authorized for use in any maintenance area (e.g., flashlights,
   multi-use tools, knives). (T-1).
   10.3.9. All items dispatchable to the missile field will conform to the requirements of T.O.
   21M-LGM30F-12, Minuteman Nuclear Surety Procedures, and AFMAN 91-201, Explosive
   Safety Standards, when used in explosive environments. (T-1).
10.4. Tool Accountability. Flight Commanders/Chiefs and workcenter supervisors, through
CTK custodians, are responsible for tool and equipment accountability and control. Members
are accountable for items until returned to the tool room and accountability returns back to CTK
custodian.
   10.4.1. Units must use an Air Force approved MIS per provisions in AFI 21-101, Aircraft
   and Equipment Maintenance Management, for accountability and control of tools and
   equipment. (T-1). Use system to:
       10.4.1.1. Track issuance and receipt of all CTK assigned tools, equipment, tool kits,
       HAZMAT items, and T.O.s.
       10.4.1.2. Track authorizations and restrictions for special tools and equipment.
       10.4.1.3. Track required inspections.
       10.4.1.4. Track spare, damaged, and removed tools
       10.4.1.5. Develop and manage tool and equipment inventories.
       10.4.1.6. Use the AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, or MAJCOM approved form
       for accountability and control of CTKs, equipment, and tools during periods of MIS
       outage. (T-1). Usage is allowed until such time has occurred that the system is returned
       to operation and all tools signed out under the manual system have been signed-in.
   10.4.2. Account for all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment at the beginning and end of
   each shift. (T-1). Separate shift inventories must be documented by both outgoing and
   incoming personnel. (T-2). CTKs present during tool room shift inventories do not need to
   be opened for inventory.
       10.4.2.1. Perform a visual inventory of all CTKs, tools, and equipment when issued for
       use, at the completion of job or tasks, and when returned to the tool storage facility. (T-
       1)..
       10.4.2.2. Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all tools, non-CA/CRL equipment, and
       CTKs at least annually or at CTK custodian change. (T-1). Inventory should include
 82                                                             AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


      condition, identification markings, and MIL accuracy. Document and maintain the most
      current inventory documentation on file. (T-1).
   10.4.3. Inventory Procedures:
      10.4.3.1. Inspect and inventory all CTKs quarterly regardless of utilization levels and
      document inspectors name, rank, and the date accomplished in an AF approved MIS. (T-
      1).
      10.4.3.2. Account for consumables by quantity or unit of issue and replenish them as
      they are used. (T-1).
      10.4.3.3. Maintenance teams shall inventory CTKs, tools, and equipment prior to
      dispatch and prior to departing any job site. (T-1).
      10.4.3.4. Handle lost or missing items in accordance with paragraph 10.8.
      10.4.3.5. Tool room personnel shall visually inspect and document all CTKs for
      discrepancies and accountability at the beginning of each tool room shift. (T-1).
   10.4.4. Electronic Tools (E-Tools). E-Tools are common infrastructure, allow access to
   logistics information systems, update T.O.s, provide automated change requests, and
   integrate with other MIS. Workgroup managers shall monitor E-Tool configuration (e.g.,
   operating system, virus checkers) in accordance with applicable Air Force instructions. (T-1).
      10.4.4.1. E-Tools purchased and used for the purpose of viewing digital technical data
      and/or for maintenance documentation must be accounted as automated data processing
      equipment (ADPE) and tracked in an Air Force approved system. (T-1). This does not
      apply to E-Tools managed and accounted for by non-Air Force organizations (e.g.,
      DIAMONDS).
      10.4.4.2. Licenses, certification, maintenance, and security of E-Tools hardware and
      software must be in accordance with 33-series Air Force instructions. (T-1). Units must
      make maximum use of E-Tool warranties and ensure only serviceable E-Tools with
      charged batteries, up to date system software, and current technical data are available for
      checkout. (T-1).
      10.4.4.3. Per 33-series Air Force instructions, E-Tools are for official use and authorized
      purposes only. MAJCOMs will establish policy for use of E-Tools for purposes other
      than viewing digitized tech data and maintenance documentation. (T-1). Group
      Commanders will establish procedures to ensure sufficient E-Tool availability for T.O.
      viewing. (T-1).
      10.4.4.4. TODOs may not have a traditional role in managing tech data when
      management is accomplished by another agency (e.g., manufacturer).
      10.4.4.5. The Lead TODO(s) shall work with other TODOs, TODAs, and computer
      systems administrators to ensure E-Tools are configured with current software to support
      T.O. and maintenance documentation. (T-1).
10.5. Marking and Tool Identification.
   10.5.1. All units must mark their CTKs, tools, and equipment with the standard EID and
   utilize an Air Force approved MIS. (T-1).
AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014                                                                        83


     10.5.1.1. The EID will consist of nine characters of which the first four characters will
     be a unique World Wide Identification (WWID) code.
         10.5.1.1.1. The first two letters of the WWID in the EID are based on the
         Wing’s/unit’s personnel assignment system base code. If required, request additional
         codes from HQ SSG/ILM, Gunter Annex, Maxwell AFB, AL.
         10.5.1.1.2. The third and fourth characters designate the unit or shop by using unique
         characters. To ensure tool rooms have unique identifiers, units will ensure other units
         within the same wing do not duplicate the first 4 characters of the EID.
         10.5.1.1.3. The unit establishes the remaining five characters (any combination of
         numbers/letters) for CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment identification.
     10.5.1.2. Units must place the 9-digit EID on all CTKs, tools not assigned to a box, and
     dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size. (T-1).
         10.5.1.2.1. The 9-digit EID must be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs. (T-
         1). Tools located inside the tool box may be marked with less than 9-digits but must
         contain the 4-digit WWID and identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the
         CTK.
         10.5.1.2.2. Tools will be marked with the most current EID. (T-1). All previous
         CTK identifiers will either be removed or marked out. (T-1) Units may affix non-
         metallic bar code labels on tools to prevent re-etching as long as the use of the tool
         and its work environment does not normally result in excessive damage to the label
         making it unreadable.
         10.5.1.2.3. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above (e.g., drill
         bits, Allen wrench sets, apexes) are to be maintained in a container marked with EID.
         (T-1). The container is counted as one item.
         10.5.1.2.4. Etch fiberglass handled hammers on the metal head only in a non-impact
         area.
         10.5.1.2.5. Assembled items that are not intended to be disassembled during use
         require only one marking and entry in the MIL.
     10.5.1.3. Group Commanders may require use of the EID in addition to AFTO Form 65,
     TMDE Bar Code Label, Aluminum Stock, or AFTO Form 66, TMDE Bar Code Label,
     Polyester Stock, for TMDE routinely dispatched from a workcenter. Do not etch or
     stamp calibrated items in any manner that affects calibration or the ability to calibrate.
     (T-1).
  10.5.2. Permanently mark grease guns, dispensing cans, spray bottles, pump oilers, and
  similar containers with the type of grease, fluid, or other liquids and military specification of
  the contents. (T-1). If no specification exists, mark the item with the manufacturer’s name
  and part number or NSN from the applicable Material Safety Data Sheet or Safety Data
  Sheet. (T-1). Keep hoses and fittings separate for each type of grease. If containers hold
  substances classified as hazardous materials, label per AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication,
  and local directives. (T-1).
 84                                                             AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014


   10.5.3. Remove EIDs from unserviceable tools and tools removed from the CTK. (T-1).
   Update the MIL accordingly. Utilize procedures developed per paragraph 10.2.3 to tag and
   segregate unserviceable warranty tools per procedures developed in. (T-3). Do not remove
   EIDs from warranty tools where removal of EID would void the tool warranty. (T-1).
10.6. Locally Manufactured, Developed, or Modified Tools and Equipment.
   10.6.1. Group Commander (or designated representative) will approve all locally
   manufactured, developed, or modified tools and equipment. (T-1). If a T.O. or the MMHE
   focal point located in Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Armament Directorate
   contains the option of a locally designed tool, coordination and approval for use is not
   required as long as the tool remains approved in the source document.
   10.6.2. QA will:
       10.6.2.1. Coordinate on all requests for approval and use of locally designed tools or
       equipment. (T-1).
       10.6.2.2. Maintain records of all approved locally designed tools and equipment,
       including pictures or drawings and a description of the use for each item. (T-1). If
       pictures, drawings, or authorizations are not available, they will be re-accomplished. (T-
       1).
       10.6.2.3. Forward locally approved tools and equipment designs to appropriate system
       program office for possible inclusion into technical data or MMHE focal point website.
       (T-2).
   10.6.3. Workcenters will review approved items biennially for applicability and current
   configuration. (T-1).
10.7. Support Section/Tool Room and Security. Limit tool issue sections to no more than one
per workcenter. (T-3).      Establish procedures to ensure custodial control and ensure
accountability. (T-1). Process reports for CTKs, tools, and equipment that are lost, damaged, or
destroyed where negligence is suspected per AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force
Property. (T-3).
   10.7.1. The tool room must be capable of being locked and afford protective measures such
   as monitoring, 24-hour coverage, or controlled key access. (T-1). If CTKs are not capable of
   being secured in the tool room, the workcenter supervisor will design a process to prevent the
   unauthorized use or access to tools and equipment. (T-1).
       10.7.1.1. Tool kit locks will be used to provide a physical barrier to opening the
       container lid, drawer, or door and prevent the unauthorized removal of tools. (T-1).
       Locks are not required on tools and equipment that are stored within secured tool rooms
       or workcenters.
       10.7.1.2. Dispatchable tools, equipment, and CTKs will be secured when left unattended.
       (T-1).
       10.7.1.3. Modifications to tool containers are authorized unless modification voids the
       manufacturer’s warranty. (T-1).
       10.7.1.4. Individual tools will not be issued from dispatchable CTKs located within the
       tool room. (T-1).
AFI21-200 2 JANUARY 2014                                                                     85


10.8. Lost Item/Tool Procedures.
   10.8.1. If a tool or equipment item, or a portion of, is found broken or discovered missing,
   the following procedures apply:
      10.8.1.1. The person identifying the missing item will search the immediate work area.
      If dispatched away from a primary workcenter, the team will contact their appropriate
      control center for potential hardness degrade condition. (T-1).
      10.8.1.2. The responsible team shall initiate a Lost Tool Report and route per established
      guidance. (T-1).
      10.8.1.3. Complete initial search within 4 hours on base, or within 12 hours off base, of
      discovering the item missing. (T-1). Accomplish subsequent notifications within 8 hours
      on base, or within 24 hours off base. (T-1).
      10.8.1.4. Secondary search and notifications shall be completed within 24 hours of loss
      on base, or 72 hours off base, whenever possible. (T-3).
      10.8.1.5. Update tool accountability system and associated MILs to reflect the current
      inventory status of the CTK if the tool cannot be immediately found. (T-1). Replace item
      as soon as possible. (T-3).
   10.8.2. QA will maintain completed reports for trend analysis.
