2. AMC MICAP Instructions. AMC MICAP is established as a program within AMC to
ensure continuous sustainment of a high velocity global distribution system supporting all
Services’ movements and combatant commanders (CoCOM) requirements.
     2.1. Definition of an AMC MICAP. 18 AF TACC/XOCL directs AMC MICAP shipments
     providing expeditious logistics supporting recovery actions for AMC, AMC-gained, and
     operational support airlift (OSA) aircraft that are not mission capable (NMC) or have
     reported mission essential (ME) discrepancies away from home station. 18 AF TACC/XOCL
     also directs AMC MICAP shipments of recovery equipment returning to tasked unit upon
     completion of aircraft recovery. Shipments designated as AMC MICAP will be identified by
     the project code (PC), PACER HAUL, 196 and required delivery date (RDD) 999.
     2.2. Procedures for AMC MICAP. Requests to 18 AF TACC/XOCL are outlined in AMCI
     21-108, Logistics Support Operations.
     2.3. Identification of AMC MICAPs. A combination of RDD, PC, transportation priority
     (TP) and special handling forms identify the category of AMC MICAPs as follows.

     item nomenclature. This documentation is the primary identification used to establish the
     AMC MICAP shipment priority.
     2.3.2. MICAP transportation control number (TCN) assignment/identification must
     conform to DTR 4500.9-R, Part II (Cargo Movement), Appendices L and O. Re-use of
     TCNs (within 10 year specified limit) is disruptive of in-transit visibility (ITV) and
     historical tracking purposes. Permanent TCN stenciled to materiel-handling equipment is
     not authorized.
     2.3.3. 18 AF TACC/XOCL, 635 Supply Change Management Group (SCMG)/LGWQM
     (Quick Response Flight), the FSS network, and the CCCs (as outlined throughout this
     instruction) may use PC 196, PACER HAUL, to ship items identified in paragraph 2.3 in
     support of AMC/AMC-gained aircraft.
     2.3.4. After verification/coordination with 18 AF TACC/XOCL, theater AMOCCs
     supporting combatant theaters, such as Pacific Command (PACOM) and European
     Command (EUCOM), are authorized to use Project Code 196 PACER HAUL to facilitate
     recovery of any off station assigned/gained air mobility aircraft in active execution of
     transportation working capital fund (TWCF) and/or 18 AF TACC/XOCL -directed
     missions. 18 AF TACC/XOCL will coordinate recovery actions as outlined in paragraph
     2.4.1. below.
  2.4. Responsibilities and Authority. The organizations identified below have the following
  responsibilities to provide shipment support.
     2.4.1. 18 AF TACC/XOCL.
         2.4.1.1. Coordinate with supply, maintenance, CCC, 18AF TACC/XOGX Aerial Port
         Control Center (APCC), XOCG duty officer and TMF to expedite AMC MICAP
         shipments, using the mode of transportation permitting the earliest arrival of the item
         at the end destination by a traceable means. Worldwide Express (WWX) services will
         be utilized to the maximum extent when considering earliest arrivals.
         2.4.1.2. Monitor/flight-follow delivery and return air and surface transportation
         carrying AMC MICAPs to support recovery actions.
         2.4.1.3. Determine when to consolidate shipments of items for AMC MICAP
         requirements to the same location via the same mode of transportation.
         2.4.1.4. When 18 AF TACC/XOCL determines 50% or more allowable cabin load
         (ACL) is required for the support mission transporting MICAP, support mission
         should be in-system select (ISS), and mission identification changed to reflect the
         first three characters of the Atlantic and Pacific support mission.
     2.4.2. 18AF TACC/XOGX (APCC).
         2.4.2.1. Determine if the desired transportation source for AMC MICAPs have
         conflicting shipments (i.e., explosive) and approve the transportation support request
         through the Global Decision Support System (GDSS) unless there are conflicting
         shipments or reasons to otherwise prohibit moving the cargo on the desired
         transportation support mission. Once approved by the 18AF TACC/XOGX (APCC),
         the shipment is considered “space-blocked” on the sourced mission.

       2.4.2.2. Annotate “AMC MICAP” in addition to the item nomenclature and TCN on
       the GDSS automated Form 59 screen, Mission Itinerary, of the mission aircraft.
       2.4.2.3. Immediately notify 18 AF TACC/XOCL when AMC MICAP shipments
       arrive at the aerial port and when AMC MICAP shipments have not been delivered to
       the aerial port and the aircraft is within one hour of its scheduled departure.
    2.4.3. Air Terminal Activities.
       2.4.3.1. The squadron or port operations officer, AMC station manager, or their
       representative at each AMC base, detachment, contracted air terminal operation
       (CATO), or operating location will:
       2.4.3.2. Receive and handle all AMC MICAP shipments which originate, transit, or
       terminate at their station. Expedite these shipments to their next/final destination.
       2.4.3.3. Monitor (close watch) aerial port actions related to these shipments. Ensure
       shipments are available to be released to receiving activity upon aircraft arrival, and
       coordinate with receiving agency if shipments are not receipted for within 30 minutes
       of aircraft block in. Immediately notify 18 AF TACC/XOGX (APCC) when AMC
       MICAP shipments arrive at the aerial port and when AMC MICAP shipments have
       not been delivered to the aerial port and the aircraft is within one hour of its
       scheduled departure
       2.4.3.4. Designate the air freight or aircraft services function to expedite all AMC
       MICAP shipments through the air terminal. This function will be available 24 hours a
       day, 7 days a week (or as specified per contract for CATO), and will promptly
       complete special item tasks.
       2.4.3.5. Establish a special item holding area in the air terminal. Separate all AMC
       MICAP shipments from other cargo.
    2.4.4. TMFs on AMC Bases.

       Operations System (CMOS).
       2.4.4.2. Ensure all AMC MICAP shipments are promptly processed and delivered to
       the Special Handling Section for shipments moving milair. The LRS supply
       representative will fill in the TMO information on the AMC IMT 18, TACC/XOCL
       MICAP Shipment, and fax it to the 635 SCMG/LGWQM (Quick Response Flight).
       TMF will ensure all AMC MICAP shipments are released through the automated
       system using CMOS. This will generate ITV necessary to track the shipment through
       the system.
       2.4.4.3. Provide expedited processing and shipment (case by case basis if on
       weekend for commercial movement) for all AMC MICAP on a 24 hours a day, 7 days
       a week.
       2.4.4.4. Determine proper mode/method selection as requested by 18 AF
       TACC/XOCL for moving AMC MICAP shipments. Mode selected should provide
       the earliest arrival at the selected destination. When commercial means is determined,
       contact the commercial carrier for expedited service. Provide the commercial carrier
AMCI23-102 29 JUNE 2009                                                                            5

            2.4.5.2.1. Identify applicable cargo and desired transportation source to the 18AF
            TACC/XOGX (APCC) through the applicable GDSS transportation coordination
            request process.
            2.4.5.2.2. If applicable, direct their supporting supply and transportation services
            to annotate supply and transportation shipping documents with the following
            statement: “(AMC MICAP/ PACER HAUL).”
            2.4.5.2.3. Use      Global      Air    Transportation      Execution   System
            (GATES)/GDSS/global transportation network (GTN) cargo queries as much as
            possible to review shipment status; however, direct telecom with an AMC port to
            confirm cargo status is authorized.
            2.4.5.2.4. Flight-follow the sourced transportation mission and re-coordinate
            transportation requests with the 18AF TACC/XOGX (APCC) if the sourced
            mission no longer meets cargo movement requirements.

       DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document, AMC Form 281, AMC MICAP/VVIP
       Handling Label; AMC IMT 18, TACC/XOCL MICAP Shipment, etc., will show the
       aircraft type and tail number or the engine type and serial number and item nomenclature
       if applicable. FSS/MRSP re-supply and retrograde will not have aircraft types and tail
       numbers. This documentation is the primary identification used to identify the VVIPs
       shipment priority.
   3.4. Responsibilities and Authority. The organizations identified below have defined the
   following responsibilities to provide shipment support.
       3.4.1. Air Terminal Activities.
          3.4.1.1. The squadron or port operations officer, AMC station manager, or their
          representative at each AMC base, detachment, CATO, or operating location will:
          3.4.1.2. Receive and handle all VVIP shipments which originate, transit, or terminate
          at their station. Expedite these shipments to their next/final destination.
          3.4.1.3. Designate the air freight and aircraft services function to expedite all VVIP
          shipments through the air terminal.
          3.4.1.4. Establish a holding area in the air terminal. Separate all VVIP shipments
          from other cargo.
       3.4.2. Air Freight or Aircraft Services Functions.
          3.4.2.1. Receipt for and inspect all air shipments and documentation for proper
          packing, marking and labeling. Enter shipment data into GATES. Process all VVIP
8                                                               AMCI23-102 29 JUNE 2009


          shipments as they occur and maintain positive control of the items through the air
          terminal.
       3.4.3. TMFs on AMC Bases.
          3.4.3.1. Ensure all VVIP shipments are advanced into CMOS.
          3.4.3.2. As VVIP shipments are resupply and retrograde, the TMF will process these
          items on the first duty day when the shipment requirement becomes known.
          3.4.3.3. Determine proper mode/method selection as necessary for moving VVIP
          shipments. Mode/method selected should provide the earliest arrival at the selected
          destination by a traceable means. When commercial means is determined, provide
          estimated expedited service cost to 635 SCMG who will coordinate premium service
          movement with the requestor and get name for approval to charge expedited cost to
          line of accounting (LOA) or transportation account code (TAC). Contact the
          commercial carrier for expedited service. Provide the commercial carrier reference
          number or tracking number to the 635 SCMG/LGWQM (Quick Response Flight) for
          tracking purposes.
          3.4.3.4. At locations without fixed air terminal activities, TMF is responsible for
          accomplishing actions necessary for controlling, manifesting, aircrew briefing,
          aircraft loading and offloading, and hand off of VVIP shipments.
          3.4.3.5. Manually validate FSS retrograde and resupply shipments as TP 1 in CMOS.
          Due to the 777 RDD FSS resupply may default under program control to TP 2 in
          CMOS and must be manually validated as a TP 1.
       3.4.4. Airlift and Air Refueling squadrons.
          3.4.4.1. Brief all aircrews on this instruction to ensure proper handling of all VVIP
          cargo.
       3.4.5. Supply Support.
          3.4.5.1. Upon receiving notification from Air Freight, the supporting section
          responsible for intra-base material movement (i.e., Vehicle Operations, Pick-up and
          Delivery, etc.) will expedite all cargo movement to its required destination.
          3.4.5.2. Establish a 24-hour contact point for inbound shipments. Send personnel to
          pick up VVIP from TMF within 30 minutes after notification of the arrival of parts.
    4.1. Prescribed Forms. No forms prescribed.
    4.2. Adopted Forms. AMC Form 281, AMCMICAP/VVIP Special Handling
          AMC IMT 18, TACC/XOCL MICAP Shipment
          AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication
          DD Form 1348-1/1348-1A, DoD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document
