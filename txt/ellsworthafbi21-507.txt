     grounding points are kept free of sand and rock build-up that could hide potential FOD
     sources. Inspection and cleaning of grounding points will be accomplished during the daily
     FOD walk.

   respective areas a minimum of once per shift. These dock areas are subject to spot
   inspections by quality assurance, 28 BW/FOD Program Manager and 28 BW/SEF.
   5.6. All loose hardware will be contained in cloth screw bags and secured to the removed
   item to prevent them from becoming FOD hazards. In back-shop environments, small parts

   areas or after departing an unpaved surface. The tire rollover technique will be used. This
   method involves rolling the vehicle forward, not more than 2 feet, after the initial FOD check
   has been completed; allowing for inspection of tire underside. If the driver vacates the seat,
   the vehicle must be placed in park/neutral if manual and emergency brake set. A vehicle
   walk around will be accomplished, ensuring vehicle is free of foreign objects (i.e., rocks,
   water bottles, trash, etc.) to include wheel wells. All loose items or material that could fall
   from the vehicle will be secured.
   5.9. All vehicles operating on the airfield must have a locally manufactured FOD picker to
   remove FOD from vehicle tires. FOD pickers will be etched with the vehicle's ID number,
   attached to vehicle key ring, and annotate on the vehicle's AF Form 1800, Operatorâ€™s
   Inspection Guide and Trouble Report and AF Form 1807, Operatorâ€™s Inspection Guide and
   Trouble Report (Fuel Servicing Vehicles).
   5.10. All vehicles operating on the flight line during hours of darkness must have a
   serviceable flashlight to perform roll over FOD check. If assigned to vehicle, etch the
   flashlight with the vehicle's ID number and annotate on the vehicle's AF Form 1800/1807.
   5.11. With the exception of removable (e.g., slide on) pocket clips on tools, do not
   disassemble or damage tools for the purpose of removing clips, rubber switch guards, extra
   bulbs, etc. in accordance with AFI 21-101 para. 10.3.9.
   5.12. The 28 BW/FOD Manager, in coordination with Airfield Management (28 OG/OSAA)
   and 28 BW/SEF may suspend vehicle operator's flight line driving privileges for failing to
   perform FOD checks. Violators are subject to suspension of flight line driving privileges for
   a minimum of 15 days. Return of privileges will require written proof of retraining and a
   written statement from the individual along with the corrective course of action from the unit
   commander provided to the 28 BW/CV.
   5.13. All wing agencies dispatching by vehicle or other means to aircraft
   parking/runway/taxi areas and aircraft maintenance areas will ensure all tools, supplies,
   packing materials, etc. are accounted for prior to entering the controlled area and after reason
   for dispatching has been completed. If any items are missing, responsible person will notify
   the MOC and ensure the lost item checklist is initiated (ref AFI 21-1-1 para 3.2.2.).
6. Prior to any aircraft engine operation, personnel will ensure the following.
   6.1. Tools, equipment and hardware have been accounted for and secured.

     6.2. Engine run supervisor will ensure a FOD check to the front, sides and aft of the intakes
     is conducted.
     6.3. Areas where unpaved portions are directly behind the aircraft and areas where debris
     may be blown onto active taxiways/parking ramps will be inspected immediately after engine
     shutdown for FOD.
7. Incident and mishap investigation.
     7.1. Initial emergency response vehicles responding to an In-Flight Emergency/Ground
     Emergency will perform a vehicle FOD inspection as time permits. FOD checks will be
     accomplished at flight line ECP or standard FOD checkpoints. If a FOD check was not
     accomplished prior to entering the flight line it will be accomplished at the predetermined
     staging area. Once staged and time permitting, all vehicles will do a tire rollover check. If
     time does not permit (i.e., aircraft has already landed) a FOD check will then be
     accomplished after In Flight Emergency (IFE) terminates and before returning to station.
     The on-scene commander, AM Ops, 28 BW/SEF, or 28 BW/FOD Program Manager will
     ensure the airfield is inspected for FOD and sweepers called if necessary. If response
     vehicles did not perform a FOD inspection, prior to entering taxiway(s), they will inform
     Ellsworth tower of known or suspected FOD. Tower will ensure aircraft do not taxi over the
     affected areas.
     7.2. The 28 BW/FOD Program Manager will be notified of all Dropped Objects (DOP),
     FOD, Lost Tools and suspected/confirmed engine foreign object damage. The 28 BW/FOD
     manager will track, report and investigate all lost tools and dropped objects to completion
     and provide synopsis' of each event to the 28 BW/CV.
     7.3. The 28 BW/FOD Program Panager will provide monthly DOP updates to 28 BW/SEF.
