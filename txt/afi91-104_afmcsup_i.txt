SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Provides new/additional guidance regarding the definition and intent of the Air Force Tamper
Detection Program, further clarifies the intent for MAJCOMs to develop and distribute sealing
procedures and updates general information.
1. Requirements and Procedures.
     1.1. Tamper Control Program. The Two-Person Concept is central to nuclear surety tamper
     control measures in the Air Force. It is designed to make sure that a lone individual cannot
     perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure on a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon
     system, or certified critical component.
     1.2. Concept Enforcement. Each organization with a mission or function involving nuclear
     weapons, nuclear weapon systems, or certified critical components:
        1.2.1. Identifies no-lone zones (where at least two authorized persons must be present
        during any operation or task).
            1.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Supervisors must ensure individuals with a valid need to
            know are aware of the location of no-lone zones, location of critical components
            within the no-lone zone, emergency procedures, and methods for reporting violations
AFI91-104_AFMCSUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                              3


         and hazards. Before personnel enter a no-lone zone, brief the fact they are entering a
         no-lone zone and that Air Force Two-Person Concept (TPC) applies. Post
         signs/placards and perform team briefings using the procedures prescribed in AFI 21-
         204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures. Do not use external signs or
         devices that identify a building as a no-lone zone.
         1.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Local commanders are authorized to expand/reduce a no-
         lone zone as prescribed in DoD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108 Vol 2, Nuclear
         Weapon Security Manual. This authority should be used sparingly and only when
         absolutely required. The following areas are designated as no-lone zones:
             1.2.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The interior of nuclear weapon maintenance bays,
             igloos, cells, or other facilities containing nuclear weapons, warheads, or certified
             critical components.
             1.2.1.2.2. (Added-AFMC) The interior of any Payload Transporter or
             Safeguards Transport when it contains a nuclear weapon, warhead, or certified
             critical component.
             1.2.1.2.3. (Added-AFMC) At aircraft parking areas, including the interior of the
             aircraft, during the loading and unloading of nuclear weapons or warheads.
             1.2.1.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Any room, vault, storage container, or similar area
             where certified critical components are stored, repaired, or processed.
     1.2.2. Enforces the Two-Person Concept.
     1.2.3. Develops procedures to limit entry to authorized persons who meet the
     requirements of paragraph 1.3.
         1.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) After entry into a no-lone zone, the supervisor/team chief
         of each authorized team controls individual team members within the no-lone zone.
         1.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) After initial entry of an authorized TPC team into a no-
         lone zone, a single, authorized individual may enter provided:
             1.2.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Sole Vouching Authority (SVA) identifies
             individuals requesting entry, verifies authorization, and validates need to enter a
             no-lone zone. SVA duties may transfer between authorized individuals provided
             the two individuals jointly identify the change. The change in SVA will be
             announced to all individuals within the exclusion area and applicable entry
             controllers. SVAs will track and enforce personnel limits prescribed in AFMAN
             91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. Refer to DoD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-
             108 Vol 2, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, for additional entry and circulation
             control procedures.
             1.2.3.2.2. (Added-AFMC) The TPC team is knowledgeable of the task to be
             performed by the individual and is capable of monitoring performance, or the
             individual is to assist the team in the task they are performing.
  1.3. Team Requirements. (Refer to paragraph 1.6.1 for criteria on foreign nationals.) A Two-
  Person Concept team consists of at least two individuals who:
 4                                                AFI91-104_AFMCSUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


        1.3.1. Are certified under the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), as specified in DoDR
        5210.42_AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program.
        1.3.2. Know the nuclear surety requirements of the task they perform.
        1.3.3. Can promptly detect an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure.
        1.3.4. Have successfully completed nuclear surety training according to AFI 91-101.
        1.3.5. Are designated to perform the required task.
            1.3.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Designation to perform the task will be documented by a
            work order bearing the statement “TWO-PERSON CONCEPT APPLIES” as
            specified in AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management.
     1.4. Violations to Report. Declare a Two-Person Concept violation when a lone individual in
     a no-lone zone has the opportunity to tamper with or damage a nuclear weapon, nuclear
     weapon system, or certified critical component. Report any violations according to AFI 91-
     204, Safety Investigation and Reports.
NOTE: A momentary breach of the no-lone zone is not a violation if no individual had the
opportunity to perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure. In performing certain tasks,
team members may lose sight of each other or be far apart. One team member may be briefly out
of sight to perform a specific task if it is unsafe or physically impossible to maintain constant
observation.
        1.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Violations to Report.            Report TPC violations, including
        emergency response, through the command post to the commander. The commander will
        ensure violations are investigated promptly. A separate TPC team, other than the team
        involved in the violation, must ascertain if unauthorized acts were performed and
        reestablish the integrity of the weapon, warhead, or critical component. Accomplish
        applicable visual and functional checks for assets that have such procedures established.
        Refer to AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, for more
        information on the reporting format.
     1.5. Authorized Deviations. You may deviate from the Two-Person Concept when:
        1.5.1. The nuclear weapon system safety rules specifically authorize a deviation.
        1.5.2. An emergency presents an immediate threat to the safety of personnel or the
        security of a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component.
        War plan exercises are not considered emergencies.
            1.5.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Emergency deviations must be reported IAW paragraph
            1.4.
     1.6. Additional Conditions:
        1.6.1. Non-US Personnel. Per AFI 91-112, Safety Rules For US/NATO Strike Fighters,
        for US custodial units at allied installations, foreign nationals may be part of a Two-
        Person Concept, and host nations will implement equivalent personnel reliability
        programs.
AFI91-104_AFMCSUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                                   5


       1.6.2. Entry Control Personnel. The Two-Person Concept applies to individuals who
       control entry into a no-lone zone. Entry controllers may not form a Two-Person Concept
       team with personnel inside the no-lone zone.
       1.6.3. Couriers. Couriers ensure that the host installation meets Two-Person Concept
       requirements and no-lone zones are delineated around nuclear logistics aircraft.
       1.6.4. PRP Interim-Certified Personnel Restrictions. Two interim-certified individuals
       may not form a Two-Person Concept team. Also, an interim-certified member may not
       pilot a single-seat aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons.
       1.6.5. Nonqualified Personnel. An individual who does not qualify as a member of a
       Two-Person Concept team may enter a no-lone zone to perform a specific task only if
       escorted by a Two-Person Concept team. Escorts should be capable of detecting incorrect
       acts or unauthorized procedures. Escort procedures will be accomplished in accordance
       with the applicable directive(s) governing the nuclear weapon system or critical
       component defining the no-lone zone.
2. Tamper Detection Program.
   2.1. Sealing Requirements. Certain items must be sealed because either:
       2.1.1. Air Force nuclear weapon system safety rules require it, or,
       2.1.2. In the case of some certified critical components, seals protect their certification
       status while in storage or during transportation, as specified in AFI 91-105, Critical
       Components.
   2.2. Sealing Methods. Authorized sealing methods include:
       2.2.1. Safety Wiring and Sealing. Two types of seals are authorized using this method.
       The first method is seals composed of a malleable material are installed with a crimping
       device and controlled die in order to form an impressed distinctive mark or unique
       identifier. The second method is seals are applied with self-locking, non-reversible
       feature with a singularly unique serial number/alpha, color control system. Both types of
       seals are used with safety wire connected to certain switches, covers, handles, or levers.
       Breakage or alteration of the wire or seal provides evidence/detection of possible
       unauthorized acts, access or tampering. Use this method only in no-lone zones.
       2.2.2. Tamper Detection Indicators (TDI). In this method, an approved TDI is placed so
       it will indicate if someone has activated, or had access to the interior of a certified critical
       component. Once the TDI is installed, evidence of tampering is visible to the naked eye
       or can be detected through the use of special equipment.
           2.2.2.1. Tamper Detection Indicators and other authorized sealing methods proposed
           for use in nuclear weapons systems will be properly certified prior to use according to
           AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE) oversees the Air Force Nuclear Surety Tamper
   Control and Detection Programs. Acting for AF/SE, the Chief of the Weapons Safety
   Division manages the programs and certifies the design safety features of sealing methods
6                                                 AFI91-104_AFMCSUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011


    proposed for use in nuclear weapon systems according to AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear
    Safety Certification Program.
    3.2. Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group (NWSSG) recommends sealing requirements in
    operational nuclear weapon systems and proposes specific nuclear weapon system safety
    rules, if necessary. See AFI 91-102.
    3.3. Major Commands:
       3.3.1. Develop and publish Field publications, as needed, to implement and enforce the
       Air Force Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs throughout their

          in the Support Agreement.
          3.3.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Where AFMC directives or Support Agreements do not
          cover a particular local situation, units will develop local publications or checklists to
          ensure adequate control of nuclear weapons and certified critical components and
          application of the Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs.
       3.3.2. Develop and distribute procedures for sealing, where appropriate. At a minimum,
       the procedural publication will:
          3.3.2.1. State when and by whom seals can be applied and removed.
              3.3.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Apply and remove seals only when directed by
              applicable technical orders or instructions. Units will designate personnel
              authorized to apply and remove seals or Tamper Detection Indicators.
          3.3.2.2. Establish controls for the handling, receipt, storage, issue, inventory, and
          disposal of TDIs (including all residue), controlled dies and self-locking, non-
          reversible seals (example: roto-seals).
          3.3.2.3. Direct that TDIs, controlled dies and self-locking, non-reversible seals are
          stored and accounted for by individuals not responsible for their installation.
          3.3.2.4. Direct personnel to comply with the following steps for malleable seals only:
              3.3.2.4.1. Place a distinctive marking (determined locally) on malleable seals
              using a crimping device and die.
              3.3.2.4.2. Be sure to destroy any distinctive markings on malleable seals after you
              remove them.
          3.3.2.5. Direct personnel to verify seal integrity immediately following installation.
          Note: For aircraft only, verify seals before and after any task or operation performed
          in the immediate area of the seal. Do not verify aircraft seals before an operation or
          task during alert crew member exercises or actual responses, but do verify the seals
          after the exercise or alert.
          3.3.2.6. Require periodic inspections of seals on nuclear weapon-loaded aircraft,
          missile systems, and certified critical components in storage or transport.
AFI91-104_AFMCSUP_I 10 AUGUST 2011                                                            7
