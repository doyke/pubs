                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. Pilot in Command Authority. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is responsible for, and is
   the final authority as to, the operation of the aircraft.
   1.1.2. This instruction is a common source of flight directives that includes:
       1.1.2.1. Air Force-specific guidance, and
       1.1.2.2. Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) (formerly the Federal Aviation
       Regulations), the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), and
       1.1.2.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended
       Practices (SARPs).
   1.1.3. This AFI provides necessarily broad guidance and cannot address every conceivable
   circumstance. PICs will use their orders and best judgment to safely conduct the flight.
   1.1.4. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) or Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Applicability.
   With respect to compliance with flight rules, the USAF considers UAS/RPA to be no
   different than manned aircraft. Groups 4 and 5 RPA operations shall follow this AFI, while
   Groups 1-3 (―Small‖) UAS shall be governed by AFPD 11-5, Small Unmanned Aircraft
   Systems Rules, Procedures, and Service, and its derivative instructions.
1.2. Compliance. The PIC will ensure compliance with this AFI and the following:
   1.2.1. MAJCOM guidance and MDS-specific instructions, manuals and supplements.
   1.2.2. The specific rules of each individual nation as published in Flight Information
   Publications (FLIP) planning documents and the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). Theater
   commanders must ensure the contents of FLIP accurately indicate the rules of each nation
   within their area of responsibility that differ from this instruction.
   1.2.3. Procedures and special notices in FLIP, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), aircraft
   technical orders, Air Force directives, MAJCOM directives, and Air Traffic Control (ATC)
   instructions. (See Attachment 1 for related publications.)
   1.2.4. Combatant Commander's Special Instructions (SPINS), theater operational
   procedures, Air Tasking Orders, Airspace Control Orders, Air Operations Center
   instructions, and other associated directives IAW the Air Component Commander's
   objectives.
1.3. Operational Prerogative of Military Aircraft. In international airspace, when
operationally necessary, PIC's are authorized to conduct military flight operations with due
regard for the safety of navigation of civil traffic in accordance with (IAW) FLIP GP
―Operations and Firings over the High Seas.‖ Except for pre-planned missions, PIC's shall
consider such operations, in peacetime, as a flight rule deviation and will comply with the
reporting requirements in paragraph 1.7. MAJCOMs may authorize tactical operations for
training and to comply with paragraph 1.2.4.

1.4. MAJCOM Supplements and Command Relationships. The following restrictions apply
to MAJCOM supplements and MDS Specific, Volume 3 instructions subordinate to this AFI.
   1.4.1. MAJCOM guidance, in any form, unless specifically permitted, shall not be less
   restrictive than this instruction.
   1.4.2. Items in this AFI delineating MAJCOM responsibilities will be addressed in a
   MAJCOM supplement, the lead command-authored AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3, MDS
   Operations Procedures, or other published MAJCOM guidance.
   1.4.3. Lead and user MAJCOMs are not bound by, or authorized to operate under, the
   other’s waivers or exemptions.
   1.4.4. MAJCOM supplements to this instruction and MDS Specific, Volume 3 instructions
   must be coordinated through HQ AFFSA for USAF/A3O approval prior to publication IAW
   AFPD 11-2. Submit supplements for coordination to: HQ AFFSA/A3OF (AJW31AF),

   9637, DSN 339-9637, email: hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil.
   1.4.5. (Added-ACC) ACC units and units under ACC oversight will publish a local
   supplement to the AFI11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3. The local supplement will not be less
   restrictive than the source publications. Local supplements will be approved by the local
   Operations Group Commander (OG/CC), with a copy provided to the respective NAF/OV
   (MAJCOM for DRUs).
1.5. Title 14 CFR Exemptions and FAA Authorizations. MAJCOMs will obtain FAA
exemptions or authorizations only through HQ USAF/A3O by contacting HQ AFFSA and
following the waiver guidance below. MAJCOMs should submit their CFR Exemption requests
a minimum of six months prior to execution for original requests and exemption renewals.
EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace Management, waivers for airshow issues (speed,
minimum safe altitudes, parachute jumping, etc.) should be submitted directly to the local Flight
Standards District Office. Operations of UAS in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS)
outside of Warning and Restricted Areas require an FAA Certificate of Authorization or Waiver
(COA), to be obtained by the user unit through their MAJCOM.
1.6. Waivers. HQ USAF/A3O will provide waivers to this instruction only upon an official
MAJCOM request when an essential requirement makes a waiver necessary or compliance with
a flight rule creates a hazard.
   1.6.1. Waiver Process. HQ USAF/A3O will provide only written waivers with an
   expiration date. Revisions to this AFI do not automatically invalidate current waivers with
   respect to paragraph numbering, etc. Upon publication of a revision, HQ AFFSA shall
   coordinate with each MAJCOM to convert, rescind, or issue new waivers (when appropriate)
   resulting from revisions to this AFI. Units requiring a waiver to this AFI will follow this
   procedure:
   1.6.1. (ACC) Waiver Process. Units will submit all waiver requests to HQ ACC/A3T
   (AFRC to HQ AFRC/A3V, ANG to NGB/A3T) for forwarding to HQ AFFSA. MAJCOM
   will provide waivers in message format following the same procedures required in paragraph
   1.6.1 Units OPCON to a COCOM will request waivers from HQ ACC/A3T through the
   COMAFFOR.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           11


       1.6.1.1. Units will forward their written request for a waiver to this instruction through
       their chain of command to the MAJCOM/A3. The unit’s detailed waiver request must
       clearly delineate if a FAA exemption is required, the operational requirement for the
       waiver and risk mitigation measures to be undertaken during operations under the waiver.
       1.6.1.2. MAJCOMs will review the request. If approved, the MAJCOM/A3 will endorse
       the request and forward it in memo or message format to HQ USAF/A3O, with a copy to
       HQ AFFSA/A3O, at least 30 days prior to the waiver requirement (if waiver also requires
       FAA exemption, see paragraph 1.5).                  Submit waiver requests to:
       afa3o.workflow@pentagon.af.mil (copy to: hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil). If approved,
       HQ USAF/A3O will send an approved waiver memo to the MAJCOM/A3.                    HQ
       USAF/A3O will review and respond in writing to all MAJCOM waiver requests.
       1.6.1.3. MAJCOMs shall track the currency of all approved waivers to ensure renewals,
       if required, are validated and then requested using the process above at least 15 days prior
       to the expiration date. HQ AFFSA retains renewal authority for existing waivers.
       Renewals should be requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval function.
   1.6.2. MAJCOM Commander Waiver Authority.
       1.6.2.1. MAJCOM commanders may unilaterally authorize any deviation from air traffic
       rules (this instruction, the CFRs, etc.), without prior approval from HQ USAF/A3O or the
       FAA, if doing so is ―essential to the defense of the United States‖ because of a military
       emergency or an urgent military necessity, and there is no time to obtain prior approval
       from HQ USAF/A3O or the FAA. Time permitting, the MAJCOM will notify HQ
       USAF/A3O (copy to HQ AFFSA) and the FAA (through HQ AFFSA) of its military
       intentions prior to deviating from the flight rules. MAJCOM commanders will notify HQ
       USAF/A3O within 72 hours of authorizing any waiver or deviation following the process
       in paragraph 1.6.1.2. Notification must include details of the waiver action to include
       expected date of return to normal operations.
       1.6.2.2. The MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for operational procedure
       requirements in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction and in the appropriate MDS
       Specific, Volume 3. Further delegation of waiver authority is at MAJCOM discretion
       and will be addressed in the relevant instruction.
       1.6.2.2. (ACC) HQ ACC/A3 delegates MDS-Vol 3 waiver authority to the
       COMAFFOR for forces under the operational control of a COCOM. Further delegation
       of waiver authority is at MAJCOM discretion and will be addressed in the relevant
       instruction.
       1.6.2.3. For the purposes of this instruction, flying MAJCOMS are: ACC, AETC,
       AFGSC, AFMC, AFRC, AFSPC, AFSOC, AMC, NGB, PACAF and USAFE.
       COMMAFFORs in the grade of O-9 or O-10 in Combatant Commands are considered
       MAJCOM commanders only for forces under their operational control.
1.7. Deviations. An ATC clearance is not authority to deviate from this instruction. A PIC may
only deviate from any flight rule or ATC clearance to protect life, for safety of flight or when an
in-flight emergency requires immediate action.
 12                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   1.7.1. Notification. When deviating from an ATC clearance, the PIC will notify ATC of the
   action taken as soon as possible.
   1.7.2. Post-Flight Actions. The following post-flight actions shall be taken in the event of a
   deviation from a flight rule and/or when given traffic priority by ATC in an emergency:
       1.7.2.1. The PIC will verbally report the incident to a supervisor and commander within
       24 hours of the incident, and shall make a detailed written record.
       1.7.2.2. The unit will keep a copy of that record for a minimum of 1 year from the date
       of the incident and be prepared to provide that record to the appropriate investigating
       authority.
1.8. Violations. A violation may result when a USAF aircraft deviates from flight rules. FAA
ATC facility deviation reports involving a USAF aircraft are processed IAW AFI 13-201. Air
Force air traffic control facility deviation reports involving USAF aircraft are processed IAW
AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. Violations that occur in the
airspace of foreign nations are handled IAW the procedures of that nation.
   1.8.1. The names of the crew will not be released to non-USAF agencies without the
   permission of the Air Force Representative to the FAA (AFREP), in coordination with
   MAJCOM/A3s or HQ USAF/A3O.
   1.8.2. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC. Forward investigation results to HQ ACC/A3A IAW AFI
   13-201, Air Force Airspace Management.

       2.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Unit OGVs or squadron representatives will request individual
       usernames and passwords for website access to www.jeppesen.com.
2.3. Publications. Operational commanders are responsible for providing their crews with
access to appropriate flight publications. Aircrew members shall not be provided with, nor use,
any publication in-flight which is out of date, incomplete, illegible or contains unfamiliar
procedures or a language barrier.
   2.3.1. The PIC will ensure current copies (electronic and/or paper) of the appropriate FLIP
   en route supplement, en route, oceanic plotting and/or terrain charts, Flight Information
   Handbook, and appropriate arrival, approach and departure procedures are on board the
   aircraft or immediately available in the UAS control station. If an electronic navigation
   system database is used, the PIC will ensure it is current. For Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)
   and paperless cockpit restrictions, see paragraph 2.17.
   2.3.2. Printed forms, charts or terminal procedures, used for en route or off-station
   navigation, must be printed in the original scale and in color (if appropriate), and be current
   with the latest Digital Aeronautical Information File (DAFIF) and Electronic Chart Update
   Manual (ECHUM). MAJCOMs may permit additional chart configurations to meet mission-
   specific needs.
   2.3.3. Aircrews will obtain FLIP and aeronautical navigation data (including charts) only
   from US Government sources. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) data may be

   Chart Users Guide are available at: http://www.naco.faa.gov. See paragraph 8.4.5. for non-
   US Government procedure use rules.
2.4. Fuel Requirements. The PIC will ensure sufficient fuel is available on board the aircraft to
comply with the requirements of this instruction and safely conduct the flight. PICs shall use
MAJCOM-approved fuel-efficiency techniques and procedures to the maximum extent practical.
Before takeoff or immediately after in-flight refueling, the aircraft must have enough usable fuel
aboard to complete the flight:
   2.4.1. To a final landing, either at the destination airport or alternate airport (if one is
   required), plus the fuel reserves.
   2.4.2. To or between Air Refueling Control Points (ARCPs) and then to land at the
   destination (or a recovery base, if refueling is not successful), plus the fuel reserve.
   2.4.3. Alternate Airport Required. When an alternate is required, the weather conditions
   at the original destination govern the preflight fuel computation.
       2.4.3.1. Fuel required for an approach and missed approach must be included in the total
       flight plan fuel if visibility-only weather criteria (paragraph 8.6.3.2.) is used to determine
       the suitability of the original destination.
       2.4.3.2. Fuel required for an approach and missed approach is not required if the ceiling
       and visibility criteria is used to determine the suitability of the original destination.
   2.4.4. Fuel Reserve. The PIC must ensure the aircraft is carrying enough usable fuel on
   each flight to increase the total planned flight time between refueling points by 10 percent
   (up to a maximum of 45 minutes for fixed-wing or 30 minutes for helicopters) or 20 minutes,
   whichever is greater. Compute fuel reserves using MAJCOM-defined consumption rates for
   normal cruising speeds or the following:
       2.4.4.1. For reciprocating engine aircraft and helicopters, use fuel consumption rates for
       normal cruising altitudes.
       2.4.4.2. For turbine-powered aircraft use fuel consumption rates that provide maximum
       endurance at 10,000 ft. Mean Sea Level (MSL).
       2.4.4.3. If the MAJCOM authorizes holding (instead of an alternate airport) for a remote
       or island destination, do not consider the prescribed holding time as part of the total
       planned flight time for computing fuel reserve.
   2.4.5. Extended Operations (ETOPS). In the absence of MDS-specific guidance, PICs of
   USAF multi-engine aircraft operated for extended periods over large bodies of water (outside
   gliding distance to a suitable landing site) or desolate land areas shall, during preflight
   planning, calculate and plot on the appropriate navigational chart, an Equal Time Point (ETP)
   to a suitable alternate for that mission leg, and specifically plan contingency fuel
   requirements (e.g.: engine-out depressurized flight at an appropriate altitude from ETP to the
   suitable landing site).
   2.4.6. Minimum/Emergency Fuel Advisory. Pilots will declare minimum/emergency fuel
   to the appropriate controlling agency when in their judgment the aircraft may land at the
   intended destination with less than the minimum/emergency fuel reserve.

       2.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) Navigation chart and/or mission flight plan identifying the route
       of flight from takeoff to landing and containing all the information that would normally
       be on the AF IMT 70.
       2.5.1.2. (Added-ACC) C/EC/HC-130 crews may continue to use AMC or unit
       navigator forms with HQ ACC/A3T approval.
       2.5.1.3. (Added-ACC) RQ-4 pilots may use the Air Force Mission Support System
       (AFMSS) computer-generated mission flight plan log.
2.6. Weather. For authorized weather sources, refer to AFH 11-203V2, Weather for Aircrews,
the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) or use a published MAJCOM-approved source. If
unable to obtain weather information, pilots may fly in VMC to a point where contact may be
established with an authorized weather source.
   2.6.1. (Added-ACC) When requesting a written weather briefing use DD Form 175-1,
   Flight Weather Briefing; or any locally-approved mission execution forecast briefing form.
   2.6.2. (Added-ACC) When military weather services are unavailable, pilots may call the
   applicable Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) (see Flight Information Handbook for
   contact number), their home station or use any FAA approved weather system or service,
   (e.g., DUATS or the NOAA Aviation Weather site).
   2.6.3. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC/ANG. The PIC will document the source of the weather
   information and the time of receipt in either the weather block of the DD Form 175, Military
   Flight Plan, or in the remarks section of the flight plan filed.
   2.6.4. (Added-ACC) When requested, aircrews will provide weather units with a post-
   mission debrief describing weather conditions encountered, accuracy of forecasts and impact
   of the weather and weather forecasts on mission effectiveness. Mission debriefs may be
   conducted in person, telephonically, electronically or in writing as defined in local operating
   instructions. Direct weather debriefs towards the weather unit that provided the initial
   weather briefing.
2.7. Briefings. Prior to flight, the PIC must ensure each crewmember and passenger is briefed
on items affecting safety or mission completion. At a minimum, briefings will include:
   2.7.1. Emergency procedures.

2.14. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards. MAJCOMs will provide guidance for aircrew
and passengers to ensure the wearing of jewelry (or other personal accoutrements) aboard the
aircraft, in a UAS control station and on the flight line do not create a FOD hazard.
2.14. (ACC)Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards. Unless precluded by MDS Specific
Volume 3 instructions, crewmembers and passengers may wear wigs, hairpieces, ornaments,
barrettes, pins, clips, or other hair fasteners, on the flight line and may continue to wear such
items when in the aircraft. No earrings will be worn on the flight line and in the aircraft (If wear
of any devices previously mentioned interferes with the form, fit, or function of flight equipment,
these devices will be removed). PIC will brief crewmembers and passengers on the potential of
these items creating a FOD hazard. The PIC may restrict crewmembers and passengers from
wearing any of these items if the PIC believes a FOD hazard exists.
   2.14.1. (Added-ACC) Crewmembers will secure restricted area badges to the uniform or to
   their person to prevent possible FOD hazards while preflighting and operating aircraft.
2.15. Equipment Required for Flight. USAF aircraft cockpits and RPA control stations must
always provide full-time attitude, altitude, and airspeed information and the capability to
recognize, confirm, and recover from unusual attitudes in all pilot positions.
   2.15.1. Flight Instrumentation. Lead commands will define display requirements for
   aircraft not certified or authorized for instrument flight. Displays must always be positioned
   and arranged in a manner to enable an effective crosscheck. UAS ground stations must
   provide the pilot equivalent information appropriate to the system’s autonomy. HQ
   USAF/A3O is the final authority and must endorse electronic and single medium displays
   and standby or emergency instruments as a Primary Flight Reference (PFR) before the
   instruments are used as a stand-alone reference for instrument flight. HQ AFFSA must
   evaluate any changes to cockpit instrumentation. The following instrumentation must always
   be displayed to the pilot (and illuminated during night operations) in USAF cockpits and
   UAS ground stations:
   2.15.1. (ACC) Flight Instrumentation. N/A AFRC/ANG. Aircraft equipped with an
   attitude indicator system which has two primary or a primary and standby (or backup) mode
   will have both modes/systems operational for night and IMC flights. For any instrument that
   presents both analog and digital information, either presentation is acceptable at the PICs
   discretion. In aircraft with tandem cockpits, the flight instruments must be operative in both
   cockpits during night/IMC flights, when both cockpits are occupied by aircrew performing
   crew duties. Do not accept aircraft from factories, modification centers or depots unless all
   flight instruments are installed and operative.
       2.15.1.1. Climb/Dive Angle (or pitch and vertical velocity)
       2.15.1.2. Bank Angle
       2.15.1.3. Barometric Altitude
22                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


     2.15.1.4. Indicated or Calibrated Airspeed
     2.15.1.5. Prominent Horizon Reference
     2.15.1.6. Heading
     2.15.1.7. Appropriate fault indications (off flags) for instruments, PFRs and UAS lost
     communication links must be operative.
  2.15.2. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Flights in IMC also require
  operational: pitot heat, anti-icing and/or de-icing equipment designed to cope with the type
  and severity of known or forecast icing conditions. Such equipment is not required for brief
  exposures when climbing or descending to an operating altitude above or below the icing
  condition.
  2.15.3. Night Flight. (N/A for UAS operations) In addition to the requirements of
  paragraphs 5.12. and 5.20., a pilot must not operate an aircraft at night unless it is equipped
  with cockpit lighting sufficient to allow crewmembers to view required instrument panels,
  controls, and read required charts, FLIP, instrument approach plates and other navigation
  materials. Each crewmember must have an operable flashlight.
     2.15.3.1. Use an authorized weather source, the latest version of the Air Almanac,
     MAJCOM-approved computer program or US Naval Observatory data to determine and
     calculate light and moon data. See glossary for definitions of night and civil twilight.
  2.15.4. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Equipment Requirements. RPAs must meet
  equipage requirements for the class of airspace for which they intend to operate. If not
  suitably equipped, the RPA may only be flown in appropriate special-use airspace or under
  the provisions of a COA.
  2.15.5. (Added-ACC) IFF/SIF Requirements. All flights require ground station check of
  Mode 3 IFF/SIF equipment prior to takeoff. Aircraft equipped with an IFF self-test capability
  are exempt from the ground station check if the self-test feature indicates normal system
  operation. However, suspected IFF/SIF equipment malfunctions require a ground station
  check. Ground check of the Mode 3 is not required on stopover flights when the IFF/SIF was
  operational on the previous flight.
     2.15.5.1. (Added-ACC) If interrogation facilities or radar facilities do not permit
     ground station checks, takeoff may be made if the IFF/SIF was operational on the
     previous mission.
     2.15.5.2. (Added-ACC) Single aircraft may take off with IFF/SIF equipment known to
     be inoperative, provided the following conditions are met and every effort has been made
     to repair the equipment:
         2.15.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) Notify the squadron operations officer or designated
         representative and obtain flight approval.
         2.15.5.2.2. (Added-ACC) The flight is in day VMC.
         2.15.5.2.3. (Added-ACC) Contact the nearest Flight Service Station or ATC facility
         and advise them that you require flight with an inoperative transponder. They will
         coordinate with the applicable ARTCC.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           23


       2.15.5.3. (Added-ACC) In flights of two or more aircraft, takeoff may be made if an
       operational IFF is available for each flight of two aircraft or each element of a formation.
       IAW paragraph 5.6.1. of the basic instruction, nonstandard formation flight may not be
       possible with inoperative IFFs.
   2.15.6. (Added-ACC) Mode 4. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4
   IFF/SIF prior to deployments outside of CONUS and missions (ATO, ACO, OPORD,
   contingency/exercise tasking) where safe passage procedures are implemented. ACC units
   and units under ACC oversight will perform operational ground Mode 4 checks before these
   sorties and any other requiring an operational Mode 4.
       2.15.6.1. (Added-ACC) Aircrews should solicit inflight Mode 4 checks from any
       available means during each sortie (e.g., AWACS, GTACS, F-15, F-22, F-35, AIFF F-16
       or NORAD through the appropriate Sector Operations Center) and will debrief
       maintenance on any unsuccessful interrogation of the Mode 4. Air and ground C2 units
       (NORAD, AWACS and GTACS) will conduct appropriate Mode 4 checks and report
       system status to interrogated aircraft.
           2.15.6.1.1. (Added-ACC) ANG/AFRC units are not required to key and operate the
           Mode 4 for flights beginning and ending at times other than normal duty hours.
           2.15.6.1.2. (Added-ACC) E-4 aircraft and air defense aircraft on alert will comply
           with Mode 4 procedures outlined in North American Aerospace Defense Command
           Instruction (NI) 10-15, Identification of Air Traffic.
           2.15.6.1.3. (Added-ACC) OC-135, Open Skies aircraft are exempt from keying the
           Mode 4 and will not carry classified material when performing Open Skies related
           training or operational missions.
2.16. Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)
Systems and Procedures. For flights that operate under instrument flight rules (IFR), the
aircraft must have a two-way radio and navigation equipment compatible with the airspace
where the operations occur. IAW AFPD 63-13, CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety Performance
for USAF Aircraft, CNS/ATM and navigation safety systems integrated on USAF aircraft must
provide an equivalent level of performance and safety to civil standards. The lead MAJCOM
and system developer ensures the aircraft is properly certified and operationally approved before
use.
   2.16.1. Certification. The term ―properly certified‖ indicates that performance of the
   aircraft systems has been assessed IAW AFI 63-1301, Assurance of CNS/ATM and
   Navigation Safety Performance, to ensure compliance with paragraph 2.15. and this section.
   Civil standards may be obtained from the HQ AFFSA/A3ON Community of Practice web
   site at: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/affsa-a3on, or via aircraft certification matrices
   maintained by 853 ELSG/NT (https://igatm.hanscom.af.mil).
   2.16.2. Operational approval. Lead MAJCOMs approve operational use of CNS/ATM and
   navigation safety systems. MAJCOMs shall ensure that required aircrew and maintainer
   proficiency and training is maintained and documented, and that flight manuals, technical
   orders, and operating instructions are updated to include appropriate procedures and
   information on CNS/ATM use and functions. MAJCOMs must provide explicit guidance to
   aircrews defining what capabilities, qualifications, and restrictions apply to installed
24                                       AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


  CNS/ATM equipment on all applicable MDSs, to include remote/oceanic operations (i.e.,
  GPS primary means, MNPS, RNP 10, RNP 4, etc), RNAV en route, terminal, and approach
  operations (i.e., Baro-VNAV, RNAV 2, RNAV 5/B-RNAV, RNAV 1/P-RNAV, etc),
  RVSM, etc. MAJCOMs should provide standard operating procedures for flight in oceanic
  (or applicable MNPS) airspace, including checklists for inflight use, as necessary.
     2.16.2.1. (Added-ACC) GPS as Primary Means of Navigation in Remote/Oceanic
     Areas. ACC aircraft and aircraft under ACC oversight are approved to use GPS as a
     primary means of navigation provided the capabilities are listed in 11-2 MDS Specific,
     Volume 3 or aircraft T.Os.
     2.16.2.2. (Added-ACC) ACC aircraft and aircraft under ACC oversight are approved to
     use VNAV systems for VFR and IFR operations provided the capabilities are listed in
     AFI 11-2 MDS Specific, Volume 3 or aircraft TOs.
     2.16.2.3. (Added-ACC) Barometric Vertical Navigation (Baro-VNAV). ACC
     aircraft and aircraft under ACC oversight are approved to use barometric VNAV (BARO-
     VNAV) systems for instrument approaches provided the capabilities are listed in 11-2
     MDS Specific, Volume 3 or aircraft T.Os.
  2.16.3. Navigation Specification. Aircraft must meet the navigation specification of the
  airspace or procedure being flown. Specific performance infrastructure requirements are
  defined for each navigation specification. An aircraft approved for a RNP or RNAV
  specification having a stringent accuracy requirement is not automatically approved for a
  navigation specification having a less stringent requirement (e.g., RNP 0.3 or RNAV 1 does
  not imply RNP 4 or RNAV 5 compliance) because different navigation specifications have
  different performance, equipage and infrastructure assumptions.
  2.16.4. GPS/RNAV Equipment. Air Force GPS/RNAV systems are divided into three
  basic categories: portable GPS units, mission enhancement systems and systems meeting
  FAA requirements for IFR use.
     2.16.4.1. Portable GPS Units (PGUs). PGUs include commercial hand-held GPS
     receivers, military precision lightweight GPS receivers (PLGRs), and PLGRs coupled
     with a laptop computer that incorporates moving map displays. They are intended to be
     used in aircraft as situational awareness tools only. MAJCOMs shall publish guidance on
     the use of PGUs, approve their software and develop programs to ensure aircrews receive
     proper training on these systems before permitting their use. PGUs are authorized for use
     with the following restrictions: PGUs shall not be used for IFR navigation, instrument
     approaches, or as a primary flight reference and will not be used as a substitute for any
     required flight equipment. PGUs must be tested IAW requirements of paragraph 2.9.6.
     2.16.4.1. (ACC) Terminal/approach procedures will not be flown using a PGU.
         2.16.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Squadron training functions will develop an appropriate
         PGU training program.
         2.16.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) Guidance for the use of PGUs on C/EC/MC/HC-130, ,
         HH-60, E-3, E-4, E-8, TC/WC/OC/RC-135 is as follows: When an integrated GPS is
         installed on the aircraft, disregard requirement to use a PGU. PGUs may be used on
         aircraft with integrated GPS at OG/CC discretion. For fighter aircraft, PGUs must be
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                      25


       specifically approved by the HQ ACC/A3 (HQ AFRC/A3 through HQ 10 AF/A3 for
       AFRC units, NGB/A3 for ANG units). Once approved, letters for ACC and ANG
       fighter aircraft will be posted on HQ ACC/A3TV website.
       2.16.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) PGU will be used on all missions other than local
       proficiency sorties. On local proficiency sorties, PGU use is at aircraft commander
       discretion. If the PGU becomes inoperable prior to takeoff from home station or while
       in-flight, make every effort to replace/fix the unit. This should not delay mission
       accomplishment.
       2.16.4.1.4. (Added-ACC) The use of PGUs will not interfere with nor replace the
       need to perform normal in-flight aircrew duties/procedures.
       2.16.4.1.5. (Added-ACC) On aircraft with sextant mount antenna, place the antenna
       in the sextant mount during preflight. If desired, it can remain there for the duration
       of the mission except when performing celestial procedures or when performing
       receiver air refueling. Squadron training flight will develop an appropriate training
       program.
       2.16.4.1.6. (Added-ACC) OG/CC or squadron commanders will ensure appropriate
       aircrew are trained on PGU usage. OG/CC may authorize training for any aircrew
       deemed appropriate. Document completed training on a letter of certification, keep
       on file and maintained IAW the RDS at the group/squadron level.
       2.16.4.1.7. (Added-ACC) The pilot, copilot and navigator on the crew should be
       trained to use the PGU. However, only one aircrew member per crew needs to be
       trained to operate the PGU in flight. Only trained crewmembers are authorized to use
       the GPS in-flight. An aircrew member not flying the aircraft should be the primary
       PGU operator.
       2.16.4.1.8. (Added-ACC) Cross-check PGU present position with on-board aircraft
       systems (SCNS/INS etc., radar) and available NAVAIDs (TACAN, VOR) to enhance
       situational awareness. Route of flight, from takeoff to destination, including standard
       instrument departure, should be programmed into the PGU during mission planning.
       Approaching the destination, program the approach and accompanying missed
       approach paths into the PGU prior to commencing the approach.
       2.16.4.1.9. (Added-ACC) During descent, the pilot not flying the aircraft or
       designated crewmember will monitor the PGU until starting the approach. After
       starting the approach, only the designated crewmember, not to include the pilot not
       flying, (if available) will monitor the PGU information during the approach. In IMC,
       if a discrepancy exists between the aircraft approach instrumentation and the PGU
       position, the PGU monitor will inform the aircraft commander. The aircraft
       commander should consider the validity of all available information and determine if
       a missed approach is warranted. All PGU altitudes provided should be considered
       unreliable.
       2.16.4.1.10. (Added-ACC) Unless the VHF radio capability on the PGU is certified
       IAW basic paragraph 2.9.6, do not use it in lieu of aircraft radios. PGU operators will
       ensure the PGU communications function is disabled, prior to using the PGU on the
       aircraft.
26                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


        2.16.4.1.11. (Added-ACC) Turn-off power to the PGU prior to any known power
        surge (switching from external to aircraft power).
     2.16.4.2. Mission enhancement systems. These systems are intended to enhance
     mission capability when conducting tactical operations such as weapons delivery and
     airdrop. Systems that do not comply with the minimum standards of Technical Standards
     Order (TSO) C-129/C-129a will not be used for instrument navigation without specific
     MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMS that approve the use of these systems for en route
     navigation must publish specific usage guidance and restrictions. Mission enhancement
     systems will not be used for terminal operations except when they are part of a navigation
     system capable of self-contained instrument approaches as outlined in paragraph 8.17.6.
     2.16.4.3. Systems Meeting Civil Requirements For IFR Use. The following guidance
     covers those systems that are properly certified and approved for operational use.
     Comply also with AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, RNAV
     approach procedures.
        2.16.4.3.1. RAIM Prediction. Pilots shall always ensure RAIM availability prior to
        commencing an RNAV procedure (departure, arrival or approach) using any
        MAJCOM-approved RNAV equipment. If TSO-C129 equipment is used solely to
        satisfy the RNAV requirement, RAIM availability must be confirmed for the intended
        route of flight (route and time) using current GPS satellite information. Pilots may
        choose to monitor the status of each satellite in its plane/slot position, account for the
        latest GPS constellation NOTAMs, and compute RAIM availability using model-
        specific RAIM prediction software, by using an en route and terminal RAIM
        prediction      websites     such     as:       http://www.raimprediction.net           or
        http://augur.ecacnav.com/augur/app/home, or by contacting a flight service
        station. Receiver RAIM prediction capability may also be used. In the event of a
        predicted, continuous loss of RAIM, pilots should delay or re-route where RAIM
        requirements can be met if GPS is their only means of meeting the required RNAV
        performance. Pilots must continually assess their navigation capability in case of
        GPS failure. In the NAS only, if TSO-C145/146 equipment is used to satisfy the
        RNAV requirement, RAIM prediction need not be accomplished if Wide-Area
        Augmentation Service (WAAS) coverage is confirmed available along the route of
        flight.
        2.16.4.3.2. Flying RNAV Approaches. MAJCOMs must approve the use of Flight
        Mission Computers (FMC) or Flight Management Systems (FMS) guidance to fly
        approaches with or without ―GPS‖ or ―or GPS‖ in the title. Pilot using suitable
        RNAV equipment to fly an approach must extract the entire procedure from a current
        database, and may not alter the extracted procedure.
        2.16.4.3.3. RNAV Substitution. On procedures developed by a US TERPS
        authority (FAA/USAF/USN), or on WGS-84 compliant procedures reviewed by
        MAJCOM TERPS, MAJCOM-approved suitable RNAV systems may be used as a
        substitute means of navigation for a named fix, VOR, TACAN, NDB, DME or
        compass locator. In such terminal areas, following a successful predictive RAIM
        check, approved RNAV systems may be substituted for required NAVAIDS or
        named fixes on arrivals, departures, and non-localizer based instrument procedures.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                      27


       Any such substitution must be extracted from a current database. These operations
       are allowable even when a facility is explicitly identified as required on a procedure
       (e.g., ―Note ADF required‖), but not if the procedure is NOTAM’ed as NA. Pilots
       using approved RNAV systems as a substitute means of navigation guidance in lieu
       of an out of service NAVAID should advise ATC of this intent and capability. Pilots
       will tune, identify, monitor and display the appropriate ground-based NAVAIDs
       whenever practicable.
       2.16.4.3.4. Terminal Area Operations using RNAV Substitution. Using a
       MAJCOM-approved suitable RNAV system, pilots may determine aircraft position
       over or distance from a VOR, TACAN, NDB, compass locator, DME fix; or a named
       fix defined by a VOR radial, TACAN course, NDB bearing, or compass locator
       bearing intersecting a VOR or localizer course. Further, pilots may navigate to or
       from a VOR, TACAN, NDB, or compass locator, or hold over a VOR, TACAN,
       NDB, compass locator, or DME fix, or fly an arc based upon DME.
       2.16.4.3.5. RNAV Prohibitions. RNAV systems using DME/DME/IRU, without
       GPS or WAAS position input, may only be used as a substitute means of navigation
       when specifically authorized by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) or other
       FAA/MAJCOM guidance for a specific procedure, NAVAID, or fix. The NOTAM or
       other FAA/MAJCOM guidance authorizing the use of DME/DME/IRU systems will
       also identify any required DME facilities based on an FAA assessment of the DME
       navigation infrastructure.   The following RNAV substitution operations are
       prohibited:
          2.16.4.3.5.1. Substitution of the navigational aid providing lateral guidance for
          the final approach segment of an instrument procedure without reference to the
          raw navigational data.
          2.16.4.3.5.2. Navigation on any localizer-based course without reference to raw
          localizer data.
          2.16.4.3.5.3. Navigation on procedures that are identified as not authorized
          (―NA‖) without exception by a NOTAM. For example, RNAV substitution
          allowances do not apply to a procedure affected by an expired or unsatisfactory
          flight inspection, or if a procedure is based upon a recently decommissioned
          NAVAID.
       2.16.4.3.6. RNAV Navigation Augmentation. Space-Based Augmentation (SBAS)
       or Wide-Area Augmentation (WAAS) provide greater fidelity to GPS navigation data
       solutions.    MAJCOMs will approve the use of SBAS/WAAS for en-route and
       terminal operations. These systems must be ―properly certified‖ IAW TSO-C145A or
       TSO-C146A and installed IAW AC 20-130A. MAJCOMs must publish MDS-
       specific guidance and ensure pilots are appropriately trained and/or certified prior to
       authorizing the use of any augmented RNAV navigation solutions.
          2.16.4.3.6.1. Pilots must check airfield NOTAMs for status and level of service
          available. When the IAP is annotated with the W symbol, site-specific WAAS
          UNRELIABLE NOTAMs or Air Traffic advisories are not provided for outages
          in WAAS Lateral Navigation (LNAV) or Vertical Navigation (VNAV) and
28                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


             Localizer-Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) service. In this case, pilots
             will use LNAV weather minima, or Baro VNAV, if so equipped, for flight
             planning decisions at these locations.
             2.16.4.3.6.2. When using augmented avionics as the planned approach at a
             required (and otherwise qualified) alternate, pilots will base flight planning
             decisions on the RNAV (GPS) LNAV minima line. Upon arrival at an alternate,
             if SBAS/WAAS is available, then pilots may use vertical guidance to complete
             the approach using the displayed level of service.
  2.16.5. Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) Airspace. Pilots will
  not fly in MNPS airspace until their aircraft is properly certified and approved by the lead
  command.
     2.16.5.1. Aircraft meeting the North Atlantic Track (NAT) MNPS requirements meet the
     Canadian Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (CMNPS) requirements.
     2.16.5.2. Pilots operating aircraft in NAT airspace designated as MNPS must comply
     with requirements specified in applicable FLIP area planning documents.
     2.16.5.3. Pilots operating aircraft in CMNPS airspace must comply with the
     requirements specified in FLIP AP/1, Chapter 3.
     2.16.5.4. HQ USAF/A3O, through HQ AFFSA, must approve waivers to the
     requirements of NAT MNPS and/or CMNPS airspace.
  2.16.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) Airspace. Pilots will not fly in
  RVSM airspace unless their aircraft is properly certified by the lead command or unless ATC
  provides a clearance allowing entrance of a non-RVSM aircraft into RVSM airspace. Prior
  to operational approval, MAJCOMs will ensure pilots operating aircraft IAW RVSM criteria
  comply with requirements specified in FLIP GP and applicable AP guidance.
  2.16.6. (ACC) Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM). During preflight
  planning, aircrews must consider the possibility of not being granted access to RVSM
  airspace.
     2.16.6.1. Prior to entry into RVSM airspace, the following shall be operating normally:
         2.16.6.1.1. Two primary altitude measurement systems,
         2.16.6.1.2. One automatic altitude control system (autopilot),
         2.16.6.1.3. One altitude alerting device, and
         2.16.6.1.4. An operational transponder.
     2.16.6.2. The PIC will notify the controlling agency as soon as possible should any of the
     equipment above fail after entering RVSM airspace.
  2.16.7. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Pilots will not operate in
  RNP airspace unless aircraft systems/equipment are certified IAW applicable civil standards
  and lead commands provide operational approval.
     2.16.7.1. MAJCOMs will ensure that crews are aware of any special conditions or
     limitations associated with operations in each level of RNP airspace.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                        29


       2.16.7.2. The applicable RNP level and any equipment conditions or limitations depicted
       on affected FLIP charts and procedures will be followed.
       2.16.7.3. Pilots will advise ATC if an equipment failure or other malfunction results in
       the loss of aircraft capability to continue operating in the designated RNP airspace.
       2.16.7.4. When a specified RNP level cannot be achieved, the pilot should revise the
       route or delay the operation until appropriate RNP level can be ensured.
   2.16.8. Operations within RNP-10 or Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Pilots
   must ensure their aircraft systems are MAJCOM approved to fly in RNP 10 or RNAV 5/B-
   RNAV airspace. MAJCOM approval to fly in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace is restricted to
   aircraft systems that are ―properly certified.‖
2.17. Electronic Flight Bags (EFB). Any device, installed or portable, used as an EFB must
provide an equivalent level of safety and performance to that provided by paper products. For
the purpose of this instruction, EFB products include, but are not limited to, laptop computers,
tablet PCs, electronic kneeboards, and tethered displays. See also paragraph 2.3. EFB systems
must comply with the testing requirements of paragraph 2.9.
   2.17.1. EFB Certification and Authorization. Prior to authorizing EFB operations, the
   User MAJCOM will (in coordination with Lead MAJCOM):
       2.17.1.1. Ensure EFBs comply with current guidance in FAA Advisory Circular AC 120-
       76. MAJCOMs should also reference the information stored on the HQ AFFSA
       CNS/ATM CoP: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3on.
       2.17.1.2. Ensure EFB flight manual data (including checklists) is displayed IAW AFI 11-
       215.
       2.17.1.3. Ensure EFB terminal procedure data is displayed identically in format and size
       to the published paper version. The EFB must not require scroll or zoom to view the
       Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP). Alternate formats/sizes of IAPs require
       evaluation of software functionality and human factors by the aircraft program office and
       endorsement by the user/lead command. Forward endorsement through HQ AFFSA for
       HQ USAF/A3O approval.
       2.17.1.4. Ensure EFBs with moving map software or display of own ship position are not
       used as a primary means of navigation (applies to both airborne and ground
       operations). This functionality will only be used as a tool to enhance situational
       awareness.
       2.17.1.5. Establish an aircrew training program to certify crews in use of EFBs, to
       include procedures for EFB failure in flight.
       2.17.1.6. Publish written approval prior to aircrew use of EFBs.
       2.17.1.7. Ensure paper publications are carried as a back-up unless paperless cockpit
       transition is complete.
   2.17.2. Paperless Cockpit Transition. Lead and User MAJCOMs transitioning an MDS to
   a paperless cockpit will develop a process which follows the recommended risk mitigation
   practices found in AC 120-76. A 6-month evaluation must be accomplished during which
   back-up paper products must be readily available onboard the aircraft. Following the
30                                      AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


  evaluation period, a final reliability report must be submitted to the lead command for
  coordination through HQ AFFSA to HQ USAF/A3O for approval of paperless operations.

                     FLIGHT PLANS AND PASSENGER MANIFESTS

3.1. Flight Plan Requirements. A flight plan enables search and rescue (SAR) agencies to
search for an overdue aircraft. An IFR flight plan communicates the pilot’s desires to ATC.
Approved flight plans include those listed in FLIP GP, an FAA or ICAO Flight Plan form, or a
host nation or MAJCOM-approved form (including computer forms). The PIC will ensure a
flight plan is filed for any flight of a USAF aircraft.
3.1. (ACC)Flight Plan Requirement. When flight plans for flights conducted within the local
flying area or round robin flights are not filed in person at airfield management operations, (e.g.,
electronic media and fax.) filing procedures/responsibilities, to include records disposition IAW
Air Force RDS and approval authority/flight plan signature requirements, must be developed and
published in the base airfield operations instruction.
   3.1.1. Mission Command and Control (C2). When at a non-military installation and a
   Flight Service Station (FSS) or Air Traffic Control (ATC) are not reachable, the pilot will
   ensure flight following by providing the mission C2 agency the intended route prior to
   takeoff. Once airborne, the PIC will stay clear of Area Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ),
   Buffer Zones, and other restricted airspace, fly VFR in controlled airspace (or IFR IAW
   paragraph 4.6), and file a flight plan with a FSS or ATC facility as soon as practicable.
   3.1.2. Procedures for Units Without a Base Operations. When a written flight plan form
   is not processed through base operations, the flying unit must have a written agreement with
   airfield management outlining the procedures for handling flight movement, messages and
   identifying the agency responsible for flight following.
   3.1.3. Flight Plan Changes. The format for making changes to a flight plan is printed on
   the inside cover of the DoD Flight Supplement. Before takeoff, or while airborne, the PIC
   may make changes to the original filed flight plan without re-filing provided:
       3.1.3.1. The change does not penetrate an ADIZ.
       3.1.3.2. The controlling ATC agency approves the change for an IFR flight.
       3.1.3.3. The PIC ensures the facility providing flight following is notified of the change.
       Failure to ensure a FSS (or its overseas equivalent) is aware of the change may result in
       erroneous SAR efforts or an unannounced arrival at the destination.
       3.1.3.4. The change complies with applicable host-nation rules.
       3.1.3.5. (Added-ACC) Unless emergency conditions dictate otherwise, when a
       significant change in the planned flight or planning factors for the flight occur either
       before takeoff or en route, the PIC will ensure the appropriate unit command and control
       agency is notified when able. ANG airlift units comply with ANGI 10-207, Global Flight
       Following.
   3.1.4. Destination Notification. If unable to contact the command and control agency, the
   PIC will contact the FSS or equivalent as soon as practicable. The PIC will request the
   destination be advised of the departure time for flight following and to prevent an
   unannounced arrival.
 32                                          AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   3.1.5. Closing the Flight Plan. If operating in the NAS on an IFR flight plan into an airport
   with a functioning control tower, the flight plan is automatically closed upon landing. In all
   other cases, the PIC will ensure an activated flight plan is closed through a FSS or ATC
   facility by any means of communication available. If necessary, call long distance collect.
   3.1.6. (Added-ACC) MAJCOM-Approved Forms. Units may use a locally designed
   form for local area VFR/IFR flight plans provided:
       3.1.6.1. (Added-ACC) The form meets the minimum flight plan information
       requirements for VFR/IFR flights and the flight authorization requirements outlined in
       AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
       3.1.6.2. (Added-ACC) The base and appropriate ARTCC have established IFR local
       stereo type flight plan agreements.
       3.1.6.3. (Added-ACC) The above procedures have been coordinated with Operations
       Flight Commander (AOF/CC) or Airfield Operations Manager.
       3.1.6.4. (Added-ACC) Aircraft conducting air defense activities may use scramble/
       airborne flight order flight plans. The Air Defense Sector and the concerned flying unit
       will jointly prepare these flight plans. The flying unit will file such flight plans with the
       appropriate ARTCC.
           3.1.6.4.1. (Added-ACC) Label these forms "Local Flight Clearance – Flight Order"
           when used to combine local area VFR/IFR stereo flight plans. Approve as a flight
           order only for local area IFR round robins filed on a DD Form 175. Flights that
           terminate at an installation not under the operational control of the base of departure
           will require a separate flight clearance and flight order. Air Defense units may use
           this clearance for all flights within the local area, between units under the control of
           the Air Defense Region having operational control of the aircraft and for other air
           defense activity that is in the interest of national security.
3.2. Passenger Manifests and Crew Lists. List passengers on a DD Form 2131, Passenger
Manifest, or a MAJCOM-approved form. File the manifest and crew list with the flight plan, the
passenger service facility, or other responsible agency. Notify C2 prior to departure if there is a
passenger manifest (or crew list) change. When able, process crew and manifest changes with
the original processing facility or with a responsible agency.

                                GENERAL FLIGHT RULES

5.1. Professional Flying Standards.
   5.1.1. Reckless Flying. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is not operated in a
   careless, reckless or irresponsible manner that could endanger life or property.
   5.1.2. Off-Station Training. Commanders will ensure that all off-station training flights
   meet valid training requirements and present a positive image of the Air Force. The PIC
   shall execute off-station training activities to achieve valid training requirements, present a
   positive view of the Air Force and shall ensure no appearance of government waste or abuse
   occurs.
      5.1.2.1. Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement Card (AIR CARD) Responsibilities.
      The PIC shall use the AIR CARD only for fuel and required ground services. Refuel at
      military installations as a first choice, followed by contract fixed base operators (FBOs).
      Refuel at non-contract FBOs only if mission needs warrant servicing at such locations.
      Further information, including documentation procedures and updated lists of contract
      FBOs, is available at: https://www.airseacard.com.
          5.1.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Use of non-contract fuel may be authorized by OG/CC
          when mission requirements dictate or by the aircraft commander during emergencies.
          5.1.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) OC-135 and HH-60 may use non-contract fuel when
          military and contract fuel is not available along the route of flight.
   5.1.3. Unauthorized Flight Demonstrations.              Unauthorized or impromptu flight
   demonstrations, maneuvers, events or ―fly-bys‖ are prohibited. AFI 11-209, Air Force
   Participation in Aerial Events, addresses authorized flight demonstrations.
   5.1.4. Readiness for Duty. A person shall not act as a crewmember of an aircraft:
      5.1.4.1. While under the influence of alcohol or its after-effects. Aircrew members shall

5.2. Transporting Passengers Under the Influence. The PIC will ensure personnel suspected
to be under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics are not allowed to board a USAF aircraft
except in an emergency or when authorized by competent authority.
5.3. Crew at Stations. Crewmembers must occupy their assigned duty stations from takeoff to
landing, unless absence is normal in the performance of crew duties, or in connection with
physiological needs. Pilots shall not leave their duty station unless another qualified pilot
establishes control of the aircraft.
5.3. (ACC)Crew at their Stations. During non-critical phases of flight, crewmembers may be
absent from their duty stations in the performance of crew duties or in connection with
physiological needs. Crew duties may include occupying another duty station to enhance mission
accomplishment, safety or crew coordination as determined by the aircraft commander.
Crewmembers must be familiar with egress and ejection procedures for whatever seat they
occupy. Physiological needs include, but are not limited to, resting, eating, stretching and taking
care of bodily functions. Any crewmember may sit in a pilot seat during non-critical phases of
flight provided a qualified pilot occupies the other pilot seat. During critical phases of flight,
crewmembers may briefly vacate/swap seats at MSA/IFR altitude, pattern altitude or safe
distance from tanker at the discretion of the aircraft commander. During critical phases of flight,
only pilots qualified in the MDS may occupy pilot seats, unless occupying the seat is directed by
an approved flight training syllabus or qualification training program, or participating in an
orientation flight IAW AFI 11-401_ACC SUP 1, Aviation Management (AFI 11-401, AFRC
SUP 1, Aviation Management for AFRC aircrew).
   5.3.1. While operating outside restricted or warning areas each RPA shall have dedicated
   pilots controlling/monitoring its flight.
   5.3.2. (Added-ACC) Cameras at Crew Duty Stations. Aircrews and passengers may take
   cameras certified IAW paragraph 2.9.6 in the basic AFI and VTRs into a cockpit when
   available space permits. Stow so that the camera cannot interfere with aircraft controls,
   aircrew flight equipment or pose a loose object hazard during aircraft maneuvering or
   ejection. Use of cameras must be pre-briefed within a flight to ensure flight path
   deconfliction, altitude awareness and visual lookout responsibilities. Use of cameras by
   orientation riders must be pre-briefed and coordinated with the aircraft commander. Cameras
   will be pre-positioned and securely stowed until required for use. Personal camera usage is
   prohibited in single seat aircraft. EXCEPTION: Pilots of single seat aircraft tasked by Air
   Defense or in support of contingency operations (e.g. Operation NOBLE EAGLE) will use
   cameras in accordance with SPINS. In multi-place aircraft, aircrews, passengers and
   orientation riders may use personal cameras subject to the following constraints:
       5.3.2.1. (Added-ACC) The pilot flying the aircraft must be current and qualified. The
       individual using the camera will not be flying the aircraft.
       5.3.2.2. (Added-ACC) For dissimilar formations, ensure minimum separation, areas to
       be avoided and abnormal procedures (blind, lost wingman, emergencies, etc.) are briefed.
       5.3.2.3. (Added-ACC) Qualified ACC and Air Force Audio Visual Service (AAVS)
       photographers may perform photographic support duties from crew duty stations,
       including from in the cockpit. Identify qualified ACC and AAVS photographers through
       the base/unit visual information manager or HQ ACC/A6OK. These photographers will
 38                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


      be on flight orders and accorded additional crewmember status as authorized by AFI 11-
      401, paragraph 1.10.1.3. See AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program,
      and the corresponding ACC Supplement, for aircrew flight equipment continuation
      training requirements.
      5.3.2.4. (Added-ACC) Aircrews, passengers and orientation riders will not use personal
      cameras while classified documents are open or classified information is visible on
      cockpit or mission crew displays. Any question concerning in-flight photography should
      be addressed to the aircraft commander or Mission Crew Commander.
      5.3.2.5. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. AFRC fighter/attack aircraft require specific
      approval by the HQ 10 AF/A3 to use a camera during flight. This includes either the front
      or back seat if appropriate. This approval is not required for the exception noted in
      paragraph 5.3.2. (Added).
   5.3.3. (Added-ACC) Lipstick Cameras. Use of lipstick cameras certified IAW paragraph
   2.9.6 of the basic instruction is authorized anytime provided they are mounted to the aircraft
   in a manner that does not interfere with ejection/egress. Since helmet-mounted lipstick
   cameras may interfere with ejection/egress, their use requires coordination with HQ
   ACC/A3TV and MAJCOM/A3 approval. ANG units will coordinate with NGB/A3T for
   NGB/A3 approval. AFRC units will coordinate with HQ AFRC/A3V for HQ AFRC/A3
   approval.
   5.3.4. (Added-ACC) Binocular Use. Use of binoculars in single seat ACC fighter/attack
   aircraft will be restricted to aircraft engaged in Forward Air Control (Airborne) (FAC (A)),
   Killer Scout, Visual Reconnaissance, DCA/Air Defense, Close Air Support (CAS) or Combat
   Search and Rescue (CSAR) missions. The use of binoculars is limited to target identification
   and threat acquisition functions. Securely stow binoculars until required for use. Use of
   binoculars must be pre-briefed within a flight to insure flight path deconfliction, altitude
   awareness and visual lookout responsibilities.
5.4. See and Avoid. Pilots operating in VMC, under IFR or VFR, whether or not under radar
control, are always responsible to see and avoid other traffic, terrain, and obstacles.
   5.4.1. Standard IFR separation is provided between aircraft operating under IFR in
   controlled airspace. Within the NAS, ATC provides traffic advisories on VFR aircraft on a
   time-permitting basis. Outside the NAS, the crew should consult ICAO and country specific
   guidance outlined in the FCG and FLIP.
   5.4.2. For UAS operations to comply with see and avoid requirements, the RPA must have
   the capability to detect/sense other traffic in sufficient time to perform an avoidance
   maneuver.
      5.4.2.1. UAS operations that do not comply with paragraph 5.4. will be conducted under
      specific arrangements with appropriate aviation authorities (FAA, host nation, or military
      control). FAA COAs issued IAW JO 7610.4 (Chapter 12, Section 9) or arrangements
      with host-nation aviation authorities do not always waive the CFRs nor provide relief
      from ICAO Rules of the Air. JO 7610.4 outlines an equivalent level of safety
      comparable to see and avoid requirements for manned aircraft. UAS operations in
      compliance with an FAA COA, host-nation aviation authorization or in special use
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            39


       airspace are acceptable provided the appropriate equivalent level of safety measures are
       in place with controlling agencies and other airspace users.
   5.4.3. (Added-ACC) Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of
   Aircraft (MARSA). FAA JO 7610.4N defines MARSA as "a condition whereby the
   military services involved assume responsibility for separation between participating military
   aircraft in the ATC system. It is used only for IFR operations that are specified in Letters of
   Agreement or other appropriate FAA or military documents." Flying units must ensure pilots
   are aware of MARSA agreements contained in Letters of Agreement with Air Traffic Control
   agencies. Pilots cannot arbitrarily declare MARSA. See AFI 13-201 for additional
   procedures.
5.5. Proximity of Aircraft. The PIC must not allow the aircraft to be flown so close to another
that it creates a collision hazard. Use 500 ft. of separation (well clear) as an approximate guide
except for:
   5.5.1. Authorized formation flights.
   5.5.2. Emergency situations requiring assistance from another aircraft. If an emergency
   requires visual checks of an aircraft in distress, the PIC must exercise extreme care to ensure
   this action does not increase the overall hazard. The capabilities of the distressed aircraft and
   the intentions of the crews involved must be considered before operating near another aircraft
   in flight.
   5.5.3. MAJCOM-approved maneuvers in which participants are aware of the nature of the
   maneuver and qualified to conduct it safely (i.e., interceptor attack training).
5.6. Formation Flight.
   5.6.1. Transponder Operations During Air Refueling or Formation Flight. Unless
   otherwise specified in Allied Communications Publication 160, US Supplement 1:
   5.6.1. (ACC) of the basic instruction, nonstandard formation flight may not be possible with
   inoperative IFFs.
       5.6.1.1. Only one aircraft (normally the lead) of a standard formation will squawk the
       assigned code.
       5.6.1.2. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, all aircraft within a non-standard formation
       flight will squawk the ATC-assigned Mode 3A/C beacon code until established within
       the assigned altitude block and closed to the proper en route interval. When aircraft
       interval exceeds 3 NMs, both the formation leader and the last aircraft will squawk the
       assigned Mode 3A/C beacon code.
       5.6.1.3. Unless otherwise directed, receivers squawk standby when <3NMs from the
       tanker.
   5.6.2. Non-standard Formation Flight. Non-standard formation flights may be conducted:
       5.6.2.1. When approved by ATC, or
       5.6.2.2. Operating under VFR in VMC, or
       5.6.2.3. Operating within an authorized Altitude Reservation (ALTRV), or
 40                                           AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


       5.6.2.4. Operating under the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA), or
       5.6.2.5. Operating in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
       5.6.2.6. (Added-ACC) Issuance of an ATC clearance for a nonstandard formation
       constitutes approval by ATC for operations in a nonstandard formation. The formation
       leader shall notify ATC upon initial contact and entering each new sector that flight
       operations are being conducted in a nonstandard formation. Advise ATC of the
       separation and spacing being employed.
5.7. Right-of-Way. Each pilot must take whatever action is necessary to avoid collision,
regardless of who has the right-of-way. The yielding aircraft must not pass over, under, abeam,
or ahead of the other aircraft until well clear.
   5.7.1. Distress. Aircraft in distress have the right-of-way over all other air traffic.
   5.7.2. Converging. When converging at approximately the same altitude (except head-on or
   approximately so), the aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way. Aircraft of different
   categories have the right-of-way in the following order of priority: balloons, gliders, aircraft
   towing or refueling other aircraft, airships, rotary- or fixed-wing aircraft.
   5.7.3. Approaching Head-On. If aircraft are approaching each other head-on or
   approximately so, each shall alter course to the right.
   5.7.4. Overtaking Aircraft. An overtaken aircraft has the right-of-way. The overtaking
   aircraft must alter course to the right.
   5.7.5. Landing. An aircraft established on final approach has the right-of-way over other
   aircraft on the ground or in the air, except when two or more aircraft are approaching to land.
   In this case, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way but it shall not use this
   advantage to cut in front of or overtake the other.
5.8. Communication in Flight.
   5.8.1. Air Traffic Control Clearances. The PIC will comply with ATC clearances and
   instructions unless a deviation is necessary due to an in-flight emergency, to ensure safety of
   flight or to comply with a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) resolution
   advisory (RA). Pilots will use standard aviation terminology, in English, from the Pilot-
   Controller glossary, MAJCOM guidance and FLIP when communicating with ATC.
       5.8.1.1. Maintain two-way radio communications with the proper ATC facility or FSS
       IAW the procedures appropriate for the class of airspace as outlined in FLIP.
       5.8.1.2. If the pilot is unsure of any clearance, immediately obtain ATC clarification.
   5.8.2. Transponder Operations. The PIC will ensure an operable transponder is used IAW
   ATC instructions or host nation or MAJCOM directives, SPINS, or for any flight in
   controlled airspace (including MODE 4 when directed). In the NAS, transponders should be
   operated any time the aircraft is moving. For aircraft that are equipped with Mode S, the PIC
   must follow proper usage guidelines as outlined in GP. MAJCOMs will manage assigned
   codes to ensure no two aircraft are airborne with the same Mode-S address/code. Mode 4
   operations are restricted to those necessary, and as outlined in the Flight Information
   Handbook (See MODE 4 in glossary).
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          41


   5.8.3. Emergency Frequencies. If suitably equipped, aircrews will monitor at least one
   emergency frequency at all times as mission and operational conditions permit. Immediately
   report distress or ELT transmissions to ATC.
   5.8.4. Radio Frequency Restrictions. Unless specifically authorized by competent
   authority, USAF aircraft will not transmit on frequencies reserved for air navigation (115.95
   – 117.95 MHz, 328.6 – 335.4 MHz). Limit radio traffic on 118.0 – 137.0 MHz frequencies
   to ATC communications. Do not transmit secure voice/data communications on other than
   approved frequencies.
   5.8.5. ATC Communications Failure. Follow the communications failure procedures
   published in the FIH.
   5.8.6. UAS ATC Communications Requirements. For RPA operations in controlled
   airspace two-way radio communications will be the primary means of communications.
   When Ultra High Frequency (UHF)/Very High Frequency (VHF) radios are not available, a
   telephone may be used as a primary means of communication. The PIC shall ensure a
   MAJCOM-approved back-up means of communication is available while the RPA is
   airborne in controlled airspace. For limited range, short duration flights, the PIC may request
   relief from radio requirements from affected ATC agencies provided a suitable alternate
   communication means is available. All UAS units will maintain a current list of landline
   contact information for all ARTCCs, Radar Approach Controls, and Airfield Towers through
   which the RPA may transit on its flight-planned route as well as its planned lost-
   link/emergency route. UAS pilots will include the number of the Ground Control Segment
   (GCS) landline (solely dedicated for ATC use) in the remarks section of the flight plan.
       5.8.6.1. (Added-ACC) For RPA operations in international oceanic airspace where
       High Frequency (HF) radios are not available, telephone may be used as a primary means
       of communication.
       5.8.6.2. (Added-ACC) RPA Link Failure. There must be an independent autonomous
       means for safe recovery of any RPA with a complete communication link failure. An in-
       flight emergency will be declared by the pilot and the proper ATC authorities will be
       immediately notified upon confirmation of lost link in controlled airspace.
5.9. Aircraft Speed.
   5.9.1. Supersonic Flight. The PIC will not allow the aircraft to operate at or above Mach l
   except as specified in AFI 13-201. Inadvertent flight above Mach 1 will be handled IAW
   AFI 13-201.
   5.9.2. In the NAS. The PIC will:
       5.9.2.1. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 250 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) below
       10,000 ft. MSL unless the MAJCOM has approved a higher speed IAW paragraph 5.9.5.
       5.9.2.2. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS at or below 2,500 ft. AGL within 4
       NMs of the primary airport of a Class C or Class D airspace area unless authorized by
       ATC, or required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed specified in the
       aircraft T.O.
       5.9.2.3. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS in the airspace underlying a Class B
       airspace area or in a VFR corridor designated through Class B airspace area, unless
42                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


     required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed specified in the aircraft
     T.O.
  5.9.3. Outside the NAS. The PIC will not allow the aircraft to exceed 250 KIAS below
  10,000 ft. MSL unless: in international airspace and mission requirements dictate; ICAO or
  host nation rules permit or it is necessary to maintain the minimum safe airspeed in the
  aircraft T.O.
  5.9.4. Holding. Conduct holding at airspeeds prescribed in FLIP or MDS-specific guidance.
  5.9.5. FAA Speed Authorization. The FAA recognizes that certain military operations and
  training requirements cannot be met under the terms of the 14 CFR §91.117, Aircraft Speed,
  and has therefore granted a speed authorization to the USAF.
     5.9.5.1. Use of FAA Speed Authorization. In the NAS, PICs may operate USAF
     aircraft in excess of 250 KIAS, below 10,000 ft. MSL, only under the following
     conditions:
         5.9.5.1.1. Within restricted areas or Military Operating Areas (MOAs).
         5.9.5.1.2. Within DoD/FAA mutually developed instrument routes or DoD
         developed visual routes. (Do not exceed 250 KIAS on SR routes).
         5.9.5.1.3. Within unpublished joint MAJCOM- and FAA-designated areas or routes.
         This provision is intended to accommodate speed requirements, as necessary to
         accomplish the national defense mission, on an interim basis until the area/route can
         be published
         5.9.5.1.4. On MAJCOM-approved large exercises or short-term special missions
         with appropriate coordination to ensure awareness of the nonparticipating flying
         public.
         5.9.5.1.5. When the aircraft T.O. requires or recommends a higher speed in order to
         maintain safe maneuverability. If the safe maneuvering airspeed in the T.O. is listed
         as a range, fly the slowest speed practical in that range, based on weight and
         configuration. This provision is primarily to accommodate climbs/descents and
         terminal area operations. Airspeeds applicable to this exemption must be published
         in the aircraft T.O. (Dash-1). A MAJCOM supplement or MDS-specific Volume 3
         does not constitute the aircraft flight manual as referenced in the FAA exemption.
            5.9.5.1.5.1. (Added-ACC) Aircrew flying in CONUS below 10,000 MSL
            (outside special use airspace) will fly at speeds at or below 250 knots unless
            maneuvering airspeeds published in the aircraft T.O. dictate otherwise. If safe
            maneuvering airspeeds for a particular phase of flight are not yet contained in the
            aircraft T.O., use the following guidance. If the safe maneuvering airspeed is
            listed as a range, fly the slowest speed practical in that range, based on weight and
            configuration.
                5.9.5.1.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) Descent into a MTR:
                  5.9.5.1.5.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) If the MTR entry point contains
                  mountainous/rough terrain, the safe maneuvering airspeed for TFR descent
                  is 400 KCAS for F-15E/F-16/F-35 aircraft. B-1 and F-15E aircrews will
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            43


                    accomplish TFR descents under radar control or radar flight following to the
                    maximum extent practical.
                  5.9.5.1.5.1.2. (Added-ACC) If the route abort, TFR fly-up or unplanned
                  climb causes the aircraft to exit the MTR, slow to safe maneuvering airspeed
                  after terrain/obstacle clearance is assured. Avoid federal airways and class
                  A/B/C/D airspace. If flight members are required to keep route timing in order
                  to maintain element integrity but are unable to re-enter the MTR, they will
                  climb above 10,000 MSL before increasing airspeed.
                  5.9.5.1.5.1.3. (Added-ACC) VFR traffic pattern: The safe maneuvering
                  airspeed for the VFR traffic pattern is IAW the applicable aircraft T.O. The
                  safe maneuvering airspeed for fighter tactical initial is 350 knots.
                  5.9.5.1.5.1.4. (Added-ACC) Air-to-Air (A/A) system checks: to the
                  maximum extent practical, F-15/F-22/F-35 flight leads will accomplish A/A
                  system checks above 10,000 MSL. If unable to accomplish A/A checks above
                  10,000 MSL, use safe maneuvering airspeeds for formation flights outlined in
                  applicable aircraft T.O. or AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3 to conduct A/A
                  checks below 10,000 MSL.
              5.9.5.1.5.2. (Added-ACC) Aircrews flying outside CONUS will follow gaining
              MAJCOM, theater or Host Nation guidance on airspeeds. If no gaining
              MAJCOM, theater or Host Nation guidance exists, use this guidance to the
              maximum extent practical.
5.10. Large Scale Exercises. MAJCOMs will conduct large-scale exercises in permanent or
temporary special-use airspace established according to FAA Handbook 7400.2 and FAA JO
7610.4. When MAJCOMs approve large-scale exercises or short-term special missions they will
ensure information on approved activities is available to the non-participating flying public and
coordinate these operations with:
   5.10.1. Affected non-participating military flying units.
   5.10.2. Affected FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCCs).
   5.10.3. Affected FAA regions through the Air Force representative (AFREP).
   5.10.4. Other agencies, as appropriate.
   5.10.5. (Added-ACC) Exercise planners will pre-brief the base AOF/CC on all overflights
   IAW AFI 13-203.
   5.10.6. (Added-ACC) Airfield overflights require prior approval by MAJCOM/A3T. All
   requests for overflight will include the above information plus a unit point of contact for
   participating aircrews. Both the requesting and participating wing or group commander (if
   different) will approve these missions.
   5.10.7. (Added-ACC) At civilian bases where ACC, AFRC or ANG units are
   tenant/associate units, coordinate approval for overflights and ground training exercises with
   local host military unit/organization and the airfield manager prior to initiating.
   5.10.8. (Added-ACC) Simulated airfield attacks for purposes that do not meet the guidance
   criteria for aircraft overflights or are not in support of a base exercise require prior approval
 44                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   by MAJCOM/CC and a waiver to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules. Do not fly
   airfield attacks without prior HHQ approval and FAA waiver.
5.11. Airport Operations.
   5.11.1. Ground Operations. Pilots shall comply with AFI 11-218, Aircraft Movement on
   the Ground, and locally-published procedures as applicable.
      5.11.1.1. UAS-specific Ground Operations.               In the absence of MDS-specific
      MAJCOM guidance, PICs must not taxi a RPA prior to takeoff, or after landing, from a
      control station that does not have a line-of-sight link with the RPA.
      5.11.1.2. In the absence of MAJCOM guidance, RPA will not taxi on a controlled
      surface without an escort present who is in continuous communication with the pilot.
      Exception: If the RPA lands at a divert location where no local procedures exist and ATC
      has an unobstructed view of the RPA, the controller may clear the RPA to taxi if deemed
      necessary to vacate its position.
      5.11.1.3. PICs will ensure the aircraft propulsion and all power sources are shut down as
      soon as practical after landing and clearing the controlled surface areas if at a location
      with no GCS and/or unit ground personnel.
      5.11.1.4. If no unit personnel are present to safeguard the RPA, the pilot will coordinate
      appropriate aircraft security until retrieval of the aircraft by military personnel.
      5.11.1.5. MAJCOMs must establish or approve hung ordnance, hot brakes, and other
      safety procedures to ensure the safety of ground personnel, to include diverts.
   5.11.2. Clearances. Obtain clearance from ATC before taxiing, taking a runway, or any
   takeoff or landing at an airport with an operating control tower.
   5.11.3. Taxi Clearance. If a taxi route requires crossing any runway, pilots will hold short
   until obtaining specific clearance to cross each runway. Do not taxi across or onto the
   assigned runway without clearance from ATC.
      5.11.3.1. Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS). Pilots of USAF
      aircraft must obtain MAJCOM-directed training and certification before participating in
      actual SMGCS taxi operations. MAJCOMs shall publish MDS-specific guidance for
      aircrews required to operate at SMGCS locations in low visibility.
   5.11.4. Uncontrolled Field Procedures. Use the runway favored by the winds if no other
   factors make that runway unacceptable. Announce your activities on the appropriate
   frequency. (Refer to the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and AFMAN 11-217,
   Volume 2, Visual Flight Procedures, for specific procedures.) In the absence of MAJCOM-
   specific guidance, UAS operations are prohibited at uncontrolled fields when other traffic is
   present.
      5.11.4.1. (Added-ACC) ACC assets, with the exception of Personnel Recovery (PR) C-
      130 and HH-60 aircraft, are not authorized to land or depart at uncontrolled airfields or
      airports without ACC/A3 approval. AFRC assets, with the exception of PR C-130 and
      HH-60 aircraft, are not authorized to land or depart at uncontrolled airfields or airports
      without AFRC/A3 approval.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           45


       5.11.4.2. (Added-ACC) Uncontrolled operations at ACC airfields are not authorized
       except as outlined below (this includes any runway surface located on ACC bases or
       ranges).
           5.11.4.2.1. (Added-ACC) Wing Commanders may request ACC/A3 approval for
           uncontrolled airfield operations at ACC airfields and runways IAW AFI 13-204,
           paragraph 5.5.4 and paragraph 5.11.4.2.2 (Added) below.
           5.11.4.2.2. (Added-ACC) In addition to the requirements in AFI 13-204, a formal
           ORM assessment must be accomplished and procedures must be published in a base
           operating instruction or base flying regulation. The instruction or regulation must be
           approved by ACC/A3 and, at a minimum, will include:
a. Hours of operation.
b. Type of aircraft authorized/involved.
c. Designated runways/operating areas authorized for uncontrolled operations.
d. Published procedures in appropriate Flight Information Publications.
e. Common operating frequency.
f. Procedures to record common operating frequency.
g. Procedures to deconflict traffic patterns with all airports within 10NM.
h. Establishing a responsible agent(s) (Operations Duty Officer, etc) for all organizations
conducting uncontrolled operations.
(1) Responsible agent(s) must be present during uncontrolled operations.
(2) Responsibilities and authority of responsible agent(s) must be clearly defined.
(3) A formal training plan/program must be established for training responsible agent(s).
i. Procedures for scheduling uncontrolled operations.
j. Procedures for briefing users on airfield conditions (construction, etc).
k. Procedures for reporting and disseminating emergency information affecting airfield
conditions (i.e. conditions created by uncontrolled operations that will affect operations when the
airfield re-opens).
l. Procedures and requirements for weather briefings.
m. Procedures to educate vehicle operators on uncontrolled airfield operations and runway
access.
n. Agency responsible for conducting runway/airfield checks prior to uncontrolled operations.
o. Procedures to inform base agencies of commencement/termination of uncontrolled operations.

           5.11.4.2.3. (Added-ACC) TDY or tenant units may participate in uncontrolled
           airfield operations at ACC airfields with the above restrictions and a signed
           Memorandum of Understanding by both the host and TDY/tenant unit OG/CC or
           equivalent.
   5.11.5. Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). USAF fixed-wing pilots are
   prohibited from accepting LAHSO clearances.
       5.11.5.1. Pilots of USAF aircraft may passively participate in LAHSO (land or take-off
       when another aircraft has been given a LAHSO clearance). The PIC is the final authority
       whether to take-off, land or continue a touch-and-go when a merging aircraft has received
       a LAHSO clearance.
46                                       AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


     5.11.5.2. MAJCOMs of units that require active LAHSO participation for mission
     accomplishment must contact HQ AFFSA/A3OF to ensure MDS-specific data is
     incorporated into FAA Order 7110.199 (Appendix 3).
  5.11.6. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). MAJCOMs may approve non-
  formation RSRS operations. Procedures are specified by affected ATC and user units.
  MAJCOM approval shall include MDS-specific RSRS criteria governing similar and
  dissimilar landing/touch-and-go/low approach operations.
     5.11.6.1. (Added-ACC) Wings may authorize RSRS to maximize runway acceptance
     rates. ACC bases are authorized to use the following RSRS standards between ACC
     aircraft when air traffic controllers are able to see the aircraft involved and determine
     distances by references to suitable landmarks. The OG/CC will establish procedures
     based on the guidance below:
        5.11.6.1.1. (Added-ACC) Deployed aircraft are authorized RSRS if a letter of
        agreement is signed between the host wing and deployed unit. Host wings will ensure
        a detailed briefing is conducted prior to local flying.

   5.11.7. Turns after Takeoff, Low Approaches, or Closed Patterns. Do not turn after a
   takeoff, touch and go or low approach until at least 400 ft. above the Departure End of the
   Runway (DER) elevation, at a safe airspeed and past the end of the runway (if visible)
   unless: specifically cleared by the controlling agency or required by a published procedure.
   This restriction does not apply when executing a closed pattern.
   5.11.8. Traffic Pattern Procedures.
       5.11.8.1. At USAF installations fly the traffic pattern published in the local flying
       procedures publication or FLIP, unless otherwise directed.
       5.11.8.2. At other than USAF installations, fly traffic patterns as directed by the control
       tower or published in FLIP, CFR Part 91 Subpart B, or the AIM.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                        49


      5.11.8.3. At airports with no control tower, follow the standard light signals or visual
      indicators that prescribe the direction of traffic and landing runway. Departures must
      comply with the appropriate route for the airport. (Refer to AIM for more information.)
      5.11.8.4. Helicopters should avoid the flow of fixed-wing aircraft. Helicopters that
      maintain compatible airspeed may fly in the rectangular pattern with fixed-wing traffic.
      5.11.8.5. (Added-ACC) Formation landings by heavy class aircraft are not authorized
      without MAJCOM approval.
      5.11.8.6. (Added-ACC) Normal and Inter. Takeoff will normally commence from the
      approach end of the runway. Aircraft subject to structural damage when taking off over
      an arresting gear cable may start takeoff immediately past the approach end arresting gear
      cable. Recompute takeoff data for each new runway takeoff position.
          5.11.8.6.1. (Added-ACC) Not applicable to helicopters.
      5.11.8.7. (Added-ACC) Normal           and     Arresting   Gear      Landing      (N/A
      helicopters). Plan to land within the designated touchdown zone of the runway. Aircraft
      subject to structural damage from landing roll over an arresting gear cable may land
      immediately past the approach end arresting gear cable (not applicable to RC-135
      aircraft). Aircraft will use AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 3 and flight manual training
      series guidance when using this option.
          5.11.8.7.1. (Added-ACC) ACC aircraft or aircraft under ACC oversight are
          prohibited from landing over a raised arresting barrier such as a MA-1A. This does
          not preclude landing over BAK 12/14 or other cables.
          5.11.8.7.2. (Added-ACC) Do not fly ACC aircraft or aircraft under ACC oversight
          into arresting cables for practice or certification. Taxi engagements are authorized
          between 70 and 120 knots.
   5.11.9. Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopters may operate from/to other than established
   landing areas (i.e., fields, highways, parks, etc.) if conducting an operational mission or a
   military requirement exists and: the pilot receives permission to use the area for landing,
   safeguards exist to permit operations without hazard to persons or property and no legal
   objections are apparent.
5.12. Night Operations. See also paragraph 2.15.3. At night, the PIC will adhere to the
following guidance:
   5.12.1. Fixed wing aircraft must not operate from a runway unless it is outlined with
   operable lighting and is clearly discernible. Covert Infrared runway lighting being used by
   qualified crews equipped with Night Vision Devices (NVDs) meets this requirement.
   Exception: MAJCOM/A3 may authorize their aircraft to operate from unlit runways or
   landing zones (or those using high-intensity runway reflective markers) with the following
   restrictions:
      5.12.1.1. Non-contingency operations are restricted to military airfields or civilian
      airports with an appropriate LOA; and,
      5.12.1.2. MAJCOM must issue MDS-specific operating instructions, including
      comprehensive risk mitigation measures (such as IR lighting requirements, NVD usage,
 50                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


       non-participating aircraft procedures, NOTAM issuance, weather and lunar illumination
       requirements and Operational Risk Management (ORM) assessments); and,
       5.12.1.3. Aircraft authorized to operate to unlit landing areas must comply with external
       lighting requirements in paragraph 5.20.
   5.12.2. In Alaska, areas located north of 60° North latitude, Antarctica, and areas located
   south of 60° South latitude, aircraft may be operated to unlighted airports during the period
   of civil twilight.
   5.12.3. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. Aircrew will preflight NVDs prior to each
   use to ensure proper operation and optimum night visual enhancement. MAJCOMs will
   prescribe the use of NVDs during aircraft operations. See also paragraph 6.3.3.
   5.12.4. Night Approaches. MAJCOMs shall determine procedures governing the use of
   instrument approaches while operating in night VMC.
       5.12.4.1. (Added-ACC) Fixed wing aircraft will comply with the following guidance:
          5.12.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Fighter/attack type aircraft (including T-38) will not
          perform night overheads unless required for formal training course, syllabus training,
          instructor proficiency or evaluation. (ANG: Units based at airfields which lack a
          precision/non-precision approach will develop an appropriate VFR procedure for
          NGB/A3 approval.)
          5.12.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) When landing at night, fly the approach procedure that
          affords the safest and most effective means for a pilot to determine both course and
          glide slope during landing. When glide slope guidance is unavailable, fly the best
          available non-precision approach.
          5.12.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) If multiple night landings are required for formal training
          course or MDS-specific Vol 1 requirements, accomplish night touch and go training
          IAW paragraph 5.18.1 (as supplemented 5.18.1) and its subparagraphs (added). When
          performing night touch and go training, an appropriate visual glide slope indicator or
          ILS glide slope information will be used to monitor glide slope position.
       5.12.4.2. (Added-ACC) At Forward Operating Locations (FOLs) with limited
       instrument approaches/airfield lighting, the OG/CC or AEG/CC will designate the
       minimum lighting/instrumentation required for safe night operations.
5.13. Landing Gear Reporting Procedures. Pilots operating retractable gear aircraft must
report "gear down" to the ATC agency or runway supervisory unit after extending the landing
gear. This report shall be made during any approach to an airport prior to crossing the runway
threshold.
5.14. Altitude Requirements. Except for MAJCOM-approved aerial demonstrations/events or
during takeoff or landing, do not operate aircraft:
   5.14.1. Emergency Landing. Below an altitude that, should an emergency landing become
   necessary, creates undue hazard to persons or property.
   5.14.2. VFR. Above 3,000 ft. AGL under VFR at altitudes or flight levels other than those
   specified in FLIP. In airspace under FAA jurisdiction, these altitudes do not apply when
   turning or holding in a holding pattern of 2 minutes or less.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           51


   5.14.3. Congested Areas. Over congested areas (i.e., cities, towns, settlements) or groups
   of people if the altitude does not ensure at least 1,000 ft. above the highest obstacle within a
   2,000-ft. radius of the aircraft. Pilots flying helicopters in FAA airspace or operating IAW
   host nation agreements may operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not
   create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.
   5.14.4. Non-congested Areas. Over non-congested areas at an altitude of less than 500 ft.
   AGL except over open water, in special use airspace (SUA), or in sparsely populated areas.
   Under such exceptions, pilots must not operate aircraft closer than 500 ft. to any person,
   vessel, vehicle, or structure. Pilots flying helicopters in FAA airspace may operate at lower
   altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the
   surface.
   5.14.5. Flight over National Recreation Areas and Wildlife Refuges. Less than 2,000 ft.
   AGL (mission permitting) over: National Park Service monuments, seashores, lake shores,
   recreation and scenic river ways; US Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and ranges; and US
   Forest Service wilderness and primitive areas. This paragraph is not applicable to SUA, low-
   altitude tactical navigation areas and MTRs. Specific areas may require higher altitudes (see
   FLIP and sectional aeronautical charts).
   5.14.6. Disaster Areas. Within a designated disaster area unless the aircraft is: aiding the
   area, specifically cleared by ATC or can fly to or from an airport in the area without
   hampering or endangering relief activities. Pilots must check NOTAMS for disaster areas.
   5.14.7. (Added-ACC) Companion Training Program (CTP). T-38 Companion Trainer
   Program aircraft are authorized to fly Military Training Routes (MTRs).
       5.14.7.1. (Added-ACC) The following rules apply to all CTP aircraft. Minimum
       altitudes are:
           5.14.7.1.1. (Added-ACC) 1,000 feet AGL in mountainous/non-mountainous terrain
           for U-2 aircrew.
5.15. Altimeter Settings. Set altimeters according to FLIP GP, FIH and AP-series documents.
Use temperature correction tables when appropriate. Flight in IMC below FL 180 is not
permitted in any area where the barometric pressure is lower than 28 or higher than 31 inches of
mercury (See AIM 7-2-1 for more information).
5.16. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   5.16.1. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to simulated instrument flight:
   5.16.1. (ACC) Restrictions. Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged without
   the use of vision-restricting devices. Pilots will comply with the guidance in paragraph 5.16.1
   of the basic instruction.
       5.16.1.1. The aircraft must be equipped with a functional two-way radio.
       5.16.1.2. A safety observer, able to see outside at all times, should accompany the flight,
       either as a crewmember or in a chase aircraft. If a chase aircraft is used, maintain
       continuous visual contact and two-way communications between aircraft. A safety
       observer is defined as an instrument qualified pilot, a fighter weapons systems operator
       (or other MAJCOM-designated aircrew member) with access to a set of flight controls.
 52                                          AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


      5.16.1.2. (ACC) For Companion Trainer Program aircraft, the safety observer must be a
      pilot qualified in that particular aircraft.
      5.16.1.3. MAJCOMs may authorize UAS to conduct simulated instrument flight
      provided the aircraft has sense and avoid capabilities as outlined in paragraph 5.4.2.
   5.16.2. Practice Instrument Approaches. Approaches conducted in other than actual IMC.
   The pilot must still be able to see the ground, surrounding terrain, and when established on
   the final segment of the approach, the airport environment. Practice instrument approaches,
   including approaches flown under VFR will be conducted IAW Chapter 8 of this instruction.
   Practice approaches may be conducted without a safety observer (as defined in paragraph
   5.16.1.2) if the pilot is instrument qualified and current in the type of approach flown. When
   flying a practice approach without a safety observer, the pilot must maintain a composite
   crosscheck that maintains situational awareness with terrain and other traffic. The pilot is not
   relieved of the responsibility to see and avoid other traffic, terrain and obstacles.
   5.16.3. Vision Restricting Devices. MAJCOMs must approve the use of vision restricting
   devices (e.g., hoods, Foggles, etc) and provide specific approval for their use during takeoffs
   and landings. Vision restricting devices will not be used without a safety observer.
   5.16.3. (ACC) Vision Restricting Devices. Hooded simulated instrument flight is
   permitted when the pilot performing simulated instrument flight is occupying the rear seat in
   aircraft with tandem cockpits. When pilots use a vision-restricting device, the safety observer
   must be an instrument qualified pilot, landing current in the aircraft and must have full view
   of the flight instruments and access to the flight controls. HH-60 aircrew will not use a hood
   or other artificial vision-restricting device for any phase of flight.
      5.16.3.1. Maintain at least 2,000 ft of obstruction clearance when using vision restricting
      devices if the safety observer is in a chase aircraft, is not qualified as a pilot, or does not
      have full view of the flight instruments and access to the flight controls.
5.17. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures:
   5.17.1. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to simulated emergencies:
      5.17.1.1. Do not practice emergency procedures with passengers on board. Non-flight
      deck crewmembers may accomplish emergency procedures or medical emergency
      training with passengers on board provided there is no interference with the cockpit crew
      and mission requirements.
      5.17.1.2. Single pilot aircraft require day (including civil twilight), VMC.
      5.17.1.3. Multi-pilot aircraft in day IMC require weather conditions at or above
      published circling minimums for the approach to be flown.
      5.17.1.4. Multi-pilot aircraft at night require weather conditions at or above 1,000 ft.
      ceiling and 2 SMs visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher.
      5.17.1.5. (Added-ACC) Simulated compound emergency procedures are prohibited in
      Companion Trainer Program aircraft.
      5.17.1.6. (Added-ACC) Excluding Functional Check Flights (FCFs), do not use the
      landing gear and flap emergency systems to simulate hydraulic or electrical emergencies

      unless the simulation has no effect on the normal operations of those systems and does
      not deplete/exhaust/hamper the intended emergency capability.
   5.17.2. Simulated Flameout, Forced Landing, or Emergency Landing Patterns
   (SFO/ELP). At controlled fields where SFO/ELP maneuvers are conducted, the facility air
   traffic manager shall issue a letter of agreement with the appropriate military authority and
   adjacent facilities as required. The letter of agreement (LOA) shall conform to FAA Joint
   Order (FAA JO) 7610.4, chapter 9.
   5.17.3. MAJCOM Responsibilities.

      5.20.4.1. Ground Operations. Aircraft equipped with anticollision lights will display
      these lights IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.
      5.20.4.1. (ACC) Ground Operations. Anti-collision or strobe light usage is optional
      during ground operations prior to taxi and for End of Runway checks, if the PIC
      determines it would be in the best interest of safety.
          5.20.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) HC-130 only. Other than approved NVG/covert
          operations, the upper anti-collision light will be on prior to engine start. If strobe
          lights are installed, the inhibit switch will be set to the ―anti-collision‖ position prior
          to engine start.
      5.20.4.2. Airborne Operations. Aircraft equipped with anticollision and strobe lights
      will operate these lights as follows:
      5.20.4.2. (ACC) Airborne Operations. Aircraft equipped with anti-collision and
      strobe lights must operate the aircraft’s anti-collision and strobe lights to the maximum
      extent practicable.
          5.20.4.2.1. Anticollision lights must be on from takeoff to landing.
          5.20.4.2.2. Strobe lights shall be operated IAW MAJCOM or aircraft T.O. guidance.
          5.20.4.2.2. (ACC) Only HC-130s equipped with red/white strobes: Red strobe
          lights should be used at night and white strobe lights should be used during daylight.
          5.20.4.2.3. The PIC may turn off anticollision lights when required for safety.
          5.20.4.2.4. The PIC may continue a mission with the failure of any light of the
          anticollision light system to the first practical stop where repairs can be made.
   5.20.5. Landing Lights. Aircraft must have at least one operable landing light. Helicopters
   equipped with a searchlight that provides sufficient light for landing may substitute that for
   an operable landing light. Covert landing lights meet this requirement during NVD use.
      5.20.5.1. Landing lights will be illuminated below 10,000 ft. MSL, day or night, within
      operational constraints.
      5.20.5.2. When mission requirements dictate, use of landing lights is optional during
      take-off/landing, if the aircraft is equipped with an operational sensor that provides a
      visual representation of the runway environment. Operations must comply with
      paragraph 5.12.1.
      5.20.5.3. When other aircraft are operating in the pattern, landing light off operations
      should be limited to specific training and operational requirements.
5.21. Aerobatics and Air Combat Tactics. Aerobatics, air combat tactics and air to ground
tactics which involve aerobatic type maneuvering must be performed in SUA, ATC-Assigned
Airspace (ATCAA), MTRs or host nation approved airspace IAW the guidelines in AFI 11-214,
Aircrew, Weapons Director, and Terminal Attack Controller Procedures for Air Operations.
Aircraft deployed or based at overseas locations will operate IAW applicable host nation
agreements or ICAO SARPs. If the aircraft operating requirements (altitude requirements,
maximum airspeeds, dropping of objects, etc) dictated in the host nation agreement are less
restrictive than USAF/MAJCOM guidance, the most restrictive guidance shall be used.
 56                                          AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   5.21.1. (Added-ACC) The minimum altitude for performing aerobatics and Air Combat
   Training (ACT) is 5,000 feet AGL or as stated in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 3,
   whichever is higher. Aerobatic maneuvers are authorized below 5,000 feet AGL to the extent
   necessary to accomplish the low altitude training events authorized in AFI 11-2 MDS-
   Specific, Volume 1.
5.22. Participating in Aerial Events.
   5.22.1. The PIC will ensure compliance with AFI 11-209, when participating in aerial
   events, demonstrations, and static displays.
   5.22.2. When a NOTAM imposes a TFR during an airshow, major sporting event, natural
   disaster, etc, no aircraft may operate in the designated airspace except IAW the authorization,
   terms and conditions of the TFR.
5.23. Tobacco Use on USAF Aircraft. Tobacco use is prohibited on USAF or contract aircraft.
5.23. (ACC)Use of tobacco products aboard any ACC aircraft, aircraft under ACC
oversight, or within RPA ground control stations including the control element is
prohibited.
5.24. Landing With Hot Armament. MAJCOMs will ensure units develop procedures for
handling aircraft that land with live armament to ensure the safe conduct of such operations.
5.24. (ACC)Landing with Hot Armament. Units will develop and follow local procedures for
handling aircraft landing with hot armament to be published in the local supplement to the AFI
11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 3 and the base-specific Instruction 11-250 (if applicable).
   5.24.1. Before landing with hot armament or practice munitions at any airfield where such
   procedures are not known, the PIC must:
       5.24.1.1. Advise the tower of the circumstances, and
       5.24.1.2. Advise transient alert and other appropriate agencies, and
       5.24.1.3. Request taxi instructions to a designated safe (de-arm) area.
   5.24.2. After landing, the PIC must:
       5.24.2.1. Avoid taxiing into an area that could threaten personnel or equipment, and
       5.24.2.2. Ensure the ground crew is aware of the armament on board, and
       5.24.2.3. Request assistance from the nearest Air Force facility, if necessary.
5.25. Pilot Reporting Procedures. In addition to the reporting requirements listed elsewhere in
this instruction, AIM, AFMAN 11-217 series, or ICAO/host-nation instructions, pilots will
report:
   5.25.1. Position. Pilots will report their position as requested by ATC and as required by
   host-nation or ICAO flight procedures in uncontrolled airspace. Use the position reporting
   format found in the En route Supplement.
   5.25.2. Hazardous Laser Activity. Pilots will report any hazardous laser activity
   encounters IAW AIM 7-5-12 and AP/1. Laser encounters can be extremely perilous, see AFI
   11-301, Volume 4, Aircrew Laser Eye Protection, for specific aircrew actions and more
   information on protection from laser illumination.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                         57


   5.25.3. Pilot Reports (PIREPs). Pilots will immediately report hazardous weather
   conditions, volcanic activity, and large concentrations of birds or wildlife on or near the
   airport/airfield to the ARTCC, terminal ATC, or FSS. Additionally, pilots are urged to report
   any significant flight condition information. Pilots operating in warning areas should
   forward significant weather reports to the appropriate controlling agency (e.g., ARTCC,
   military radar unit, Airborne Warning and Control System, etc). In all cases, follow up with
   a report to a Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) to ensure rapid dissemination to other using
   agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
5.26. Operations in the vicinity of hazards. Unless MAJCOM-approved, USAF aircraft will
not be operated in any forecast or actual severe condition (e.g. severe icing, turbulence, actual
Bird Watch Condition SEVERE, etc). See AFH 11-203 and AFI 91-202 for detailed information.
   5.26.1. Takeoff, Approach, and Landing. Pilots will not takeoff, land, or fly an approach
   at an airport where thunderstorms or other hazardous conditions are producing hail, strong
   winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, lightning, windshear, and (or) microbursts.
   5.26.1. (ACC) In the vicinity of the airport of intended takeoff and/or landing, maintain at
   least 5 NM separation from heavy rain showers. The OG/CC or designated representative
   may authorize approaches or departures if thunderstorms are officially observed to be closer
   than 10 NM from the airport. Thunderstorms must not be producing hazardous conditions at
   either the airport or in the landing or takeoff corridors being used. Thunderstorms must not
   be forecast or observed to be moving in directions that threaten either the airport of
   landing/takeoff corridors.
       5.26.1.1. Bird Watch Condition (BWC). In the absence of MAJCOM or MDS-specific
       BWC guidance, USAF pilots will comply with the following:
       5.26.1.2. BWC MODERATE: Operational commanders will consider restricting
       formation departures, approaches, and pattern work. To increase the chances of seeing
       and avoiding birds, PICs should avoid hard turns or excessive climb angles. During
       BWC Phase II periods, PICs will accomplish one approach to a full stop unless mission
       needs warrant additional approaches and sufficient fuel exists to divert if BWC changes
       to SEVERE.
       5.26.1.3. BWC SEVERE: PICs shall not conduct flight operations except in an
       emergency. Arriving aircraft will either hold awaiting a lower BWC, or will divert.
       Non-emergency landings in BWC SEVERE require risk acceptance approval by the
       operations group commander (or airbase wing commander if no OG/CC) responsible for
       the airfield’s flight operations.
       5.26.1.4. Civil or Foreign Fields. PICs will follow BWC MODERATE procedures if
       they receive a civilian ATC/ATIS hazard advisory to use caution for birds in the vicinity.
       5.26.1.5. PICs can expect NATO countries to comply with NATO STANAG 3879. Use
       this intensity conversion: 0-4: low, 5: medium, 6-8: severe. Risks warning updates for
       NW Europe can be obtained via: https://www.notams.jcs.mil/common/birdtam.html.
   5.26.2. Thunderstorms. Pilots shall not intentionally operate into a thunderstorm except
   when operating on a MAJCOM-approved mission specifically requiring thunderstorm
   penetration. Damaging lightning strikes, electrostatic discharges and hail encounters can
58                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


  occur in apparently benign conditions. Pilots shall not fly in IMC in the vicinity of actual
  thunderstorms without operable radar, unless specifically approved by the MAJCOM.
  5.26.3. Flight Planned Route. When forecast, observed or reported hazardous weather
  activity (thunderstorm or other severe weather condition) affects the planned route, pilots
  will alter the route of flight to avoid the hazard, delay the scheduled mission or proceed to a
  suitable alternate. Pilots shall use all available information including ground and on-board
  radar, PMSV, and PIREPs to avoid hazardous or severe weather conditions.
  5.26.3. (ACC) Flight Planned Route. Avoid thunderstorm activity by any means available
  by at least:
     5.26.3.1. (Added-ACC) 20 NM laterally at or above FL 230.
     5.26.3.2. (Added-ACC) 10 NM laterally below FL 230.
  5.26.4. Wake Turbulence and Windshear. Pilots will:
     5.26.4.1. Report Wake Turbulence. Notify ATC when encountering wake turbulence.
     Pilots should observe wake turbulence avoidance criteria in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 3,
     Supplemental Flight Information, and FLIP.
     5.26.4.2. Report Windshear. Immediately report a windshear or microburst encounter
     on takeoff, approach or landing to the most appropriate agency (e.g., control tower,
     approach control, PMSV) and if possible include: the altitude, loss or gain in airspeed or
     altitude, the type of aircraft and the location of occurrence (see AFH 11-203, Volume 1).
  5.26.5. Volcanic Activity. Unless conducting rescue operations or when authorized by the
  MAJCOM/A3, pilots of Air Force aircraft will not operate in an area of known or reported
  hazardous volcanic activity. MAJCOMS may issue MDS-specific guidance on ground and
  flight operations, including pilot actions for inadvertent ash encounters and ash avoidance
  criteria for areas of known or forecast hazardous volcanic ash concentrations. In the absence
  of MAJCOM guidance, pilots shall not plan to operate within 50 NM of any hazardous
  volcanic ash without MAJCOM/A3 approval. Consult an authorized weather source (see
  para. 2.6.) for current Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) ash cloud information (or
  SIGMET). If unable to contact an authorized weather source, pilots will consider those areas
  identified on international VAAC depictions (or SIGMETs) as hazardous. In ground or flight
  operations, any encounters with volcanic ash should be reported as soon as possible to the
  appropriate controlling agency and aircraft maintenance authorities. In all cases, follow up
  with a report to a PMSV, or other applicable weather agency, to ensure rapid dissemination
  to other using agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
     5.26.5.1. (Added-ACC) Operations in Areas of Volcanic Ash Activity. Review all
     NOTAMS and Air Traffic Control directives for current status of volcanic activity. To
     the maximum extent possible, avoid flight in areas of known volcanic ash activity
     (volcanoes producing ash and the ash cloud) by 50 NM unless operational necessity
     dictates and is ACC/A3 approved. See AFH 11-203V1, Weather for Aircrews, for
     additional guidance.
  5.26.6. Freezing Precipitation (Ice/Snow/Frost). Pilots will not takeoff with ice, snow,
  frost or other contamination adhering to the wings, control surfaces, propellers, engine inlets,
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                         59


   or other critical surfaces of the aircraft, unless authorized by the program manager or flight
   manual.
      5.26.6.1. A thin coating of frost is permitted on the fuselage, provided the lettering
      and/or paint lines are visible.
      5.26.6.2. Light frost (up to 1/8 inch thick) caused by supercooled fuel is permitted on the
      lower wing surface (i.e., below the fuel tank area) if the fuselage and all other control
      surfaces are free of all icing. If deicing is required on any other aircraft surface, the
      underwing frost shall also be removed.
      5.26.6.3. Information on the removal and prevention of frozen precipitation is contained
      in AF T.O. 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing, De-Icing and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft available at
      https://www.toindex-s.wpafb.af.mil.
          5.26.6.3.1. Approved annual deicing/anti-icing holdover tables are available at the
          HQ AFFSA/A3OF website: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3of.
5.27. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Aircraft equipped with
TCAS shall operate in the TCAS mode that provides both Traffic Alerts (TAs) and Resolution
Advisories (RAs) unless the provisions of paragraph 5.27.2, MAJCOM guidance, mission
requirements or host nation agreements dictate otherwise.
   5.27.1. Response to TCAS Alerts. Pilots shall respond to all RAs as directed by the TCAS
   system unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the aircraft (e.g., descent into
   obstacles).
      5.27.1.1. Pilots shall not deviate from an assigned ATC clearance based solely on TA
      information. Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe separation.
      5.27.1.2. In the event of an RA, alter the flight path only to the extent necessary to
      comply with the RA.
      5.27.1.3. Pilots who deviate from an ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify
      ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and promptly return to the current ATC
      clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new clearance.
      5.27.1.4. If a TCAS RA requires maneuvering contrary to ATC instructions, right-of-
      way rules, cloud clearance requirements, or other VFR/IFR flight rules, pilots are
      expected to follow the TCAS RA.
   5.27.2. Formation TCAS Operations.
      5.27.2.1. Formation leads (and last aircraft, when formation length exceeds 3 NMs) shall
      operate in TA mode unless otherwise required by ATC, host nation agreement or
      specified in the MDS specific guidance.
      5.27.2.2. During refueling operations the tanker aircraft will operate in TA mode.
   5.27.3. UAS TCAS Operations. RPAs equipped with TCAS shall only operate in TA
   Mode unless specifically authorized by competent authority.
5.28. Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS). Pilots will comply with
appropriate flight manual procedures upon receipt of a Ground Proximity Warning System
(GPWS)/TAWS/Enhanced GPWS (EGPWS)/Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS)
 60                                          AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


warning. During day/VMC flight, terrain warnings need not be followed if the pilot can verify
the warning is false by visual contact with the terrain/obstacle.
   5.28.1. MAJCOMs will establish guidance on TAWS use during tactical operations.
5.29. Navigation Procedures for Higher Latitudes. (See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1)
   5.29.1. Aircraft capable of displaying only magnetic heading are prohibited from operating
   in designated Areas of Magnetic Unreliability (AMU). For areas north of 70 N and south of
   60 S that are not officially designated as AMUs, MAJCOMs will determine the highest
   allowable latitude for aircraft capable of displaying only magnetic heading.
       5.29.1.1. MAJCOMs must provide aircraft-specific operational approval prior to en route
       and terminal area operations using navigation aids oriented to true or grid.
       5.29.1.2. Outside of AMUs, aircraft unable to display true or grid heading may use
       navigation aids oriented to true or grid for en route navigation if allowed by MAJCOM.
           5.29.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) All ACC and ACC-gained aircraft may conduct en route
           and terminal area operations using navigation aids oriented in true or grid only if they
           are equipped with a heading reference capable of being displayed in true (or grid).
   5.29.2. Unless otherwise restricted by aircraft flight manual or MAJCOM directives, USAF
   aircrews are authorized to fly true or grid approaches.
       5.29.2.1. Except as noted in paragraph 5.29.2.2 aircraft must possess a true or grid
       heading source, and be able to display true or grid heading on appropriate navigation
       displays in order to fly terminal area true or grid instrument procedures in night or IMC.
       5.29.2.2. Aircraft without a true or grid heading source may fly true or grid RNAV
       (GPS) approaches and true or grid RNAV departure procedures at night or IMC provided
       the RNAV procedure includes all required magnetic course information.
5.30. UAS Abnormal Flight Operations. If ATC loses the RPA transponder signal or the
ability to determine the position or altitude of the RPA, the pilot will declare an emergency,
attempt to transmit IFF code 7700 (or 7600, if appropriate), terminate the mission, and proceed
to either home station or the nearest suitable DoD-controlled airspace/airfield for landing. The
pilot will state intentions to ATC and also provide ATC with position reports when requested for
tracking.
   5.30.1. In the event of a divert, the pilot will coordinate a route of flight and new clearance
   with ATC that minimizes any hazard to other air traffic and persons on the ground.
5.31. UAS Lost-Link Procedures. Upon confirmation of a sustained loss of command link, the
PIC will accomplish appropriate lost link procedures and notify ATC with the following
information: time of lost link, last known position, altitude, and programmed lost link routing.
The PIC shall confirm execution of appropriate lost link procedures with ATC or other means, if
practical.
   5.31.1. The PIC will ensure the RPA is programmed to follow a predictable route and
   altitude plan if it loses link. If practical, lost link routing will be programmed to maintain
   either the RPA’s last assigned clearance or include a delay to enable coordination with ATC
   prior to aircraft departing its approved working area. The PIC shall attempt to regain
   command link and will notify ATC of anticipated aircraft maneuvers. Lost link routing shall
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            61


   be planned to ensure that the aircraft has sufficient obstacle clearance and does not penetrate
   unauthorized airspace.
   5.31.2. Lost link routing will terminate in an area that provides the best chance to regain link
   or at a landing/recovery airfield. If unable to reestablish link, and in absence of MAJCOM-
   specific guidance, the PIC will inform ATC of the intended flight termination plan.
5.32. (Added-ACC) Laser Command Pointers (LCP) and Laser Eye Protection
(LEP). The list of authorized LCP and LEP is located on the HQ ACC/A3TV website. Aircrew
using LCP and LEP will follow the guidance in their MDS specific volumes 3 and the following:
   5.32.1. (Added-ACC) All aircrew and ground support personnel who routinely use LCPs
   must receive training IAW AFOSHSTD 48-139, para. 2.4., and be placed on the medical
   surveillance program IAW AFOSHSTD 48-139, para. 2.5. All aircrew members expected to
   operate in operational areas requiring LEPs must receive laser awareness training.
       5.32.1.1. (Added-ACC) Aircrews should conduct familiarization training with LCPs
       prior to field operations. This will help identify locations and angles of canopy lasing that
       1) result in significant reflections, refractions or transmission losses and 2) produce
       unnecessary or unacceptable glare effects that could degrade performance of either pilot
       or WSO.
   5.32.2. (Added-ACC) LEP will be worn when:
       5.32.2.1. (Added-ACC) Employing a handheld LCP.
       5.32.2.2. (Added-ACC) A reflection hazard exists (e.g., inside the cockpit).
       5.32.2.3. (Added-ACC) Observing or assisting in a ground test of an LCP.
       5.32.2.4. (Added-ACC) In a designated landing zone (LZ) or terminal area (TA) and
       the use of laser pointers is anticipated.
       5.32.2.5. (Added-ACC) LEP with side protection must be worn when employing LCP
       in a cockpit, where a reflection hazard exists or during a ground test.
   5.32.3. (Added-ACC) Put on LEP (when required) prior to removing the LCP safety cap.
   Flight leads/aircraft commanders will confirm LCP employing flight members/aircrew are
   wearing LEP prior anyone employing an LCP under any conditions where a reflection hazard
   exists.
   5.32.4. (Added-ACC) Remove and stow LEP prior to take-off, air refueling and landing
   (N/A for enlisted aircrew positions).
   5.32.5. (Added-ACC) All aircrew will comply with the following procedures:
       5.32.5.1. (Added-ACC) Fixed-wing flight leads will ensure a minimum of 1,000-foot
       separation between LCP employing aircraft and other aircraft. (Assumes no magnifying
       devices are being used.)
       5.32.5.2. (Added-ACC) If all personnel in the area to be designated are wearing LEP,
       the minimum LCP employment altitude is:
          5.32.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) Fixed-wing aircraft: 1,000 ft AGL.
 62                                          AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


          5.32.5.2.2. (Added-ACC) Rotary-wing aircraft: No minimum altitude provided the
          LCP is not pointed toward any aircraft, person or specular surface (i.e., water, glass,
          mirrors, reflecting surfaces etc.).
      5.32.5.3. (Added-ACC) If non-LEP equipped personnel are in the area to be designated,
      minimum LCP employment altitude is 3,000 feet AGL or 3,000 feet slant range from the
      target.
      5.32.5.4. (Added-ACC) LCPs should not be employed if the absence of personnel using
      image magnifying devices in an area to be designated cannot be verified. If LCPs must be
      used under such conditions for training, they may only be employed at ranges or altitudes
      exceeding the Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD) for viewing with 12cm
      telescopes (see ACC Approved Laser Devices listing on HQ ACC/A3TV website). Use
      under these conditions during contingency operations must be assessed for risk to
      unprotected personnel.
      5.32.5.5. (Added-ACC) Flight leads/aircraft commanders will make a "laser safe" call
      when LCP use is terminated and the safety cap is in place.
   5.32.6. (Added-ACC) Aircrew should exercise caution when employing LCPs in the
   vicinity of night vision equipment and infra-red sensors. Potential damage to these systems
   with subsequent degradation in mission performance can occur.
      5.32.6.1. (Added-ACC) After any flight potentially in the vicinity of laser operations,
      post-flight NVGs through the ground tester and ensure they are performing at the same
      level as before the flight to ensure no laser damage to the NVGs occurred.
   5.32.7. (Added-ACC) Commanders must ensure a Laser Safety Officer (LSO) has been
   designated and that they have received laser safety training IAW AFOSHSTD 48-139,
   para.2.4.
   5.32.8. (Added-ACC) Organizations must notify the installation LSO and
   Bioenvironmental Engineering prior to first use or testing of LCPs to assure training
   requirements and other controls are satisfied and to obtain assistance in establishing a laser
   controlled area for ground testing of the LCP.
   5.32.9. (Added-ACC) Unit procedures for using LCPs should follow manufacturer’s
   guidance and requirements of ACC General Flight Rules and provide procedures that will
   minimize the potential for unintentional lasing (e.g., secure storage, storage without batteries,
   use of aperture caps, etc.).
   5.32.10. (Added-ACC) Combat units must notify and obtain approval of LCP use from the
   Range Operations Officer or Range Control Officer (RCO) when training on active Air
   Force, ANG or AFRC ranges. The RCO will be notified and approve use of a laser when it

     6.2.2.3. (Added-ACC) Passengers and crewmembers will wear a seat belt, while seated
     during flight to avoid injury in the event of sudden turbulence.
     6.2.2.4. (Added-ACC) When directed by the aircraft commander.
     6.2.2.5. (Added-ACC) When mission-essential duties make the wearing of a seat belt
     impractical, aircrew members not occupying an ejection seat are exempt from wearing a
     seat belt at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
     6.2.2.6. (Added-ACC) Except when under the supervision of a qualified crewmember,
     passengers will remain seated with their seat belts fastened during air refueling
     operations.
     6.2.2.7. (Added-ACC) In helicopters, except when mission requirements dictate the use
     of another restraint device. At least one pilot will have seat belts and shoulder harness
     fastened during ground operations when rotors are turning.
     6.2.2.8. (Added-ACC) E-3, E-4 and E-8 flight engineers are exempt from wearing
     shoulder harnesses during takeoffs and landings.
  6.2.3. (Added-ACC) Personal equipment including helmets, oxygen masks, anti-G
  equipment, flight clothing, and flight gloves:
     6.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) Minimum flight clothing and aircrew flight equipment
     requirements will be IAW AFI 11-301V1 and the corresponding ACC Supplement.
     OG/CCs shall specify additional aircrew flight clothing based on mission requirements in
     the local supplement to the AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Vol 3.
     6.2.3.2. (Added-ACC) Aircrew members will wear flight clothing IAW AFI 11-301V1
     and the corresponding ACC Supplement. Aircrew members authorized to wear the Air
     Force short/long sleeve light blue blouse/shirt or civilian clothes while performing
     aircrew duties in ACC aircraft or aircraft under ACC oversight are exempt from this
     paragraph.
     6.2.3.3. (Added-ACC) All bomber crewmembers will wear helmets during initial
     takeoff/climb out, air refueling from 1/2 mile through termination of actual refueling
     operations, low altitude training routes, flight characteristics demonstration, flight below
     10,000 feet MSL and any time an armed ejection seat is occupied. Pilots will have a visor
     down during any operations exceeding 300 KIAS below 10,000 feet MSL. If the visor
     interferes with the ability to see the instruments or terrain, minimize the time spent with
     the visor up.
     6.2.3.4. (Added-ACC) When aircrew members or incentive/orientation                    flight
     participants wear flight helmets, comply with the following guidance:
        6.2.3.4.1. (Added-ACC) When crewmembers wear helmets, their hair must be loose
        and unbound, must not extend below the bottom of the collar and will not be so bulky
        that the helmet will not fit properly. Wear of the hair under the helmet must leave the
        overall shape of the head unchanged. (EXCEPTION: Female aircrew members will
        only wear hair in a bun, braids, ponytail or otherwise bunched up if the unit aircrew
        flight equipment shop can ensure proper flight helmet fit in accordance with the
        applicable technical order guidance.

          6.2.3.4.2. (Added-ACC) Female aircrew members and orientation flight participants
          must not use hard-surface hair-retention devices such as barrettes, clips or pins under
          the helmet.
          6.2.3.4.3. (Added-ACC) The use of a larger size helmet or removing layers of the
          thermal plastic liner to accommodate hair bulk to achieve a proper fit is not
          authorized (N/A for helicopter SPH-4AF helmet shell). In some cases, hair may need
          to be cut to achieve a proper fit with the helmet, even though hair length is within AFI
          36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, standards.
          6.2.3.4.4. (Added-ACC) Hair must be worn above the bottom of the collar or
          contained within the basic confines of the helmet.
          6.2.3.4.5. (Added-ACC) Hair must not interfere with snug fitting of the nape strap
          or earcups.
          6.2.3.4.6. (Added-ACC) Use of the absorbent liner (skull cap) may allow aircrew
          members with longer hair to attain proper helmet fit given the above criteria.

   Guidance will take into account the operational environment, sortie content and availability
   of rescue forces.
   6.2.5. (Added-ACC) Pressure suits above FL 500 (N/A F-22). OG/CCs shall determine
   the policy for pressure suits for flight above FL 500 (specifically establish time, altitude
   limits and recovery procedures).
6.3. Spectacles, Sunglasses, Contact Lenses, Laser Eye Protection, and NVDs.
   6.3.1. Spectacles. Crewmembers who wear corrective spectacles while performing aircrew
   duties must use only Air Force-provided spectacles and sunglasses. Crewmembers must
   carry a spare set of clear prescription spectacles while performing aircrew duties.
   6.3.2. Sunglasses. All crewmembers of USAF aircraft shall wear only Air Force-provided
   sunglasses, based on the Aircrew Flight Frame (AFF), while performing in-flight aircrew
   duty. Individuals are authorized two pair every two years, obtained through individual
   equipment supply processes.
   6.3.3. Contact Lenses. Crewmembers who desire contact lenses must consult with the

AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          69


       6.3.5.1. (Added-ACC) USAF Flight Surgeons must screen pilots who use NVG or
       NVG/HUD equipment IAW AFI 48-123 and AL-SR-1992-0002 (SGST-3).
6.4. Oxygen Requirements. (N/A for UAS ground control stations) The PIC shall ensure
sufficient oxygen for the planned mission (including contingencies) is available to all occupants
before takeoff. Normally, aircrew will use supplemental oxygen anytime the cabin altitude
exceeds 10,000 ft MSL.
   6.4.1. Unpressurized Operations. When mission essential, aircrew trained IAW AFI 11-
   403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, may operate aircraft unpressurized above
   10,000 ft. MSL without supplemental oxygen IAW MAJCOM guidance and the following
   restrictions:
   6.4.1. (ACC) Unpressurized Operations. For any scheduled mission where cockpit
   pressure will exceed 18,000 feet MSL, all aircrew members/occupants will prebreathe 100%
   oxygen for at least 30 minutes prior to the cabin altitude exceeding 10,000 feet MSL. Any
   break in this prebreathing cycle will require either starting the cycle again or removal of the
   affected individual from the flight.
       6.4.1.1. Total flight time (without supplemental oxygen) above 10,000 ft. MSL shall not
       exceed 1 hour if any portion of the flight above 10,000 ft. MSL is in IMC, at night, or
       when using NVGs, employing weapons, conducting airdrop or air-refueling, or
       performing high-g maneuvers.
       6.4.1.2. Maximum of 30 minutes (without supplemental oxygen) between 12,500 and
       14,000 ft. MSL.
       6.4.1.3. Supplemental oxygen must be used by all persons while above 14,000 ft. MSL.
       6.4.1.4. Any occupant, not trained IAW AFI 11-403, limits the cabin altitude to:
           6.4.1.4.1. 10,000 ft. to 13,000 ft. MSL for three hours without supplemental oxygen.
           6.4.1.4.2. 13,000 ft. MSL without supplemental oxygen.
       6.4.1.5. FL 250 shall not be exceeded even if occupants have oxygen (see paragraph 6.5)
   6.4.2. Pressurized Operations. Pilots flying pressurized aircraft maintaining a cabin
   altitude below 10,000 ft. will comply with Table 6.2. Each crewmember shall use
   supplemental oxygen anytime the cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 ft MSL.
       6.4.2.1. (Added-ACC) The following oxygen restrictions apply to aircrew members:
           6.4.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Bomber crewmembers will wear oxygen masks from
           initial takeoff to the initial oxygen check. Additionally, bomber pilots will wear
           oxygen masks during air refueling from pre-contact through termination of actual
           refueling operations and from the final approach fix or turn to visual final through
           landing or missed approach.
           6.4.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) In the B-1, when readily available oxygen is required, the
           helmet with oxygen mask attached satisfies this requirement, provided adequate
           oxygen sources are available.
 70                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


           6.4.2.1.3. (Added-ACC) When readily available oxygen is required, the troop
           oxygen system with troop masks installed, satisfies this requirement for aircraft so
           equipped.
   6.4.3. Procedures for Loss of Cabin Pressure. Initiate an immediate descent to the lowest
   practical altitude, preferably below 18,000 ft. MSL, but do not allow cabin altitude to remain
   above FL 250 unless occupants are wearing functional pressure suits. If any occupant lacks
   functioning oxygen equipment, descend to an altitude of 13,000 ft MSL or less (terrain
   permitting) and comply with paragraph 6.4.1.
       6.4.3.1. If cabin altitude exceeds 18,000 ft MSL following the unintended loss of cabin
       pressure, aircrew and passengers must be evaluated by a flight surgeon or other
       competent aviation medical authority prior to further flight. If cabin altitude cannot be
       determined, use the aircraft altitude at the time of the event. Report a loss of cabin
       pressurization IAW AFMAN 91-223.
   6.4.4. Decompression Sickness (DCS). If any occupant exhibits DCS symptoms, the pilot
   must descend as soon as practical and land at the nearest suitable installation where medical
   assistance can be obtained. Individuals suspected of DCS should be administered and remain
   on 100 percent oxygen (using tight-fitting mask or equivalent) until evaluated by competent
   aviation medical authority. Decompression sickness may occur up to 12 hours after landing.
   Aircrew will not fly after a DCS event without specific authorization from a flight surgeon or
   designated civil aviation medical examiner.
       6.4.4.1. (Added-ACC) To minimize the risk of developing decompression sickness
       (DCS) in pressurized aircraft operating at cabin altitudes of 21,000 - 25,000 feet without
       pressure suits, pilots will adhere to the time limits in Table 6.3 (Added). The time limit
       at or above 21,000 ft cabin altitude will be based on the highest cabin altitude flown
       during the sortie. Once the time limit is reached, pilots will land or descend to a cabin
       altitude of at or below 10,000 ft. Time spent at or below a cabin altitude of 10,000 ft
       resets the allowable duration at a one-for-one rate. Example: A pilot spends 20 minutes at
       a cabin altitude of 24,000 ft (45 min allowed per Table 6.3 (Added)) and descends to a
       cabin altitude of 10,000 ft for 20 minutes, he regains 20 minutes of exposure time and
       may climb back to a cabin altitude of 21,000 ft or higher for an additional 45 minutes
       before having to descend again. If any crewmember shows any signs of DCS, follow the
       guidance contained in paragraph 6.4.4
   6.4.5. Hypoxia. Should anyone on the aircraft experience hypoxia symptoms, the pilot will
   immediately descend to the lowest practical altitude and land at a suitable location to obtain
   medical assistance. Aircrew will not fly after a hypoxia event without specific authorization
   from a flight surgeon or designated civil aviation medical examiner.
6.5. High Altitude Operations. Without a functional pressure suit, the pilot shall maintain a
cabin altitude below FL 250 and adhere to the time limits in Table 6.1. For high-altitude airdrop
missions, use the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-409, High Altitude Mission Support
Procedures. If the aircraft lands between missions, and the time on the ground equals or exceeds
the time spent at or above a cabin altitude of FL 210, the time of allowable duration can be reset
to the maximum.

6.6. (Added-ACC) Wind and Sea State Restrictions for Ejection Seat Aircraft. Normal
flying training operations will not be conducted when surface winds along the intended route of
flight exceed 35 knots steady state over land (25 knots over water) or when the Sea State exceeds
10 feet wave height. This is not intended to restrict point-to-point operations when only a small
portion of the route is affected. If possible, alter the mission planned route to avoid the high
winds and high Sea State area. The OG/CC (or equivalent) is the waiver authority.

                                           Chapter 7

                              VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR)

7.1. General Information. PICs may fly USAF aircraft under VFR when required for mission
accomplishment. Mission examples include: operational necessity, host nation requirements,
training, proficiency or evaluation sorties, aircraft equipment that precludes IFR flight; and ATC
or NAVAID gaps that preclude IFR flight. Unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/A3,
USAF fixed-wing multi-engine aircraft will not depart VFR without ensuring they can vertically
clear published IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned departure route with one
engine inoperative. Comply with AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2, and the following:
7.1. (ACC)General Information. ACC fixed-wing multi-engine aircraft are authorized to
depart VFR even if they do not meet published IFR departure climb gradients with one engine
inoperative. The PIC will complete a thorough review of the planned departure track to ensure
terrain and obstacle clearance capability.
   7.1.1. The PIC will utilize radar advisory, monitoring or control services when practical, and
   should ensure flight following by any available means (i.e. FSS or C2 agency).
   7.1.2. The PIC will conduct planning, at a minimum, IAW paragraph 2.1., as appropriate to
   the area of operations, to ensure VFR operations are authorized and properly planned.
   7.1.3. When conditions (e.g. weather, airspace, etc.) prevent continued flight under VFR, the
   PIC will alter the route and continue operations under VFR until: the destination, obtaining
   an IFR clearance or until landing at a suitable location.
   7.1.4. PICs conducting tactical operations should fly under VFR unless compliance degrades
   mission accomplishment.
   7.1.5. RPA pilots must comply with provisions of JO 7610.4 when operating under VFR.
7.2. Weather Requirements for Filing VFR. The forecast weather for the departure, planned
route of flight and arrival ( 1 hour of the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)) must comply with
the minima in Table 7.1. or 7.2. If transitioning to IFR, the pilot shall maintain appropriate
visibility and cloud clearance requirements to a minimum IFR altitude and until receipt of the
IFR clearance. If transitioning from IFR to VFR, the PIC must maintain the appropriate
visibility and cloud clearances as soon as the IFR cancellation is acknowledged by ATC.
   7.2.1. The forecast for helicopters must comply with Table 7.1. or Table 7.2.
   7.2.2. The forecast for fixed-wing must be equal to or greater than l,500 ft. ceiling and 3
   SMs visibility.
7.3. Flight Operations under VFR. PICs shall adhere to the weather minimums listed in Table
7.1. when in FAA airspace. When outside FAA airspace, PICs shall comply with guidance in
FLIP, FCG or the ICAO VFR weather minimums in Table 7.2. PICs of VFR aircraft must at all
times be able to control the aircraft by visual reference to a discernible horizon, regardless of
cloud clearance requirements.
   7.3.1. Cold Weather Operations. USAF pilots shall apply altimeter corrections to en route
   and terrain clearance altitudes, especially when operating VFR at night. See Chapter 8.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                     75


7.4. Special VFR (SVFR). USAF fixed-wing aircraft shall not fly under SVFR. MAJCOMs
may allow helicopter aircrews to fly under SVFR IAW 14 CFR §91.157 in FAA airspace, or
appropriate host-nation guidance. Helicopter PIC’s may request SVFR clearances at airports
with the designation ―NO SVFR‖ in the Airport Facilities Directory or on the sectional chart.
7.5. VFR Over-the-Top. PICs operating VFR above a ceiling shall comply with AFMAN 11-
217V2. See also paragraph 8.18 for VFR-on-Top.

                                           Chapter 8

                           INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR)

8.1. IFR Requirements. PICs will fly USAF fixed-wing aircraft under IFR to the maximum
extent possible without unacceptable mission degradation. Pilots shall fly under IFR if:
8.1. (ACC)IFR Required. Flights under VFR radar services to, from or between training areas,
low-level routes and low-altitude tactical navigation (LATN) areas fulfill the intent of this
paragraph and may be conducted in lieu of IFR.
   8.1.1. Weather conditions do not permit flight according to VFR.
   8.1.2. Airspace rules require IFR flight (e.g. Class A airspace).
   8.1.3. Operating in excess of 180 KTAS within (not simply crossing) federal airways.
   8.1.4. Operating fixed-wing aircraft at night, unless the mission cannot be flown under IFR.
8.2. Practice Instrument Approaches Under VFR. MAJCOM approval is required to practice
instrument approaches under VFR. The following restrictions apply:
8.2. (ACC)Practice Instrument Approaches Under VFR. Aircrews may fly practice
instrument approaches under VFR IAW paragraph 5.16 of the basic instruction. However,
aircrews are advised flying practice approaches under VFR alleviates the air traffic controller's
responsibility for providing the required IFR aircraft separation.
   8.2.1. Maintain VFR cloud clearances and visibilities IAW Chapter 7.
   8.2.2. Terminal radar service shall be used when available.
   8.2.3. Aircrews must make all position reports IAW AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2.
   8.2.4. Pilots must request ATC authorization to fly the published missed approach.
8.3. ATC Clearance. Pilots must obtain an ATC clearance before commencing any IFR flight
that originates in or penetrates controlled airspace.
8.4. Published Instrument Procedure. A ―published‖ procedure is defined as:
   8.4.1. An instrument procedure charted in US government FLIP by the DoD/National
   Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) or FAA/National Aeronautical Charting Office
   (NACO). USAF aircrews will use NGA or NACO products when available.
   8.4.2. A procedure developed IAW AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures.
   8.4.3. Radar procedure with minimums published graphically or in FLIP Radar Instrument
   Approach Minimums section.
   8.4.4. A host nation or commercially produced procedure which is approved by the
   MAJCOM per paragraph 8.4.5.
   8.4.5. Non-US Government and Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures
   (FTIP). USAF aircrews will not fly a non-US Government (USG) published instrument
   procedure (includes commercially-produced procedures like Jeppesen or Lido) that has not
   been reviewed to ensure conformance with accepted standards by the appropriate Terminal
 80                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   Instrument Procedures (TERPS) office. This validation must be a current TERPS review
   letter (attached to the procedure or as published in the ASRR’s ―Giant Report‖) that informs
   the pilot of items that do not comply with US TERPS, ICAO PANS-OPS or NATO criteria
   (e.g. recognized obstruction clearance, weather/visibility minima, etc.). MAJCOMs shall
   establish a process to ensure initial (or update) review requests of non-USG or FTIPs are
   provided to the appropriate TERPS office 7 days prior to use.
       8.4.5.1. Prior to use, pilots shall ensure the TERPS review is current. FTIPs
       (government or commercially produced), reviewed by one TERPS office, may be flown
       by aircrews from any other MAJCOM unless precluded by their own MAJCOM.
       8.4.5.1. (ACC) ACC accepts other MAJCOM TERPS reviews of non-DoD instrument
       procedures (i.e. Jeppesen/Host Nation), provided they were conducted IAW para
       8.3.1.1.4.1. of the parent AFI and will remain valid for the required period of operations.
       If the non-DoD procedure does not meet these requirements, ACC units and ANG units
       under ACC oversight submit requests for approval through OG/CC, to HQ ACC/A3TV
       by fax (DSN 574-8675) or email (acc.dotvsrtb@langley.af.mil). AFRC units under
       ACC oversight submit requests for approval to HQ AFRC/A3V. Requests will include
       the airfield name, approach procedure(s), ICAO identifier, city, country and required
       dates for using the procedures. OG/CC will submit requests at least 2 weeks in advance to
       allow for processing. Emergency requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
       8.4.5.2. MAJCOMs must ensure crews receive adequate training prior to the initial use
       of any non-USG instrument procedure. At a minimum, this training should include the
       differences in symbology, language or translation, weather minimums, host nation
       NOTAM retrieval, equipment and airspace requirements.
       8.4.5.3. Waiver of TERPS Review. During non-standard operations (defined as an
       urgent requirement to fly short-notice: humanitarian, contingency, medical evacuation,
       ―Special‖ Access and vital State Department missions), the TERPS review may be
       waived by the applicable MAJCOM/A3 (if an O-8 or above). The MAJCOM/A3 may
       also waive the TERPS review for non-USG procedures, for which the exact same USG
       procedure exists. If the A3’s grade is below O-8, then waiver authority will lie with the
       first O-8 in the MAJCOM’s operational chain of command. This waiver authority will
       not be further delegated. If this waiver authority is exercised, MAJCOMs will ensure the
       aircrew and the applicable TERPS office are aware that the provisions of paragraph 8.4.5.
       have been waived.
8.5. Destination Requirements for Filing Purposes. See Attachment 2 for a decision tree.
   8.5.1. Destination with a Published Approach Procedure. Pilots may file IFR to a
   destination with a published instrument approach capable of being flown with navigational
   equipment aboard the aircraft.
   8.5.1. (ACC) Destination with a Published Approach. For all T-38 night operations, do
   not file to a destination (other than home field) unless there is an operational straight-in
   approach with glide path guidance.
       8.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) FLIP Availability. FLIP high and/or low instrument approach
       books will be available for the aircraft commander, pilot, navigator, boom operator, RPA
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                         81


      Ground Control Station and flight engineer, as applicable, to monitor each instrument
      procedure flown.
   8.5.2. Destination Without a Published Instrument Approach Procedure. If there is no
   compatible published approach at the destination, pilots may file a composite IFR/VFR flight
   plan to:
      8.5.2.1. A point en route where forecast weather at ETA (+ 1 hour) allows continued
      flight to the destination under VFR.
      8.5.2.2. A point served by a published approach procedure where forecast weather at
      ETA (+ 1 hour) allows the pilot to descend to VFR conditions and continue to the
      destination under VFR.
8.6. IFR Filing Weather Requirements. The following are the weather requirements for filing
to a destination:
   8.6.1. Temporary (TEMPO) Conditions. Pilots may file to a destination with a forecast
   that includes temporary (TEMPO) changes in ceiling and/or visibility lower than prescribed
   in 8.7.1., but an alternate may be required.
   8.6.2. UAS Weather Requirements. MAJCOMs may determine UAS weather limit
   requirements based on airspace rules, aircraft equipage, level of autonomy and crew
   qualifications/capabilities. In the absence MAJCOM guidance, UAS will follow weather
   requirements as published in this section.
   8.6.3. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. Weather for the ETA (±1 hour) at destination or recovery base
   must be at or above the lowest compatible published landing minimums for the aircraft
   concerned.
   8.6.3. (ACC) Fixed-WingAircraft. Fighter/Attack/CTP/MQ-1/MQ-9 aircraft commanders
   may file to a destination airport (must be a MAJCOM approved airport for MQ-1 and MQ-9)
   if weather (ceiling and visibility) is forecast to be at or above their pilot weather category
   minimums or published minimums, whichever is higher.
      8.6.3.1. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement when operational necessity dictates the
      use of a destination forecast to be below minimums, but MAJCOMs must establish
      alternate recovery procedures, such as the use of two or more alternate airports,
      additional holding fuel, etc.
      8.6.3.1. (ACC) For operational necessity, OG/CC may approve aircraft commanders to
      file to a destination airport where weather is forecast to be below the lowest published
      approach minimums (or pilot category minimums) if two suitable alternate airports are
      available and designated on the flight plan. Both alternates must be at least 45 NM apart,
      be at least 10 NM from the destination, have an operational and compatible precision
      approach and meet or exceed the criteria for alternate airport weather for filing purposes
      in AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 8.8. The aircraft will have sufficient fuel to execute an
      approach and missed approach at the destination airport, proceed to the alternate
      requiring the greatest fuel expenditure and still meet AFI 11-202V3 or appropriate AFI
      11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 3 fuel reserve requirements, whichever is higher.
      8.6.3.2. For a straight-in or sidestep approach, the forecast weather must meet only the
      published visibility requirements for that approach.
 82                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


       8.6.3.3. For a circling approach, the forecast weather must meet both the ceiling and
       prevailing visibility requirements.
   8.6.4. Helicopters. PICs may use Category A minima, regardless of approach speed. PICs
   should fly a constant airspeed to comply with the stabilized approach concept. PICs may
   reduce the Category A visibility minima on Category I procedures by one-half, but no lower
   than 1/4 SM prevailing visibility (PV) or 1,200 feet runway visual range (RVR). PICs may
   not reduce the visibility minima on Copter procedures, Category II procedures or if
   ―Visibility Reduction by Helicopters NA‖ is annotated on the procedure. PICs will apply
   any inoperative approach lighting visibility correction before reducing minima. PICs will
   apply airspeed limitations IAW Table 8.1. For more information, see Chapter 7 in FAA-H-
   8261-1A,         ―Instrument        Procedures         Handbook,         available      at:

8.7. Required IFR Alternate. This section prescribes when an IFR alternate must be filed.
MAJCOMs will determine alternate airfield policies for UAS.
8.7. (ACC)When an Alternate is Required. Designate an alternate airport in the flight plan,
regardless of forecast weather, when filing to a destination in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Guam,
Hawaii or Iceland.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                         83


  8.7.1. Weather. An alternate is required when the worst weather (TEMPO or prevailing) at
  the ETA (±1 hour) for the first point of intended landing (or each point of intended landing
  on a stopover flight plan) does not permit a VFR descent from the MIA and is less than:
     8.7.1.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft: A ceiling of 2,000 ft. and a visibility of 3 SMs.
         8.7.1.1.1. Exception: MAJCOMs may lower this requirement to a ceiling of 1,000 ft.
         and a visibility of 2 SMs, if two or more suitable independent precision approaches
         are available and operable for the airport of intended landing at ETA (±1 hour).
     8.7.1.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of 1,000 ft. (or 400 ft. above the lowest compatible
     approach minimums, whichever is higher) and a visibility of 2 SM.
  8.7.2. Additional Conditions Requiring an Alternate. Unless forecast weather for the
  ETA (±1 hour) at the destination (or a point en route) exceeds the requirements of 8.7.1. and
  permits a VFR descent from the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) to a VFR approach and
  landing, pilots must designate an alternate airport on all IFR flight plans when filing to a
  destination:
     8.7.2.1. Where all compatible approaches require radar.
     8.7.2.2. Where required NAVAIDs are unmonitored.
     8.7.2.3. When the destination has no weather reporting capability.
     8.7.2.4. When the point of intended landing’s lowest compatible approach weather
     minimums are greater than or equal to a 1,500 ft. ceiling or 3 SM visibility.
     8.7.2.5. (Added-ACC) For noncompliant aircraft or formations, when denial of
     accommodation to reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM) airspace would prevent
     the aircraft or flight from reaching its planned destination, a suitable alternate will be
     designated that does not require accommodation.
  8.7.3. Exception for Remote or Island Destinations. MAJCOMs may authorize holding
  for a specified time in lieu of an alternate for those remote or island destinations for which
  designating an alternate is not possible. MAJCOMs that authorize holding at a remote or
  island destination will prescribe weather criteria and recovery procedures.
     8.7.3.1. (Added-ACC) Consider an airfield to be a remote or island destination when its
     location precludes flight to a suitable alternate. The weather forecast for this destination
     airfield must be equal to or better than the weather requirements for an alternate airfield
     prescribed in paragraphs 8.8.1 and 8.8.2
     8.7.3.2. (Added-ACC) For B-1, E-3, E-4, E-8, E-9, U-2, C/EC/HC-130 and
     OC/RC/TC/WC-135s. If prevailing weather conditions require an alternate, these aircraft
     will have fuel on board to hold for 2 hours at the destination fix or AFI 11-2 MDS
     Specific, Volume 3 minimums, whichever is greater.
     8.7.3.3. (Added-ACC) For A/OA-10, F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-22, F-35, QF-4, T-38, HH-
     60Gs, and MC-12Ws. Compute fuel requirements using a fuel reserve as prescribed in
     AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 2.4.4, from departure to over the destination fix. Include fuel
     for 30 minutes holding at destination fix, plus fuel for the penetration and landing.
 84                                           AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


       8.7.3.4. (Added-ACC) N/A ANG. RQ-4 operations are authorized holding in lieu of
       designating an alternate. RQ-4 pilots will ensure the aircraft has sufficient fuel on board
       to hold for 2 hours at the destination then penetrate and land with normal recovery fuel.
8.8. Selecting an Alternate. Except for TEMPO conditions for thunderstorms and snow/rain
showers, the worst forecasted prevailing weather conditions for an alternate airport (ETA ±1
hour) must meet or exceed:
   8.8.1. Alternate with a Compatible Published Instrument Approach Procedure:
       8.8.1.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. A ceiling of at least 500 ft. above the lowest compatible
       approach minima and a visibility of at least 2 SM or published visibility minima
       whichever is greater.
       8.8.1.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of at least 200 ft. above, and a visibility of at least 1 SM
       above, the lowest compatible published landing minimum.
   8.8.2. Alternate without a Published or Compatible Instrument Approach
   Procedure. Forecast weather for the ETA (±1 hour) must permit a VFR descent from the
   MIA to a VFR approach and landing, or, if the mission justifies the increased risk, under
   specific conditions, an otherwise unqualified airfield may be designated as an alternate by the
   MAJCOM/A3. MAJCOMs establish UAS alternate airfield policies.
       8.8.2.1. (Added-ACC) If radar is required for the only suitable approach at the
       alternate, weather requirements at the alternate are the same as for an alternate without a
       published approach procedure (paragraph 8.8.2).
8.9. Airports That Do Not Qualify as Alternates. Except IAW paragraph 8.8.2, airports do
not qualify as alternates if:
   8.9.1. All compatible approaches require radar.
   8.9.2. GPS is the only available NAVAID.
   8.9.2. (ACC) N/A ANG. Waiver to paragraph 8.9.2. is granted for RQ-4A/B operations,
   authorizing the use of alternate airfields at which GPS is the only available NAVAID.
   8.9.3. The FLIP designation ―   A   NA‖ is displayed on all compatible approach plates.
   8.9.4. The FLIP A designation (without NA) is displayed on all compatible approach plates
   and an associated note applies. The A signifies that non-standard alternate minimums are
   published for that runway. While non-standard alternate minimums do not apply to USAF
   aircraft, there may be notes associated with the non-standard alternate minimums that do.
   Pilots must check for such notes whenever the A designation is shown on an IAP.
   8.9.5. (Added-ACC) Access to RVSM airspace is required to reach the alternate for non-
   compliant aircraft.
8.10. RVR Use, Applicability and Conversion. RVR reports, when given for a particular
runway, apply to all takeoffs, landings, and approaches to that runway, and always take
precedence over any other visibility report for that runway. RVR is normally reported in feet or
meters. Pilots will use the static RVR when available (regardless of reported variability). If only
a variable report is received and a static RVR cannot be determined, pilots will apply the lowest
reported RVR value. If necessary, pilots may convert the reported visibility from one format to
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            85


another (e.g. RVR to PV) only for takeoffs and straight-in approaches using the conversion
tables printed in the front of the Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklet. For
conversions, use the higher of: the next higher value in the conversion chart, or the highest
published value from the IAP minima block; do not interpolate.
8.11. Minimum Takeoff Weather. Pilots shall not takeoff when existing weather is below the
landing minimums for their aircraft, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM, but in no
case less than 600 RVR (200 meters).
   8.11.1. RVR Requirements. (N/A for Helicopter) Minima below 1600 RVR are not
   authorized unless the runways are equipped with centerline lights, visible runway centerline
   markings, and two operative transmissometers. All reported RVR readings must meet or
   exceed minimum authorized values.
   8.11.2. MAJCOMs that permit takeoffs when weather is lower than the published landing
   minimums shall prescribe alternative takeoff minima and substitute recovery procedures.
   8.11.2. (ACC) Takeoff Minimums (The restrictions of paragraph 8.11.1. apply when
   takeoffs below 1600 RVR are authorized below):
       8.11.2.1. (Added-ACC) C/EC/HC-130 and HH-60 aircraft will comply with AFI 11-2
       MDS Specific, Volume 3 guidance.
       8.11.2.2. (Added-ACC) Fighter/Attack/CTP aircraft must have takeoff weather equal to
       or greater than the approach and landing minimums specified in the applicable pilot
       weather category of Table 8.3 (Added) of this supplement. The OG/CC or equivalent
       may approve takeoffs when takeoff weather is below the applicable pilot weather
       category.
       8.11.2.3. (Added-ACC) Bomber/Battle                 Management/Reconnaissance/Treaty
       Verification/Tanker aircraft must have takeoff weather of 1600 feet (500 m) RVR. If
       RVR is 1000 feet to 1600 feet (300 m to 500 m), the mission must be higher headquarters
       directed and takeoff approved by the OG/CC or his designated representative.
          8.11.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) 1 ACCS (E-4) operational National Airborne Operations
          Center(NAOC) missions, NAOC Team Chief may waive takeoff RVR down to 1000
          feet (300 M).For Special Airlift Missions (SAM), takeoff RVR is 1000 feet (300 M).
          If available, both approach and departure end RVR readings will be obtained if
          takeoff RVR is reported below 1600 feet (500m). Both transmissometers must report
          at or above 1000 feet (300 M).
       8.11.2.4. (Added-ACC) Bomber/Battle                     Management/Reconnaissance/Treaty
       Verification/Tanker aircraft will file a takeoff alternate when departure airfield weather is
       below published landing minimums for that airfield. A suitable takeoff alternate airfield
       is one within 30 minutes for single/twin engine aircraft and within 1 hour for three or
       more engine aircraft at cruising speed. For a takeoff alternate airfield with an operational
       published precision approach procedure, the weather must be reported and forecast to
       remain no lower than a ceiling of 600 feet (180 m) and visibility of 2 miles (3.2 km) from
       takeoff until 1 hour after possible ETA. For a takeoff alternate airfield with an
       operational published non-precision approach procedure, the weather must be reported
       and forecast to remain no lower than a ceiling of 800 feet (240 m) and visibility of 2
 86                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


      miles (3.2 km) or ceiling of 500 feet (150 m) above and visibility 1 mile (1.6 km) above
      the lowest published landing minimum, whichever is higher, from takeoff until 1 hour
      after possible ETA (C/EC/HC-130 and HH-60 aircraft will comply with AFI 11-2 MDS
      Specific, Volume 3 guidance).
      8.11.2.5. (Added-ACC) N/A ANG. RQ-4 may takeoff in weather conditions below
      required minimums; however, the mission must be higher headquarters directed and
      takeoff approved by the OG/CC (or equivalent). Visibility must be at least 1600 feet (500
      m) RVR. When the departure airfield weather is below required RQ-4 landing minimum,
      pilots will either declare a takeoff alternate or obtain OG/CC (or equivalent) approval to
      land below RQ-4 minima at the takeoff airfield. A suitable takeoff alternate airfield is one
      within 1 hour at cruising speed, has at least a ceiling of 1000 feet and visibility of 2 miles
      and has a pre-planned RQ-4 approach and landing.
   8.11.3. Civil contract carriers may operate from airports under USAF jurisdiction using the
   takeoff minimums approved by the FAA and published in the air carrier's operations
   specifications.
8.12. IFR Departures. Pilots of USAF aircraft must adhere to IFR departure procedures
guidance in this section and in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
   8.12.1. MAJCOM Responsibility. Normally, MAJCOMs or COMAFFORs will ensure
   aircraft are tasked to takeoff at a weight that allows the PIC to comply with paragraph
   8.12.11.
   8.12.2. PIC Responsibility. The PIC will ensure the planned departure method, climb
   gradient, low close-in obstacles, route and emergency procedures are briefed to the crew
   prior to takeoff. See Attachment 3 for a decision tree.
   8.12.3. Authorized IFR Departure Methods. Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and
   Standard Instrument Departures (SID) should be flown to the maximum extent possible.
   USAF aircraft will depart IFR using only these methods:
      8.12.3.1. Published ODP; textual or graphic, including Reduced Takeoff Runway Length
      (RTRL) and Visual Climb Over the Airport (VCOA) procedures. VCOA procedures may
      also be termed VCID (Visual Climb to Instrument Departure).
      8.12.3.2. SID.
      8.12.3.3. Specific ATC Departure Instructions.
      8.12.3.4. Diverse Departures (Omni-directional Departures-ICAO).
      8.12.3.5. Special MAJCOM Certification (authorized locations, pilots and aircraft only).
      See paragraph 8.12.9.
   8.12.4. Obstacle Departure Procedures. Pilots will fly the published ODP               for the
   runway used. If issued other departure instructions, pilots should request clearance to fly the
   ODP or comply with 8.12.6.
      8.12.4.1. Visual Climb Over Airport. Pilots will not fly any VCOA procedure until
      completion of MAJCOM-specified training. The weather must be at or above the
      minimums published for the VCOA. Unless published, pilots will consider the VCOA’s
      visibility requirement as a ―remain within‖ distance, and will not exceed this radius from
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          87


     the center of the airfield while climbing to the specified altitude. Pilots will notify ATC
     (or other traffic) when planning to depart via the VCOA. Pilots without NVDs will not
     fly a VCOA at night, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM.
     8.12.4.2. Reduced Takeoff Runway Length ODP. Pilots using a published RTRL
     procedure shall ensure their aircraft can attain a safe liftoff speed and rotate prior to the
     distance remaining specified in the procedure. MAJCOMS should establish ad hoc
     RTRL request procedures for their aircrews. Ad hoc RTRL procedures will be
     considered a published ODP.
     8.12.4.3. Sector Departure ODP. Pilots may fly ―sector‖ diverse departures as
     published.
  8.12.5. Standard Instrument Departures. PICs will comply with the routing, altitudes,
  and climb gradient (including notes) published on the SID (or in the , if not published on
  the SID). If the aircraft cannot comply with an ATC minimum climb gradient, coordinate
  with ATC prior to flying the procedure or obtain an amended clearance. The term SID
  includes other approved published instrument departure procedures (DP).
  8.12.6. Specific ATC Departure Instructions. ATC instructions refer to specific
  navigational guidance (e.g. heading, routing, altitude) issued with the clearance or by tower.
  Outside the NAS, in a non-radar environment, to be considered a valid instrument departure,
  the instructions must be issued with either a minimum climb gradient or confirmation that the
  climb gradient does not exceed 200 feet/NM. Unless issued with a minimum climb gradient,
  the instructions may not provide obstacle clearance below a minimum IFR altitude.
  Therefore, in all cases:
     8.12.6.1. If the departure runway has any published climb gradients, the PIC must meet
     or exceed the highest gradient when departing via ATC instructions.
     8.12.6.2. If unable to meet any ATC climb gradient, coordinate with ATC prior to flying
     the procedure.
     8.12.6.3. Pilots are never relieved of the responsibility for terrain and obstacle avoidance.
     The radio call ―Radar Contact‖ only means the aircraft has been identified on radar.
     Responsibility is shared between pilot and controller only after navigational guidance is
     issued.
     8.12.6.4. Outside the NAS, use caution when flying radar vectors. See paragraph 8.13.2.
  8.12.7. Diverse Departures (Omni-directional Departure). Pilots will track runway
  centerline to 400 feet above the DER before turning on course. PICs must ensure their
  aircraft will vertically clear applicable low close-in obstacles published in NOTAMs or the
  Takeoff Minima and Departure Procedures (              ) before turning on course. Diverse
  departures are not authorized when an obstacle departure procedure, climb gradient or non-
  standard takeoff weather minima are published for that runway. ―Sector‖ diverse departures
  are authorized.
  8.12.8. Special MAJCOM Certification. MAJCOMs may develop departure procedures
  for their aircraft at specific locations that allow safe aircraft departure. Pilots must meet
  MAJCOM-specified training or certification requirements before these procedures may be
88                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


  flown. Once developed, these departure procedures will be sent to HQ AFFSA/A3O for
  review and inclusion in the ASRR or other appropriate location.
  8.12.9. No Authorized IFR Departure Method. If the airport does not have one of the IFR
  departure methods described above, then an IFR departure is not authorized. Refer to
  Chapter 7.
  8.12.10. Required Climb Gradients. Regardless of the IFR departure method selected,
  PICs will climb at a minimum of 200 ft/NM unless a higher gradient is published for the
  departure runway (in a departure procedure or ). For specific ATC departure instruction
  climb gradients, see paragraph 8.12.6. When no departure procedure is published and a
  diverse departure is not authorized, coordination with MAJCOM TERPS specialists is
  required to determine the best departure method and required climb gradient prior to an IFR
  departure.
     8.12.10.1. Low Close-in Obstacles. In addition to complying with the published climb
     gradient, the PIC must also ensure that the aircraft can always vertically clear applicable
     published low close-in obstacles.
     8.12.10.2. Non-Standard Takeoff Minimums. Pilots will not depart an airfield using
     non-standard takeoff minimums in lieu of meeting the required climb gradient. When
     non-standard takeoff minima are published, with or without a climb gradient, the PIC
     may not take-off under the provisions of IFR established in paragraph 8.11. unless:
         8.12.10.2.1. The departure procedure authorizes ―standard‖ takeoff minimums with a
         climb gradient in lieu of the non-standard criteria and the requirements of paragraph
         8.12.10.4 or 8.12.10.5 below are met, or
         8.12.10.2.2. The aircraft is capable of being at or above the published non-standard
         takeoff minima ceiling requirement prior to crossing the departure end of the runway
         (for fixed-wing multi-engine, calculate this capability with One Engine Inoperative
         (OEI)) and can continue a climb profile that will vertically clear all obstacles.
     8.12.10.3. Unable to meet Required Climb Gradient. If unable to meet or exceed the
     required climb gradient and before reducing a published gradient with one of the methods
     listed below, MAJCOMs will ensure supervisors and PICs consider: reducing aircraft
     gross weight, delaying the mission until environmental conditions improve, the crew’s
     familiarity with the departure area and the ability to increase performance by jettisoning
     external stores. If still unable to comply with the required gradient after exhausting the
     remedies in this chapter, an IFR departure is not authorized. Exception: If the mission
     justifies the increased risk, and if specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/A3, the pilot
     may depart any location, in VMC, without regard to the IFR climb gradient. Without
     such specific authorization, pilots will refer to Chapter 7.
     8.12.10.3. (ACC) Unable to meet Required Climb Gradient. If unable to meet or
     exceed the required IFR departure climb gradient, ACC aircrews may climb in VMC to
     the IFR MEA or depart VFR. A VMC climb to the IFR MEA or a VFR departure is to be
     used only as a last resort for mission accomplishment.
     8.12.10.4. Single Engine Aircraft and All Helicopters. PIC’s will ensure the aircraft
     meets or exceeds the published climb gradient (or 200 ft/NM if a higher gradient is not
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                        89


      published) for the selected departure to an appropriate minimum IFR altitude IAW
      paragraph 8.13.
          8.12.10.4.1. If unable to comply and when authorized by the MAJCOM, climb in
          VMC to an appropriate IFR altitude or fly VFR IAW Chapter 7.
      8.12.10.5. Multi-Engine Fixed Wing Aircraft. PIC’s will ensure the aircraft meets or
      exceeds the published climb gradient (or 200 ft/NM if a higher gradient is not published)
      for the selected IFR departure method, with One Engine Inoperative (OEI), to an
      appropriate MIA.
          8.12.10.5.1. If operationally necessary, the operations supervisor (or equivalent
          mission execution authority supervisor) may authorize the PIC to ensure the aircraft
          vertically clears all obstacles along the planned departure path OEI by subtracting up
          to 48’/NM from the published (or standard) climb gradient or the use of the departure
          runway’s SDP for OEI departure planning (IAW 8.12.11.).
          8.12.10.5.2. When using any method to reduce the required climb gradient, the PIC
          must still ensure the aircraft, with all engines operating (AEO), meets or exceeds the
          published climb gradient and all ATC or SID climb restrictions for the method
          selected.
   8.12.11. Special Departure Procedures (SDP). MAJCOMs may authorize SDPs for OEI
   departure planning when operationally necessary. The following guidance applies to the use
   of SDP’s or similar specifically designed departure procedures and/or routing for use in the
   event of the loss of an engine’s thrust. The term SDP refers to all such procedures/routing
   and not to any one particular product. All such products must be constructed from data and
   criteria specifically approved by HQ AFFSA/A3O. MAJCOMs must certify pilots prior to
   the use of SDPs. PICs must understand a SDP delivers as little as zero feet of obstruction
   clearance and must be flown exactly as published. PIC’s shall:
      8.12.11.1. Use only the most current procedure and brief the procedure prior to takeoff,
      8.12.11.2. Not exceed the maximum gross weight published for the procedure,
      8.12.11.3. Fly SDP routing that differs from clearance routing only in an emergency,
      unless approved by ATC.
8.13. Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA). This section is not applicable to climbs and descents
required for takeoff and landing or practice approaches.
   8.13.1. On Airways. Pilots shall not fly lower than the Minimum En route Altitude (MEA),
   Minimum Reception Altitude (MRA), Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA) or Minimum
   Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) published for the airway.
      8.13.1.1. Pilots using the MOCA shall ensure that the altitude selected will provide
      suitable navigation facility and ATC radio reception.
   8.13.2. Off Airways. Pilots shall fly no lower than:
      8.13.2.1. The Off Route Obstacle Clearance Altitude (OROCA).
      8.13.2.2. The Off Route Terrain Clearance Altitude (ORTCA).
 90                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


          8.13.2.2.1. Pilots using the OROCA or ORTCA shall ensure that the altitude selected
          will provide suitable navigation facility and ATC radio communication reception.
      8.13.2.3. An altitude that provides at least 1,000 ft. of clearance above all obstacles
      within 5 nautical miles of the course to be flown in non-mountainous terrain or 2,000 ft.
      in mountainous terrain (see paragraph 2.11. & Glossary).
      8.13.2.4. Descent below applicable MIAs, listed above, is only authorized under the
      following conditions:
          8.13.2.4.1. To an ATC-provided Minimum radar Vectoring Altitude (MVA) within
          the NAS from a suitably equipped and capable radar facility. For areas of
          responsibility outside the NAS, MAJCOMs will determine which radar facilities are
          not suitably equipped and capable.
              8.13.2.4.1.1. If there is any doubt as to whether the ATC-provided minimum
              vectoring altitude is providing adequate obstacle clearance pilots should not
              descend below the non-radar minimum altitudes listed above.
              8.13.2.4.1.2. In no case will the minimum altitude be below 1000 ft. AGL.
          8.13.2.4.2. When cloud clearance and visibility, IAW Tables 7.1/7.2 or MAJCOM
          direction, allow the pilot to maintain safe clearance from terrain and obstacles, or
          8.13.2.4.3. When a MAJCOM-approved self-contained navigation system (or
          approved Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance system (TF/TA)) is used.
   8.13.3. Military Training Routes (MTR). Pilots operating on MTRs shall adhere to the
   minimum altitudes published in FLIP AP.
   8.13.3. (ACC) MTRs. Minimum terrain following altitudes and altitudes suitable for flight
   in IMC for IFR operations on published low level routes will be IAW FLIP and applicable
   AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 3.
8.14. IFR Cruising Altitudes.
   8.14.1. Pilots should file requested altitudes for IFR flights in controlled airspace according
   to the cruising altitude diagram depicted on the appropriate en route chart.
   8.14.2. Pilots operating in uncontrolled airspace shall maintain altitude IAW the diagrams
   published on the appropriate en route chart.
8.15. IFR Enroute Navigation. Pilots shall fly along the centerline of the direct course
between NAVAIDS or fixes defining a published or unpublished route when operating in
controlled airspace under IFR unless:
   8.15.1. Authorized by the controlling agency, or while operating in SUA or on MTRs.
8.16. In-Flight Communications.
   8.16.1. Position Reports. A pilot operating under IFR will continuously monitor
   appropriate ATC frequencies and follow FIH instructions for position reports, lost
   communications, and radio procedures.
   8.16.2. Navigation and Communication Equipment Malfunctions. When operating in
   controlled airspace under IFR, the PIC will immediately report to ATC the loss or
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            91


   impairment of navigational or air-to-ground communications capability according to
   instructions in the FIH.
   8.16.3. Cancellation of IFR Clearance. Pilots shall ensure compliance with Chapter 7 of
   this instruction before canceling IFR. VFR flight following requirements are not required if
   already in contact with the destination’s control tower.
8.17. Descent, Approach and Landing. Pilots will obtain the latest destination airport
conditions prior to beginning descent or commencing an approach. See paragraph 8.10.
8.17. (ACC)Approach and Landing. ACC policy is to manage the exposure of
fighter/attack/CTP/M/MQ-1/MQ-9 pilots with varying capabilities and experience levels
according to the risks inherent in low-weather approaches. Prior to assigning a lower weather
category, the squadron commander, operations officer or designated representative will evaluate
a pilot's instrument proficiency inflight or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD) capable of
providing a graphic display of the approach. This is not a formal flight evaluation as described in
AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; however, certification of pilot
weather category will be documented on a Letter of Certification (Letter of Xs) IAW AFI 11-
202V2.
   8.17.1. Prior to Descent or Approach. Pilots shall not begin an en route descent, arrival or
   published approach if the destination’s weather is below the required approach minimums.
   8.17.1. (ACC) Prior to Descent or Approach. Fighter/Attack/CTP/MQ-1/MQ-9 pilots
   must have ceiling and visibility minimums for the applicable pilot weather category (Table
   8.3 (Added)) or published minimums, whichever is higher, to start an en route descent or
   published approach. Bomber/Battle management/Reconnaissance/Treaty Verification/Tanker
   aircraft flying approaches using visual requirements only must have visibility of 2400 feet
   RVR (800 m) or published minimums, whichever is higher, to start a published straight-in,
   sidestep approach or en route descent.
       8.17.1.1. After Beginning Descent or Approach. If a pilot has begun the en route
       descent, arrival or published approach (or has received a radar vector for the approach)
       and subsequently determines the weather is below minimums (visibility for straight-in
       approaches or either ceiling or visibility for circling approaches), the pilot must not
       deviate from the last ATC clearance until obtaining a new or amended clearance. The
       pilot may request a clearance to a holding fix or alternate airport, or, unless restricted by
       the MAJCOM, continue the approach as published to the Missed Approach Point (MAP)
       and land if the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway environment
       is in sight (See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1).
       8.17.1.1. (ACC) After Beginning Descent or Approach. Fighter/Attack/CTP/MQ-
       1/MQ-9 pilots will consider weather below minimums when reported weather is below
       either the ceiling or visibility of the pilot's weather category or published minimums,
       whichever is higher.
       8.17.1.2. (Added-ACC) NAOC Minimums. 1 ACCS (E-4) operational NAOC and
       SAM missions, approach minimums are as published, to include CAT II/IIIa approaches.
       8.17.1.3. (Added-ACC) 1 ACCS (E-4) weather minimums for training sorties are as
       published, but will be no lower than 200 feet ceiling/2400 RVR. The full stop landing
92                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


     may use visibility only criteria to published minimums or 2400 RVR (800 M), whichever
     is greater.
  8.17.2. Determining Visibility Minimums for Approach and Landing. Prevailing
  visibility (PV) may be used when RVR is not reported. For circling approaches, PV shall be
  used. See paragraph 8.10. MAJCOMs shall determine suitable weather minima based on
  aircraft equipage, level of autonomy and crew proficiency.
     8.17.2.1. Operational Criteria for Arriving Aircraft. USAF pilots will not use
     published visibility minima below 2,400 feet (or ½ SM or 800m) unless touchdown zone
     (TDZ) and centerline lighting (CL) are available and operable. Helicopter PICs will use
     touchdown zone RVR to determine visibility requirements.
         8.17.2.1.1. Category I (1800 RVR or greater). MAJCOMs may authorize Category I
         Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches to less than 2400 RVR at locations
         without TDZ/CL (or when such system is inoperative) provided the approach is flown
         using guidance from an approved flight director, heads-up display, or coupled to an
         autopilot flown to a Decision Altitude. In addition to MAJCOM approval,
         authorization must be stated on the IAP.
         8.17.2.1.2. Category II (1200 to less than 1800 RVR). Touchdown zone RVR will
         be used to determine if visibility is suitable for the instrument approach procedure.
         For RVR 1600 to less than 1800, mid/rollout RVR values will be used as advisory
         information. If RVR is less than 1600, rollout RVR (or mid RVR, if rollout RVR
         inoperative) is also required.
         8.17.2.1.3. Category III (RVR less than 1200). All installed transmissometers must
         be operational. MAJCOMs will publish Category III RVR requirements (i.e. in 11-
         2MDS V3), if applicable.
     8.17.2.2. Straight-In or Sidestep Approach. Weather must only be at or above the
     published visibility minimums.
     8.17.2.3. Circling Approach. Weather must be at or above both the published ceiling
     and visibility minimums.
     8.17.2.4. Inoperative Approach Lighting System (ALS). Unless paragraph 5.12.1.4.
     applies, when the runway ALS (or any portion thereof), as depicted on the procedure, is
     inoperative, pilots shall increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument
     approach by one of the following:
         8.17.2.4.1. As directed by the inoperative components table in FLIP.
         8.17.2.4.2. As stated on IAP, NOTAMs, ATIS, or other airport information source.
         8.17.2.4.3. If no other guidance is provided, increase published visibility by ½ mile.
         8.17.2.4.4. This paragraph applies only to the ALS itself, not to Visual Approach
         Slope Indicator (VASI) or Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).
  8.17.3. Conventional Approach. Pilots will fly conventional approaches IAW this
  instruction, AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, MDS-series Volumes 3, and other governing
  directives (including the AIM, when appropriate) as defined by the MAJCOM.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          93


  8.17.4. RADAR Approach. For pilots to fly a published radar approach or instrument
  approach procedure that requires radar to define a fix essential for flying the approach, a non-
  radar facility must provide a positive aircraft position within 25 NMs of the airfield. Pilots
  operating in Class A airspace may file to the nearest nonradar facility or fix (regardless of
  distance from the terminal) and request radar vector service to the terminal.
  8.17.5. Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) Approach. Pilots shall not fly PRM
  approaches unless the pilot(s) and the aircraft are properly certified by the MAJCOM. Pilots
  unable to accept a PRM approach clearance must contact the Air Traffic Control System
  Command Center at 1-800-333-4286 to coordinate an arrival time. Without coordination,
  pilots should expect an ATC-directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
     8.17.5.1. TCAS II equipped aircraft will fly the ILS PRM approach in TA/RA mode.
     8.17.5.2. If an ATC breakout and a TCAS RA are received simultaneously, or shortly
     after one another, the pilot will respond to any turns required in the breakout instructions
     as well as the vertical correction required by the TCAS system.
  8.17.6. Self-Contained Approach (SCA). A MAJCOM-approved arrival procedure flown
  from a MIA to a landing surface using only the navigational equipment on board the aircraft
  (GPS, radar or other sensors). These procedures may be practiced in the NAS (or elsewhere
  with host-nation approval) under radar control, in conjunction with a published instrument
  approach procedure, in SUA or under VFR.
  8.17.6. (ACC) Self-Contained Approaches. All IMC SCAs must be approved through
  Stan/Eval channels by the HQ ACC/A3 (HQ AFRC/A3 for AFRC units and NGB/A3 for
  ANG units). During contingencies, COMAFFOR is the waiver authority. VMC SCAs need
  not be submitted to higher headquarters for approval.
     8.17.6.1. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). ARAs are instrument approaches
     conducted using navigational guidance provided by reference to the aircraft’s on-board
     radar system. ARA’s conducted in IMC shall be developed and approved by the
     MAJCOM TERPS office. For the purposes of filing under IFR, ARA approaches will be
     considered published if they meet the requirements of paragraph 8.4.
     8.17.6.2. SCA using GPS or other sensors. MAJCOMs will publish specific guidance
     and restrictions on the use of SCAs such as Self-Contained Navigation Systems (SCNS),
     Mission Computer Approaches, SCAs using FMS or other GPS-based systems (or other
     sensors) that have not been certified to civil IFR instrument approach standards. These
     procedures fall outside the construct of published instrument approaches and should be
     flown under VFR or closely follow a published instrument approach ground track.
     MAJCOMs that permit their pilots to fly SCAs in IMC during tactical operations must
     publish SCA guidance that includes, at a minimum:
         8.17.6.2.1. SCA weather minimums, minimum final approach segment dimensions,
         tracks, and minimum altitudes, based on aircraft equipage and capabilities. Along the
         planned ground track, a minimum of 300 feet (250 feet with TF/TA) of obstacle
         clearance must be observed between the MIA and the MDA/DA; and
94                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


         8.17.6.2.2. SCA missed approach procedures and ground tracks will be established
         and assessed for obstructions along the planned escape ground track, and require no
         more than a 200 ft/nm climb gradient; and
         8.17.6.2.3. SCA allowable course deviation standards, required actions when those
         standards are exceeded, aircraft equipage requirements, pilot certification and
         proficiency rules, landing surface marking/lighting requirements, and minimum
         standards of navigation system accuracy required to commence the procedure; and
         8.17.6.2.4. SCA guidance to ensure corrections (i.e. temperature, restrictions to
         visibility, NOTAM information, obstacle data, etc.) are applied to the procedure.
         Corrections will be applied to the MDA/DA and other altitudes using the best
         available data.
  8.17.7. Temperature Correction. When the reported temperature at the altimeter setting
  source (normally the airfield), is lower than the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
  temperature, the aircraft’s actual altitude will be lower than the barometric altimeter
  indicates. It is critical that pilots flying aircraft equipped with FMS that compensate for cold
  temperatures be familiar with the conditions under which the FMS calculates cold weather
  altitudes. During all flight operations, to maintain obstacle clearance, pilots will use the FIH
  chart (or FMS calculations) to apply cold weather corrections to barometric altitudes on IAPs
  IAW Table 8.2.
     8.17.7.1. In lieu of MAJCOM guidance, while in IMC in mountainous terrain, pilots will
     plan to fly at least 1,000 ft above published minimum altitudes obtained from IFR
     enroute charts and terrain charts (e.g. MEAs, MOCAs, OROCAs or other minimum safe
     altitudes during low-levels, etc.) if the temperature at those altitudes is colder than 10°C
     below ISA.
     8.17.7.2. Pilots will not apply a temperature correction to an ATC assigned altitude, but
     may refuse a lower altitude if obstacle protection is in doubt.
     8.17.7.3. When applying corrections to IAP altitudes, pilots will advise ATC if any
     applied correction exceeds 80 feet.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          95

   8.17.8. Determining DH/DA/MDA. Pilots shall determine minimum approach altitudes
   (DH, DA or MDA) with the barometric altimeter except when flying a Category II/III ILS
   approach. When flying a Category II/III ILS approach use the radar altimeter to determine
   DH and use the barometric altimeter as a supporting instrument. Pilots shall not fly Category
   II or III approaches unless the pilot(s) and the aircraft are properly certified by the MAJCOM
   IAW appropriate civil standards. MAJCOM should direct procedures for the use of radar
   altimeters during all other approach types, including during tactical operations.
   8.17.8. (ACC) Radar altimeters will not be used as sole source to determine MDA or
   DH/DA unless flying CAT II/III ILS-approaches.
   8.17.9. Descent Below DH/DA/MDA. Continuing an approach below DH/DA/MDA is not
   authorized until sufficient visual reference with the runway environment has been established
   and the aircraft is in a position to execute a safe landing. The term ―runway environment‖ is
   defined in the glossary and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
       8.17.9.1. (Added-ACC) Fighter/Attack/CTP/MQ-1/MQ-9 pilots will reference the
       touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) or threshold elevation (THRE), whichever is
       published, for straight-in approaches and field elevation for circling approaches to
       determine pilot weather category minimum descent altitude or published minimums,
       whichever is higher. EXAMPLE: TDZE is 26 feet plus 500 feet pilot weather minimum
       equals 526 feet DH/MDA. Use field elevation if TDZE or THRE is unavailable.
       8.17.9.2. (Added-ACC) Bomber/Battle                Management/Reconnaissance/Treaty
       Verification/Tanker and C/EC/HC-130 aircraft will use a decision height of 200 feet or
       published minimums, whichever is higher, on all precision approaches.
   8.17.10. Executing the Missed Approach. If on arrival at the MAP or DH/DA (or at any
   time thereafter) any of the requirements in paragraph 8.17.9. are not met, the pilot shall
   immediately execute the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climb out
   instructions or other ATC clearance.
 96                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


       8.17.10.1. To ensure obstacle/terrain clearance, the missed approach procedure may not
       be initiated until over the MAP/DH/DA, unless otherwise cleared by ATC. Climbing
       prior to the MAP/DH/DA is permitted but ATC should be advised as soon as practical.
       8.17.10.2. Prior to starting any instrument approach, pilots will ensure their aircraft can
       accomplish the missed approach. Unless a higher climb gradient is published or assigned
       by ATC, maintain a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM during the missed approach.
       ―Copter Only‖ approaches require a minimum climb gradient of 400 ft/NM. If, during an
       emergency, an aircraft is unable to comply with the missed approach routing or climb
       requirements, pilots should coordinate for alternate climb out instructions to ensure the
       aircraft will vertically clear all obstacles.
8.18. IFR "VFR-on-Top. " Unless otherwise restricted by the MAJCOM, PICs may request
and fly IFR "VFR on Top" operations (IAW AFMAN 11-217V2 guidance) when the mission
requires such clearances. If the PIC cancels the IFR clearance, comply with Chapter 7.
8.19. Performance Specification Airspace. PIC’s will ensure their aircraft is properly
equipped, certified, and approved before operating in any performance specification airspace
(e.g. MNPS/RVSM/RNP-10/BRNAV, etc). See CNS/ATM requirements in Chapter 2.
8.19. (ACC)Performance Specification Airspace. ACC aircraft or aircraft under ACC
oversight will document appropriate airspace certifications (MNPS, RVSM, RNP RNAV) in AFI
11-2 MDS Specific Volumes 3, aircraft T.O.s, or on the HQ ACC/A3TV website via HHQ
Message. Once this certification is documented, aircraft may operate IAW appropriate civil
procedures. Units will develop training programs to ensure aircrews are aware of any special
conditions or procedures associated with operations in the airspace.

NOTES:
1. This system applies to all ACC, AFRC and ANG pilots flying Fighter/Attack/CTP/MQ-1/MQ-9 air-
craft. Document pilot weather minimum categories in ARMS.
2. When calculating total time, do not include student/UPT or other flight time. Hours in assigned
MDS aircraft may include all Series or Mission types of a particular design aircraft (i.e., F-15A/B/C/
D/E).
3. Assignment to Category 1 is dependent on the pilot's demonstrated knowledge and performance
under operations in Category 2. The pilot's squadron commander will ensure that a current ARMS
product or individual qualification letter is maintained with the pilot's training folder. The product
 98                                             AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


or letter documents those pilots qualified to fly Category 1 weather criteria by the squadron com-
mander. The certifying official will annotate and initial changes to the product or the letter until the
updated product is available.
4. Category 2 is the minimum for normal training/support missions. Category 1 may be exercised for
overriding mission requirements with approval of the OG/CC or designated representative.
5. If an IP has immediate access to a duplicate set of flight controls, use the IP’s pilot weather category.
Companion Trainer Program flights without an IP on board will use the front cockpit pilot's weather
minimums.
6. For formation approaches, the pilot weather minimums for the pilot with the most restrictive cate-
gory will apply. Formation landings are prohibited in all cases when the weather is less than 500
feet and 1 1/2 miles unless required to cope with an emergency situation.
7. Conduct night formation landings only to cope with emergency situations. The preferred method of
recovery is to drop the wingman off while the leader executes a go-around.
8. Qualified pilots may be placed on air defense alert regardless of the pilot's weather category (applies
only to fighters). When existing or forecast weather is below the pilot's weather minimum category,
place the pilot on mandatory alert status or change out as required by NORAD Regulation (NR)
55-11 (Classified), NORAD Air Defense Fighter Alert (U).
9. If non-current in precision approaches IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1, increase the pilot
weather minimum by one category. To regain currency, fly a precision approach under simulated
instrument conditions IAW paragraph 5.16. or in weather at or above the raised weather category or
IAW Note 5 above.

   CREW REST, FATIGUE MANAGEMENT AND FLIGHT DUTY LIMITATIONS

9.1. Background Information. This chapter prescribes mandatory crew rest and maximum
Flight Duty Periods (FDP) for all personnel who operate USAF aircraft. Basic guidance for
fatigue management strategies and waiver authority procedures are also addressed.
9.2. Waiver Authority. Procedures in this chapter may be waived by:
   9.2.1. MAJCOM/A3 when an ORM assessment determines that mission requirements justify
   the increased risk. At MAJCOM/A3 discretion, waiver authority may be further delegated to
   no lower than the operations group commander (or equivalent). Waivers to crew rest and
   flight duty limitations may be published in MAJCOM guidance or on a case-by-case basis.
   Exception: when authorized by the MAJCOM/A3, the PIC may extend maximum FDP up to
   2 hours to compensate for unplanned mission delays, provided the mission requirements
   justify the increased risk.
   9.2.2. COMAFFOR (in the grade of O-8 or higher) for forces under his or her operational
   control during contingencies and impending or actual hostilities. Waiver authority may be
   delegated to no lower than Air Component Commander/A3 or equivalent level.
9.3. Fatigue Management Authorization. Regardless of authorized FDP, the PIC will restrict
duty time, extend crew rest periods or terminate a mission/mission leg if safety may be
compromised by fatigue factors.
9.4. Terms Explained.
   9.4.1. Aircrew or Crew. The full complement of military, civilian and contract personnel
   required to operate a USAF aircraft and to complete an assigned mission.
   9.4.2. Aircrew Member. An individual, designated on the Flight Authorization, who:
       9.4.2.1. Is an aircrew member as explained in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service, AFI 11-402,
       Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, and,
       9.4.2.2. Is assigned to a position listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
       Factors, and,
       9.4.2.3. Is designated on orders to fulfill specific aeronautical tasks.
   9.4.3. Augmented Aircrew. A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members
   to permit in-flight rest periods IAW paragraph 9.4.8. If the basic aircrew requires only one
   pilot and a second qualified pilot (includes pilots enrolled in an AETC formal aircrew
   training course) is designated an aircrew member to augment pilot duties, the crew can be
   considered augmented.
       9.4.3.1. (Added-ACC) Augmented aircrews are not authorized for ACC fighter or
       attack aircraft.
       9.4.3.2. (Added-ACC) Augmented aircrew will consist of the extra qualified
       crewmembers identified below:
100                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


         9.4.3.2.1. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC. RC/TC-135 and WC-135: An extra aircraft
         commander and navigator. An extra crewmember qualified in cargo loading
         operations is required for cargo/passenger carrying missions.
         9.4.3.2.2. (Added-ACC) E-3/E-4 Flight Deck/E-8. An extra aircraft commander,
         navigator and flight engineer.
             9.4.3.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) E-4 Mission Crew. An E-4 alert mission crew is
             considered augmented regardless of flight deck augmentation. The mission crew
             FDP shall not be restricted due to the lack of flight deck augmentation.
         9.4.3.2.3. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC. OC-135: An extra aircraft commander,
         navigator and Airborne Systems Engineer.
  9.4.4. Basic Aircrew. Aircrew positions as defined in the aircraft T.O. (or MDS-specific
  AFI) for the normal operation of the aircraft or mission.
  9.4.5. Crew Rest Period. The crew rest period is normally a minimum 12-hour non-duty
  period before the FDP begins. Its purpose is to ensure the aircrew member is adequately
  rested before performing flight or flight related duties. Crew rest is free time, and includes
  time for meals, transportation, and rest. Rest is defined as a condition that allows an
  individual the opportunity to sleep.
  9.4.5. (ACC) Crew Rest Period. For aircraft generation scenarios, e.g., Phase I exercise,
  crew rest is not required for aircrews to accept aircraft provided internal/external power
  application or engine start are not required for aircraft acceptance.
  9.4.6. Flight Duty Period. FDP begins when an aircrew member reports for a mission,
  briefing, or other official duty and ends when engines are shut down at the end of the
  mission, mission leg, or a series of missions. FDP for UAS ends at final engine shut down,
  final in-flight handover briefing, or final crew swap, whichever occurs last.
  9.4.6. (ACC) FDP. AFRC/ANG only. Flight duty period includes both military duty and
  civilian work for ARC personnel. It begins when the individual reports for his or her first
  duty period (military or civilian) and ends at engine shutdown at the end of the mission or
  series of missions. However, time spent in the completion of post-flight duties will not count
  as crew rest towards the next flight duty period. Active associate personnel assigned to an
  ARC unit will follow Active Duty rules per this supplement.
      9.4.6.1. (Added-ACC) Time spent traveling as a passenger on commercial or military
      transportation in excess of 4 hours counts as part of the duty period. Official duty travel
      for personnel in official military/civilian status will count toward the duty period.
  9.4.7. ―Deadhead‖ Time. For crew rest purposes, ―deadhead‖ time is computed as FDP. If
  an aircrew member will perform in-flight or crew-specialty related duties (i.e., aircraft off-
  loading or performance data calculations) in conjunction with ―deadheading‖, paragraphs
  9.8., 9.11., 9.12. and Table 9.1 apply.
  9.4.8. Sleeping Provisions. Sleeping provisions are crew bunks or other MAJCOM-defined
  rest facilities aboard the aircraft. Rest facilities should provide adequate privacy and noise
  levels to obtain suitable rest.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          101


9.5. Alert Duty. MAJCOMs establish alert and compensatory periods in keeping with mission
requirements and an ORM assessment.
   9.5.1. (Added-ACC) Alert Duty Forces.
      9.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) Alert Scheduling. Do not schedule an aircrew member for
      more than 7 days of continuous alert duty. Aircrews scheduled for a 7-day alert tour
      should be allowed a period of free time away from the alert facilities during their tour.
      Following a 7-day tour, an aircrew must have a minimum of 24 hours rest time away
      from the alert site before beginning a subsequent alert tour. If aircrew swap-out is
      delayed following a 7-day tour, an aircrew may extend for one 24 hour period with
      Sector/DO approval.
      9.5.1.2. (Added-ACC) Travel to Alert Site. The flight duty period for alert aircrews
      traveling to alert via commercial air begins one hour prior to scheduled commercial air
      takeoff. The flight duty period for alert aircrews traveling to alert via military air begins
      upon arrival at the squadron for mission preparation/briefing. Upon assuming alert duties,
      the aircrew enters crew rest (as defined in paragraph 9.5.1.3.3 (Added) of this
      supplement). For same day aircrew swap-outs at the end of the aircrews' 12-hour crew
      duty day, the unit will go on mandatory scramble order (MSO) status until aircrews have
      completed an 8-hour crew rest period. After obtaining required crew rest, aircrews may
      begin a duty period not to exceed 12 hours.
      9.5.1.3. (Added-ACC) Flight Duty on Alert. Initial flight duty period is as displayed
      in Table 9.1 (plus 2 hours if waived IAW para 9.6.3 (Added) of this supplement, if
      required) and begins with the first squadron duty, alert changeover or ANG civilian work,
      whichever occurs first. After getting crew rest on alert (paragraph 9.5.1.3.3 (Added)),
      subsequent flight duty periods begin with any official tasking and will not exceed
      respective times shown in Table 9.1
          9.5.1.3.1. (Added-ACC) Planned Tasking. Planned tasking (e.g., training sorties,
          aircraft swaps, etc.) will not exceed the flight duty period. If an actual alert tasking
          results in an aircrew member exceeding the flight duty period, replace or put the
          crewmember on MSO status until crew rest is obtained.
          9.5.1.3.2. (Added-ACC) Normal Sleeping Hours. Except for actual alert tasking,
          do not disturb alert crews from 2200-0600L. For any planned missions (actual alert or
          training) that start during or extend into the period 2200-0600L, make all possible
          attempts to notify aircrew members in enough time for mission preparation and crew
          rest. Any tasking or duty accomplished by the aircrew during this period will be
          considered official tasking and will reset crew rest and crew duty day calculations.
          This includes those duties in paragraph 9.5.1.3.3 (Added) that do not normally affect
          crew rest and crew duty day calculations such as obtaining weather, NOTAMS,
          power-on checks and aircraft acceptance.
          9.5.1.3.3. (Added-ACC) Crew Rest on Alert. Once provided the opportunity for at
          least 8 hours uninterrupted rest, an aircrew member may start a new alert flight duty
          period. The crew rest period for alert is defined as the period when "official alert
          duties" are not being performed. Crew rest is free time, which includes time for meals
          and rest. "Official alert duties" are defined as alert scrambles to include battle
102                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


         stations, runway alert, cocking the aircraft or a suit-up call. "Official alert duties" do
         not include checking weather, NOTAMS, power-on checks (oxygen/light checks) i.e.,
         those checks accomplished without engine start or aircraft acceptance (walk around
         and forms check) if performed during normal waking hours (0600-2200L).
         9.5.1.3.4. (Added-ACC) Restricted Status. If the air defense sector and the unit
         determine that they need to place an aircrew member into crew rest due to probable
         future tasking, they may place the unit on restricted status. When on restricted status,
         alert crews will be in crew rest. This is distinct from MSO status and does not require
         up-channel reporting or prevent other HHQ tasking.
         9.5.1.3.5. (Added-ACC) Sortie Limits. An aircrew member may fly up to three
         sorties during a flight duty period. Alert scrambles do not have a day/night
         combination limit. Upon reaching the sortie limit, replace the aircrew member or put
         on MSO status until crew rest is obtained.
         9.5.1.3.6. (Added-ACC) Post-alert Status. An alert aircrew member may perform
         a normal flight duty period if crew rest requirements are met IAW paragraph 9.7.1 of
         this supplement. The post-alert duty day begins at changeover, scramble activity
         (including battle stations or a "suit-up" call) or other official tasking, whichever
         occurs first.
         9.5.1.3.7. (Added-ACC) Squadron Supervision. Squadron supervisors recalled to
         perform supervisory/SOF duties during an actual scramble do not need to meet crew
         rest requirements for that duty. However, they must obtain required crew rest before
         returning to duty if scheduled to fly.
      9.5.1.4. (Added-ACC) Alert Contingencies. Alert duty is a dynamic environment and
      as such all contingencies cannot be addressed. An alert aircrew or alert site commander
      may put the site on restricted or MSO status at any time due to crew rest considerations
      (actual/planned tasking, fatigue or other factors). The preservation of lives and assets
      should be the overriding factor in all crew rest decisions.
  9.5.2. (Added-ACC) Alert Duty Forces in support of USSTRATCOM. All aircrew will
  respond to a report to aircraft, klaxon or klaxon advisory in accordance with applicable
  directives, regardless of flight duty period or crew rest limitations and accomplish required
  actions. However, do not violate crew rest during training, exercises or inspections. During
  actual OPLAN execution, compliance with crew rest requirements is encouraged but not
  required.
      9.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) Alert Scheduling. Do not schedule an aircrew member for
      more than 7 days of continuous alert for inspections, exercises or training. Schedule
      aircrew as required to support actual OPLAN execution. Crew management during actual
      OPLAN execution should be based on continuing alert operations indefinitely.
      9.5.2.2. (Added-ACC) Flight Related Duty on Alert. Initial flight duty period is as
      displayed in Table 9.1 (plus 2 hours if waived IAW para 9.6.2 (Added) of this
      supplement, if required) and begins with the first squadron duty or alert changeover,
      whichever occurs first. After getting crew rest on alert (paragraph 9.5.2.4 (Added)),
      subsequent flight duty periods begin with any official tasking and will not exceed
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          103


       respective times shown in Table 9.1 Aircrew will enter crew rest at expiration of the
       flight duty period.
       9.5.2.3. (Added-ACC) Normal Sleeping Hours. Except for a required aircrew
       response for real world situations, do not disturb alert crews from 2200-0600L. For any
       planned activities (alert duties or training) that start during or extend into the period
       2200-0600L, make all possible attempts to notify aircrew members in enough time for
       mission preparation and crew rest. Any tasking or duty accomplished by the aircrew
       during this period will be considered official tasking and will reset crew rest and crew
       duty day calculations. This includes those duties in paragraph 9.5.2.4 (Added), that do
       not normally affect crew rest and crew duty day calculations.
       9.5.2.4. (Added-ACC) Crew Rest on Alert. Once provided the opportunity for at least
       8 hours uninterrupted rest, an aircrew member may start a new alert flight duty period.
       The crew rest period for alert is defined as the period when "official alert duties" are not
       being performed. Crew rest is free time, which includes time for meals and rest. "Official
       alert duties" are defined as alert crew response, AARP operations, daily alert briefing,
       daily preflight, aircraft/aircrew changeover, change to Combat Mission Folder material,
       change to Positive Control Materials and any aircraft maintenance that requires aircrew
       presence at the aircraft. "Official alert duties" do not include individual crews checking
       weather or NOTAMS, etc. if performed during normal waking hours (0600-2200L).
       9.5.2.5. (Added-ACC) Post Alert Status: An alert aircrew member may perform a
       normal flight duty period if crew rest requirements are met. The post-alert duty day
       begins at daily alert briefing or other official alert duty, whichever occurs first.
       9.5.2.6. (Added-ACC) Alert Contingencies. Alert duty is a dynamic environment and
       as such all contingencies cannot be addressed. Wing Commander will make all crew rest
       decisions balancing safety with mission accomplishment. For training, exercises or
       inspections that are not linked to real world events, wing leadership and/or Inspector
       General Team Chief will ensure schedules allow for adherence to crew rest and flight
       duty period restrictions. Wing leadership is responsible for notifying personnel if an
       exercise/training/inspection generation changes to a real world generation.
9.6. Maximum Flying Time. 56 hours flight time logged per 7 consecutive days, 125 hours
flight time logged per 30 consecutive days and 330 hours per 90 consecutive days.
9.6. (ACC)Maximum Flying Time. The maximum flying time for aircrew members of
Fighter/Attack/CTP will be 75 hours per 30 consecutive days and 200 hours per 90 consecutive
days. IAW paragraph 9.2.1 of the basic AFI, the 56 hours logged per 7 consecutive days
maximum is waived to 84 hours for Bomber/Battle Management/Reconnaissance/Treaty
Verification aircraft on operational missions or deployments. No training sorties will be flown
with logged flight time over 56 hours per 7 consecutive days in any case.
   9.6.1. (Added-ACC) ACC aircrew flying in support of contingency operations are exempt
   from maximum flying time restrictions as stated in paragraph 9.6 These aircrew will follow
   AFI 11-202V3 basic regulation maximum flying time rules. This exemption includes
   deployment and redeployment sorties.
   9.6.2. (Added-ACC) Basic aircrew maximum flight duty periods may be extended up to 4
   hours by wing commanders (ANG/AFRC: Operations Group Commander). For extensions
 104                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   greater than 4 hours, the waiver authority is the HQ ACC/A3 (ANG: HQ NGB/A3; AFRC:
   HQ AFRC/A3). The HQ ACC/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3; AFRC: HQ AFRC/A3) is the approval
   authority for any extension to the augmented aircrew maximum flight duty period. The
   following exceptions apply:
       9.6.2.1. (Added-ACC) For ACC AOS-controlled PDM, FMS and non-unit move
       missions, the ACC AOS/CC may extend crew duty day by up to 2 hours.
       9.6.2.2. (Added-ACC) ACC active duty advisors attached to units under ACC oversight
       will comply with ACC guidance.
       9.6.2.3. (Added-ACC) Aircrews will follow the guidance and seek waiver through
       other MAJCOMS while under their operational control.
       9.6.2.4. (Added-ACC) COMAFFOR is the waiver authority for crews under OPCON of
       a COCOM. Forces operating in an AOR and not under OPCON of the COCOM will
       forward waiver requests through their appropriate leadership chain (MAJCOM or NAF)
       to ACC for approval.
   9.6.3. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. For rotary-wing aircraft, maximum FDP is IAW Table
   9.1. and the following restrictions:
       9.6.3.1. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. For missions originating from home station,
       maximum FDP is 14 hours for all training mission events, FCF flights, space center
       launch and recovery support missions and deployments.
       9.6.3.2. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. For training/FCF missions that do not originate
       from home station, redeployments or contingencies and exercise missions, maximum
       FDP is as follows:

Table 9.1. (ACC) Maximum Flight Duty Period (Hours).




9.8. Crew Rest. Aircrew require at least 10 continuous hours of restful activities (including an
opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep) during the 12 hours immediately prior to
the FDP. To ensure individual accountability and mission reliability, crewmembers should be
officially notified prior to entering a crew rest period. A crew rest period cannot begin until after
the completion of official duties.
   9.8.1. Crew rest is compulsory for any aircrew member prior to performing any of the
   following flight-related duties: preflight, load/unload, start, and taxi aircraft.
   9.8.2. Each aircrew member is individually responsible to ensure that he or she obtains
   sufficient rest during crew rest periods. Activities that would prevent the opportunity to
   achieve at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep are discouraged.
   9.8.3. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC. Fighter/Attack/U-2 aircrew are limited to a maximum
   flight duty period of 10 hours when night operations are conducted. (ANG: Waiver authority
   for up to 12 hours is Operations Group commander). For the purpose of this restriction, night
   operations do not include civil twilight and duty day is based on time of day at mission
   termination. EXCEPTION: This restriction does not apply to alert crews covered under
   paragraph 9.5. in this supplement, single seat U-2 pilots flying combat or O-9 operational
   missions or pilots and WSOs operating aircraft under the control of ACC AOS.
9.9. Crew Rest Interruptions. Any official business or duty that requires the active
participation of an aircrew member interrupts the crew rest period. This includes official
business conducted on the telephone or other electronic means. If crew rest is interrupted so that
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           107


the individual cannot get an opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, the individual
must be afforded the opportunity for at least 8 more hours of uninterrupted sleep plus reasonable
time to dress, eat, travel, etc. Intentional crew rest interruptions shall only be made under the
most exceptional circumstances. The individual must consider unofficial interruptions so that
the intent of paragraph 9.8. is met. If crew rest is interrupted, individuals will inform a
supervisor and remove themselves from the flight schedule, when necessary.
9.10. Exceptions to the 12-Hour Minimum Crew Rest Period. For continuous operations
when basic aircrew FDPs are greater than 12 but less than 14 hours, subsequent crew rest may be
reduced proportionally to a minimum of 10 hours in order to maintain a 24-hour work/rest
schedule.
9.10. (ACC)ANG and AFRC only. The waiver authority for reduced crew rest related to local
flying training is delegated to the wing commander. Wing commanders may reduce the crew rest
period to 10 hours for home station continuation training sorties and other related duties,
provided the ANG/AFRC crew member obtains 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. All other
sorties/missions require 12 hours of crew rest. Crew rest related to duties not to include flying
may be waived by the OG/CC. Commanders must exhaust all viable scheduling options before
utilizing this waiver authority.
   9.10.1. Continuous operations means three or more consecutive FDPs of at least 12 hours
   duration separated by minimum crew rest.
       9.10.1.1. The 10-hour crew rest exception shall only be used to keep crews in 24-hour
       clock cycles, not for scheduling convenience or additional sortie generation.
       9.10.1.2. Any reduction from 12 hours crew rest requires pre-coordination for
       transportation, meals and quarters, so that crewmembers are provided an opportunity for
       at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.
   9.10.2. (Added-ACC) ANG only. Successive Flight Activity. Crew rest for successive
   flight activity will not begin sooner than 1 hour after final landing from previous flight
   activity or when the last crew member leaves after completing related aircrew duties.
   9.10.3. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. HH-60 and HC-130 crewmembers meeting the crew
   rest criteria, defined in paragraph 9.8. and the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Specific, Volume 3
   may perform aircraft generation activities (pre-flight, load, start and taxi) without having
   formally been placed in a crew rest posture in advance. Activities involving aircraft
   generation shall not exceed a 12-hour duty day. Crew duty day begins at the start of official
   duties, unless noted below.
       9.10.3.1. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. For crewmembers who have less than 12 hours
       crew rest but greater than 8 hours, OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
       Individual crew members must evaluate their ability to mentally and physically perform
       their required crew duties. Under normal day-to-day activities, the OG/CC should ensure
       crewmembers are afforded 12 hours rest for aircraft generation activities, but in some
       extreme cases, it may be necessary to begin these activities with less than 12 hours rest.
       9.10.3.2. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. Crew duty day for aircraft generation activities
       begun with less than 12 hours rest is limited to 10 hours, beginning at crew show time.
 108                                        AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


       9.10.3.3. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. Waiver for crew rest periods of less than 8 hours
       to perform aircraft generation activities rest with AFRC/A3.
       9.10.3.4. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. Do not give crewmembers less than 12 hours crew
       rest without group commander approval.
       9.10.3.5. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. Standby crews will be given 12 hours crew rest
       prior to the earliest anticipated show time. Aircrew not dispatched on a mission following
       standby duty will receive post-mission crew rest.
       9.10.3.6. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. Crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to
       recover away from home station will be notified 24 hours before reporting for the
       mission. The first 12 hours are not considered crew rest, but are designed to allow
       crewmembers to resolve personal affairs. During these first 12 hours, a crewmember may
       perform limited non-flying duties. The second 12-hour period is inviolate.
       9.10.3.7. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. The crew chief is responsible to the aircraft
       commander. The PIC will determine how long the crew chief can safely perform aircraft
       recovery actions. The crew chief must have the opportunity to sleep 8 hours of each 24-
       hour period.
9.11. Scheduling Restrictions. Aircrews will not perform flight duties until the requirements of
paragraph 9.8 have been met.
   9.11.1. Aircrew members must maintain a medical clearance from the flight surgeon to
   perform in-flight duties. All medical or dental treatment obtained from any source must be
   cleared by a flight surgeon prior to reporting for flight duty.
   9.11.2. Use of any medication or dietary supplements is governed by AFI 48-123 and as
   approved by a flight surgeon. Aircrew members will not normally self-medicate. In the
   absence of other MAJCOM guidance, the following is a partial list of medications that may
   be used without medical consultation:
       9.11.2.1. Single doses of over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to
       provide analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions.
       9.11.2.2. OTC skin antiseptics, topical anti-fungals, 1 percent hydrocortisone cream, or
       benzoyl peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not hinder flying duties
       or wear of personal equipment.
       9.11.2.3. OTC antacids for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
       9.11.2.4. OTC hemorrhoidal suppositories.
       9.11.2.5. OTC bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
       9.11.2.6. OTC oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays may be carried should
       unexpected ear or sinus block occur during flight. Aircrew may only use such sprays as
       ―get me downs.‖ Do not use to treat symptoms of head congestion prior to flight.
       9.11.2.7. For information on medication, see Aerospace Medicine policy letters at:

   9.11.3. Aircrew members will not fly:
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            109


     9.11.3.1. Within 24 hours of compressed gas diving (including SCUBA), surface
     supplied diving, hyperbaric (compression) chamber exposure or aircraft pressurization
     checks (to below sea level) that exceed 10 minutes duration (this restriction not
     applicable to UAS ground control station operations).
         9.11.3.1.1. Exceptions: Following HEEDS training, aircrew may only fly within the
         24 hour window if the aircraft’s maximum altitude remains below 10,000 ft. MSL.
         Pararescue aircrew personnel will follow guidelines IAW US Navy Diving
             Manual on flying and diving restrictions.
     9.11.3.2. Within 12 hours after completion of a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight
     above 25,000 ft. MSL. Personnel may fly as passengers in aircraft during this period,
     provided the planned mission will maintain a cabin altitude of 10,000 ft. MSL or less.
     For altitude chamber flights to a maximum altitude of 25,000 ft. MSL or below, aircrew
     members may fly without delay as crewmembers or passengers if their cabin altitude
     does not exceed 15,000 ft. MSL (this restriction not applicable to UAS ground control
     station operations).
     9.11.3.3. Within 72 hours after donating blood, plasma or bone marrow. The flying unit
     commander must approve donations of blood, plasma or bone marrow by aircrew
     members.
     9.11.3.4. Within 12 hours of consuming alcohol or other intoxicating substance, or while
     impaired by its after effects. See also paragraph 5.1.4.
     9.11.3.5. (Added-ACC) Crewmembers will not perform flying duties (using planned
     takeoff time) within 12 hours after actual exposure to noxious gases used in (gas) mask
     confidence training.
  9.11.4. MAJCOMs should establish scheduling restrictions for aircrew members who, for
  duty or personal reasons, transit multiple time zones less than 24 hours prior to reporting for
  flying duty.
  9.11.4. (ACC) Fighter and attack aircraft crews crossing four or more time zones within a
  24-hour period, (e.g., returning from continental United States (CONUS) leave or completing
  deployment to or from CONUS) will not fly a local training sortie for 48 hours (waiver
  authority is the OG/CC).
  9.11.5. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC/ANG. For U-2 operational reconnaissance missions,
  reference AFI 11-220 (S), Reconnaissance Flight Rules and Procedures (U), for waiver
  authority of crew rest and crew duty limits.
  9.11.6. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC. Transition duty day for multi-pilot Bomber/Battle
  Management/Treaty Verification/ Tanker aircraft is a period of 12 hours that starts and runs
  concurrently with the maximum flight duty periods. Within the transition duty day, pilots
  may practice takeoffs, emergency procedures, low approaches or touch and go landings. For
  any sortie, OG/CC can approve an aircraft commander's initiated request to extend the
  transition duty day to 16 hours.
  9.11.7. (Added-ACC) AFRC only. Except as listed in paragraph 9.6.3. (Added), for local
  training missions in multi pilot aircraft (including transition, air refueling, tactical, formation
  and low level missions), flight duty periods for AFRC crew members are waived, IAW
 110                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   paragraph 9.2.1. of the basic AFI, up to 16 hours provided no more than 12 consecutive hours
   are devoted to actual flying duties. AFRC operations group commanders or equivalent may
   further limit training duty time.
   9.11.8. (Added-ACC) N/A AFRC/ANG. The transition duty day for single seat U-2 pilots
   is 10 hours; 6 hours when wearing a pressure suit. For pilots flying two-seat models of the U-
   2, the non-pressure suit transition duty day is 12 hours when U-2ST qualified pilots occupy
   both seats.
   9.11.9. (Added-ACC) Extend transition duty day to 16 hours for:
       9.11.9.1. (Added-ACC) Flight evaluations conducted in B-1, E-4 and OC/RC/TC/WC-
       135 aircraft.
   9.11.10. (Added-ACC) Fighter pilots/WSOs are limited to two sorties per duty day if either
   sortie is at night; otherwise, they are limited to three daytime sorties per day. During
   operational readiness inspections/unit operational evaluations, fighter aircrews may fly four
   sorties per duty day if all are in the daytime; three sorties if any are flown at night. Aircrews
   deploying/redeploying on active air defense missions or participating in NORAD or Air
   Forces Iceland exercises, while limited to three sorties, do not have the day/night
   combination limit.
   9.11.11. (Added-ACC) When an aircrew member's ability to perform flying duties safely or
   effectively has become questionable or when involved in an aircraft mishap, the aircrew
   member's commander must immediately restrict the individual from being placed on any
   flying schedule.
9.12. Alertness Management Strategies. Commanders, mission planners, aerospace medicine
personnel and crewmembers share responsibility for alertness management.
   9.12.1. MAJCOMs will emphasize alertness management programs or procedures to
   minimize the risks associated with aircrew fatigue. These should include:
       9.12.1.1. Commander’s Responsibilities. Commanders use reasonable means to
       manage the health and welfare of their crew forces. Use aircrew and family education to
       emphasize the importance of aircrew fitness and alertness on duty performance.
       Consultation with aerospace medicine or other fatigue management experts is advisable.
       9.12.1.2. Fatigue Mitigation. Mechanisms to ensure that at all stages of the mission,
       commanders, mission planners and PICs assess the impact of reduced aircrew alertness.
          9.12.1.2.1. Assessments should include the fatiguing effects of weather, extremes of
          temperature, nighttime operations and use of NVDs, poor sleeping conditions (due to
          both location and time of day), mission delays, and restrictive personal equipment.
              9.12.1.2.1.1. Commanders, mission planners, aerospace medicine personnel and
              PICs must continually execute ORM assessments and implement alertness
              management strategies such as: extending crew rest periods, pre-positioning
              crews, using sleep quarantine facilities, non-pharmacological countermeasures
              such as controlled cockpit rest, bright light or physical activity breaks;
              pharmacological agents (go and no-go pills), and fatigue management education
              and training.
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                      111


         9.12.1.2.2. To combat cumulative fatigue, commanders should grant additional crew
         rest, or limit consecutive duty days, during surge, combat, max-effort, or operations
         near maximum FDPs.
         9.12.1.2.3. (Added-ACC) Aircrew members should be afforded a minimum of 24
         hours crew rest following three consecutive flight duty periods of 16 hours or more
         with minimum crew rest between flights.
         9.12.1.2.4. (Added-ACC) Allow crewmembers returning to their home base from
         lengthy flying TDYs sufficient time to recover from the cumulative effects of the
         mission and tend to personal needs.
         9.12.1.2.5. (Added-ACC) Commanders will provide individuals with post-
         deployment compensatory time off and time off for recovery and reconstitution in
         accordance with AFI 36-3003 and other applicable guidance.
     9.12.1.3. Fatigue Countermeasure Medications. MAJCOMs will provide guidance on
     the use of go and no-go medications IAW AF/SG policy. For more information see:
     https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kj.do?functionalArea=AerospaceMedicine. This
     website contains policy letters, approved medications, forms, dosage and warnings for
     approved fatigue countermeasures medications. The website will be updated as required
     by AFMOA/SG3PF.
     9.12.1.4. Controlled Cockpit Rest. Unless further restricted in MAJCOM guidance or
     MDS specific Volume 3, controlled cockpit rest may be implemented when the basic
     aircrew includes a second qualified pilot. All cockpit crewmembers must remain at their
     stations. Cockpit rest shall be limited to 45 minutes, taken by only one crew member at a
     time and must be restricted to non-critical phases of flight between cruise and one hour
     prior to planned descent. More than one rest period per crewmember is permitted.
     Cockpit rest is not authorized with any aircraft system malfunctions that increase cockpit
     workload (e.g., Autopilot, Navigation Systems). The resting crewmember must be
     roused immediately if a situation develops that may affect flight safety. Cockpit rest
     shall not be a substitute for any required crew rest.
         9.12.1.4.1. (Added-ACC) Controlled cockpit rest applies to crewmember positions
         where normal duties are performed. If aircraft have provisions for sleeping/rest, the
         restrictions of controlled cockpit rest do not apply and crewmembers may take rest
         IAW MDS-specific directives and T.O. All ACC and AFRC bomber aircraft are
         equipped with sleeping provisions. Guidance for long duration flight kit development
         is addressed in AFI 11-2MDSV1. The aircraft commander is the final authority for
         cockpit rest.
  9.12.2. Flight publications describe procedures for loss of pressurization, oxygen, cockpit
  temperature control, inoperative autopilot, and other in-flight malfunctions or emergencies
  that restrict flight duration and contribute to aircrew fatigue. Such limitations in flight
  publications take precedence over less restrictive standards in this instruction.

Terms
Some terms printed here are reserved for future use or are intended to define a common
vocabulary for HQ AFFSA, MAJCOM, USAF aircrew and industry users of this AFI.—
1090mHz Extended Squitter (1090 ES)—The most mature of the 3 ADS-B link options. A
―Squitter‖ provides a spontaneous transmission containing information about the aircraft’s
identification, position, altitude, velocity, and route of flight information. It uses the Mode S
transponders as a basis for operation.
8.33KHz spacing—Due to frequency congestion in the 118-137 MHz range (voice
communications) in Europe, the normal spacing between frequencies (25 kHz) was further
divided into three 8.33 kHz bands.
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS—B)—Aircraft equipment that
automatically broadcasts routine messages which include its position (such as lat, long, altitude),
velocity, and altitude. Other information may also be included.
Aerobatics—Intentionally performed spins, vertical recoveries, and other maneuvers that require
pitch and bank angles greater than 90 degrees.
Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA)—HQ USAF Field Operating Agency (FOA)
charged with the development, standardization, evaluation and certification of procedures,
equipment and standards to support global flight operations. Centrally manages ATCALS, the
SDP program contract, performs combat flight inspection, and instructs the Air Force Advanced
Instrument School for USAF pilots. Central agency responsible for global USAF Terminal
Instrument Procedures. Headquartered at the FAA’s Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in
Oklahoma City, OK.
Air Combat Tactics—A general term that includes basic fighter maneuvers, air combat
maneuvers, and air combat tactics.
Civil Twilight—Evening Civil Twilight is the period that begins at sunset and ends in the
evening when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon. Morning Civil
Twilight begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon,
and ends at sunrise. Use an authorized weather source, the latest version of the Air Almanac,
MAJCOM-approved computer program or US Naval Observatory data to determine and
calculate light and moon data. Both periods of twilight are considered ―day‖, unless further
restricted by the MAJCOM.
Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)—An
umbrella term used to describe the emerging avionics technologies and architecture of space- and
ground-based systems designed to bring about Free Flight. Examples include: RNAV/RNP,
RVSM, CPDLC, ADS-B, elementary and enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, FM
Immunity, TCAS, and TAWS—Previously termed Global Air Traffic Management (GATM)
by the DoD.
Composite Flight Plan—A flight plan which specifies VFR operation for one portion of flight
and IFR for another portion.
Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CDPLC)—An ―email-like‖ data link between
pilots and ATC that will augment and may replace voice communications. The two
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           125


environments for CPDLC are currently Future Aeronautical Navigation System 1/A (FANS-1/A)
and the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).
Critical Phase of Flight—For the purposes of this AFI, this term shall include: Terminal Area
operations including taxi, takeoff and landing, Low-level flight, Air Refueling, Airdrop, weapons
employment, flight using NVGs, tactical/air combat and formation operations (other than cruise)
and all portions of any test or functional check flight or any aerial demonstration.
Day—The time between the beginning of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time.
Down link Aircraft Parameters (DAP)—This is data down-linked to the ground, via the Mode
S transponder, that provides information about the aircraft operations and planned route. The
three types of DAP are ―basic functionality‖ (flight ID, transponder capability, and flight status),
―enhanced‖ [EHS] and ―elementary‖ [ELS] surveillance features also provide flight intent
information.
Decision Altitude/Decision Height (DA/DH)—A specified altitude in the precision approach at
which a decision must be made to either continue the approach if the pilot acquires the required
visual references, or to immediately climb or execute a missed approach.   Outside the NAS,
Decision altitude is referenced to mean sea level and decision height is referenced to the
threshold elevation.
Diverse Departure—If the airport has at least one published approach, the absence of any non-
standard takeoff minimums and/or IFR departure procedures for a specific runway normally
indicates that runway meets diverse departure criteria. Pilots departing a diverse runway may
climb runway heading to 400 ft. above the DER elevation and then turn in any direction provided
the aircraft maintains a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM until reaching the appropriate IFR
altitude. Published ―Sector‖ diverse departures (i.e. ―Diverse Departure authorized 145° CW to
278° with min climb gradient of…) are authorized as an Obstacle Departure Procedure.
Embedded GPS/INS (EGI)—A military, self-contained navigation system that provides
positioning, velocity, and acceleration data for the aircraft. The EGI receives signals from GPS.
The EGI receiver tracks up to five satellites simultaneously.
Enhanced Surveillance (EHS)—Support of EHS consists of populating and maintaining three
Mode S transponder registers beyond those required for ELS: Selected Vertical Intention, Track
and Turn Report, and Heading and Speed Report.
Elementary Surveillance (ELS)—Support of ELS consists primarily of populating and
maintaining four Mode S transponder registers: Data Link Capability Report, Common-Usage
Ground Initiated Comm B (GICB) Capability Report, Aircraft Identification (Flight ID), and
Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) resolution advisory.
Extended Operations (ETOPS)—Those operations conducted over large bodies of water, or
desolate land areas, outside of gliding distance to a suitable landing site.
FAA Authorization—An authorization is an official written FAA document which provides the
petitioner relief from specified parts of the CFRs.
FAA Exemption—An exemption is an official written FAA document which provides the
petitioner relief from specified parts of the CFRs.
 126                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


Fault Detection/Exclusion (FDE)—A GPS receiver capable of autonomously determining
which GPS satellite(s) is (are) causing the RAIM alert and then excluding the faulty satellite(s)
from the navigation solution. Flight in some civil airspace requires both RAIM and FDE.
Flight Mission Computer/Flight Management System (FMC/FMS)—An on-board computer
system that uses a database to allow routes and other navigation data to be preprogrammed. The
system is updated with respect to position accuracy by reference to conventional navigation aids.
Formation Flight—More than one aircraft which, by prior arrangement between the pilots,
operates as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between
aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and the pilots of the other
aircraft in the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are
maneuvering to attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during joinup
and breakaway. Such a group is treated for ATC purposes as a single aircraft.
Free Flight—A safe and efficient operating capability under instrument flight rules in which the
pilot has the freedom to select routing, altitude, and speed in real time.
Fuel Reserve—The amount of usable fuel that must be carried on each aircraft, beyond that
required to complete the flight as planned.
Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS)—GBAS augments ground systems (typically at
an airport) with equipment similar in functionality to a GPS satellite. This augmentation allows
a properly equipped aircraft to increase the accuracy of the vertical/lateral GPS solution. The US
LAAS is a GBAS equivalent system.
GNSS Landing System (GLS)—Hardware and software that augments the GPS SPS to provide
for precision approach and landing capability. Based on differential GPS concepts, the GLS
augments the basic GPS position data in order to increase the integrity, continuity, and accuracy
needed for a precision approach.
GPS-based Monitoring Unit (GMU)—An on-board monitoring and recording unit composed
of a GPS receiver, computer and flight deck windows antennae. An alternative to the ICAO
requirement of overflying a Height Monitoring Unit (HMU) as a means to check aircraft for
RVSM compliance.
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)—An umbrella term adopted by ICAO to
encompass any independent satellite navigation system. GNSS provides suitably equipped
aircraft with en route/terminal navigation with non-precision approach and precision approach
capabilities. The U.S. system is GPS.
Global Positioning System (GPS)—A constellation of satellites that enables the user to receive
signals from six operational satellites nearly 100% of the time from most locations on Earth.
RAIM and FDE ensures the GPS derived solution meets the accuracy, availability, and integrity
requirements critical to flight safety
Differential GPS (GPS-D)—DGPS is a GPS augmentation that uses differential corrections to
the basic satellite measurements that are performed within the receiver. DGPS is based upon
accurate knowledge of the geographic location of Earth reference stations. This knowledge is
used to compute corrections to GPS parameters, error sources, and/or resultant positions. These
differential corrections are then transmitted to GPS users, either from a ground-based station
[e.g., LAAS] or from a satellite-based system [WAAS, EGNOS, GALILEO, etc]. GPS receivers
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           127


apply the corrections to their received GPS signals and compute a more optimum position. For a
civil user, differential GPS can improve accuracy from 100 meters to better than 10 meters.
Global Positioning System- Precise Positioning Service (GPS-PPS)—The military maintains
exclusive access to the more accurate "P-code" (pseudo random code). It is much more accurate,
much harder to jam and spoof. To provide better protection to military aircraft, the DoD has
encrypted the P-code to form Y-code. Horizontal accuracy is less than ten meters.
Global Positioning System Standard Positioning Service (GPS- SPS)—One of two levels of
GPS service used by both the military and civil aviation community in order to support aircraft
navigation and landing. Since a Presidential Order turned Selective Availability off, SPS
horizontal accuracy is about ten meters [vs. about 100 meters when SA is on].
GPS ―Overlay‖ Approaches—These are instrument approaches that were previously approved
for use with GPS based on an existing traditional instrument approach such as a VOR or NDB
approach. As most of the ―Overlay‖ approach locations now have RNAV (GPS) approaches,
there is no GPS ―Overlay‖ approach authorization from the FAA in the NAS.
Ground Control Element—Comprises the UAS ground control station, power generation units,
communications infrastructure and antenna arrays.
Height Monitoring Unit (HMU)—A passive, ground-based system that measures the geometric
height of an aircraft for comparison with the geometric height of the flight level at which it is
being flown. The HMU calculates altimetry system error using meteorological information and
the Mode-C/S height data. Overflight of an HMU satisfies the ICAO requirement to check
aircraft for RVSM compliance. Additional information on RVSM monitoring program can be
found at: http://www.tc.faa.gov/act-500/niaab/rvsm/naarmo_intro.asp
ICAO—The International Civil Aviation Organization (a UN Specialized Agency),
headquartered in Montreal, Canada, is the global forum for civil aviation that works to achieve
its vision of safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation through cooperation
amongst its member States. Promotes understanding and security through cooperative aviation
regulation.
Inertial Navigation System (INS)—A self contained, dead reckoning system that senses the
acceleration along the three axes of the aircraft and calculates the distance traveled from a
reference point. Accuracy of the system decreases with time.
Instrument Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions expressed in terms of
visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less than the minima specified for visual
meteorological conditions.
Lateral Navigation (LNAV)—A function of RNAV equipment which calculates, displays, and
provides lateral guidance to a profile or path.
Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)—Procedures developed to expedite traffic flow at
civil and joint-use airports needing additional tools to increase capacity. Allows civilian aircraft
to operate on intersecting runways simultaneously.
Low Close-in Obstacles—Those obstacles within the Initial Climb Area that require an
excessive climb gradient to a climb-to-altitude of 200 feet or less above the Departure End of
Runway elevation or alternate takeoff weather minima. These obstacles are published in
NOTAMs, on the SID chart or in the IFR Take-off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure
 128                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


Procedures section of the terminal procedure booklet. Typical chart notation is: ―NOTE: Rwy
17L, tree 5610' from DER, 212' left of centerline, 82' AGL/2723' MSL.‖
Minimum Fuel—Indicates that an aircraft's fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching
the destination, it can accept little or no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely
indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.
Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)—The lowest safe altitude permitted to be flown under IFR.
Normally, this is the lowest published IFR altitude (i.e. MEA, MOCA, OROCA, or ORTCA) for
a given area, not including any portion of an IAP. See paragraph 8.13.
Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS)—Implemented in the North
Atlantic region between FL285-420, it specifies a number of equipment, training, and procedural
requirements. MNPS navigation accuracy is equivalent to RNP 12.6. Dual long-range
navigation systems (LRNS) and dual long-range communication systems are required. RVSM is
mandatory in MNPS airspace. Aircraft that cannot meet dual LRNS requirements may be
accommodated on special routings ("Blue Spruce" routes). Aircraft that cannot meet RVSM
requirements are excluded from MNPS airspace unless operating on an ALTRV.
Mode 4—Transponder mode established to enable IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) functions
between military aircraft or military aircraft and military ground stations. Uses classified codes,
but operates on 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz, the same frequency pair used by the Air Traffic
Control Radar Beacon System that civil air traffic uses for Mode 3A/C, Mode S, and TCAS.
Mode 4 interrogation signals can suppress civil airborne transponders, therefore all Mode 4
operations in the NAS require prior authorization through the Air Force Frequency Management
Agency (AFFMA): affma.cc@pentagon.af.mil.
Mode 5—Mode 5 is the performance upgrade to the current Mark XII IFF transponder
system. Mode 5 provides new waveforms, new cryptography, more data, and improved radio
frequency (RF) link margin to resolve many of the deficiencies identified with Mark XII. It will
eventually replace the analog Mode 4 IFF system with digital IFF message formats which embed
unprecedented combat relevant data.
Mode Select (Mode S)—The primary role of the Mode S transponder is to "selectively" respond
to interrogations [as opposed to responding to all interrogations] from a ground sensor or TCAS
to provide airborne data information including identification, equipage, and altitude.
Mountainous Terrain—Defined in 14 CFR §95.11 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto
Rico. PANS-OPS defines mountainous terrain as an area over which the changes of surface
elevation exceed 900m (3,000 ft) within a distance of 18.5 km (10.0 NM), or 300 ft over a 1 NM
distance. AFFSA believes the PANS OPS definition is too restrictive, so instead chose to use the
definition from NATO’s ATP 56(B) (Part 3, Chapter 4) that defines mountainous terrain as 500
ft surface elevation change over a ½ NM distance.
National Airspace System (NAS)—The NAS is the common network of United States (U.S.)
airspace: air navigation facilities, equipment, services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical
charts, information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical information, manpower and
material. Included are system components shared jointly with the military. United States, in a
geographical sense, means (1) the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
possessions, including the territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles) and (2) the airspace of
those areas. Note: IAW ICAO Article 12 and Annex 2 and 11, the United States has accepted
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          129


responsibility for providing air traffic services within airspace overlying the high seas beyond 12
miles from the coast (also known as international airspace). These flight information regions of
international airspace include: Oakland Oceanic, Anchorage Oceanic, Anchorage Continental,
Anchorage Arctic, Miami Oceanic, Houston Oceanic and New York Oceanic. Aircrews should
be aware that although they are being provided air traffic services by the FAA, they are operating
in international airspace and ICAO SARPS, FLIP, and AFIs are applicable. (See paragraph 1.2)
Night—The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time.
Non-Standard Formation—Operations under any of the following conditions:
       a. When the flight leader has requested and ATC has approved other than standard
       formation dimensions (≤1 NM lateral separation or ≤ 100 ft. vertical separation).
       b. When operating within an authorized altitude reservation (ALTRV) or under the
       provisions of a letter of agreement.
       c. When operations are conducted in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
Obstacle Climb Gradient—FLIP products often provide different climb gradients, ATC and
Obstacle. Only the obstacle climb gradient need be considered for OEI (if applicable) IFR
departure planning. If no obstacle climb gradient is published, the aircraft must achieve a
minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM (or as specified in paragraph 8.12.6.), OEI (if
applicable), on all IFR departures. VFR departures must meet or exceed only any published
gradient, OEI (if applicable), to an appropriate VFR cruise altitude or a MIA.
One Engine Inoperative—Multi-engine aircraft are typically certified as airworthy after
demonstrating satisfactory control authority and climb capability after suffering the loss of one
engine at the most critical moment on takeoff. USAF multi-engine aircraft must be operated so
the aircraft is capable of experiencing such an event and still vertically clear all departure path
obstacles (even at night or while IMC). Therefore, using civilian ―see and avoid‖ rules is
prohibited, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/CC or as published in a Special
MAJCOM Certification procedure.
Operations Supervisor—This term is officially defined in AFI 11-418. MAJCOMS for which
that AFI does not apply (AFSOC/AMC/AFRC) should use an equivalent-level mission execution
authority position as the operations supervisor.
OROCA—An off-route altitude which provides obstruction clearance with a 1,000 ft. buffer in
non-mountainous terrain areas and a 2,000 ft. buffer in designated mountainous areas within the
United States. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational
aids, air traffic control radar, or communications coverage.
ORTCA—An off-route altitude that provides terrain clearance with a 3,000 ft. buffer from
terrain. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational aids, air
traffic control radar, or communications coverage. This altitude is used on en route charts
covering those areas outside the United States.
Passenger—An individual on board the aircraft who is not on the aeronautical orders IAW AFI
11-401. For the purpose of this AFI, MEPs are considered passengers.
P Airfield—Civil airport wherein permit covers use by transient military aircraft.

PANS-OPS—ICAO documents detailing specific procedures for the safety of air traffic
navigation agreed to by ICAO signatories.
Predictive RAIM (P-RAIM)—Using a standard set of algorithms, the availability of RAIM
may be determined based on the satellite coverage expected at an aircraft’s ETA. Due to terrain
masking and other factors (e.g. satellite fails after RAIM prediction made), P-RAIM does not
guarantee there will actually be sufficient satellite coverage on arrival. P-RAIM does not have
to reside in the GPS receiver. It can be provided by FAA Flight Service (US NAS only) and
other ground based RAIM algorithms.
Prevailing Visibility—The greatest horizontal visibility observed throughout at least half of the
horizon circle. It need not be continuous throughout 180 consecutive degrees.
PRM Approach—An instrument landing system (ILS) approach conducted to parallel runways
whose extended centerlines are separated by less than 4,300 ft. and the parallel runways have a
PRM system that permits simultaneous independent ILS approaches. See:
http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/prm/.
Radar Required—This note on an instrument procedure indicates aircraft using the procedure
will be monitored by ATC radar during a particular phase of flight or throughout the entire
procedure, as applicable. Coordination with air traffic is necessary to ensure ATC capability and
agreement to provide these services before adding the note to any instrument procedure. Note:
Instrument procedures with radar requirements should be avoided whenever possible.
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)—RAIM is a two-step process used to
assess the integrity of the GPS signals in the receiver. First, the GPS receiver determines if five
or more working satellites are above the horizon and in the proper geometry to make RAIM
available. Second, based upon the range solutions from those satellites it must determine if the
RAIM algorithm indicates a potential navigation error. Flight in some civil airspace requires
RAIM and FDE.
Reduced Lighting—External aircraft lighting that is less than that required by paragraph 5.20.
Reduced Same Runway Separation—Allows reduction of the normal ATC aircraft separation
standards during landing/touch-and-go and restricted low approach operations to increase the
airport/runway capacity.
Reduced Takeoff Runway Length Procedure—Method used by TERPS to reduce high IFR
climb gradients by shortening the available takeoff runway, thus increasing the distance to the
obstacle, spot elevation, or terrain feature. Normally printed in the IAP    section as: “…or
alternatively, w/ standard takeoff minimums and a normal 200'/NM climb gradient, takeoff must
occur no later than 2200' prior to departure end of runway.” Aircrews are NOT permitted to
compute climb gradients in this manner.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft—The aircraft portion of an unmanned aircraft system. Normally,
Group 4 and 5 unmanned aircraft are considered RPAs, and are flown by RPA Pilots.
Remote/Island Destination—In the absence of more restrictive MAJCOM guidance, pilots will
consider a remote/island destination as any aerodrome that, due to its unique geographic
location, offers no suitable alternate within two hours flying time.
Required Navigation Performance (RNP)—Prescribes the system performance necessary for
operation in a specified airspace, based on its required accuracy (RNP value). The basic
AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                         131


accuracy requirement for RNP-X airspace is for the aircraft to remain within X nautical miles of
the cleared position for 95% of the time in RNP airspace.
RNAV–Area Navigation—Rather than fly established airways from one ground NAVAID to
another, RNAV permits suitably equipped aircraft to operate on any desired course between
virtual waypoints.
Runway Environment—The runway environment consists of one or more of the following
elements: The approach light system (except that the pilot may not descend below 100 ft. above
the Touch Down Zone Elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red
termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable), the threshold,
threshold markings or threshold lights, the runway end identifier lights, the touchdown zone
lights, the runway or runway markings, the runway lights, the visual approach slope indicator.
For more information, refer to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
Runway Visual Range—The maximum distance in the direction of takeoff or landing at which
the runway, or the specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a
specified point on its center line at a height corresponding to the average eye-level of pilots at
touch down. This value is normally determined by instruments located alongside and about 14
ft. above the runway and calibrated with reference to the high-intensity runway lights.
Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM)—Reduces the vertical separation between
properly equipped and certified aircraft to 1000 ft in special qualification airspace, normally
between FL290-410 inclusive.
Self-Contained Approach—An arrival procedure, normally from a minimum IFR altitude, to a
runway, using only navigational equipment on board the aircraft (GPS, radar, or other sensors).
Single Medium Display—A single medium display is a Head-Up Display (HUD), Head-Down
Display (HDD), or Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) presenting flight instrumentation on a
single display such as a HUD combiner, a ―glass‖ multifunction display, or a helmet visor.
Special Departure Procedure—A procedure designed to allow a safe takeoff for multi-engine
aircraft whose OEI climb rate would otherwise not meet the TERPS minimum climb gradient
requirement. The runway and all known obstacles along a chosen takeoff path are analyzed and
compared to the aircraft OEI takeoff and climb performance. The procedure provides a
maximum allowable takeoff gross weight for given environmental conditions that ensure vertical
and lateral obstacle clearance safety margins. The minimum allowable gross and net climb
gradients for SDPs are typically lower than TERPS standards. Unlike TERPS, the takeoff path is
selected to minimize obstacle clearance requirements and only those obstacles within the lateral
limits of the chosen flight path are considered. Pilots should understand that most SDPs allow
exactly zero feet of clearance between their aircraft and the offending obstacles, and provide no
safety factor for pilot technique, less than 100% engine thrust, etc. The term SDP encompasses
both the use of the textual obstacle data table information and the graphical departure
procedures.
Standard Formation—A formation in which no participating aircraft is more than 1 NM
horizontally and 100 feet vertically from the lead aircraft.
Stopover Flight—A flight where intermediate stops are planned en route to a final destination.
 132                                         AFI11-202V3_ACCSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


Tactical Operations—Flight operations consisting of maneuvers that are unique to the
employment of air power to: gain and maintain air superiority, prevent freedom of operation for
the enemy in the objective area, and to assist naval and ground forces in the attainment of their
objectives. Tactical operations must be specifically MAJCOM (or COCOM) defined, approved
and implemented. These operations are normally practiced only on training or exercise missions,
in a form of special use airspace or on designated training ranges or routes.
Terrain Alert Warning System (TAWS)—Generic term for any on-board system taking inputs
from terrain databases, radar altimeter, aircraft position sensors, etc. to activate a Ground
Proximity Warning System or Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).
Developed to help prevent Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) mishaps.
Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)—An airborne system that functions
independently of the ground-based radar to provide collision avoidance protection between
suitably equipped aircraft. TCAS I provides proximity warnings to pilots in the form of traffic
advisories. TCAS II provides both traffic advisories and recommended vertical escape
maneuvers, known as resolution advisories.

Terminal Area Operations—Terminal area operations are normally those flight phases
conducted within 30 NM of an airfield of intended departure or landing, or those operations on
charted Standard Instrument Departures, on charted Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs), or
other flight operations between the last enroute fix/waypoint and an initial approach
fix/waypoint.
Unmanned Aircraft System—A control station, one or more unmanned aircraft, control and
payload datalinks, and mission payloads, designed or modified not to carry a human pilot and
operated through remote or self-contained autonomous control. A UAS must meet all applicable
requirements of a manned aircraft, unless specifically exempted. The term RPA is specific to the
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (the flying portion of the UAS).
Unmonitored Navigational Aid—Most NAVAIDs have internal monitoring systems that
provide automatic shutdown or notification when a malfunction occurs. Unmonitored
NAVAIDs lack the ability to immediately notify ATC when a malfunction occurs. The pilot
may still use the NAVAID for all types of navigation, including instrument approaches, but must
monitor the NAVAID for a loss of identification since no prior warning of operation may be
available from ATC.
Visual Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions in which visual flight rules may
be used; expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from clouds along
the path of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological conditions prevail
and instrument flight rules must be followed.
VFR-on-Top—ATC authorization for an IFR aircraft to operate in VFR conditions at any
appropriate VFR altitude (as specified in FLIP and as restricted by ATC). A pilot receiving this
authorization must comply with the VFR visibility, distance from cloud criteria, and the
minimum IFR altitudes specified in Chapters 7 and 8.
VFR- over-the-Top—VFR flight maneuver during which an aircraft on a VFR flight plan
climbs over a ceiling in VMC, maintains VMC above the clouds, then descends in VMC and
lands.

Vertical Navigation (VNAV)—A term that describes using GPS lateral and vertical guidance to
define the minimums for a GPS non-precision or precision approach.
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)—The U.S. implementation of Space Based
Augmentation System (SBAS), a satellite navigation system consisting of the equipment and
software which augments the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS).
World Geodetic Survey—1984 (WGS-84)—Developed by the U.S. for world mapping, WGS
84 is an earth fixed global reference frame. It is the ICAO standard.

  A4.1.4. (Added-ACC) Comments:
     A4.1.4.1. (Added-ACC) This chart applies only to lightweight flight clothing to include
     COMBAT EDGE equipment and Chemical Defense (CD) training gear. CD training in
     the caution and danger zones should be limited to wearing of flight helmet, CD mask,
     filter pack/blower and Nomex flight gloves. Every effort should be taken to limit direct
     exposure to high temperatures by keeping the aircraft sheltered for as long as possible
