              SAMPLE NOTIFICATION OFFICER SELECTION PROCESS

Table A26.1. (Added) Notification Officer Selection Process.
A26.1. Groups are specified by periods when prospective notification officers are placed on-call
for a 7 day period. The method of selection is based on the number of weeks each group/Fighter
Wing Staff Agency by the number of Field Grade Officers assigned (minus the Wing
Commander, Vice Wing Commander, and the four Group Commanders.)
A26.2. Approximately 30 days before the start of each quarter, a request is sent to commanders
and their executive officers to identify notification officers for the weeks their groups were
selected to fill. The officers selected can then be trained by the CAR as the date of their assigned
weeks approach.
A26.3. Medical officers/chaplains may also be used to fill notification officer duties if desired
and if called upon will be dual-hatted by performing this role along with their medical/pastoral
responsibilities as well.
A26.4. Officers selected should not be scheduled for any TDYs/Deployments/leave etcs., during
their 7 days window and need to refrain from any actions that could prevent them from
performing this duty if called upon (leaving the local area, obligated commitments, etc.) Pilots
may continue with their flying scheduled while on-call.
