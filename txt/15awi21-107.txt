OPR: 154 MXS/CC                                           Certified by: 15 MXS/CC (Lt Col Robert Butz)
Supersedes 15 AWI 21-107, 8 Mar 2005                                                        Pages: 14

This instruction provides the basic procedures to be followed for aircraft recovery/removal in the event of
a crashed/disabled aircraft after all initial response events have been accomplished. The 15th Airlift Wing
provides crash recovery for base-assigned aircraft and contains capabilities for the recovery of crash/dis-
abled US military and military contracted aircraft landing at Hickam AFB or on the island of Oahu in sup-
port of the 15th Airlift Wing. Physical aircraft removal procedures will not be implemented until
approved by the Safety Investigation Board or Incident Commander (IC). The CRTC (Crash Recovery
Team Chief)/CRT (Crash Recovery Team) does not act as the IC. This instruction applies to all personnel
assigned to the 15th Airlift Wing and tenant units who have responsibility for the above actions. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance
with AFMAN37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordancewith the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/
.” Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibil-
ity (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Throughout the publication office names have been changed to reflect the partnership with the Hawaii Air
National Guard. This revision incorporates significant changes from the previous version. All personnel
should read this instruction carefully.


1. Policy:
   1.1. Hickam Air Force Base will return to operational status as soon as practical after a mishap. The
   15th Airlift Wing Commander or designated representative, as stated in AFI 10-2501, Air Force
   Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, will determine the degree of emer-
   gency and make the decision regarding the speed with which the runway is cleared.

    1.2. The Crashed, Damaged, or Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR) program is established to
    recover damaged or disabled aircraft in minimum time and consistent with the following consider-
    ations:
       1.2.1. The requirement to re-open the runway for operational use.
       1.2.2. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
       1.2.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap or accident investigations.
       1.2.4. Safety of personnel involved with recovery operations.
       1.2.5. In accordance with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, when an aircraft is
       under investigation by the Interim Safety Board (ISB) or the Safety Investigation Board (SIB),
       recovery operations will not proceed until the board president releases the aircraft. Personnel who
       are not engaged in the investigation will remain outside of the recovery area. The crash recovery
       team may be called upon to perform tasks as required by the investigation team.
    1.3. The CDDAR program instruction is procedural and will not take precedence over aircraft-spe-
    cific technical data in recovery of crashed, damaged, or disabled aircraft.
WARNING: Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure may cause serious injury or
death to those in contact with it. T.O. 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response
Information (Emergency Services) contains information regarding aircraft-specific composite component
locations, and should be consulted when responding to aircraft incidents. Transient aircraft’s home base
should be contacted to determine composite material risks and requirements for Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE).
CAUTION: The aircraft and crash site will be disturbed only to the extent required to eliminate any
potentially dangerous situation to the aircraft, support equipment, or personnel, and will remain in an
undisturbed state until the aircraft is released to maintenance by the Incident Commander (IC).
