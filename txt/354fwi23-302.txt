SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
realigns references and updated AFPD changes.
1. Goal. To reduce mishaps and avert personal injury or death to Air Force personnel and
reduce the wing’s cost of vehicle accident and abuse repairs.
 2                                                             354FWI23-302 5 JANUARY 2012


2. Objective. To establish an effective mishap prevention program by placing responsibility
and accountability on the operator's commander to maintain high standards of vehicle operator
training and discipline and the use of operational risk management in all aspects of vehicle
operations. Consequently, procedures set forth in paragraph six of this instruction will require
unit funding for the actual cost of materials and labor (labor: if repaired using contracted
maintenance) used to repair accident and abuse damage of assigned assets. This policy will foster
better operator care to safeguard the overall condition of Eielson’s vehicle fleet.
3. Definitions.
     3.1. Accident: A vehicle accident is the result of a collision with any foreign object.
     3.2. Abuse: Vehicle abuse is considered damage caused by willful or negligent acts of
     improper operation or care. Some examples of vehicle abuse are listed in attachment 4.
     3.3. Incident: Damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters, mechanical failures or
     other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided by safe operation or adequate
     vehicle care during non-use. Causes of incidents may also include damage resulting from
     normal use for the vehicle’s intended purpose (for example, snow removal or heavy
     construction work). Using organizations are not required to reimburse for damage caused by
     incidents.
     3.4. Fair wear and tear: The normal expected deterioration of a vehicle or equipment based
     on its age, usage and life expectancy.
4. Key Personnel/Organization Responsibilities.
     4.1. The 354 LRS/CC will:
        4.1.1. Provide accident or abuse notification memorandum (attachment 2) and photos to
        the using organization’s squadron commander. This responsibility can be delegated by
        the 354 LRS/CC.
        4.1.2. Send an abuse notification memorandum to the unit’s commander.
            4.1.2.1. Direct accident/abuse repair estimates within 5 days after accident/abuse
            notification, if using organization’s commander does not indicate to the 354 LRS
            Vehicle Management Flight a report of survey (ROS) investigation has been initiated
            and the asset is needed for investigation.
        4.1.3. Not provide U-Drive-It (UDI) replacements to organizations with vehicles
        involved in accidents or identified as abuse, unless it will impede sortie generation or
        sustainment.
        4.1.4. Not authorize accident or abuse repairs until organizational commanders,
        responsible for the accident or abuse, acknowledge reimbursement to the 354 LRS
        Vehicle Management Flight for the entire cost of the repair. Assets not reimbursed will
        be subject to redistribution, and the vehicle authorization will be recommended for
        deletion.
     4.2. The 354 LRS Vehicle Fleet Manager and Vehicle Management Superintendent or
     designated representative (MSgt or above) will:
354FWI23-302 5 JANUARY 2012                                                                  3


     4.2.1. Identify suspected cases of accidents or abuses, evaluate and validate each alleged
     vehicle or vehicles on a case by case basis.
     4.2.2. Consider the facts and determine whether the vehicle should be processed as an
     accident or suspected abuse due to damages not attributed to fair wear and tear or natural
     incident. NOTE: Unreported accidents are treated as vehicle abuse.
  4.3. Vehicle Management and Analysis section (VM&A) will:
     4.3.1. Document and track vehicle accident and abuse repairs.
     4.3.2. VM&A will prepare an AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement,
     when requested by the using organization commander. Note: Both military and civilian
     direct labor charges computed by OLVIMS are used for determining labor cost for in-
     house repairs of vehicles/equipment on the AF Form 20.
  4.4. Using organization’s commander will:
     4.4.1. When deemed appropriate, appoint an investigating officer to conduct a
     preliminary investigation IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force
     Property, Chapter 18.
     4.4.2. Ensure the investigation is completed and processed IAW AFMAN 23-220,
     Chapter 18.
     4.4.3. Release vehicle for repair to 354 LRS Vehicle Management Flight, and ensure
     funds are available to pay for unit’s accident and abuse repairs.
     4.4.4. If an organizational commander thinks the government owned vehicle or
     equipment accident/abuse case is not justified, written justification must be forwarded to
     the 354 LRS/CC. If the 354 LRS/CC agrees, the accident/abuse case will be dropped. If
     the 354 LRS/CC does not agree with the using organization that a vehicle accident/abuse
     case is not justified, the 354 MSG/CC becomes the arbitrary authority.
     4.4.5. Follow procedures outlined in paragraph six of this instruction.
  4.5. Assigned or using organization will:
     4.5.1. Ensure an SF 91 is accomplished at the time of an alleged accident and vehicle
     maintenance is notified at 377-4229 during duty hours and 388-2540 during standby
     operation to respond to the scene. Vehicle management personnel will determine safety,
     serviceability and drivability of the vehicle status and advise unit on transportation
     methods.
     4.5.2. Ensure their unit personnel are on scene until the vehicle is transported to the
     vehicle management flight.
     4.5.3. Coordinate reimbursement to the 354 LRS for all vehicle part and/or contract
     repair costs of damaged vehicles due to an accident or vehicle abuse. Turn vehicles into
     vehicle management immediately upon release from the accident scene. The initial
     responsibility to identify and report accidents rests with the vehicle operator and the
     vehicle’s assigned unit.
 4                                                           354FWI23-302 5 JANUARY 2012

        for repairs.
     4.6. Vehicle Control Officer/Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Officer (VCO/VCNCO)
     will:
        4.6.1. Maintain a record of unit’s accident and abuse cases.
        4.6.2. Send a copy of the accident report to the 354 FW/SE.
        4.6.3. Coordinate with VM&A regarding status of unit’s funding of accident/abuse
        repairs.
     4.7. Units TDY to Eielson Air Force Base driving 354 FW vehicles:
        4.7.1. Units will provide an AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement
        Document, with unit’s accounting classification to the 354 LRS Vehicle Management
        Flight obligating $5,000, or as directed by 354 LRS/CC, to cover accident/abuse repairs.
        4.7.2. VM&A will hold AF Form 406 until after exercise or mission is complete and
        final vehicle assessments have been determined. VM&A will return AF Form 406 to the
        home station unit upon completion of accident/abuse repairs.
        4.7.3. Units will send AF Form 406 to 354lrs.vm&a@eielson.af.mil.
     4.8. Personnel TDY to Eielson Air Force Base driving 354 FW vehicles will:

     organization will provide the 354 FW/JA with sufficient information about the accident to
     determine if the POV or GOV driver was at fault. If the POV was at fault, the 354 FW/JA
     will pursue repairs through the POV insurance company, with all repairs being accomplished
     through contractors to facilitate reimbursement of costs.
     5.2. Multiple-Unit Accidents: Each unit will conduct an investigation. The commanders of
     the units involved will jointly determine liability. If a decision cannot be made the 354
     MSG/CC will have final decision authority.
     5.3. Pecuniary Liability: GOV reimbursement to the 354 LRS for repairs due to accidents or
     abuse will be made to the unit. The unit/CC is responsible to determine the individual’s
     pecuniary liability as assessed through a ROS.
6. Procedures. Upon determination of vehicle damage, as a result of an accident or abuse:
354FWI23-302 5 JANUARY 2012                                                                   5

     using organizational commander is accepting financial liability and will allocate funds for
     vehicle repairs.
  6.2. All accident and abuse repairs, for registered vehicles, estimated below the Government
  Purchase Card (GPC) micro-purchase threshold of $3,000 will be completed utilizing
  contracted maintenance. Vehicle Management Flight will source vendors to complete repairs
  and track repairs with contract work orders. Responsible using organization will make GPC
  payment to vendor when repairs are complete.
  6.3. For all accident and abuse repairs estimated above the micro-purchase threshold and for
  all dry-leased General Services Administration (GSA) vehicle accidents and abuses, the
  process will be completed using the AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, procedure. The
  VM&A section will receive repair quotes from three sources and provide the information to
  the responsible using organization’s Resource Advisor (RA) and courtesy copy the unit’s
  VCO/VCNCO. Upon receipt of the quotes from VM&A, the responsible using organization’s
  RA will process the AF Form 9 in Automated Business Services System within 3 duty days.
  The RA and unit VCO/VCNCO will contact VM&A to provide status updates and assistance
  to resolve any difficulties in the process. NOTE: This procedure does not apply to GSA
  vehicles on a wet lease. Please contact VM&A at 377-4745 to see if your vehicles are on a
  dry lease or wet lease.
