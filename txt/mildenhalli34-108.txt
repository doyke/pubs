1. General.
     1.1. The Mildenhall “Very Important Teen (VIT) Program” reduces the Air Force age
     limitations for unrestricted use of certain portions of Mildenhall Fitness and Sports Centers to
     the age of 13 for program participants only. For purposes of this instruction, unrestricted use
     is defined as not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian or requiring interactive
     supervision from an adult.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Mildenhall Fitness and Sports Center staff will administer paperwork for all
     participants in the VIT program. Applicants will be issued a VIT identification card once all
     eligibility requirements have been completed.
     2.2. Participants will be required to complete a Fitness Center orientation on proper use of
     all equipment in the Selectorized/Cardiovascular Rooms. The free-weight room will be off-
     limits for all participants in the program, unless they are accompanied by an adult in
     accordance with AFI 34-266. The fitness center staff will provide each participant and
     parent/guardian the policies and procedures that apply to each specific area of the fitness
     center.
     2.3. The parent and participant will sign and date that they have read and agree with the
     terms of the program. Once the orientation is completed and the participant feels confident
     in the program policy procedures they will take a VIT Certification Written Assessment.
     Once assessment is completed with a minimum score of 85% they will receive their VIT
     card. If the assessment is taken with a failing score the participant must wait 24 hours before
     they can retest. Any violation of the policies will result in administrative action, including
     but not limited to removal from the program.
     2.4. The Fitness Staff will not be responsible for directly supervising or monitoring program
     participants under any circumstances other than to ensure that participants are not violating
     program policies.
3. Eligibility.
     3.1. All dependents of active duty military and DoD civilians assigned to RAF Mildenhall
     between the ages of 13 and 15 are qualified to participate in the VIT program.
4. Disciplinary Action.
     4.1. All participants are required to abide by the same policies and procedures that adult
     patrons must follow. If the participant violates those policies and procedures, depending on
     the severity of incident, a warning will be issued. If behavior continues and is not corrected,
     card and privileges will be removed. Once privileges are removed, the participant will not be
     eligible for the program again until he/she reaches the age of 16. In accordance with AFI 34-
     266, anyone 16 years and above may utilize the Sports and Fitness Center without adult
     supervision. The authority for removal from the program is delegated to the Mildenhall
     Sports and Fitness Center Manager.
