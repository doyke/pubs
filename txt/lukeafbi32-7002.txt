       2.8.13.2. Host units will notify the HAZMO of any HAZMAT usage/requirements
       for units deploying to Luke.
    2.8.14. Coordinate the purchase of all building materials through 56 CES/CEAN prior to
    procurement for potential hazard content evaluation.
LUKEAFBI32-7002 13 DECEMBER 2012                                                             9


     2.8.15. Contact 56 LRS HAZMART for Weapon Systems HAZMAT shelf-life
     requirements.
     2.8.16. Ensure all HAZMAT container lids are closed when not in use.
  2.9. The QAP will:
     2.9.1. Ensure contractors provide 56 CES/CEAN a Contractor’s Environmental
     Reporting Entry Form (LUKEAFB Form 317) and copies MSDSs for HAZMAT to be
     used during the contract period at least 5 days prior to start of project.
         2.9.1.1. Ensure Contractor’s Environmental Reporting Entry Form includes
         nomenclature, manufacture, part number, quantity, HAZMAT application process,
         and storage location.
         2.9.1.2. Monitor work performed by the Corps of Engineers, 56 CES Simplified
         Acquisition Base Engineer Requirements (SABER), centrally managed contracts,
         work performed under an AF Form 9 and ensure LUKEAFB Form 317 is complete.
         HAZMAT used by contractors on Luke AFB, or its property, is not subject to the
         approval process, but is subject to tracking requirements. Contractors are responsible
         for identifying the type and quantities of chemicals to be used.
     2.9.2. Provide the HAZMO a monthly HAZMAT usage report on the actual amount of
     HAZMAT used by contractor. Contactor will use the LUKEAFB Form 317 to report
     monthly usage.
     2.9.3. Notify HAZMO upon completion of project/service contracts.
3. Luke HAZMAT Reduction Procedures:
  3.1. Identification of items that may be replaced by substitutes having lower environmental
  or health hazard concerns will be accomplished during the HAZMAT authorization process.
  Work centers are responsible for making every attempt to identify substitutes and submitting
  technical order changes.
  3.2. The user work centers will make every attempt to either avoid using HAZMAT or
  minimize its use, or seek non-hazardous materials to substitute for the HAZMAT when
  available.
  3.3. To effectively reduce levels of HAZMAT on base, no more than 200 percent of the
  authorized draw amount will be maintained in each work center (e.g., If a shop authorized
  draw amount is 2 tubes of sealant monthly, no more than 4 tubes can be maintained in the
  shop at any given time).
  3.4. Workcenters will turn in excess HAZMAT to their respective HAZMART IAW
  paragraph 2.8.4. and 2.8.8.
  3.5. Each HAZMART will establish a free-issue, reuse, and redistribution operation for
  returned HAZMAT no longer needed by the original user. Every attempt will be made to
  issue returned material before issuing new material. Additionally, local stock numbers will
  be established for a smaller unit of issue whenever feasible to provide users the absolute
  minimal amount of material (e.g., pint versus a gallon).
4. GPC/Form 9 HAZMAT Purchases:
 10                                               LUKEAFBI32-7002 13 DECEMBER 2012


   4.1. Users must obtain authorization approval for HAZMAT regardless of where or how the
   HAZMAT is purchased. MSDSs for products must be sent to HAZMO prior to purchase.
   Before HAZMAT is purchased with an AF Form 9 or GPC, the user must obtain a control
   number from the HAZMAT tracking system for HAZMAT that has been authorized for
   purchase.
      4.1.1. An approved AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, must accompany
      all local purchase HAZMAT requests for self-help projects.
   4.2. Users will submit a AF HAZMAT tracking system receipt to the HAZMART within 2
   business days of receiving HAZMAT purchased. Receipt must identify date product
   received, respective unit/organization, the AF HAZMAT tracking system shop code, product
   name, manufacturer, locally assigned stock number, quantity and container size, unit cost of
   product purchased, and control number issued through the AF HAZMAT tracking system.
   4.3. After HAZMART verifies the purchased HAZMAT matches the authorization,
   HAZMART will issue the product in the AF HAZMAT tracking system.
   4.4. If the product purchased differs from the approved item (e.g. different manufacturer,
   unit of issue), the user must provide a new MSDS for the substitute item to the HAZMO for
   re-approval.
   4.5. HAZMARTs and SOS will report known GPC violations of HAZMAT purchases to 56
   CONS/LGCP via email.
5. Air Force Weapon System Hazardous Material Program (WSHP):
   5.1. The HMMPT will provide adequate support for the WSHP process. The MXG
   Environmental Coordinator (EC) will chair process teams under the management and
   guidance of the 56 FW Pollution Prevention Council.
6. Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Management:
   6.1. Weapon System ODSs.
      6.1.1. The HAZMART will be the central ordering point for all Weapon System Class I
      ODS, and all purchases will be through the Standard Base Supply System. Copies of
      T.O. or equivalent will accompany all Class I ODS requests. The MXG EC will validate
      each request to ensure pre-approval by HQ AETC/A4MSE. The MXG EC will contact
      HQ AETC/A4MSE for resolution of any extraordinary requests.
      6.1.2. The MXG EC will forward the Class I ODS requirements to HQ AETC/A4MSE
      as required. A courtesy report will be provided to 56 CES/CEAN.
LUKEAFBI32-7002 13 DECEMBER 2012                                         11


  6.2. Facility ODS (56 CES/CEO) will:
     6.2.1. Create and maintain an ODS Facility Management Plan.
     6.2.2. Collect ODS usage data for reporting to required agencies.
