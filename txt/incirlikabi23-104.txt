                                          Chapter 1

               TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HM)

1.1. Purpose and Overview. Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) DOD 4500.9R, Chap
204, para C 2 directs services to comply with applicable Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA)
and host nation (HN) requirements when moving hazardous material on and off-the-installation
by commercial surface, sea or air transportation mode. The Republic of Turkey adopted and
implemented all European Union regulations concerning safe handling and management of
chemicals, i.e. Classification, Packaging and Labeling (CLP) of chemicals, Registration,
Authorization, Evaluation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Reduction of Hazardous
Substances (RoHS) and the reduction and elimination of substances depleting the Ozone layer
(ODS). Further TU implemented the European agreements ADR, Movement of Dangerous
Goods by Road, and RID, Movement of Dangerous Goods by Rail, the International Maritime
Dangerous Goods Code, and the International Air Transport Association Dangerous Goods
Regulation (IATA-DGR) as national law. Unless stated otherwise, all chapters and attachments
of this instruction apply to on and off-base transportation of HM/HW/CW. This publication may
not be supplemented or altered. Note: IAW CDGP Para 3.2 the Installation Commander
determines the requirements for on-installation transportation of regulated amounts of hazardous
material as defined in this instruction.
1.2. Responsibilities and duties. Responsibilities and duties of Commanders, Dangerous
Goods Advisors (DGAs) and functional elements (e.g. Shippers, Carriers, Certifiers) of units
transporting HM are prescribed in the USAFE Command Dangerous Goods Program (CDGP),
USAFEI 23-104. Squadrons assigned to 39 ABW, including GSUS 425ABS IZMIR & 717 ABS
ANKARAs, and tenant units (728 AMS) stationed on Incirlik AB with responsibilities and duties
according to CDGP are listed in Attachment 12. This list will be reviewed and updated by the
IDGA annually, based on information gained during mandatory inspections. In general, all
personnel involved in activities relating to the movement of HM/HW/CW must ensure all safety
requirements are met. Commanders of tenant units may implement their own instruction to
organize the duties and responsibilities identified in the CDGP and as directed and coordinated
within their own command structure.
   1.2.1. Installation Commander. By law the overall responsibility for the transportation
   safety of HM/HW/CW rests with the head of the organization. The 39 ABW/CC is the head
   of the organization in this sense for all organizations under the 39 ABW and tenant units on
   installations managed by this wing.
   1.2.2. The Installation DGA (IDGA) manages the implementation and execution of the
   USAFE CDGP on Incirlik Air Base IAW section 3 and 4 of USAFEI23-104. The IDGA
   office is assigned to 39 MSG /CC. The IDGA duty phone numbers are 676-6202 and Mob:
   0090 530 227 31 47. The IDGA provides on call duty to support incident commanders in
   case of an incident according to Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan and to assist
   Units in case of a HM/HW/CW related movement accident. Note: Names and contact
   information of the IDGA and UDGA must be posted on the safety board of every unit
   handling hazardous material. To ensure the monitoring duties of the Wing commander are
   properly executed and documented. The IDGA will act as a Wing IG augmentee IAW AFI
   90-201 and as identified by the USAFE CDGP MICT checklist. The IDGA may publish a
 6 INCIRLIKABI23-104 10 JULY 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 17 September 2014


   local MICT checklist based on this instruction to cover additional local requirements
   identified in by this instruction.
   1.2.3. Unit Commanders. This applies to group and/or squadron commander                Unit
   Commanders are appointed persons and also responsible persons in the meaning of the DG
   transportation law as explained in USAFEI23-104. Unit commanders ensure personnel
   charged with duties identified in section 8 of USAFE 23-104 are properly trained before
   assuming those duties. Further details to unit commander responsibilities are identified in
   USAFE 23-104, section 5, and as described herein. The following units are required to set up
   a unit program: 39 CES, 39 LRS, 39 MDG, 39 MXS, 39 SFS, 39 FSS, 728 AMS, 425 ABS,
   717 ABS. Depending on volume and in coordination with the Installation DGA the
   appointment of a unit DGA (UDGA) may at group or squadron level. Unit commanders
   must ensure the unit DGAs execute the duties identified in USAFE 23-104, section 6, in
   cooperation with the IDGA.
   1.2.4. Unit DGAs (UDGA), appointed at Flight, Squadron or Group level, are executing the
   USAFE Command Dangerous Goods Program as supplemented by this instruction on behalf
   of the Unit Commander. Unit Commanders still remain ultimately responsible. The CDGP
   related documents shall be filed in single binder(s) as structured and described in Attachment
   14, of this instruction.
   1.2.5. Contractors are expected to adhere to all host nation laws, including Final Governing
   Standards (FGS) applying to transportation of dangerous goods on/off base. USG Personnel
   involved in the supervision of contracted activities relating to the movement of HM/HW/CW
   must also ensure all safety requirements are met and that all contractors adhere to the
   implementation of Dangerous Goods Program IAW USAFEI23-104.
1.3. Scope. Packages of HM consigned for movement sea will be prepared IAW the IMDG.
The movement by air must comply to IATA_DGR. The use of AFMAN 24-204 for MILAIR is
authorized in TU as identified in the ratification document to STANAG 3854. The movement
of Hazardous Materials on and off Incirlik Air Base by road must comply with the safety
provisions set forth in this instruction and to the provisions of ADR regulation for Transport of
Dangerous Goods by road, and EC 1272/2008, Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP).
This instruction does not apply to on-base transportation of explosive or ammunition. For the
on-base movement of ammunition and explosives refer to AFMAN 91-201 and corresponding
USAFE Supl. In areas where the Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part II (DOD
4500.9-R) is more stringent than ADR, DTR Part II applies for movements of Hazardous
Materials on the installation. Note: Organizations moving dangerous goods or hazardous waste
on and off Incirlik Air Base must keep a current copy of the ADR on file in the unit. The most
current version of the ADR (PDF file) may be downloaded from the following Web-site:

      for official duty travel transporting HM/HW/CW, the exemptions listed in the ADR for
      private persons will not apply.
      2.1.9.3. Under no circumstances will packages containing HM /HW/CW requiring
      ventilation be carried in vehicle passenger compartment. If HM/HW/CW is moved in
      open passenger compartments, i.e. vans or busses, provided ventilation is not required,
      the packages must be secured IAW the safety principles for load securing.
      2.1.9.4. Closed or sheeted vehicles may be used for carriage of packaging sensitive to
      moisture.
      2.1.9.5. Open or ventilated vehicles/containers (ventilated: one 10x10 cm opening at the
      top front and one 10x10 cm opening at the rear end of the trailer) may be required to
      carry HM/HW/CW, if directed by the ‘Special Provisions for Carriage’ outlined in Chap
      3.2, Table A, Column 18 ADR (e.g. CV 36 or V14).
   2.1.10. Step 10 – Load Securing (*4, 6). Packages containing HM /HW/CW must be
   securely fixed or packed in vehicles or containers to prevent movement or release of
   dangerous goods during transportation. AE 55-48, Blocking and Bracing for Motor
   Transport, Technical Orders (e.g. T.O. 11A-1-61-series), or MIL-STD 1386 series, or
   European or American Motor Carrier best load securing practices may be used to determine
   load securing (blocking and bracing techniques) Personnel applying load securing principles
   must be in the possession of the applicable training certificate.
   2.1.11. Step 11 – Placarding (Hazmat placards and orange-colored plates) (*4, 6,
   7). Tank-vehicles (including tank-vehicles, not drained and purged) and other transport units
   or large containers (ISOs and MILVANs) carrying HM exceeding threshold limits specified
   in table 1.1.3.6.3, ADR must be placarded, marked and furnished with orange-colored plates
   according to Ch. 5.3, ADR. Corresponding placards required for other modes of transport
   (including placards specified in CFR 49), with minor variations which do not affect the
   obvious meaning of the placards, are also acceptable. The placards may include text such as
   UN number or words describing the hazard (i.e. ‘Flammable Liquid’) provided the text does
   not obscure or detract from other required placard elements. Affixing an additional placard
   at the front of the tractor is optional. Cover or remove placards and orange-colored plates
   once vehicle is unloaded, clean and free of residues¹. Note: Tank vehicles or tank containers
   must be empty, drained and purged prior to removing placards and/or orange colored plates.
   2.1.12. Step 12 – Vehicle Crew (*5, 6). Drivers of vehicles transporting HM/HW/CW on
   and off-base in quantities exceeding the exemption limits prescribed in 1.1.3.6, ADR must
   possess a valid ADR driver certificate according to paragraph 6.2.4.1 of this instruction and a
   driver’s license required for size and type of vehicles used for transportation. Prior to
   movement the consignor/carrier must brief the driver on the contents of the load, any
   necessary miscellaneous requirements, requirements concerning the supervision of transport
   units and emergency procedures in case of vehicle breakdown, accident and/or accidental
   release of HM as described in Chapters 3 and 4 below.
   2.1.13. Step 13 – Security (*1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Regardless of quantity, before releasing
   HAZMAT to driver(s), shipper/loader will verify the identity of the crew members.
   Therefore each member of the vehicle crew must carry an identification card which includes
   their photograph. See Chapter 4 for additional guidance.

     CLASSIFICATION, LABELING AND PACKAGING (CLP) OF HAZARDOUS
                              MATERIAL

8.1. General Information. European Directive EC/1272/2008 (CLP) regulates the
classification, labeling and packaging of chemical mixtures and substances in the European
Community. Turkey adopted and implemented CLP by publishing Official Gazette 27092, dated
26 December 2008. The requirement for hazard communication in the form of labeling during
transport is based on Articles 1(6) and 33 of the CLP; as implemented by the EUCOM Command
Hazardous Material Management Program Advisory Note 01-11 and attachment 8 of USAFEI
23-104. For movement of hazardous material which is not covered in DG regulations, i.e. ADR,
RID, IMDG, IATA-DGR or AFMAN 24-204, the outer package must be marked IAW CLP. Ref
29 CFR the organization using hazardous material outside of the US must update the safety data
sheet with the relevant HAZCOM information of the HN were the material is actually located.
For the purpose of this instruction this means all HM in the inventory of the units and tenants of
the 39 ABW section 12 of the material safety data sheet must be reviewed to ensure
identification of risk of polluting the aquatic environment. Further section 14 of the MSDS must
be checked for identification of the proper UN number IAW ADR. The coordination of the
proper H and P statements for section 15 of the MSDS may be through the Bioenvironmental
engineering, safety, or environmental expert who need to be equally trained on the UN Globally
Harmonized System (GHS) as identified in 29 CFR and the European version of it, the CLP.
8.2. Procedures. Comply with detailed information provided in attachment 8 of USAFE23-104
and the following general procedures.
   8.2.1. Units with responsibilities for storing, preparing and moving chemical substances and
   mixtures must ensure a label with the following information is affixed on the package [CLP
   references (Articles) are cited after the description in italic letters]:
       8.2.1.1. Hazard pictograms; Article 19, CLP
       8.2.1.2. Signal Words; Article 20, CLP
       8.2.1.3. Hazard statements; Article 21, CLP
       8.2.1.4. Precautionary statements; Article 22,CLP
       8.2.1.5. Supplemental information; Article 25,CLP
   8.2.2. Copy of the CLP (PDF file) may be downloaded from the following web-site:
   http://eur-
   lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:353:0001:1355:EN:PDF
   Note: All Substances and mixtures classified as hazardous IAW CLP must bear the described
   label; regardless if regulated by ADR/IMDG-Code. Outer packages of combination packages
   may be exempt from CLP labeling requirements.

NOTES:

OBO = On Base Only (minimum requirement - applies to the carriage of dangerous goods (DG) within fenced boundaries of
military installations)
ADR = European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (comply when moving DG off
the installation)
RID = Regulations Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail (comply when moving DG in a
transportation chain incl. rail)
IMDG-Code =International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (comply when moving DG in transportation a chain incl. sealift)
DG = Dangerous Goods (hazardous material and hazardous waste)
CTU = Cargo Transport Unit

¹ For plastics containers, unless otherwise approved by the competent authority, the period of use permitted for the carriage of
dangerous substances is 5 years, except where a shorter period of use is prescribed (e.g. 2 years for UN 1790 & UN 2031 IAW SP
PP81).

² Required for combination packages containing inner packages filled with liquids (Exemption: Combination packages
containing hermetically sealed inner packages with not more than 500 ml each); Single packages fitted with vents; Cryogenic
receptacles carrying liquefied gases.

³ Applies to UN3077 & UN3082 and dangerous goods classified as environmentally hazardous IAW Para 2.2.9.1.10.5, ADR/RID.
Marking is required on single packages or inner packages of combination packages exceeding 5 liters for liquids and 5 kg for
solids. Marking is not required on ‘Overpack’.

⁴ Applies to UN3077 & UN3082 (see MSDS); dangerous goods classified as environmentally hazardous substances (aquatic
environment) IAW Para 2.9.3, IMDG-Code (see MSDS); and dangerous goods coded ‘P’ in Index and/or in the Dangerous Goods
List, Part 3 of IMDG. Marking is required on single packages or inner packages of combination packages exceeding 5 liters for
liquids and 5 kg for solids. Marking is required on ‘Overpack’.

⁵ GHS labels (showing Pictogram, Signal Words etc. - see Art. 16 of CLP) are required on: all single packages; inner and outer
packages of combination packages (not required on outer package if dangerous goods labels are affixed). EG-MSDS, Part 2
provides information on hazard identification, GHS-Classification and labeling.

⁶ Transport units carrying DG must display two rectangular orange-colored plates (to be mounted at the front and the rear of the
vehicle). Orange-colored plates affixed on tank-vehicles must also bear the UN number (lower half) and the hazard identification
number (upper half).

⁷ Vehicles and their contents handed over for piggyback transport must meet the provisions of ADR (Ref.: 1.1.4.4, RID).

⁸ Containers (e.g. ISOs, MILVANs and tank-containers) must be affixed with placards (min 25x25cm in size) identifying the
hazard(s) of the contents. With respect to colors and symbols, Placards shall have the same design as labels (correspond to
5.2.2.2, ADR/RID/IMDG). No placards are required for ammunition/explosives of Division 1.4, compatibility group S.

⁹ Vehicles used for the carriage of class 1 & 7 (other than in containers) must be affixed with placards described in Note ⁸.

¹⁰ Tank-vehicles must always be affixed with corresponding placards, unless tanks are drained and purged.

¹² For Class 1, compatibility groups shall not be indicated on placards if the vehicle or container is carrying substances or articles
belonging to two or more compatibility groups.

¹³ Mark is required on containers and tank-vehicles carrying environmentally hazardous substances meeting the criteria of
2.2.9.1.10, ADR/RID. Equivalent marine pollutant mark is required when moving DG defined as marine pollutants in transport
chain including sealift. Marine Pollutant marks are still required even packages may be exempt from labeling IAW Note⁴.
Review MSDS for classification details.

¹⁴ Display UN Number (within the placard or next to the placard – Ref. 5.3.2.1, IMDG) when DG is loaded in excess of 4000 kg
gross mass, to which only one UN Number has been assigned and which are the only dangerous goods in the transport unit.

¹⁵ PSN of the contents must durably be marked on at least both sides of: Tank transport units; bulk containers and any other
CTUs containing packaged DG of a single commodity for which no placard, UN Number or marine pollutant mark is required.
Alternatively, the UN Number may be displayed.

¹⁶ Shunting labels confirming to Models 13 or 15 must be affixed on both sides of railcars carrying DG (mostly Class 1), if model
numbers are assigned to DG listed in Chap 3.2, table A, Column 5, DG list, RID.

¹⁷ IMDG-Code: Always. ADR/RID: Exempt under certain conditions – see Chap 3.4
