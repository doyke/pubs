This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and Facilities. It
establishes United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) policy, procedures, and responsibilities for air-
craft shelters and the associated equipment assignment, operation, repair, and maintenance. It applies to
all shelters at main operating bases (MOB), collocated operating bases (COB), and forward operating
locations (FOL) within USAFE area of responsibility (AOR). Use AF Manual (AFMAN) 91-201, Explo-
sives Safety Standards, and USAFEI 21-101, USAFE Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,
as references for safety and aircraft use of protective aircraft shelters (PAS). Maintain and dispose of
records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposi-
tion Schedule (will become AFMAN 33-3222 Vol. 4). This instruction does not apply to US Air Force
Reserve or Air National Guard.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision changes the format to comply with most recent publications policy, and replaces all refer-
ences to HQ USAFE/CEO, Operations Division to HQ USAFE/CEC, Engineering Division.


1. General. PAS are protective, dispersed facilities provided to enhance aircraft and associated equip-
ment ground survivability. Units must maintain shelters and the associated equipment in constant readi-
ness for assigned or augmentation aircraft.

2. Definitions:
   2.1. MOB. A base with essential buildings and facilities provided for total organization and interme-
   diate maintenance capability existing for assigned weapon systems. The intermediate maintenance
   capabilities may be expanded to support specific weapon systems deployed to the MOB.
2                                                                USAFEI32-1004 8 NOVEMBER 2002


    2.2. COB. An allied base designated for joint or unilateral use for US wartime relocation of in-place
    US forces.
    2.3. FOL. An airfield sanctioned by the host nation government and USAFE. Both the host nation
    and USAFE agree to the basing and support of limited USAFE aircraft.
    2.4. Operational PAS. Shelters providing protective parking for tactical aircraft and accommodating
    organizational maintenance functions, with the capability of running aircraft engines and storing
    munitions supporting aircraft sorties.
    2.5. Maintenance PAS. Shelters protecting aircraft and accommodating organizational or limited
    intermediate-level maintenance functions for both munitions and aircraft, without the capability of
    running aircraft engines in the shelter.
    2.6. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) PAS. Shelters funded through NATO security
    investment program.
    2.7. US PAS. Shelters exceeding NATO funding criteria, and are not eligible for NATO Security
    Investment Program funding. They are not included in the NATO joint final acceptance inspection.

3. Policy:
    3.1. Current USAFE policy affirms sheltering 100 percent of wartime primary authorized aircraft
    (PAA) at MOBs and 70 percent at COBs and FOLs. PAS facility managers are assigned the same way
    as other real property facilities at MOBs, COBs, munitions storage site (MUNSS), and FOLs. AFI
    32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting, gives accounting instructions.
    3.2. The base civil engineer (BCE) performs repairs, PAS modification maintenance in the same man-
    ner as other types of real property, real property installed equipment (RPIE), and real property similar
    equipment (RPSE) for all US-funded PAS. Do not accomplish permanent modifications without Civil
    Engineer, Engineering Division (HQ USAFE/CEC) approval. Coordinate modification requests with
    Programs Division (HQ USAFE/CEP), Directorate of Operations (HQ USAFE/DOT), Maintenance
    Division (HQ USAFE/LGM), and Mission System Division (HQ USAFE/SCN) prior to modification
    request approval. Temporary (not to exceed 12 months) modification request require only BCE
    approval with an info copy to HQ USAFE/CEC. However, coordinate any modification, temporary or
    permanent, to a PAS containing a Weapon Storage Security System (WS3) vault, through Weapons
    Maintenance Division (HQ USAFE/LGW). Ensure no work in WS3 equipped PAS involves structural
    contact with any part of the WS3 system. This includes drilling, wiring, or attachment of any item that
    is not part of the original equipment. Any work that will impact or contact the WS3 must be approved
    through HQ USAFE/LGW. Account, record, and report all operational PAS in the real property
    accountable records and inventory reports under category code 141-182. Assign maintenance TAB-V
    PAS 211-XXX series category code.
    3.3. The only use for US-funded PAS, other than to shelter aircraft, is to temporarily accommodate
    peak warehousing and storage of war reserve material (WRM) or a function directly associated with
    assigned and augmented aircraft. Installed facility subsystems (doors, winches, exhaust ports, etc.)
    must remain in place and fully operational if the PAS are used for other than aircraft operations or
    storage. The base facilities board, appropriate major NATO command (e.g., Supreme Headquarters
    Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), and the NATO International Staff must approve the use of NATO
    shelters for any purpose other than aircraft protection or WRM storage. Other uses must not detract
    from the PAS use or availability to shelter parked aircraft.
USAFEI32-1004 8 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                        3


     3.3.1. Close all doors and turn off lights when PAS is not in use. The PAS user may waive this
     requirement when necessary to meet mission operational requirements. If the mission calls for this
     requirement to be waived in excess of 24 hours, a written waiver from the assigned unit shall be
     issued and kept on file until the waiver has expired.
     3.3.2. If any modification work is performed in conjunction with the temporary use, the user must
     provide the MOB BCE a removal plan to describe PAS restoration to ready status within 48 hours.
     3.3.3. Facility subsystems will remain in serviceable condition and maintenance will be per-
     formed as if the PAS was in ready condition.
     3.3.4. Protect all mechanical and electrical system components from foreign object damage
     (FOD).
     3.3.5. When munitions are stored within the PAS, requirements for explosive siting and opera-
     tions shall be in accordance with AFMAN 91-201 and AFMAN 91-201 USAFESUP 1. A license
     is required in the United Kingdom (UK).
  3.4. The MOB BCE:
     3.4.1. Assigns in writing, a single point of contact (POC), who maintains all US PAS and all
     related components.
     3.4.2. Develops and ensures MOBs, COBs, and FOLs use PAS maintenance action sheets (AF
     Form 1841, Maintenance Action Sheet (MAS), approved for electronic form (EF) in Interim
     Work Information Management System (IWIMS) covering recurring maintenance actions and
     inspections. The MAS will include all mechanical, electrical, and structural components. Each
     MOB develops a MAS for the assigned PAS.
     3.4.3. Gives the highest possible priority to repair and maintain work spares for RPIE and RPSE
     required to return a PAS from partial ready to ready.
     3.4.4. Coordinates with the PAS manager before civilian contractor personnel are allowed to work
     in or around a PAS.

     and marking inside and outside PAS.
     3.4.7. Power Production shop will provide training to PAS users according to EUCOM Directive
     (ED) 60-12, and AFI 32-1063.
  3.5. The BCE ensures the emergency door opening kit is available to the MOB, COB, and FOL PAS
  user to manually open aircraft entry doors when the electrically powered door drive system is inoper-
  able. During peacetime, keep emergency door openings to a minimum and open only in the presence
  of a MOB BCE representative. All emergency opening kit component parts must sustain a 6-ton pull.
  The BCE in conjunction with the Operations Group will determine the minimum number of kits that
  will be maintained.
