                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of the T-6.
With the complementary references cited, this instruction prescribes standard operational
procedures to be used by all pilots operating T-6 aircraft.
     1.1.1. (Added-12FTW) The operational control of T-6A aircraft flying at Randolph AFB is
     vested in the wing commander (12 FTW/CC), the operations group commander (12OG/CC)
     and the 559 FTS squadron commander.
        1.1.1.1. (Added-12FTW) The 12 OG/CC is responsible for ensuring compliance with
        the provisions of this supplement.
        1.1.1.2. (Added-12FTW) Changes to this guidance will be approved through the 12
        OG/CC.
        1.1.1.3. (Added-12FTW) Deviations from this supplement are authorized when
        directed by the 12 FTW/CC, 12 OG/CC, air traffic control or in the interest of flying
        safety.
        1.1.1.4. (Added-12FTW) Supervisors, instructors and aircrews operating 12 FTW
        aircraft are responsible for compliance with the provisions of this supplement.
1.2. Pilot’s Responsibility. This instruction, in conjunction with other governing directives,
prescribes T-6 procedures under most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for
sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the
safe and effective operation of the aircraft.
1.3. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of the MAJCOM
director of operations unless an urgent requirement or aircraft emergency dictates otherwise. In
that case, the PIC will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
1.4. References. The primary references for T-6 operations are technical order (TO) 1T-6A-1,
Flight Manual, USAF/USN Series T-6A Aircraft; this instruction; and AFMAN 11-248, T-6
Primary Flying. Training units may develop phase manuals and supplements from the
procedures contained in these documents. Use phase manuals to augment initial and mission
qualification training. They may expand these basic procedures, but will not be less restrictive.
1.5. Recommended Improvements Waivers. Submit suggested improvements to this
instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to the parent
MAJCOM through standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) channels. Parent MAJCOMs will
forward approved recommendations to HQ AETC/A3FV. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the approval
authority for changes or revisions to this instruction. The MAJCOM director of operations is
waiver authority for this instruction. Waiver requests may be submitted in message or
memorandum format. File a copy of all approved waivers with this instruction.
1.6. Definition of Student. ―Student‖ refers to any pilot or student pilot enrolled in a formal
training course.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                     9


1.7. (Added-12FTW) Explanation of Terms. All altitudes referenced in this supplement are
MSL unless otherwise stated. IFG is the abbreviation for T-6A In-Flight Guide. (CS) is the
abbreviation for call sign. RAFB West (Hangover) Air Traffic Control Tower will be referred to
as Tower.

                                           Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning will be shared jointly by the
individual pilots and the operations function of the organization.
2.2. General Procedures:
   2.2.1. Sufficient flight planning must be done to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI
   11-202, Volume 3, and applicable supplements specify minimum requirements.
   2.2.2. Complete takeoff and landing data (TOLD) for all flights. Tab data derived from TO-
   1T-6A-1 approved performance charts is acceptable and may be utilized when available.
   MAJCOMs will approve TOLD programs derived from locally produced algorithms.
2.3. Briefing and Debriefing:
   2.3.1. Minimum Briefing Time. The minimum briefing time between the start of the
   mission briefing and takeoff is 1 hour. The minimum briefing time for the first navigation
   sortie of the day beginning or ending off-station and for all off-station, low-level navigation
   sorties is 1 hour and 45 minutes. EXCEPTION: Two qualified instructor pilots (IP) familiar
   with the off-station airfield may use 1 hour minimum briefing time.
   2.3.2. Briefing Guides:
       2.3.2.1. Brief students and passengers on their specific duties and responsibilities related
       to safe mission accomplishment and appropriate training rules. Aircrews will refer to the
       appropriate briefing guides located in this instruction—Attachment 2, Attachment 3,
       Attachment 4, and Attachment 5—and will brief applicable items before each mission.
       Note: Briefing guides are a reference list of items that may apply to particular missions.
       In addition, aircrews will refer to Attachment 6 for T-6 training rules.
       2.3.2.2. The briefing guide reference items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those
       items covered by written squadron standards and understood by all participants may be
       briefed as ―standard.‖ Each guide may be expanded as necessary to cover other important
       items of the flight. Brief only those items applicable to the particular mission and in
       sufficient detail to prevent any misunderstanding between crewmembers.
       2.3.2.3. An alternate mission will be briefed for each flight if applicable. The alternate
       mission will be less complex than the primary mission. Missions or events not briefed
       will not be flown. Mission elements or events may be briefed airborne if it is practical to
       do so and flight safety is not compromised.
       2.3.2.4. All missions will be briefed and debriefed, using the applicable briefing guide as
       a reference.
       2.3.2.5. Solo students will not deviate from the briefed primary or alternate mission
       profile.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                     11


2.4. Unit-Developed Checklists and Local Pilot Aids:
   2.4.1. Unit-developed checklists may be used in lieu of TO 1T-6A-1CL-1, Pilot’s
   Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist, if they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in
   order) listed in the checklist.
   2.4.1. (12FTW) A current squadron approved, condensed checklist may be used as a
   reference for normal procedures. However, the Pilot’s Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist
   will be readily available in flight. AETC/A3FV is the final approving authority for the
   condensed checklist.
   2.4.2. Unit-developed pilot aids will include, as a minimum, the following items:
      2.4.2.1. Briefing guides.
      2.4.2.2. Local ultra-high frequency (UHF)          and very high frequency (VHF)
      channelization.
      2.4.2.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams.
      2.4.2.4. Emergency information (for example, emergency action checklists, no-radio
      procedures, divert information).
      2.4.2.5. Bailout area information.
      2.4.2.6. Cross-country procedures to include command and control,                 engine
      documentation, Joint Oil Analysis Program samples, and aircraft servicing.
      2.4.2.7. Other information as deemed necessary by the unit (for example, stereo flight
      plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas, and instrument preflight).

                                           Chapter 3

                         NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 3A—Preflight

3.1. Required Personal Equipment. In addition to equipment specified in AFI 11-202,
Volume 3, the following requirements apply:
WARNING: Be especially careful of the dangers of a spinning prop. Do not allow anyone to
approach an operating engine.
   3.1.1. Due to the nature of the T-6 egress system, each crewmember will wear a visor during
   all phases of flight, and should be down prior to lowering the canopy. A clear visor will be
   worn at night or when needed for restricted visibility.
   3.1.2. On nonlocal sorties, each aircrew will carry appropriate in-flight publications and a
   suitable terrain chart to cover the proposed route of flight.
   3.1.3. G-suits are required for all sorties when planning to exceed 2 Gs during any portion of
   a sortie.
   3.1.4. (Added-12FTW) Life preserver units (LPUs) are required for departures and arrivals
   over water outside power-off glide distance from land. Aircrews will consider the possibility
   of air traffic control directions to remain over water longer than planned. T-6 crews will not
   cruise outside power-off glide distance from land.
3.2. Aircraft Systems:
   3.2.1. Students will not fly solo in aircraft requiring an operational check. Perform
   operational checks during dual-student training sorties if they do not interfere with training
   objectives.
   3.2.2. Off-station requirements are listed in the lead command supplement to AFI 11-202,
   Volume 3.
   3.2.3. (Added-12FTW) After shutdown tire checks: Maintenance will normally marshal
   aircraft slightly past the aircraft parking spot. After completing the engine shutdown
   checklist, the pilot will release brakes at the direction of maintenance. Maintenance will then
   push the aircraft back to check tire condition. The pilot will then set the brakes. If there is
   insufficient ground crew to push the aircraft back, crews will leave the parking brake set and
   maintenance will check the tires at a later time.
   3.2.4. (Added-12FTW) Aircrews will not take an aircraft for an off-station mission unless
   the aircraft can start without use of a power cart at home station.
   3.2.5. (Added-12FTW) Aircrews may motor the engine with the canopy open.
3.3. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). To reduce the risk of FOD during ground operations,
personnel will:
   3.3.1. Not approach an operating engine.
   3.3.2. Avoid using excessive power.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                           13


   3.3.3. Avoid prop or jet blast from other aircraft.
   3.3.4. Ensure loose items are secure in the cockpit before opening the canopy.
   3.3.5. (Added-12FTW) Maintenance crews will not remove chocks until a crewmember is
   seated in the cockpit and has verified that the parking brake is set.
3.4. Procedures for Ejection Seat Safety Pin:
   3.4.1. Remove the ejection seat safety pin and properly stow at the end of the runway during
   the before takeoff checklist according to the flight crew checklist.
   3.4.2. Solo student pilots will make a radio call to the controlling agency stating that the
   ejection seat safety pin is removed and stowed prior to being cleared for takeoff.
   3.4.3. After landing, solo student pilots will clear the runway and stop the aircraft prior to
   reinstalling their ejection seat safety pin.
   3.4.4. When nonrated personnel occupy the rear seat, the rear cockpit ejection seat safety pin
   will remain installed with the interseat sequencing system selector in the BOTH position
   during all sorties. (If an ejection is attempted, but fails, the nonrated rear seat occupant will
   remove and drop the seat pin and pull his or her respective ejection handle.) EXCEPTION:
   Students enrolled in a formal training course will remove the pin when occupying the rear
   seat.

Section 3B—Taxiing

3.5. Ground and Taxi Operations. Conduct ground and taxi operations according to AFI 11-
218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground.
3.5. (12FTW)Ground and Taxi Operations. Painted taxi lines in the 14R/32L hammerheads
provide 10 feet wingtip spacing between T-6, and T-38 aircraft. Aircrews will pull the aircraft
all the way forward so the nose wheel is on the yellow square. This allows 10 feet of wingtip
spacing for aircraft taxiing in front of or behind aircraft on the square. Pilots are responsible for
ensuring proper wingtip spacing when taxiing next to/between other than these aircraft.
3.6. Taxi Interval. Maintain a minimum of 75 feet when taxiing staggered and 150 feet when
in trail. Use normal wingtip spacing (paragraph 3.5) with caution when approaching or holding
for the active runway, but be extremely aware of other aircraft accomplishing an overspeed
governor check.
3.6. (12FTW)Taxi Interval. At Randolph AFB, accomplish the OVERSPEED GOVERNOR
CHECK in the hammerhead, when available. Do not accomplish this check with aircraft,
personnel, or equipment immediately in front of or within 50 feet behind the aircraft.
3.7. Ice and/or Snow Conditions. Do not taxi if snow or ice is adhering to taxiways or
runways until all portions of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe operations.
Note: When ice and/or snow are present on the taxiway, taxi on the centerline with a minimum
of 300 feet of spacing.

Section 3C—Takeoff and Landing

3.8. Fuel. Aircraft will take off with sufficient fuel for the planned sortie, to include required
reserve and alternate fuel. The following definitions and requirements apply to fuel:
   3.8.1. Joker fuel is a prebriefed fuel state needed to terminate an event and transition to the
   next phase of flight.
   3.8.2. Bingo fuel is a prebriefed fuel state that allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or an alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and
   arriving with normal recovery fuel.
   3.8.3. Normal recovery fuel is the fuel on initial or at the final approach fix (FAF) at the base
   of intended landing or alternate, if required. This fuel quantity will be the higher of what is
   established locally or 200 pounds.
   3.8.4. Declare minimum fuel or emergency fuel to the controlling agency when it becomes
   apparent the fuel remaining at final touchdown will be less than the requirements indicated in
   paragraphs 3.8.4.1 and 3.8.4.2, respectively. After declaring minimum or emergency fuel,
   add the fuel status call and the amount of fuel remaining (in minutes) to each new air traffic
   control (ATC) facility. Once established in the local traffic pattern, add fuel status with each
   radio transmission.
       3.8.4.1. Minimum fuel—150 pounds (200 pounds on solo student syllabus sorties).
       3.8.4.2. Emergency fuel—100 pounds or less.
   3.8.5. (Added-12FTW) The T-6A is authorized to takeoff with a partial fuel load to
   perform one-time returns from the local area and/or full stop/taxi backs when necessary to
   facilitate training. Aircrews will limit braking as much as possible to prevent heat build-up.
   If an abort is required following a full stop/taxi back, the aircrews will follow procedures for
   hot brakes. The aircraft commander will ensure there is enough fuel to arrive at intended
   destination/alternate with required fuel. Minimum takeoff fuel for any ROTC profile is 650
   pounds plus required divert fuel.
3.9. Runway. Minimum runway length and width for T-6 operations is 4,000 feet long by 75
feet wide. (EXCEPTION: Operations group commanders may waive the length and width
requirement for nontowered airfield [NTA] low approaches down to 3,000 feet long by 50 feet
wide. Notify 19 AF/DO and HQ AETC/DOFV of the waiver and include the waiver in the next
update of the NTA letter of agreement (LOA). An intersection takeoff must provide 4,000 feet of
usable runway. T-6 operations require 4,000 feet between arresting cables located on or above
the runway surface.
3.9. (12FTW)Runway. The 12 OG/CC waives the minimum runway length/width requirement
for the following airfields. A current LOA for each airfield is on file with HQ AETC/A3FV.
Aircrews are authorized to conduct routine NTA low approach training at these airfields IAW

complete guidance.) Do not:
   3.10.1. Begin a takeoff following another departure until the preceding aircraft is airborne or
   a minimum separation of 3,000 feet exists.
   3.10.2. Begin the final turn after a straight-in has reported at 2 miles unless you have the
   straight-in in sight, can make a normal final turn, and can maintain spacing behind the
   straight-in.
   3.10.3. Cross the runway threshold to land until preceding aircraft are either airborne, clear
   of the runway, or a minimum separation of 3,000 feet exists when using alternate sides of the
   runway for similar aircraft. Minimum separation is 6,000 feet when not using alternate sides
   or when behind a dissimilar aircraft. For tower-controlled flight operations, minimum
   separation is 6,000 feet when conducting a touch-and-go landing behind a full stop. The
   required spacing at night is 6,000 feet (similar and dissimilar). Increase the spacing, as
   required when wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds or when landing with a tail
   wind. If it appears as if spacing between two aircraft on final will be a factor, the RSU should
   direct the second aircraft to go around and offset.
   3.10.3. (12FTW) Aircrew flying at Randolph AFB should plan to use reduced same runway
   separation (RSRS) criteria as outlined in 12FTWI 13-204 Air Traffic Control and Airfield
   Operations paragraphs 4.4. - 4.4.5. and table 4.6.
   3.10.4. Initiate or accomplish items in the after landing or full stop and/or taxi back checklist
   until clear of the runway and at a safe taxi speed.
   3.10.4. (12FTW) AFTER LANDING checks may be accomplished under crew concept
   during taxi back to the chocks. It is not necessary to come to a complete stop after clearing
   the runway to accomplish the after landing checks.
3.11. Rolling Takeoffs. Perform single-ship rolling takeoffs during daylight or extended
daylight hours with a rated pilot on board.
 16                                        AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


3.12. Crosswind Limitations:
   3.12.1. Icy runway—5 knots.
   3.12.2. Standing water—5 knots.
   3.12.3. Standing water due to patchy standing water (ponding) (as determined by the
   [supervisor of flying SOF])—10 knots.
   3.12.4. Wet runway—10 knots.
   3.12.5. Solo students, solo fixed-wing qualification students, or formation wing takeoffs and
   landings—15 knots.
   3.12.6. Touch-and-go landings—20 knots.
   3.12.7. Initial takeoffs and full-stop landings on a dry runway—25 knots.
3.13. Raising the Landing Gear. When airborne and before moving the gear handle, the pilot
flying the aircraft will make an intercockpit ―ear clear‖ call and pause momentarily before
moving the gear handle. On presolo contact sorties, the IP will acknowledge ―clear‖ before the
student moves the gear handle. On all other sorties, ―gear clear‖ is an advisory call only.
3.13. (12FTW)Raising the Landing Gear. The pilot flying will confirm the gear handle down
prior to reporting ―gear down‖ to the Tower. On dual sorties, the pilot not flying must physically
check for proper gear indications before confirming the configuration.
3.14. Flaps:
   3.14.1. During the course of normal training, aircrew should use TO or UP flap settings for
   full-stop and touch-and-go landings when the crosswind (steady state or gust) exceeds 10
   knots. This is not intended to limit aircrew in the event of emergency or unusual
   circumstance if the landing (LDG) 0 flap setting is appropriate.
   3.14.2. Aircrews may use any flap setting when flying multiple touch-and-go landings
   provided crosswind limitations in paragraph 3.14.1 are not exceeded.
   3.14.3. Crosswind permitting, the LDG flap setting should be used for full-stop landings
   when the landing distance is greater than or equal to 80 percent of the actual field length. If
   landing distance is greater than or equal to 80 percent of actual field length and crosswinds
   do not support LDG flaps, an alternate runway should be selected.
3.15. Low Approach. During low approaches, do not allow the aircraft to touch down. When a
restricted low approach is directed, do not descend below 500 feet above ground level (AGL) or
below the altitude specified by the controller.

Section 3D—Maneuvering Parameters

3.16. Out-of-Control Flight (OCF) Recoveries:
   3.16.1. Do not practice OCF recoveries without an OCF-current IP on board.
   3.16.2. To avoid entering instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) during OCF recovery
   training, a minimum of 7,000 feet of airspace, clear of clouds, must exist below entry
   altitude. Before starting OCF recoveries, verify that this cloud clearance criteria exists.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                     17


   3.16.3. When conducting OCF recoveries over clouds, plan to complete all OCF recoveries
   (to include dive recoveries) at least 3,000 feet above the clouds.
3.17. Aerobatics. Perform aerobatic flight only in special use airspace.
3.18. Contact Recoveries. Practice contact recoveries only in day visual meteorological
conditions (VMC).
3.19. Aircraft Configuration. Unless specifically stated in the exercise or maneuver
description, perform all maneuvers with gear and flaps in the retracted position. Do not extend
the flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft performance.
3.20. Cloud Clearances:
   3.20.1. When on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan under radar control in a
   designated ATC military operating area, weather requirements for aerobatics, confidence
   maneuvers, and extended trail is clear of clouds with 3 nm of in-flight visibility.
   3.20.2. Solo syllabus sorties must remain in VMC at all times, with sufficient ground
   references to visually navigate to, from, and within assigned areas.
   3.20.3. When flying practice emergency landing patterns (ELP), maintain proper visual
   flight rules (VFR) cloud clearances. Additionally, the ELPs in a tower-controlled pattern
   require 500 feet below clouds and 3 miles visibility according to Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) Order 7610.4J Ch 3, Special Military Operations. RSU controlled
   patterns and uncontrolled fields at which AETC operations are being conducted are permitted
   to use the same cloud clearance restrictions.
3.21. Minimum Altitudes:
   3.21.1. Perform all parts of aerobatic maneuvers, unusual attitudes, abnormal flight
   recoveries, practice lost wingman, extended trail, stalls, and slow flight above 6,000 feet
   AGL.
   3.21.2. The minimum altitude to begin OCF spin training is 13,500 feet mean sea level
   (MSL). Ensure spinning stops above 10,000 feet MSL.
   3.21.3. Except while in the traffic pattern or during departure and recovery, the minimum en
   route and area altitude for a solo-student syllabus mission is 5,000 feet AGL.
   3.21.4. The minimum altitude for VFR nonlocal, point-to-point navigation missions dictated
   by operational or training requirements is 3,000 feet AGL.
       3.21.4.1. (Added-12FTW) Pilots recovering VFR to Randolph from local routes or
       from point-to-point navigation sorties will avoid crossing any portion of the 14L/32R
       (East) VFR pattern below 3800’.
   3.21.5. The minimum altitude to complete configured aircraft slips is 300 AGL.
3.22. Dual-Only Maneuvers. Solo students will not practice the following:
   3.22.1. Stalls.
   3.22.2. Stability demonstrations.
   3.22.3. Nose-high recoveries.
 18                                          AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   3.22.4. Nose-low recoveries.
   3.22.5. Inverted recoveries.
   3.22.6. NTA operations.
   3.22.7. OCF recoveries.
   3.22.8. ELPs or any other simulated engine-out maneuvers.
   3.22.9. No-flap patterns or landings.
   3.22.10. Straight-in approaches.
   3.22.11. Slow-flight maneuvers.
   3.22.12. Rolling takeoffs.
   3.22.13. Low-closed patterns.
   3.22.14. Angle of attack (AOA) patterns.

Section 3E—Extended Daylight

3.23. Definition. Extended daylight is defined as the period 15 minutes before official sunrise
to 15 minutes past official sunset. For local training only, daylight traffic and area operations are
in effect during the extended daylight period.
3.24. Maneuvers. All maneuvers normally accomplished during normal daylight hours may be
performed within the extended daylight window, including solo syllabus sorties. Under certain
weather conditions, such as low ceiling and visibility, the SOF should decide if maneuvers are
appropriate or safe during the above-defined times. Further restrictions may be imposed by the
operations group commander.

Section 3F—Night Flying

3.25. Prohibited Maneuvers. Aerobatics, practice OCF recoveries, practice stalls, stability
demonstrations, and practice contact recoveries are prohibited at night.
3.26. Solo. Student pilots will not fly solo at night.
3.27. Formation. Flying formation at night is prohibited.
3.28. Taxiing. Taxi with a minimum of 300 feet and on the taxiway centerline.
3.29. Lighting:
   3.29.1. Taxi Light. The taxi light will normally be used during all night taxiing.
   EXCEPTION: When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of an aircraft
   landing or taking off, taxiing aircraft may extinguish their taxi light. However, the taxiing
   aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared without the taxi light.
   3.29.2. Strobe Light. Aircrews may turn off strobe lights during the hours of darkness
   while in the home base traffic pattern (based on local guidance).
   3.29.3. Lighted Wands. Marshalers will use two-lighted wands during the hours of
   darkness.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                        19


3.30. Overhead Patterns. Fly night overhead patterns only at the home station. Note: Lackland
AFB (Kelly Field Annex) is included for the 12th Flying Training Wing.
3.31. Instrument Procedures:
   3.31.1. Night Landings. Night landings at other than the home field require operational
   glidepath guidance. Visual descent path indicator or precision guidance systems constitute
   acceptable glidepath guidance. At towered fields meeting this criteria, aircrew are allowed
   under IFR to receive vectors for ―visual approaches‖ to increase the frequency and repetition
   of night landings.
   3.31.2. Filing at Night. Do not file to a base of intended landing (other than the home
   station) unless there is an operable straight-in approach with glidepath guidance. Night
   alternates must have an operational instrument straight-in approach with glidepath guidance.
   3.31.3. Night Nonprecision Approaches. At airfields other than the home field, descents
   below a minimum descent altitude (MDA) on a nonprecision approach require glidepath
   guidance. However, aircrews may perform practice approaches at facilities with no glidepath
   guidance if they descend no lower than the published MDA. When landing from a
   nonprecision approach, transition to visual references no later than the visual approach
   system glidepath intercept.
   3.31.4. Night Circling. Do not practice the visual circling maneuver portion of an
   instrument approach or perform a low-closed pattern at night. You may fly the instrument
   portion of a designated circling approach (for example, very high frequency omnidirectional
   range station [VOR]-A), but you must execute climb out instructions or go missed approach
   by the missed approach point (MAP).
   3.31.5. Unusual Circumstances at Night. In unusual circumstances, such as an aircraft
   emergency or a facility outage, the PIC will determine the best method of recovery, which
   may or may not include glidepath guidance.

Section 3G—Pilot Weather Categories (PWC)

3.32. PWC Minimums. PWCs are designed to reduce the exposure of pilots with limited
experience to the risks inherent during periods of low ceiling and visibility. Table 3.1 specifies
PWC minimums. Before assigning a lower PWC, a PWC 1 pilot must evaluate the pilot’s
instrument proficiency. When calculating total time for the purpose of PWC, the PWC 1 pilot
will not include student, undergraduate flying training, or ―other‖ flight time. Note: Hours in an
assigned aircraft may include all series or mission types of that aircraft.

                    for PWC 1.
Notes:
1. For the purposes of this table, the terms ―pilot‖ and ―aircraft commander‖ in Notes 2 through 6
are synonymous. Document PWCs in the Aviation Resource Management System and the Letter of
Xs.
2. Assignment of PWC 1 status is dependent on the pilot’s demonstrated knowledge and
performance in flight under PWC 2 operations and in aircrew training devices with a low visibility
capability. The commander of the flying squadron to which the pilot is assigned or attached will
certify assignment to PWC 1 by signing the Letter of Xs. The letter will be filed in the pilot’s flight
training folder.
3. OG/CC may authorize PWC 2 pilots to use PWC 1 minimums for approaches at the home field.
4. If an IP is on board, aircrews may use the IP’s PWC.
5. If the pilot is noncurrent in instrument approaches, increase the PWC minimums by one
category. The pilot may regain currency with an IP at a dual set of controls or in a chase aircraft.
6. Use the approach-end RVR to determine takeoff and landing criteria.

Section 3H—Weather Restrictions for Instrument Approaches

3.33. Filing Weather. Do not file to a destination unless the ceiling and visibility for the
estimated time of arrival (plus or minus 1 hour) is at or above the appropriate PWC or suitable
published minimums, whichever is greater (Table 3.1).
3.34. Takeoff. Takeoff minimums are specified in Table 3.1. Base the decision to launch a local
sortie on the existing weather and forecast for planned landing plus 1 hour. Base the decision to
launch nonlocal sorties on the existing weather at takeoff time.
3.35. Before Starting Penetration. Do not commence an en route descent or published
approach unless existing ceiling and visibility meet the requirements of Table 3.1. During actual
IMC, a precision approach monitored by surveillance radar is the preferred approach. Note: This
does not prevent instrument practice for other types of approaches if the ceiling and visibility are
at or above minimums for the approach being flown.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                         21


3.36. After Starting Penetration. After beginning a penetration or published approach, if
weather is reported below the required PWC or published minimums (ceiling or visibility), the
pilot may continue the approach to the PWC or published minimums, whichever is higher. He or
she will determine the PWC decision height (DH) or MDA by referring to the touchdown zone
elevation (TDZE). When TDZE is not depicted or is unavailable, the pilot will use the runway
threshold elevation or airport elevation, in that order. He or she may land if the runway
environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing. In all cases, the
pilot will comply with the last clearance received until obtaining a revised clearance.
CAUTION: The use of PWC minimums on a precision approach (precision radar approach,
instrument landing system) may require a pilot to execute a missed approach prior to the
published DH. In these instances, on reaching PWC minimums and making the decision not to
continue the approach, the pilot should start a climb immediately while proceeding to the
nonprecision MAP. On reaching the nonprecision MAP, he or she should continue with the
published missed approach procedure or alternate missed approach instructions, as appropriate.
3.37. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight must be conducted according
to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and requires a qualified safety observer in the aircraft. The pilot in the
front or rear cockpit may act as a safety observer when the pilot in the other cockpit is flying
simulated instruments. When flying instrument approaches in VMC, pilots may fly down to
approach minimums if the runway environment is in sight when reaching applicable PWC
minimums. Pilots must acknowledge reaching PWC minimums and state their intentions to
crewmembers if continuing to publish minimums. Vision restriction devices will not be worn in
the front cockpit.
3.38. Icing. Refer to TO 1T-6A-1, Sections V and VII for icing restrictions.
3.39. Global Positioning System (GPS):
   3.39.1. The T-6A KLN 900 GPS is FAA Technical Standard Order (TSO) C129a, Airborne
   Supplemental Navigation Equipment Using the Global Positioning System (GPS), -certified
   for route area navigation (RNAV) GPS approaches down to lateral navigation (LNAV) MDA
   minimums.
   3.39.2. The T-6A KLN 900 GPS is FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 90-100A, U. S. Terminal
   and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations, -certified for RNAV 2 (T and Q routes)
   procedures. It is not possible to retrieve entire RNAV T and Q routes from the data base of
   the KLN 900; however, extracting individual named fixes from the database is permitted
   under FAA AC 90-100A, provided all fixes along the published route to be flown are
   inserted. Manual entry of waypoints using latitude and/or longitude or place and/or bearing is
   not permitted.
   3.39.3. The T-6A KLN 900 GPS meets or provides an equivalent level of safety and
   performance mandated by FAA AC 90-100A for RNAV 1 (standard instrument departures
   [SID], standard terminal arrivals [STAR], departure procedures [DP]) and is operationally
   approved by HQ AETC/A2/3/10 to perform these operations with the following restrictions.
       3.39.3.1. If flying RNAV SIDs, DPs, STARs, T or Q routes, aircrew will check
       predictive receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) for their route of flight
       during preflight planning at http://www.raimprediction.net or an approved alternate site
       to ensure GPS satellite coverage. The T-6A KLN 900 GPS does not have a predictive
22                                       AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     RAIM capability for these operations. Aircrew should utilize the ―baro aided‖ tabs when
     utilizing these sites.
     3.39.3.2. When flying an RNAV SID, DP or STAR the procedure must be retrieved by
     procedure name from the onboard navigation database in its entirety and conform to the
     charted procedure. If a SID, DP, or STAR contains a course to fix leg, course to altitude
     leg, or a fix to manual termination leg, utilization of the omnibearing select (OBS)
     function and manual selection of the course may be necessary. While this does not meet
     the requirement for automation under FAA AC 90-100A and FAA AC 90-105, Approval
     Guidance for RNP Operations and Barometric Vertical Navigation in the U.S. National
     Airspace System, AETC aircrew with proper MAJCOM directed training are authorized
     under AFI 11-202, Volume 3, to perform these operations. Radius to fix legs will not be
     flown in the T-6A.
     3.39.3.3. When flying RNAV SIDs or DPs aircrew will have an RNAV GPS approach
     loaded for the airfield that they are departing. This will ensure proper RAIM sensitivity
     within 30 nautical miles (nm) of the departure airfield and that the course deviation index
     (CDI) is in the proper scale. For SIDs and DPs extending beyond 30 nm, aircrew will
     select a CDI scale of 1nm from the Mode page for the remainder of the SID or DP. Note:
     While it is possible for aircrew to select a desired CDI scale for the KLN 900, it is not
     possible to select the RAIM sensitivity. Improper RAIM sensitivity beyond 30 nm is
     permitted under FAA AC 90-100A.
     3.39.3.4. When flying RNAV STARs aircrew will have an RNAV GPS approach or an
     approach labeled ―or GPS‖ loaded for their destination to ensure proper RAIM and CDI
     sensitivity within 30 nm of their destination. If commencing an RNAV STAR outside of
     30 nm, aircrew will change the CDI sensitivity to 1 nm from the Mode page. Improper
     RAIM sensitivity beyond 30 nm is permitted under FAA AC 90-100A.
     3.39.3.5. When flying conventional SIDs, DPs, and STARs using GPS or RNAV,
     comply with guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3/AETCSUP.
  3.39.4. The T-6A KLN 900 GPS is installed according to FAA AC 20-138A, Airworthiness
  Approval of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Equipment. The GPS equipment also
  employs step error detection according to FAA TSO C-129a, which satisfies all requirements
  in AFI 11-202, Volume 3. This equipment is approved for en route, terminal, and
  nonprecision approach operations and other instrument procedures requiring a minimum
  required navigation performance (RNP) value of 0.3 or greater. Instrument approaches may
  be flown in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and MAJCOM and local supplements
  down to, but not below, LNAV MDA minimums. Crews must complete MAJCOM-directed
  training for use of these systems down to RNP 0.3 before IFR use. Fault detection and
  exclusion (FDE) must be checked before using GPS as a primary source of IFR navigation.
  In order to meet the requirements of AFI 11-202, Volume 3, FDE must indicate ―YES‖
  before using GPS as a primary source of IFR navigation within the National Air Space
  System.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                         23


Section 3I—Formation

3.40. Maximum Size. The maximum flight formation size is four aircraft unless waived by the
19 AF/DO.
3.41. Lead Change:
   3.41.1. The minimum altitude for a lead change within a formation is 500 feet AGL.
   3.41.2. Do not initiate a lead change with the wingman farther back than a normal fingertip
   or route position or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast.
   3.41.3. Do not initiate a lead change unless the aircraft assuming the lead is in a position
   from which the lead change can be safely initiated and visual contact maintained.
3.42. Takeoff:
   3.42.1. Two-ship formation takeoffs require a minimum of 150 feet of runway width.
   3.42.2. For wing takeoffs, the ceiling and visibility must be greater than or equal to PWC,
   circling minimums, or 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles (whichever is higher). The maximum
   crosswind component for wing takeoffs is 15 knots, and the runway must be free from
   standing water, ice, or snow.
   3.42.3. For interval takeoffs, the ceiling and visibility must be greater than or equal to 1,500
   feet and 3 miles, respectively.
   3.42.4. Four-ship echelon lineup requires a runway greater than or equal to 300 feet wide.
   3.42.5. Four-ship interval lineup requires 500 feet of element spacing on runways less than
   200 feet wide.
3.43. En Route. Four-ship formations will not cruise in IMC, but may climb or descend
through IMC.
3.44. Approach and Landing:
   3.44.1. Planned formation low approaches will be initiated no lower than 100 feet AGL to
   reduce the possibility of an inadvertent touchdown.
   3.44.2. Two-ship formation landings require a minimum of 150 feet of runway width.
   3.44.3. For formation approaches and landings, the ceiling and visibility must be greater than
   or equal to 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles or approach minimums, whichever is higher. The
   maximum crosswind component for wing landings is 15 knots, and the runway must be free
   from standing water, ice, or snow.
   3.44.4. Formation touch-and-go landings are prohibited.
   3.44.5. The formation VMC drag maneuver may be used to establish spacing for single-ship
   landings when conditions do not permit a formation landing only when it has been
   prebriefed. The briefing must include the specific traffic pattern or instrument approach
   procedure to be flown.
       3.44.5.1. Minimum weather required for the drag maneuver is 1,500 foot ceiling and 3
       nm visibility. All aircraft will maintain VMC from the drag point to landing.
 24                                          AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


       3.44.5.2. Prior to directing a VMC drag maneuver while operating under IFR, the flight
       lead will coordinate with the appropriate ATC agency for nonstandard formation for the
       remainder of the approach.
       3.44.5.3. Minimum spacing is 3,000 feet unless greater spacing is briefed. Anytime the
       spacing is in question, the wingman will go-around or execute the missed approach,
       notify ATC, and comply with local procedures.
       3.44.5.4. Wingmen may use prebriefed power settings and configurations (speed brake,
       gear, and flaps) to establish and maintain spacing. Wingmen will not fly less than final
       approach airspeed and S-turns will not be used to gain or maintain separation while on
       final.
       3.44.5.5. The latest drag point must allow adequate time for the wingman to establish
       required separation and then for the flight lead to slow to final approach airspeed no later
       than 3 nm from the runway. On instrument approaches, the drag will normally be
       accomplished in order to establish separation prior to the FAF or glideslope intercept.
3.45. Maneuvers:
   3.45.1. Fingertip Formation. Limit maneuvering to 120 knots minimum airspeed,
   approximately 90 degrees of bank, and 2 to 3 Gs.
   3.45.2. Route. Maximum bank angle is approximately 60 degrees.
   3.45.3. Echelon. Maximum bank angle is approximately 60 degrees.
   3.45.4. Close Trail. Limit maneuvering to turns and modified lazy eights, using 120 knots
   minimum airspeed, approximately 90 degrees of bank, and 2 to 3 Gs.
   3.45.5. Extended Trail. Using 100 knots minimum airspeed, limit maneuvering to turns,
   loops, barrel rolls, modified lazy eights, modified Cuban eights, and cloverleafs. Do not
   perform abrupt turn reversals; that is, turns in one direction followed by a rapid,
   unanticipated roll into a turn in the opposite direction. Extended trail is limited to two-ship
   formations. Perform a G-awareness exercise before flying maneuvers in extended trail.
   3.45.6. Practice Lost Wingman. Practice lost wingman procedures in VMC.
3.46. Solo Students. Solo students will not fly:
   3.46.1. Actual or simulated instrument approaches and landings as lead or wing.
   3.46.2. Close trail as wingman.
   3.46.3. The fingertip position when accomplishing in-flight checks or radio channel changes.
   3.46.4. Practice lost wingman procedures while on the wing.
   3.46.5. Extended trail level 3 as wing.
   3.46.6. Formation landings (wing or lead).
   3.46.7. Formation takeoff from the wing position.

3.47. Three- and Four-Ship Formations. For three- and four-ship formations, all members
will be qualified pilots or navigators and a formation-qualified IP will be aboard each aircraft.
The operations group commander (or designated representative) will be responsible for
approving these flights.
   3.47.1. (Added-12FTW) The 12 OG/CC has designated the 559 FTS squadron commander
   approval authority for all T-6A three and four ship formations.

Section 3J—Low-Level Routes

3.48. Solo Restriction. Low levels will not be flown solo.
3.49. Daylight Restriction. To minimize the possibility of a bird strike and avoid the problems
associated with visual illusions, enter the route no earlier than 30 minutes after sunrise (1 hour
for mountainous terrain) and exit the route no later than 30 minutes before sunset (1 hour for
mountainous terrain).
3.50. Minimum Altitudes. Fly low-level navigation at an altitude of 500 to 1,500 feet AGL.
When terrain height varies, maintain a minimum of 500 feet above the highest terrain within
2,000 feet of the aircraft.
3.51. Obstacle Clearances. Towers and other manufactured obstacles extremely difficult to see
than high terrain. Note: For towers on or near the route, plan to fly a minimum of 500 feet above
the highest obstacle within 2 nm of the aircraft. Once the obstacle is acquired visually and
positively identified, the 2,000-foot clearance in paragraph 3.50 applies.

Section 3K—Simulated Emergency Procedures

3.52. Restrictions:
3.52. (12FTW)Restrictions. Pilots are expected to make scheduled entry times IAW FLIP
AP/1B and this supplement (two minutes early to five minutes late). Coordinate with the
Operations Supervisor if entry time will exceed those limits.
   3.52.1. Airborne simulated emergencies to include ELPs and No Flap Operations will be
   briefed and will only be conducted during day VMC weather conditions. Simulated
   emergency practice will be discontinued if intercockpit communications cannot be
   maintained. Compound or multiple simulated emergencies are prohibited with the exception
   of ELPs which may be flown in any flap setting to simulate a malfunctioning Emergency
   Gear Extension system.
   3.52.2. Pilots will not practice simulated engine failures on takeoff that require a landing
   straight ahead, a turn back to land opposite direction from the runway just departed, or a
   teardrop to another crossing or parallel runway. Those procedures will only be practiced in
   the simulator.
3.53. ELPs:
   3.53.1. ELPs may be flown at NTAs according to Section 3L of this instruction.
   3.53.2. When conducted in controlled airspace, ELPs must be coordinated with the ATC
   agencies responsible for the airspace the ELP will transit.
 26                                       AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   3.53.3. ELPs may only be flown at airfields with an approved AETC NTA LOA (according
   to the lead command supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 3).
   3.53.4. Zero torque ELPs may only be flown to a low approach (no lower than 200 feet
   AGL).
   3.53.5. Straight-in ELPs may be flown at auxiliary fields by instructor development (ID)
   crews if no more than two aircraft are in the pattern (no solos). Bases will evaluate
   operational risk management impacts and publish deconfliction procedures (approved by the
   Undergraduate Flying Operations Section [19 AF/DOU]) for straight-in ELPs in a local
   supplement to AETCI 11-204 before implementing this training at their auxiliary fields.

Section 3L—NTA Operations

3.54. Requirements. When AFI 11-202, Volume 3, refers to uncontrolled airfields, the
following guidance applies: maneuvers may only be flown at airfields with an approved AETC
NTA LOA according to the lead command supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   3.54.1. With the operations group commander’s approval, aircrews may conduct operations
   at nontowered, public-use airfields, with the following restrictions:
      3.54.1.1. They will be flown single ship only.
      3.54.1.2. Winds must be within limits for each runway to which the aircrew operates as
      best as can be determined with available information. Fly the instrument approach most
      suited for the winds. If the NTA only has one approach and it is opposite direction for the
      wind conditions, it may be flown under any wind conditions but aircrew must monitor
      (via common traffic advisory frequency [CTAF] or visually) any departing aircraft to
      ensure safety of flight and traffic deconfliction.
      3.54.1.3. All patterns and approaches will be flown to a low approach. (EXCEPTION:
      Full stops may be performed by aircrews flying to an auxiliary field for the purpose of
      manning the RSU.) In the event a landing is required at an NTA for other than RSU
      manning, the operations group commander will ensure fire or crash recovery and
      maintenance personnel, as appropriate to the situation, are available for the subsequent
      launch.
      3.54.1.4. Aircrews will monitor the published common traffic advisory frequency and
      make all radio calls and position reports recommended in the FAA Aeronautical
      Information Manual (AIM) Official Guide to Basic Flight Information and ATC
      Procedures, available at: http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/.
      3.54.1.5. No more than two aircraft (total), military and/or civilian, may be in the pattern
      at any time.
      3.54.1.6. Instrument approaches, rectangular patterns (as depicted in FAA AIM), and
      ELPs may be flown. Rectangular patterns and ELPs will be flown left hand traffic, unless
      the airfield traffic pattern indicators or flight information publications (FLIP) depict
      otherwise. No overhead patterns will be flown.
      3.54.1.7. The maximum airspeed for any operation at an NTA is 150 knots indicated
      airspeed.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                     27


      3.54.1.8. Instrument approaches will be flown under IFR clearance, unless waived by
      HQ AETC/A3F.
      3.54.1.9. Weather restrictions for instrument approaches are as listed in Section 3H of
      this instruction.
      3.54.1.10. For entry other than by an instrument approach, aircrews must maintain cloud
      clearances and visibility appropriate for their type of flight plan (IFR or VFR) and
      airspace. If an aircrew is approaching the airfield on an IFR clearance and not intending
      to fly an instrument approach, weather conditions must permit a VMC descent from the
      appropriate IFR en route altitude.
      3.54.1.11. Aircrews will immediately notify the SOF if any hazardous conditions exist at
      an NTA that would prevent normal operations.
      3.54.1.12. (Added-12FTW) If using Karnes County from the south MOA, cancel IFR
      and notify San Antonio of your intentions. Recover VFR to Randolph through Auger,
      Karnes, Spur or Truckstop and request flight following with San Antonio, or an IFR
      clearance as required. If using a non-towered airfield out of the Talon MOA, cancel IFR
      with Houston. After completion of training at the non-towered airfield, call San Antonio
      or Houston for flight following, or an IFR clearance.
   3.54.2. Each operations group commander will develop a training program to prepare
   aircrews to operate in the NTA environment. As a minimum, the program will include a
   discussion of all applicable codes of federal regulations, advisory circulars, and AIM
   references on NTA operations. Training will emphasize standard civilian radio phraseology.

Section 3M—AOA Restrictions

3.55. AOA Pattern Requirements. Training will only be accomplished at T-6 joint primary
pilot training bases. (The intent is to have Navy IPs train Navy students on AOA patterns.)
   3.55.1. In addition to assigned Navy IPs, the 71st FTW Squadron CCs will assign, at their
   discretion, Air Force IPs to be qualified in AOA patterns:
   3.55.2. When flying AOA patterns, the following restrictions apply:
      3.55.2.1. AOA patterns will not be flown to AOA landings. Aircrews will fly AOA
      patterns to a normal roundout and flared touchdown.
      3.55.2.2. AOA patterns will not be flown when the tower or RSU is calling ―wind gusts.‖
      3.55.2.3. AOA patterns will be a dual-only maneuver for student pilots.
      3.55.2.4. AOA patterns will not be flown by Air Force students.
   3.55.3. AOA patterns will be flown with the flaps in the TO setting for student pilots.
   EXCEPTION: Qualified IPs will practice all flap settings.
   3.55.4. When flying an AOA pattern, aircrews will add the term ―AOA‖ to their initial,
   closed-downwind and gear-down radio calls to allow other aircraft to adjust their spacing
   accordingly.
 28                                        AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


Section 3N—Operating in High Wind or Sea States

3.56. Restrictions. Units will restrict their flying operations when high winds or sea states
would be hazardous to aircrew members in ejection situations. Local training flights are not
permitted over land when steady state surface winds (forecast or actual) in training or operating
areas exceed 35 knots. Over-water training flights will not be permitted when forecast or actual
wave heights exceed 10 feet or surface winds exceed 25 knots in training or operating areas.

Section 3O—Functional Check Flights (FCF), Operational Check Flights (OCF), and Ferry
Flights

3.57. Restrictions and Requirements:
   3.57.1. FCFs will not be conducted with other types of missions except FCF continuation
   training, FCF upgrade training, or FCF certification flights. All FCF requirements will be
   accomplished by an FCF pilot or an FCF pilot in training status with an FCF IP on board.
   The operations group commander may authorize a T-6 IP to fly with an FCF pilot on board.
   3.57.2. FCFs may recover at home station when originating from AETC auxiliary fields or
   from bases within the local flying area.
   3.57.3. Aircraft within the local flying area requiring an FCF or OCF flight may be flown to
   the home station by an FCF pilot or crew. The operations group commander is the waiver
   authority for this one-time ferry flight.
   3.57.4. Maneuvers not in accordance with TO 1T-6A-6CF-1, Functional Check Flight
   Procedures Manual, will not be flown or practiced on FCF missions. Vision-restricting
   devices will not be used on FCF flights.
   3.57.5. Local FCF pilots or crews are authorized to perform required FCFs on transient
   AETC aircraft if approved by the owning commander. All FCFs on AETC aircraft will be
   flown by AETC FCF pilots or crews. AETC FCF pilots or crews will not normally perform
   FCFs on transient aircraft from other services or commands without specific approval from
   the commander who has operational control over the aircraft.
   3.57.6. OCFs will normally be flown by FCF pilots, but highly experienced non-FCF IPs
   may perform OCF flights with the operations group commander’s approval.
   3.57.7. To avoid entering IMC during an FCF sortie where OCF and/or spin recoveries are
   required, depending on the nature of the FCF, a minimum of 10,000 feet of airspace clear of
   clouds should exist below OCF or spin entry altitude. In addition, minimum weather should
   allow a line of sight to a suitable airfield within engine-out glide range.

Section 3P—Advanced Handling Characteristic (AHC) Program

3.58. Restrictions:
   3.58.1. Only AHC IPs certified according to the training program in AFI 11-2T-6, Volume
   1, T-6 Aircrew Training, will conduct AHC training. Operations group commanders will
   determine the minimum number of AHC IPs necessary to accomplish the mission.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                       29


   3.58.2. To avoid entering IMC during an AHC sortie where OCF recoveries are required, a
   minimum of 10,000 feet of airspace clear of clouds must exist below OCF entry altitude. In
   addition, minimum weather must allow line of sight to a suitable airfield within engine-out
   glide range or the minimum obscuration (few, scattered [sct], broken [bkn]) to be 4,000 feet
   AGL with a minimum of 5 miles visibility.

Section 3Q—Chase Procedures

3.59. Restrictions:
   3.59.1. Any qualified IP may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency conditions (or
   impending emergency conditions). Qualified stan/eval flight examiners may fly chase during
   flight evaluations.
   3.59.2. A chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary to observe performance, but is primarily
   responsible for aircraft separation. Generally, a chase aircraft will maneuver in a 30- or 60-
   degree cone out to 1,000 feet from which the pilot can effectively clear and/or provide
   assistance. The chase aircraft will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL.
   3.59.3. Unless safety or circumstance dictate otherwise, a chase aircraft will low-approach
   no lower than 300 feet AGL.

Yes – Aircraft is acceptable for flight
No – Aircraft is not acceptable for flight
4.2. Factors to Consider for Aircraft Malfunctions. Once airborne, aircraft commanders
must weigh all pertinent factors when deciding whether to continue or to abort a sortie for an
aircraft malfunction. Factors to consider include student mission requirements and weather
conditions at the home base and divert base. Solo students will contact the RSU controller (if in
the pattern) or the SOF (if outside the pattern) for instructions.
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                      31


4.3. Waiver of Restrictions. Operations group commanders may waive the restrictions listed in
Table 4.1 on a flight-by-flight basis if there is no compromise of flight safety or Air Force
directives. This authority may not be delegated below the operations group deputy commander.
4.4. Solo Flying:
   4.4.1. Aircraft may be flown solo with instrument or system malfunctions in the rear cockpit
   that do not affect safety of flight.
   4.4.2. Student pilots will not fly solo in an aircraft with a known malfunction unless
   approved by the squadron supervisor. In addition, the aircraft must be cleared by a
   maintenance supervisor.
   4.4.3. With any sort of engine malfunction indication (engine still running), a solo student
   should fly a precautionary emergency landing.
   4.4.4. If a solo student experiences an engine failure (engine shutdown or not producing
   sufficient power to sustain level flight), serious consideration should be given to ejection.
   The student may attempt a forced landing with the following restriction: minimum runway
   length 4,000 feet.

                               Attachment 7 (Added-12FTW)
                 RANDOLPH T-6 LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

A7.1. (Added-12FTW) Areas: Area boundaries are defined in the IFG and 12FTWI 13-204
(Attachment 10). San Antonio TRACON assigns and controls the South (1B) MOA. Houston
Center assigns and controls the Tweet (2B) MOA and the Talon (2A) MOA.
   A7.1.1. (Added-12FTW) Pilots should primarily use ground references (GPS/VOR
   secondary) to remain in assigned areas. Traffic permitting, TRACON or CENTER may
   continue to provide service if the transponder or NAVAID fails.
   A7.1.2. (Added-12FTW) Use the local altimeter setting or as assigned by ATC in the areas.
   Pilots are responsible for remaining below the top of the areas when the local altimeter
   setting is less than 29.92. Adjust top of area down when altimeter is less than 29.92 (10’ per
   .01‖).
   A7.1.3. (Added-12FTW) If no area is available, SAT TRACON or HOU CENTER will
   direct the aircraft that has been in the area longest to recover.
A7.2. (Added-12FTW) Weather Requirements: Minimum weather requirements for local
operations are in accordance with 11-2T-6 V3, AFI 11-202V3, 12FTWI 13-204 and as defined in
the IFG.
   A7.2.1. (Added-12FTW) The SOF will determine the T-6 flying status and bird-watch
   condition, and work with the Operations Supervisor, SAT TRACON and HOU CENTER
   when weather conditions warrant limitation of available airspace.
   A7.2.2. (Added-12FTW) Aircrews should report any airspace, low level or pattern
   limitations due to weather or bird activity to the SOF or relay through ATC.
   A7.2.3. (Added-12FTW) In the event of a recall, all aircraft will coordinate with ATC for
   recovery and state ―MIN FUEL‖ if at or below planned BINGO fuel to ensure sequencing
   priority. Upon return, aircraft may remain in an open VFR pattern at the discretion of the
   SOF. During instrument status, all aircraft will full-stop.
A7.3. (Added-12FTW) Radio Procedures: Aircrews will use UHF primary to the max extent
possible in the local area (exception: VHF comm. is preferred at Stinson airfield to enhance
civilian traffic situational awareness).
   A7.3.1. Time and traffic permitting, aircraft will monitor CH 2 and announce their position
   with HANGOVER tower NLT 5 NM prior to entry at High Key, TRUCKSTOP, Karnes or
   VFR entry if returning to Randolph VFR (when not on a designated recovery).
   A7.3.2. (12FTW) Pattern radio calls will be made in accordance with 12FTWI 13-204 and
   the 559th Standard Operating Procedures.
A7.4. (Added-12FTW) Pattern Procedures: Adhere to pattern procedures defined in the IFG
and 12FTWI 13-204 (Paragraph 4.2.9 and Attachment 4).
   A7.4.1. (Added-12FTW) Pattern Deconfliction. Pattern rules are designed to allow the
   aircrews to sequence themselves into the flow of traffic for pattern and landing practice.
   Pattern deconfliction is maintained by strict adherence to these rules, aircrew clearing,
   pattern break-outs, and go-arounds when adequate spacing is not ensured. Tower also
52                                        AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  ensures separation by monitoring pilot actions, denying pattern requests (i.e. closed, straight-
  in), and calling out traffic or directing break-outs and go-arounds when traffic separation is
  less than prescribed. However, tower will not typically give sequence number or traffic
  information if the normal pattern rules will ensure separation.
  A7.4.2. (Added-12FTW) Runway Change. When a planned runway change is announced,
  pilots will determine whether to depart, full-stop or remain in the pattern based on fuel/time
  remaining and training requirements.
     A7.4.2.1. (Added-12FTW) Aircraft remaining in the pattern can expect a climb to the
     high pattern (2800’ MSL) at 10 minutes prior to RWY change time. Aircraft will carry
     straight through high initial and turn crosswind at the departure end until cleared to re-
     enter the pattern.
     A7.4.2.2. (Added-12FTW) For ease of sequencing, at 10 minutes prior to RWY change
     time (when cleared by ATC to re-enter), all aircraft will make a descending turn to the
     west at 90-to-initial and re-enter the pattern via the VFR entry point. Continue to carry
     straight through initial in the new pattern direction until the new RWY is ―in use‖.
     A7.4.2.3. (Added-12FTW) If a runway change is required during restricted pattern, all
     aircraft will depart or full-stop.

                   LOCAL T-6 EMERGENCY AIRFIELD SURVEY

A8.1. (Added-12FTW) Aircrews should always consider weather, energy level and experience
level before attempting an ELP at any of these airfields.
A8.2. (12FTW) Northern departure/arrival emergency airfields:
   A8.2.1. (Added-12FTW) Bulverde Airpark.

Table A8.1. Bulverde Airpark.
  Bulverde Airpark (1T8)
  Not Suitable
      A8.2.1.1. (Added-12FTW) Located just to the north of the NVFR point for SR293.
      Runway length is very short (less than 3000’) and makes Bulverde unsuitable.
      A8.2.1.2. (Added-12FTW) Eject in lieu of an attempted emergency landing at
      Bulverde Airpark.
   A8.2.2. (Added-12FTW) Kestrel Airpark.

      A8.2.2.1. (12FTW) Kestrel is located 4 miles north of Bulverde. Runway 12 has a
      severe downslope which will be a major factor in stopping the aircraft within the 3000’
      feet of paved surface. CAUTION: Kestrel is less than 4000’ long.
   A8.2.3. (Added-12FTW) San Geronimo Airpark.

Table A8.3. San Geronimo Airpark.
  San Geronimo Airpark (8T8)      3000’ x 40’     Rwy 17-35        RND 274/27

  Karnes County Airport (2R9)       3218’ x 60’     Rwy 16-34         RND 159/47
  Suitable           Elevation 291’ MSL       No Approaches            Unicom: 123.0
      A8.3.1.1. (Added-12FTW) No overruns. Runway is in good repair. No obstructions
      on approach to either runway. However, there is a creek approx. 200' off the south end of
      the runway. The manager of this public airfield indicated there is often moderate traffic
      in the local area and recommends making a radio call on VHF UNICOM, time
      permitting. CAUTION: Karnes County is less than 4000’ long.
      A8.3.1.2. (Added-12FTW) Seriously consider ejecting if it appears you will land
      long at Karnes County due to runway length and the hazard off the end of the
      runway when landing to the South.
   A8.3.2. (Added-12FTW) Pleasanton Municipal.

Table A8.5. Pleasanton Municipal
  Pleasanton Municipal (PEZ)         4000’ x 75’    Rwy 16-34         RND 207/37
  Suitable            Elevation 429’ MSL       GPS Approach            Unicom: 122.7
      A8.3.2.1. (Added-12FTW) Recently resurfaced. The runway has a displaced threshold
      on Runway 16 approx. 403' down the runway. Pleasanton is located 8 miles from turn-
      point Bravo on SR-287. Routinely used by Navy aircraft. The runway is crowned in the
      center and has a drainage ditch on the east side of the runway in the center between the
      1000' and 2000' point of the runway. There are some trees on both approach ends, but
      they are at least 500' away and pose no hazard.
   A8.3.3. (Added-12FTW) Connally Ranch.

Table A8.6. Connally Ranch.
  Connally Ranch (private) (8TA0)  4050’ X 60’ E   Rwy 11-29            RND 186/23

      A8.3.3.1. (Added-12FTW) No overruns. Runway is in good repair. No major
      obstructions off the end of either runway. No obstructions on approach to either runway.
      Connally is located at the northwest corner of the South MOA and 7 miles west of the
      entry point for SR-287. The owner is a rancher with a home next to the runway.
      Although there are a lot of cattle in the area, they are isolated from the runway with
      strong fencing.
   A8.3.4. (Added-12FTW) Arrow South Ranch.

      A8.3.4.1. (Added-12FTW) No overruns and a large "X" at both ends of the runway, but
      the owner advises that the symbol is there to discourage civilian unauthorized use.
      Arrow South sits 2 miles from the centerline of SR-287 between points B and C ( 7+45
AFI11-2T-6V3_12FTWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                        55


      mins. into the route). In the event of an engine malfunction during SR-287, Arrow would
      be a very viable choice, particularly in light of the runway length. The runway is in very
      good condition and has a fence approx. 100' around the entire airfield. The runway has
      an increasing gradient on Runway 12 that is favorable since that is the prevailing runway.
      There are no hazards or obstructions near the runway, but there is a 475' tower 2 miles to
      the north of the field on the opposite side of I-37 (it is well marked on all charts).
   A8.3.5. (Added-12FTW) Bailey.

Table A8.8. Bailey.
  Bailey (private) (2TS8)
  Not Suitable
      A8.3.5.1. (Added-12FTW) There are numerous large bushes (5'-10') that are growing
      over the edges of the runway surface and both ends of the runway. These bushes have
      trunks up to 8‖ in diameter and branches up to 1" in diameter that would clearly impact
      the wing of the T-6 during the landing. There is also a chain link fence constructed
      across the runway. These hazards make Bailey unsuitable for landing.
      A8.3.5.2. (Added-12FTW) Eject in lieu of an attempted emergency landing at
      Bailey.
   A8.3.6. (Added-12FTW) San Christoval Ranch.
