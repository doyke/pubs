     unit or division in which they were authorized unescorted entry or until unescorted entry is
     withdrawn. When the individual is reassigned, separated, discharged or retired, the unit or

     a receipt indicating the badge was turned in.
     4.5. A physical inventory of all RABs will be accomplished by 31 December each year. In
     order to perform the inventory, Restricted Area Badges should be physically checked with
     matching AF Form 2586’s. Any imbalances of having more or less of AF Forms 2586’s or
     Restricted Area Badges should be documented and reviewed to determine their status and
     resolve the differences. The inventory will be conducted and authenticated by unit or
     division Security Manager. A report will be prepared and forwarded to the 911 SFS Pass and
     ID section no later 31 December each year. A copy of this report will be retained with the
     unit or division Security Manager until completion of the next scheduled inventory.

       INVESTIGATION (ROI) - LOST RESTRICTED AREA BADGE (RAB)

MEMORANDUM FOR 911TH SECURITY FORCES PASS AND ID SECTION
FROM: Major Joseph Smith/TSgt George Jones
SUBJECT: Appointment of Investigating Official and Subsequent Report of Investigation (ROI) -
Lost Restricted Area Badge (RAB)
1. TSgt George Jones has been appointed to investigate and complete a ROI regarding a RAB
reported lost.
2. Brooks, Daniel T., SSgt/ 123-45-6789 has reported the loss of his AF Form 1199A, USAF
Restricted Area Badge, Card S123456, Badge 3456. {Give a brief narrative regarding the
approximate date, place, and circumstances surrounding the loss}
3. The bearer has searched extensively for his RAB and met with negative results. If the
Restricted Area Badge is located at a later date, it will be returned to 911 SFS Pass and ID section.
The bearer is aware the RAB is the property of the U. S. government. Its counterfeiting, alteration
or misuse is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 499, 506, and 701, and will make offender liable to a heavy
penalty.
4. It has been determined by the named investigating official that the loss of this badge does not
compromise the wing security program and does not indicate an abuse by the bearer of the RAB
system.
5. Daniel T. Brooks does require unescorted entry privileges to the restricted area based on his
job/mission requirements. I do request a new Restricted Area Badge be reissued.
