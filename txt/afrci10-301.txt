possess a current valid state driver’s license in order to drive a GSA and/or military vehicle IAW
AFI 24-301. If a recruiter’s license is suspended or revoked, notify appropriate HQ RM in
writing (indicate offense, date suspended and/or revoked and length of time of suspension or
revocation). The VCO should spot check for current valid state driver’s license. During staff
assistance visits, all licenses will be checked.
2.8. GSA Vehicle Authorized Use. GSA vehicles assigned to AFRC/RS are for personnel
(including civil service employees) assigned to Functional Account Code (FAC) 1690
performing recruiting duties. Personnel on AFRC/RS mandays are also authorized to use GSA
vehicles. In addition, personnel supporting the recruiting mission are authorized to ride in GSA
vehicles (example: a reservist who volunteers to help a recruiter at a high school, air show, etc.,
is authorized transportation to and from that location in the GSA vehicle). GSA vehicles are not
loaned to personnel outside of recruiting unless approved, in writing, by the Commander,
Recruiting Service (RS/CC), or the RSX Division Chief.
2.9. GSA Vehicles for Domicile-to-Duty/Fieldwork. Annual MAJCOM approval from the
SECAF is required prior to any Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) being used for Domicile-to-
duty/Fieldwork. Once the MAJCOM has an approved letter, then SQ CC’s may occasionally
authorize recruiters to use a GSA vehicle to proceed directly from their domicile to conduct
official recruiting matters. All of the following conditions should be considered in order to
justify a request for Domicile-to-duty/Fieldwork vehicle use:
   2.9.1. The mission, not personal convenience, requires the member to go directly to the field
   location before first reporting to the regular duty station.
   2.9.2. The individual normally commutes to a fixed location, however far from his or her
   official duty station.
   2.9.3. When it would be more advantageous to the government to provide the member a
   vehicle for home-to-work transportation rather than have the member travel a long distance
   to pick up a vehicle and drive back toward or beyond his/her residence to perform his/her
   job.
   2.9.4. The member has after-duty appointments and late return of the vehicle to the office
   creates a safety risk.
   2.9.5. If time and/or distance can be saved and substantiated on AFRS Form 1400,
   Domicile-to-Duty Transportation Record.
AFRCI10-301 13 JUNE 2014                                                                          11


   2.9.6. All instances of Domicile-to-Duty/Fieldwork transportation will be documented on
   AFRS Form 1400. AFRC/RSXX delegates approval authority to the requestor’s supervisor
   for domicile-to-duty or duty-to-domicile requests. Before approval the supervisor will ensure
   the conditions in paragraphs 2.9.1 through 2.9.5 are met and he or she will document the
   approval on AFRS Form 1400.
   2.9.7. The full-time use or blanket approval of domicile-to-duty transportation is not
   authorized.
   2.9.8. Approved domicile-to-duty transportation must be entered on AFRS Form 1400.
   Detailed justification citing the specific purpose is required. After-the-fact approval is not
   authorized.
   2.9.9. The FC will sign the AFRS Form 1400 at the end of each month, certify the accuracy
   of the entries, the essential mission of the domicile-to-duty requirements and forward the
   original copy to the SQ RM for review.
   2.9.10. The SQ RM will review the information on the form to ensure all domicile-to-duty
   transportation was essential and properly documented. The SQ RM should advise the SQ
   Commander of suspected misuse or abuse and recommend corrective action.
   2.9.11. The SQ/CC will review and sign all AFRS Forms 1400.
   2.9.12. Completed AFRS Forms 1400 will be filed by SQ RM for three years. The FC
   retains a copy of the AFRS Form 1400 for three years for inspection/validation purposes. For
   further instructions, reference AFRIMS RDS.
2.10. Turn-In or Exchanging a GSA Vehicle. GSA vehicles are turned in based on years
and/or mileage. The appropriate GSA FMC will notify VCOs regarding exchange (except if prior
approval for an upgraded vehicle has been reviewed by AFRC/RSXX). The exchange must be of
equal or lower value (example: do not exchange a sedan for a van, etc. A request for a four wheel
drive, SUV, or pick-up truck must be justified prior to making the request). Justifications for the
request are as follows; a recruiting area that is continually experiencing hazardous weather
conditions (i.e. snow, flooding, etc.), a recruiting zone that the majority of travel is conducted in
off-road areas, or an area that the DOT has directed specific vehicle requirements for travel. All
upgrades must be approved by the AFRC/RSXX. The FC must submit letter to appropriate SQ
RM with justification for upgrade. The SQ RM will verify justification and forward to the
SQ/CC for approval. After being routed to SQ/CC, requests will be sent to the Lead VCO to
verify and finally AFRC/RSXX for final approval authority.
   2.10.1. Vehicle upgrade requests for all four wheel drive vehicles, SUV’s and pick-up trucks
   must include:
       2.10.1.1. Staff Summary coordination sheet

 12                                                               AFRCI10-301 13 JUNE 2014


           2.10.1.2.4. Significant impact on mission/lost man hours if not provided.
2.11. Vehicle Transfers. Temporary and permanent transfers of vehicles between fleet
management centers must have the approval of appropriate GSA fleet managers. The FC must
request a vehicle transfer in writing to the SQ RM. The SQ RM will determine appropriate
measures for the requested transfer through the appropriate GSA Fleet Service Representative.
When transfers have been approved and the parking location, operating location, or assigned
operator has SQ changed, the SQ RM will keep record of change on file and inform/forward to
HQ VCO.
2.12. GSA Vehicle Misuse. Misuse is defined as any unauthorized vehicle use. For example,
driving the vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, smoking in the vehicle, or

                           CENTER OF INFLUENCE PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The purpose of Center of Influence (COI) events is to generate leads and gain
support of civilian influencers by informing them of Air Force Reserve opportunities. The COI
program is not a protocol-funded program to reward people for past support. It is a planned event
where meals or snacks appropriate for the occasion are served to provide a setting for Air Force
Reserve personnel to talk to prospective applicants and influencers. The processes and guidance
provided in this chapter are to be used in conjunction with AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-
Wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program; Title 37 U.S.C. § 488, DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics
Regulation. EXCEPTION: At HP residency events, there may not be time for a complete
presentation due to time constraints of the residents. The purpose of this type event is to obtain
leads. Although a COI is conducted in a social environment, its purpose is recruiting business.
NOTE: The word recruiter will be interchangeable with requester in this chapter.
6.2. Squadrons Responsibilities The SQ/CC will appoint in writing one individual as a COI
event program manager and one individual to pay for COI events, IAW AFI 64-117.

   documents received from the recruiter after the event.
   6.4.4. Maintain a log of each event to ensure cost does not exceed the amount on the AF
   Form 4009.
   6.4.5. Request the AF Form 4009 to be increased if needed.
6.5. Flight Chief Responsibilities. The FC is responsible for completing and submitting the
AFRC Form 21 to the appointed SQ COI PM for approval of funds to conduct a COI. The FC
will:
   6.5.1. Ensure the set-up is initiated for the COI event with a local vendor.
       6.5.1.1. Ensure vendor accepts the GPC for payment. A Government Purchase Check is
       used ONLY if the vendor does not accept the GPC card.

       charge tax.
       6.5.1.3. Ensure vendor will not exceed the gratuity of 15%. A waiver may be submitted
       up to 20%.

   6.5.2. Prepare and forward the AFRC Form 21 a minimum of two weeks before the COI
   event is to be held so the SQ PM can assign an event number to each COI.
   6.5.3. Ensure COI does not exceed the approved amount on the AFRC Form 21.
   6.5.4. Ensure the COI program manager is notified within 24 hours if the COI event has
   been cancelled.
   6.5.5. Ensure COI PM receives an original receipt, itemized bill and a copy of the approved
   AFRC Form 21 (signed) within seven days from the completion of the COI event. All
   original receipts and signed AFRC Form 21 will be mailed or sent via the contracted
   shipping vendor to the SQ RM.
   6.5.6. Ensure a copy of the COI event receipt, AFRC Form 21 is kept on file at the flight for
   the current FY.
6.6. Authorized COI Attendees. Attendees should consist of qualified influencers and
prospective applicants for a bona fide recruiting program and recruiters. Other attendees may
include other military members, spouses, family members and the following:
   6.6.1. Prospective Applicant. A prospective applicant is a person who is tentatively qualified
   for a recruiting program being worked by the recruiter. EXCEPTIONS: This prospective
   applicant must not have been listed as a prospective applicant at a previous COI event.
   Additionally, this prospective applicant must not currently hold military status (active or
   ready reserve to include members currently in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)).
   Individual Ready Reserve is part of the Ready Reserve and is not authorized for COIs.
   Further guidance use Reference, Title 37, and U.S.C. 428.
       6.6.1.1. High school seniors and other Non-Prior Service (NPS) applicants. Do not invite

       or reserve).
       6.6.1.3. A prospective applicant who attended another event for a different program. For
       example, a HP applicant who did not qualify for commissioning and decides to enlist as a
       NPS applicant then later attends a COI event as a NPS applicant may be listed as a
       prospective applicant for that program.
   6.6.2. Influencers are persons who, by their position, have strong and obvious influence on
   prospective applicants. These are normally educators, parents, or guardians of prospective
   applicants, civic leaders, business persons and radio and television representatives. NOTE:
   A prospective applicant who enters the Air Force Reserve and later attends a second COI is
   listed as an influencer.
6.7. Funding Per Attendee at COI Events. The AFRC/RS receives authority to incur
expenses supporting recruiting objectives. Funds are available for events involving groups and
individuals.
   6.7.1. Refreshments at Recruiting Functions. Appropriated funds may be used for small

6.8. One-On-One Events. A one-on-one event is an arranged meeting with one applicant and
the recruiter. It may also include the applicant's and the recruiter's spouse or significant other.
   6.8.1. Normally, only a single one-on-one event is authorized per authorized applicant. A
   SQ/CC may approve additional one-on-one events as needed for physician or other critical
   officer prospective applicants to overcome objections or resolve other issues delaying the
   recruiting process.
   6.8.2. Only the military member and/or participating spouse/significant other may attend an
   event at Air Force Reserve expense. Other family members may attend only if he or she is an
   age-qualified prospective applicant or a bona fide influencer.
   6.8.3. A one-on-one COI event is restricted to the following categories of individuals:
       6.8.3.1. Critical officer specialty prospective applicants, (Medical and Dental Corp,
       Doctors and Oral Surgeons). HQ AFRC or higher authority identifies these specialties at
       the beginning of the fiscal year, makes changes as required and sends updates through
       distribution.     NOTE: With SQ CC approval, another military member may help with
       the sales presentation; for example, an Air Force Reserve physician or nurse or someone
       whose profession or background is related to the prospective applicant's and would
       further enhance the sale.
       6.8.3.2. Radio and television station owners, outdoor company owners, managers, public
       service directors, program directors, or other persons in media decision-making positions.
       6.8.3.3. Civic leaders, business persons and educators with FC’s approval.
6.9. Ratio of Military-to-Civilian Attendees. Refers to the number of military-to-civilian
persons attending a COI event. The ratio will not exceed one military to three civilians unless

count as military representatives in the one-to-three ratio.
   6.9.1. Ratio waivers. In special circumstances, the SQ/CC, may authorize a ratio of one
   military to two civilians.
   6.9.2. This waiver must be approved in advance and annotated on AFRC Form 21.
6.10. Participation in a COI by a Military Person. Military personnel required to participate
in a COI function are furnished the COI meal at no cost as long as they meet the military-to-
civilian ratio requirement. If personnel in TDY status are furnished the COI meal at no cost, they
must declare the meal on their travel claim as a government-deductible meal. The COI host will
brief TDY personnel of this requirement. For further guidance refer to DODD 5500.7-R.
6.11. Short-notice (other than residency events). COI funds may be expended to support
events that occur on short notice. An event is considered short-notice when it is scheduled within
seven days from the date of the event. EXCEPTION: One-on-one COI events are usually
scheduled within the seven day requirement and are exempt from short-notice status.
 34                                                                  AFRCI10-301 13 JUNE 2014


   6.11.1. A pre-approved AFRC Form 21 for a one-on-one event with a critical officer
   specialty may be issued to OA/HP Recruiters. The AFRC Form 21 has an assigned event
   number and is monitored by the COI PM.
6.12. Signing in at COI Events. An organized guest sign-in procedure must be followed at
COI events using AFRC Form 118, COI Guest List - Prospective Applicant, for prospective
applicants and AFRC Form 119, COI Guest List –Influencer, for influencers and all other
attendees. Provisions of the Privacy Act apply only in lead-generating prospective applicant
events. After the event and after leads have been distributed, the AFRC Form 118 and AFRC
Form 119 are attached to the flights office file copy of the AFRC Form 21, along with a copy of
the GPC card receipt and any other supporting documents.
6.13. No-Shows at COI Events. A no-show refers to individuals invited to COI events that
accepted the invitation but did not attend and the recruiter did not know in advance to adjust the
number. Recruiters negotiate COI events with vendors, agreeing not to charge for no-shows. If a
vendor does not agree to this and the recruiter believes it is still the best available offer, proceed
with the offer. If the number of no-shows paid exceeds 10 percent of the expected or guaranteed
attendance, explain in a separate memo to accompany the AFRC Form 21 and detailed receipt.
   6.13.1. Buffet and bulk purchase type events, such as HP residency events, have a floating
   unit cost up to the maximum unit cost. If the number of attendees minus the number of no-
   shows divided into the total cost of the event causes the unit cost to rise above the maximum
   authorized, explain fully in a separate memo (to the COI Program Manager) to accompany
   the receipt and AFRC Form 21.
6.14. Unauthorized Expenditures. Do not use COI funds for any of the following
expenditures:
   6.14.1. Taxes

   10.4.1. Special medical tests are required that cannot be provided by the government
   medical facility, or a substantial delay (30-45 days) in scheduling or processing will result.
   10.4.2. Repeated tests are required and it is inconvenient for the applicant to return to the
   government medical facility.
   10.4.3. Cost does not exceed $500. The SQ/CCs are the approving authority for costs
   exceeding this amount.
10.5. Procedures for Contract Physical Examinations and Special Medical Tests. The
OA/HP Recruiters will submit a letter to their FC requesting payment for contract physical
examinations and special medical tests. The letter will include:
   10.5.1. Name, Social Security Number (SSN), and mailing address of applicant (ensure
   information is protected according to the Privacy Act of 1974).

   10.5.2. Unit to which the applicant will be assigned or attached.
   10.5.3. Circumstances preventing the physical examination or special medical tests from
   being conducted in a government medical facility.
   10.5.4. The OA/HP FC sends a letter with the name of the authorized provider or medical
   facility to the applicant with information copy to the recruiter. This letter authorizes the
   facility to conduct the required physical examination or special medical tests and bill the Air
   Force Reserve for reimbursement. In addition, the letter requests the facility to include their
   identification number if it is not on the bill.
10.6. Payment for Contract Physical and Special Medical Examinations. There are three
payment methods used for these examinations. Each method requires a copy of the bill, letter
requesting the examination and any other supporting documents be kept on file:
   10.6.1. GPC may be used to pay for these examinations (do not exceed the SPL of $3,000).
   10.6.2. Government Purchase Check is issued only if the GPC is not accepted. The check
   must be made out to the vendor not the applicant or recruiter.
   10.6.3. Complete SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than
   Personal, certifying services rendered. The completed SF 1034 with identification number is
   forwarded to the local finance office for payment.
