SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
revision addresses additional applicable regulations (29 CFR 1910.1001; 29 CFR 1926.1101; 40
CFR Part 763, subpart E, 15 USC 2641-2656; and 40 CFR Part 61, subpart M) and updates
asbestos management program requirements, repair and abatement procedures.

Section A—Overview

1. Background. Asbestos is regulated by 15 USC 2601-2697, Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA); 42 USC 7401-7671q, Clean Air Act (CAA); and regulations issued pursuant to 29 USC
651-678. This instruction focuses on each base’s development and implementation of asbestos
management programs to reduce possible exposure to airborne asbestos fibers and satisfy
regulatory requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1001; 29 CFR 1926.1101; 40 CFR Part 763, subpart E;
15 USC 2641-2656; and 40 CFR Part 61, subpart M. Past and current records addressed in this
instruction must be maintained indefinitely, Ref Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139 Records
Disposition Schedule, Table 32-07, Rule 10.01. For more details on referenced regulations and
specific Air Force environmental program requirements, please contact the Environmental
Center of Excellence (AFCEC/CZ) and the Air Force Legal Operations Agency, Environmental
Law and Litigation Division's Environmental Law Field Support Center (AFLOA/JACE-FSC).

Section B—Responsibilities

2. Air Force Civil Engineer Center - Operations Directorate, Engineer Division
(AFCEC/COS):
     2.1. Develops requirements and provides guidance necessary for base facility asbestos
     management programs.
     2.2. Provides operational technical support to Environmental Center of Excellence
     (AFCEC/CZ) or MAJCOM Environmental Program Manager (for those areas that retained
     that function such as ANG and AFRC) overseeing facility asbestos management programs.
3. Environmental Center of Excellence (AFCEC/CZ) or MAJCOM Environmental
Program Manager (for those areas that retained that function such as ANG and AFRC):
     3.1. Provide oversight and environmental support to ensure facility asbestos management is
     effective at each base.
4. Base Civil Engineer (BCE):
     4.1. Develops a base asbestos management plan (paragraph 7.1) and maintains an inventory
     of all facilities with known asbestos-containing materials (ACM) and ensure real property
     records are properly annotated. ACM is any material containing more than one (1) percent
     asbestos
AFI32-1052 4 JANUARY 2013                                                                     3


   4.2. Develops and implements a comprehensive written asbestos operating plan (paragraph
   6.2).
   4.3. Examines ACM in base facilities ( any ACM that is non-friable or intact and any ACM
   that is friable or not intact), and decides whether repair, maintenance, or removal of the
   material is necessary. The BCE also determines whether extraordinary precautions are
   necessary to protect personnel until recommended actions are completed (e.g., frequent
   monitoring, removal of personnel from the area, temporary controls, or other protective
   measures). To accomplish these actions, the BCE will work together with base
   Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE).
   4.4. Decides whether asbestos-related work will be accomplished with in-service resources
   or by contract.
5. Base Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE):
   5.1. Works directly with the BCE to determine if recommended actions are necessary (e.g.,
   frequent monitoring, removal of personnel from the area, temporary controls, or other
   protective measures) in order to protect human health.
   5.2. With the BCE, conducts direct evaluation of facilities containing ACM, which cannot be
   reliably maintained, repaired, or isolated and that is likely to become friable or not remain
   intact. Provides advice to the installation commander regarding health issues associated with
   "Must remove" mandates.
   5.3. Where there is no mandate to remove asbestos, BE will provide advice to the BCE
   regarding the health risk to facility occupants.

Section C—Program Requirements

6. Applicable Regulations. 29 CFR 1910.1001; 29 CFR 1926.1101; 40 CFR Part 763,
subpart E; 15 USC 2641-2656; and 40 CFR Part 61, subpart M, prescribe requirements for
identifying ACM, notifying building occupants of potential asbestos-related hazards, and
acquiring specialized asbestos-related training. In addition, they provide specific guidance for
asbestos identification, labeling, control, and abatement in schools, government, public, and
commercial buildings. Planned asbestos abatement efforts must comply with these and other
applicable federal, state, and local regulations prior to commencing work. Current and past
records created pursuant to this instruction must be maintained indefinitely.
   6.1. Asbestos Abatement. All damaged ACM, either friable or not intact, is presumed
   hazardous due to its potential to release asbestos fibers into the air. Damaged ACM must be
   repaired or removed to eliminate this potential hazard. Bases will abate hazardous ACM
   through inventory management, isolation, containment, and removal.
   6.2. Asbestos Removal.
       6.2.1. Bases must remove ACM which cannot be reliably maintained, repaired, or
       isolated and that is likely to become friable or not remain intact. "Must remove"
       mandates will be issued by the installation commander with advice from BE and the
       BCE, based on their direct evaluation of the material and the facility. If asbestos is
       present at any detectable level (determined by bulk sampling in accordance with 40 CFR
 4                                                                AFI32-1052 4 JANUARY 2013


        Part 763, paragraphs 763.85-87) and is disturbed during maintenance, repair, or removal
        actions, then regulatory requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.1101apply.
        6.2.2. Where there is no mandate to remove asbestos, the BCE will consult with BE to
        determine health risk to facility occupants and will evaluate the material’s condition, use
        of the facility, the feasibility or frequency of repair, and cost-effectiveness when deciding
        whether to remove or repair non-friable, intact ACM.
        6.2.3. When safety and budgetary considerations permit (e.g., if asbestos is non-friable
        and intact, encased, appropriately treated, or cost of asbestos removal is less than 10% of
        project cost), include complete removal of ACM when planning operations, maintenance,
        and military construction program facility projects.
        6.2.4. Remove existing ACM at opportune times during minor construction or repairs
        (e.g., if wall sections are opened and ACM is exposed, or carpeting is replaced over vinyl
        asbestos flooring).
     6.3. Facility Management. To ensure ACM does not become airborne, the BCE will
     closely monitor facilities in accordance with paragraphs 5.3.1 through 5.3.3.
        6.3.1. Conduct asbestos surveys to identify all installed ACM. 29 CFR 1910.1001
        requires installed Thermal System Insulation (TSI) and sprayed-on and toweled-on
        surfacing materials be classified as Presumed ACM (PACM) in buildings constructed no
        later than 1980. Asphalt and vinyl flooring material installed no later than 1980 also
        must be treated as asbestos-containing. To verify whether PACM and flooring material
        contains asbestos, complete an asbestos survey in accordance with 40 CFR Part 763,
        subpart E (sampling methods are specified in paragraphs 763.85-87). One commercially-
        available non-regulatory survey method is ASTM E2356-10, Standard Practice for
        Comprehensive Building Asbestos Surveys.
        6.3.2. Determine if visibly-damaged TSI, existing spray- or toweled-applied surfacing or
        fireproofing, or miscellaneous ACM is in immediate danger of becoming friable or non-
        intact, and releasing airborne asbestos fibers; ensure such material is quickly repaired by
        personnel trained in accordance with 40 CFR Part 763, subpart E, Appendix C.
        6.3.3. Routinely inspect identified ACM and PACM to verify that the material’s
        condition has not changed. Approved methods are specified in 40 CFR Part 763,
        paragraphs 763.85-87.

Section D—Program Management

7. Purpose and Scope. Each installation with maintenance responsibility must have a written
management plan and operating plan to carry out the objectives of facility asbestos management.
These plans serve two purposes: to detail how tasks are done; and to document the installation’s
commitment to protect the health of personnel. They may be combined into one document if
each section clearly delineates associated requirements. Current and past records created
pursuant to this instruction must be maintained indefinitely.
     7.1. Asbestos Management Plan. The objective of the asbestos management plan is to
     maintain a permanent record of the current status and condition of all ACM in an
     installation’s facility inventory. The management plan provides the documentation for all
AFI32-1052 4 JANUARY 2013                                                                     5


  asbestos management efforts, and procedures for overseeing the entire facility asbestos
  management program, including procedures to ensure bases comply with applicable
  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency
  (EPA), and state and local regulations.
  7.2. Asbestos Operating Plan. The asbestos operating plan dictates how the base will carry
  out asbestos-related projects. The plan will assign responsibilities; establish inspection and
  repair capabilities; and provide repair procedures and personnel protection instructions. The
  plan will refer to and explain applicable OSHA and EPA rules, AFPD 32-70, and AFI 91202,
  The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program (formerly AFI 91301), with provisions for
  enforcement. The operating plan addresses:
     7.2.1. Organizational structure for carrying out asbestos-related work.
     7.2.2. Project coordination and communication necessary for construction and
     renovation work involving facilities containing asbestos.
     7.2.3. Personnel training programs.
     7.2.4. Equipment and supply requirements.
     7.2.5. Identification of worker manuals or other written procedures.
     7.2.6. Yearly budget estimates.
     7.2.7. Procedures for interim control measures and extraordinary precautions.
     7.2.8. Procedures for asbestos certification and asbestos disposition statements on
     programming documents.
     7.2.9. Requirements for a special response team and in-house inspection.
     7.2.10. Requirements for contractor asbestos analysis and abatement.
